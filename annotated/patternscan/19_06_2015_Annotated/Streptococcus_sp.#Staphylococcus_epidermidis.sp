TI  == destruction-free procedure for the isolation of bacteria from sputum samples for  raman spectroscopic analysis.
AB  == lower respiratory tract infections are the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. here, a timely identification of the causing pathogens is crucial to the success of the treatment. raman spectroscopy allows for quick identification  of bacterial cells without the need for time-consuming cultivation steps, which is the current gold standard to detect pathogens. however, before raman spectroscopy can be used to identify pathogens, they have to be isolated from the sample matrix, i.e., sputum in case of lower respiratory tract infections. in this study, we report an isolation protocol for single bacterial cells from sputum samples for raman spectroscopic identification. prior to the isolation, a  liquefaction step using the proteolytic enzyme mixture pronase e is required in order to deal with the high viscosity of sputum. the extraction of the bacteria was subsequently performed via different filtration and centrifugation steps, whereby isolation ratios between 46 and 57 % were achieved for sputa spiked with  6.107 to 6.104 cfu/ml of staphylococcus aureus. the compatibility of such a liquefaction and isolation procedure towards a raman spectroscopic classification was shown for five different model species, namely s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. a classification of single-cell raman spectra of these five species with an accuracy of 98.5 % could be achieved on the basis of a principal component analysis (pca) followed by a linear discriminant analysis (lda). these  classification results could be validated with an independent test dataset, where 97.4 % of all spectra were identified correctly. graphical abstract development of an isolation protocol of bacterial cells out of sputum samples followed by raman spectroscopic measurement and species identification using chemometrical models.

TI  == influence of the magnetic field on microorganisms in the oral cavity.
AB  == since the beginning of their lives, all living organisms are exposed to the influence of geomagnetic fields. objectives: with respect to the positive effects that magnetic fields have on human tissues, especially the bactericidal effect, this investigation aimed to assess their influence on the reduction of oral microorganisms. material and methods: in order to obtain adequate specimens of dental plaque deposit, microbes such as streptococcus parasanguinis, staphylococcus epidermidis, rhodococcus equi and candida albicans were isolated from the human mouth. to establish the intensity of microbial growth on the basis of the modified optical density (od) of agar turbidimetry assay, microbial count  and spectrophotometry were applied. the study was carried out with two microbial  concentrations (1 and 10 cfu/ml) after periods of incubation of 24 and 48 h and using micromagnets. results: a positive effect of the magnetic field, resulting in the reduction of dental plaque microbes in vitro, was found. in the first 24 hours of exposure to the magnetic field, the number of all isolated microbes was  significantly reduced. the most potent influence of magnets and the most intensified reduction after 24 hours were evident in candida albicans colonies. the decrease in the influence of magnets on microbes in vitro was also detected.  conclusions: magnets reduce the number of microbes and might be recommended as a  supplement in therapy for reduced periodontal tissues. this is important because  periodontal tissues that are in good conditions provide prolonged support to the  oral tissues under partial and supradental denture.

TI  == metagenomic analysis of milk of healthy and mastitis-suffering women.
AB  == background: some studies have been conducted to assess the composition of the bacterial communities inhabiting human milk, but they did not evaluate the presence of other microorganisms, such as fungi, archaea, protozoa, or viruses. objective: this study aimed to compare the metagenome of human milk samples provided by healthy and mastitis-suffering women. methods: dna was isolated from  human milk samples collected from 10 healthy women and 10 women with symptoms of  lactational mastitis. shotgun libraries from total extracted dna were constructed and the libraries were sequenced by 454 pyrosequencing. results: the amount of human dna sequences was >/= 90% in all the samples. among the bacterial sequences, the predominant phyla were proteobacteria, firmicutes, and bacteroidetes. the healthy core microbiome included the genera staphylococcus, streptococcus, bacteroides, faecalibacterium, ruminococcus, lactobacillus, and propionibacterium. at the species level, a high degree of inter-individual variability was observed among healthy women. in contrast, staphylococcus aureus  clearly dominated the microbiome in the samples from the women with acute mastitis whereas high increases in staphylococcus epidermidis-related reads were  observed in the milk of those suffering from subacute mastitis. fungal and protozoa-related reads were identified in most of the samples, whereas archaea reads were absent in samples from women with mastitis. some viral-related sequence reads were also detected. conclusion: human milk contains a complex microbial metagenome constituted by the genomes of bacteria, archaea, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. in mastitis cases, the milk microbiome reflects a loss of bacterial diversity and a high increase of the sequences related to the presumptive etiological agents.

TI  == development of gendine coated cannula for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for extended use.
AB  == continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (csii) using pumps is a widely used method for insulin therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus. one of the major factors that usually lead to the discontinuation of csii is csii set related issues including infection at the infusion site. current american diabetic association recommends rotating sites every 2-3 days. this adds cost and creates  inconvenience. therefore, in order to prevent infections and extend durations between insertion site changes, we have developed a teflon cannula coated with the combination of gentian violet and chlorhexidine (gendine) and tested its antimicrobial efficacy against different pathogens. cannulas were coated with gendine on exterior surface and dried. efficacy and durability of gendine cannulas was determined against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin- susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and candida glabrata using biofilm colonization method. cytotoxicity of gendine was assessed against mouse fibroblast cell lines. gendine cannulas showed complete prevention of biofilm colonization of all organisms tested up to 2 weeks (p < 0.0001) compared to uncoated control. gendine catheter against mouse fibroblast cells shown to be non-cytotoxic. our in vitro results show that a novel gendine cannula is highly effective in completely inhibiting biofilm of multi-drug resistant pathogens for  up to 2 weeks and may have potential clinical applications such as prolonged use, cost reduction and decreased infection rate.

TI  == colostrum of healthy slovenian mothers: microbiota composition and bacteriocin gene prevalence.
AB  == microbial communities inhabiting the breast milk microenvironment are essential in supporting mammary gland health in lactating women and in providing gut-colonizing bacterial 'inoculum' for their infants' gastro-intestinal development. bacterial dna was extracted from colostrum samples of 45 healthy slovenian mothers. characteristics of the communities in the samples were assessed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) coupled with denaturing gradient gel  electrophoresis (dgge) and by quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr). pcr screening for the prevalence of bacteriocin genes was performed on dna of culturable and total colostrum bacteria. dgge profiling revealed the presence of staphylococcus  and gemella in most of the samples and exposed 4 clusters based on the abundance  of 3 bands: staphylococcus epidermidis/gemella, streptococcus oralis/pneumonia and streptococcus salivarius. bacilli represented the largest proportion of the communities. high prevalence in samples at relatively low quantities was confirmed by qpcr for enterobacteria (100%), clostridia (95.6%), bacteroides-prevotella group (62.2%) and bifidobacteria (53.3%). bacterial quantities (genome equivalents ml-1) varied greatly among the samples; staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococci varied in the range of 4 logs, streptococci and all bacteria varied in the range of 2 logs, and other researched groups varied in the range of 1 log. the quantity of most bacterial groups was correlated with the amount of all bacteria. the majority of the genus staphylococcus was represented by the species staphylococcus epidermidis (on average 61%), and their abundances were linearly correlated. determinants of salivaricin a, salivaricin b, streptin and cytolysin were found in single samples. this work provides knowledge on the colostrum microbial community composition of healthy lactating slovenian mothers and reports bacteriocin gene prevalence.

TI  == characterisation of clinical meticillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis demonstrating high levels of linezolid resistance (>256 mug/ml) resulting from transmissible and mutational mechanisms.
AB  == staphylococcus epidermidis (s. epidermidis), one of the leading etiological agents of nosocomial infections poses a significant economic burden globally. introduced in 2000, linezolid (lzd) has become an important antibiotic, used in nearly seventy countries worldwide to treat infections caused by gram-positive pathogens such as meticillin-resistant staphylococcus and streptococcus species along with vancomycin-resistant enterococci. resistance to lzd in clinical settings remains rare. here, we report the emergence of meticillin resistant s. epidermidis (mrse) clinical isolates from two voluntary general acute hospitals exhibiting higher than typically reported levels of lzd resistance (mic>256 mug/ml). the mrse st-2 clone isolated from eight patients (2010-2011) not only possessed resistance-conferring mutations such as g2576t in domain v of 23s rrna  gene (as determined by hrm-pcr analysis) and r172c substitution in the ribosomal  protein l3, but also carried the cfr gene (the only known transmissible mechanism of lzd resistance). all isolates possessed several key biofilm-associated genes (such as icaa, icad, aap and atle) and resistance to multiple clinically significant antibiotics was recorded. this study reports the earliest incidence (2010) of clinical mrse in the republic of ireland demonstrating multiple lzd resistance mechanisms both mutational and potentially transmissible, and characterises this emerging resistance from a molecular perspective.

TI  == phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility and occurrence of selected resistance genes in gram-positive mastitis pathogens isolated from wisconsin dairy cows.
AB  == in the united states, few intramammary antimicrobials exist that are approved for treatment of bovine mastitis; thus, ensuring judicious use of these products is a priority. the objectives of this study were to determine phenotypic susceptibility and presence of selected antimicrobial resistance genes from staphylococci, streptococci, and streptococcal-like organisms recovered from cases of clinical mastitis occurring in cows on large wisconsin farms. staphylococcus aureus (n = 35 from 19 herds), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 51 from 30 herds), streptococcus spp. (n = 78 from 36 herds), and streptococcal-like organisms (n = 31 from 19 herds) were used in this study. all  staphylococcus spp. were susceptible to ceftiofur, cephalothin, and the combination of penicillin and novobiocin. of all staphylococci, only a single staphylococcus epidermidis exhibited phenotypic resistance to oxacillin. phenotypic susceptibility to erythromycin was observed in only 8.6 and 15.7% of staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, respectively. approximately 20% of staphylococci and 13 to 22% of streptococci and streptococcal-like organisms exhibited phenotypic resistance to pirlimycin. all streptococcus spp. exhibited phenotypic susceptibility to ceftiofur, cephalothin, and oxacillin. the proportion of isolates exhibiting phenotypic susceptibility to pirlimycin and sulfadimethoxine differed among streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus uberis. all streptococcal-like organisms exhibited phenotypic susceptibility to ceftiofur, cephalothin, oxacillin, penicillin, and the combination of penicillin and novobiocin. of all organisms tested, 36.9% did not  carry any of the resistance genes (ermc, blaz, tetk, or tetm), 35.4% carried 1 gene, and 27.7% carried multiple genes (usually blaz in combination with a tet gene). eighteen (51.4%) staph. aureus and 12 (48.0%) staphylococcus chromogenes carried multiple resistance genes. six (12.2%) strep. dysgalactiae and no strep.  uberis carried multiple resistance genes. results indicate that most gram-positive mastitis organisms were susceptible to most antimicrobials used for intramammary administration, but some resistance to drugs used for systemic treatment of mastitis was noted. the presence of selected resistance genes was not proportional to the occurrence of phenotypic resistance.

TI  == antibacterial assay-guided isolation of active compounds from artocarpus heterophyllus heartwoods.
AB  == context: preparations from artocarpus heterophyllus lam. (moraceae) heartwoods are used in the traditional folk medicine for the treatment of inflammation, malarial fever, and to prevent bacterial and fungal infections. objective: the objective of this study was to isolate pure antibacterial compounds from a. heterophyllus heartwoods. materials and methods: the dried and powdered a. heterophyllus heartwoods were successively extracted with the following solvents: hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol. each of the extracts was screened for their  antibacterial activities using a disc diffusion method (10 mg/disc). their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations  (mbcs) were determined using a broth microdilution method. the extract that showed the strongest antibacterial activities was fractionated to isolate the active compounds by an antibacterial assay-guided isolation process. results and  discussion: the ethyl acetate extract exhibited the strongest antibacterial activities against streptococcus mutans, s. pyogenes, and bacillus subtilis with  mic values of 78, 39, and 9.8 microg/ml, respectively. based on an antibacterial  assay-guided isolation, four antibacterial compounds: cycloartocarpin (1), artocarpin (2), artocarpanone (3), and cyanomaclurin (4) were purified. among these isolated compounds, artocarpin exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria, including s. mutans, s. pyogenes, b. subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis with mics of 4.4, 4.4, 17.8,  8.9, and 8.9 microm, respectively, and mbcs of 8.9, 8.9, 17.8, 8.9, and 8.9 microm, respectively, while artocarpanone showed the strongest activity against escherichia coli, a gram-negative bacteria with mic and mbc values of 12.9 and 25.8 microm, respectively. only artocarpin showed inhibitory activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa with an mic of 286.4 microm.

TI  == a c-type lectin from bothrops jararacussu venom disrupts staphylococcal biofilms.
AB  == bovine mastitis is a major threat to animal health and the dairy industry. staphylococcus aureus is a contagious pathogen that is usually associated with persistent intramammary infections, and biofilm formation is a relevant aspect of the outcome of these infections. several biological activities have been described for snake venoms, which led us to screen secretions of bothrops jararacussu for antibiofilm activity against s. aureus nrs155. crude venom was fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography, and the fractions were tested against s. aureus. biofilm growth, but not bacterial growth, was affected by several fractions. two fractions (15 and 16) showed the best activities and were  also assayed against s. epidermidis nrs101. fraction 15 was identified by tripletof mass spectrometry as a galactose-binding c-type lectin with a molecular weight of 15 kda. the lectin was purified from the crude venom by d-galactose affinity chromatography, and only one peak was observed. this pure lectin was able to inhibit 75% and 80% of s. aureus and s. epidermidis biofilms, respectively, without affecting bacterial cell viability. the lectin also exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on both bacterial biofilms. the antibiofilm activity was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy. a pre-formed s. epidermidis biofilm was significantly disrupted by the c-type lectin in a time-dependent manner. additionally, the lectin demonstrated the ability to inhibit biofilm formation by several mastitis pathogens, including different field strains of s. aureus, s. hyicus, s. chromogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and escherichia coli. these findings reveal a new activity for c-type lectins. studies are underway to evaluate the biological activity of these lectins in a mouse mastitis model.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel 4-bromo-1h-indazole derivatives as  ftsz inhibitors.
AB  == a series of novel 4-bromo-1h-indazole derivatives as filamentous temperature-sensitive protein z (ftsz) inhibitors were designed, synthesized, and assayed for their in vitro antibacterial activity against various phenotypes of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and their cell division inhibitory activity. the results indicated that this series showed better antibacterial activity against staphylococcus epidermidis and penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pyogenes than the other tested strains. among them, compounds 12 and 18 exhibited 256-fold and 256-fold more potent activity than 3-methoxybenzamide (3-mba) against penicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and compound 18 showed 64-fold better activity than 3-mba but 4-fold weaker activity than ciprofloxacin in the inhibition of s. aureus atcc29213. particularly, compound 9 presented the best activity (4 microg/ml) against s. pyogenes ps, being 32-fold, 32-fold, and 2-fold more active than 3-mba, curcumin, and ciprofloxacin, respectively, but it was four times less active than oxacillin sodium. in addition, some synthesized compounds displayed moderate inhibition of  cell division against s. aureus atcc25923, escherichia coli atcc25922, and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc27853, sharing a minimum cell division concentration of 128 microg/ml.

TI  == platelets and infections - complex interactions with bacteria.
AB  == platelets can be considered sentinels of vascular system due to their high number in the circulation and to the range of functional immunoreceptors they express. platelets express a wide range of potential bacterial receptors, including complement receptors, fcgammarii, toll-like receptors but also integrins conventionally described in the hemostatic response, such as gpiib-iiia or gpib.  bacteria bind these receptors either directly, or indirectly via fibrinogen, fibronectin, the first complement c1q, the von willebrand factor, etc. the fate of platelet-bound bacteria is questioned. several studies reported the ability of activated platelets to internalize bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus or porphyromonas gingivalis, though there is no clue on what happens thereafter. are they sheltered from the immune system in the cytoplasm of platelets or are they lysed? indeed, while the presence of phagolysosome has not been demonstrated in platelets, they contain antimicrobial peptides that were shown to be efficient on s. aureus. besides, the fact that bacteria can bind to platelets via receptors involved in hemostasis suggests that they may induce aggregation; this has indeed been described for streptococcus sanguinis, s. epidermidis, or c. pneumoniae. on  the other hand, platelets are able to display an inflammatory response to an infectious triggering. we, and others, have shown that platelet release soluble immunomodulatory factors upon stimulation by bacterial components. moreover, interactions between bacteria and platelets are not limited to only these two partners. indeed, platelets are also essential for the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps by neutrophils, resulting in bacterial clearance by trapping  bacteria and concentrating antibacterial factors but in enhancing thrombosis. in  conclusion, the platelet-bacteria interplay is a complex game; its fine analysis  is complicated by the fact that the inflammatory component adds to the aggregation response.

TI  == antibacterial activity of berry juices, an in vitro study.
AB  == abstract objective. the aim of the present study was to evaluate in vitro antibacterial activities of blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices on bacteria associated with gingival inflammation. materials and methods. the growth of selected bacteria (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was studied in vitro on agar plates. the  content of phenols in the different extracts was measured with hplc-esi-ms. results. the spectrometric analysis identified that the highest level of the single phenols studied was found for ferulic acid (113 mug/ml) in blackcurrant juice. sea buckthorn contained low levels of selected phenols. total bacterial inhibition for all bacterial species studied was found at 20% berry juice concentration with ph varying between 4.1-5.4. conclusions. the present study identified that in vitro bacterial growth on agar plates was inhibited by blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices and that low juice ph explains bacterial in vitro growth. this may have clinical implications in biofilm development, reducing the risks for both tooth decay and gingivitis.

TI  == introducing a semi-coated model to investigate antibacterial effects of biocompatible polymers on titanium surfaces.
AB  == peri-implant infections from bacterial biofilms on artificial surfaces are a common threat to all medical implants. they are a handicap for the patient and can lead to implant failure or even life-threatening complications. new implant surfaces have to be developed to reduce biofilm formation and to improve the long-term prognosis of medical implants. the aim of this study was (1) to develop a new method to test the antibacterial efficacy of implant surfaces by direct surface contact and (2) to elucidate whether an innovative antimicrobial copolymer coating of 4-vinyl-n-hexylpyridinium bromide and dimethyl(2-methacryloyloxyethyl) phosphonate (vp:dmmep 30:70) on titanium is able to reduce the attachment of bacteria prevalent in peri-implant infections. with a new in vitro model with semi-coated titanium discs, we were able to show a dramatic reduction in the adhesion of various pathogenic bacteria (streptococcus  sanguinis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis),  completely independently of effects caused by soluble materials. in contrast, soft tissue cells (human gingival or dermis fibroblasts) were less affected by the same coating, despite a moderate reduction in initial adhesion of gingival fibroblasts. these data confirm the hypothesis that vp:dmmep 30:70 is a promising antibacterial copolymer that may be of use in several clinical applications.

TI  == microbiology of pelvic lymphocyst infection after lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors.
AB  == background: pelvic lymphocyst infection is a rare complication after lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors. although medical therapy is a useful addition to surgical drainage, the appropriate antibiotic regimen is unknown because few studies have examined the causative organisms. the purpose of this case series was to identify the micro-organisms infecting pelvic lymphocysts. methods: this was a single-center, retrospective, case-series review conducted at a tertiary-care cancer center between october 2002 and march 2013. the participants included all patients who experienced their first pelvic lymphocyst infection after undergoing pelvic lymphadenectomy for cervical, endometrial, or ovarian cancer and exhibited positive lymphocyst fluid culture. computed tomography- or sonography-guided percutaneous aspiration procedures were performed to obtain lymphocyst fluid for culture. results: during the study period, 878 patients underwent lymphadenectomy for gynecologic malignant tumors,  and 13 developed a pelvic lymphocyst infection documented microbiologically. cultures identified staphylococcus aureus (three patients), s. epidermidis (one patient), streptococcus agalactiae (three patients), enterococcus (two patients), escherichia coli (one patient), and anaerobic bacteria (three patients). they were all monomicrobial infections. conclusions: our study and other smaller ones  suggest that lymphocyst infections following pelvic lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors usually are monomicrobial and caused by gram-positive cocci, including staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus, and anaerobes such as  bacteroides fragilis. these bacteria should be considered when selecting empiric  antibiotic therapy.

TI  == antimicrobial protein and peptide concentrations and activity in human breast milk consumed by preterm infants at risk of late-onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  == objective: we investigated the levels and antimicrobial activity of antimicrobial proteins and peptides (amps) in breast milk consumed by preterm infants, and whether deficiencies of these factors were associated with late-onset neonatal sepsis (los), a bacterial infection that frequently occurs in preterm infants in  the neonatal period. study design: breast milk from mothers of preterm infants (</= 32 weeks gestation) was collected on days 7 (n = 88) and 21 (n = 77) postpartum. concentrations of lactoferrin, ll-37, beta-defensins 1 and 2, and alpha-defensin 5 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the antimicrobial activity of breast milk samples against staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and streptococcus agalactiae was compared to the activity of infant formula, alone or supplemented with physiological levels of amps. samples of breast milk fed to infants with and without subsequent los were compared for levels of amps and inhibition of bacterial growth. results: levels of most amps and antibacterial activity in preterm breast milk were higher at day 7 than at day 21. lactoferrin was the only amp that limited pathogen growth >50% when added to formula at a concentration equivalent to that present in breast milk. levels of amps were similar in the breast milk fed to infants with and without los, however, infants who developed los consumed significantly less breast milk and lower doses of milk amps than those who were free from los. conclusions: the concentrations of lactoferrin and  defensins in preterm breast milk have antimicrobial activity against common neonatal pathogens.

TI  == temporal dynamics of the very premature infant gut dominant microbiota.
AB  == backgroundthe very-preterm infant gut microbiota is increasingly explored due to  its probable role in the development of life threatening diseases. results of high-throughput studies validate and renew the interest in approaches with lower  resolution such as pcr-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (ttge) for the follow-up of dominant microbiota dynamics. we report here an extensive longitudinal study of gut colonization in very preterm infants. we explored by 16s rdna-based pcr-ttge a total of 354 stool specimens sampled during routine monitoring from the 1st to the 8th week of life in 30 very pre-term infants born  before 30 weeks of gestational age.resultscombining comparison with a diversity ladder and sequencing allowed affiliation of 50 species-level operational taxonomic units (slotus) as well as semi-quantitative estimation of operational taxonomic units (otus). coagulase-negative staphylococci, mainly the staphylococcus epidermidis, was found in all the infants during the study period  and was the most represented (75.7% of the slotus) from the first days of life. enterococci, present in 60% of the infants were early, highly represented and persistent colonizers of the premature gut. later enterobacteriaceae and the genus clostridium appeared and were found in 10 (33%) and 21 infants (70%), respectively. we showed a high representation of veillonella in more than a quarter of the infants and being able to persistently colonize premature gut. the genera anaerococcus, aquabacterium, bacillus, bifidobacterium, corynebacterium, micrococcus, oceanobacillus, propionibacterium, pseudomonas, rothia, sarcina, sneathia and streptococcus were observed as transient or persistent colonizers, each genus being found in a minority of infants.conclusionsdespite low resolution, pcr-ttge remains complementary to high-throughput sequencing-based approaches because it allows the follow-up of dominant bacteria in gut microbiota in a large longitudinal cohorts of preterm neonates. we described the development of pre-term gut microbiota that should be now replaced regarding the functional role of major otus.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of pinus peuce (pinaceae) growing wild in r. macedonia.
AB  == the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils isolated from twigs with needles (t+n) and from twigs without needles (t-n) from  wild pinus peuce griseb. (pinaceae), from three different locations in r. macedonia, were investigated. essential oil yields of t+n ranged from 7.5 ml/kg to 12.5 ml/kg and for t-n from 13.8 ml/kg to 17.3 ml/kg. gc/fid/ms analysis of the essential oils revealed eighty-four components, representing 93.7-95.7% and 91.2-92.0% of the t+n and t-n oils, respectively. the major components in t+n and t-n oils were monoterpenes: alpha-pinene (23.8-39.9%, 21.2-23.3%), camphene (2.2-5.5%, 0.7-2.0%), beta-pinene (10.1-17.1%, 8.2-16.4%), myrcene (1.2-1.41%, 1.6-2.5%), limonene+beta-phellandrene (6.8-14.0%, 8.8-23.6%) and bornyl acetate (2.3-6.9%, 1.1-3.4%), followed by the sesquiterpenes: trans-(e)-caryophyllene (3.6-4.3%, 3.2-7.3%), germacrene d (7.1-9.5%, 5.0-10.3%) and delta-cadinene (2.1-3.1%, 3.3-4.2%, respectively). antimicrobial screening of the essential oils was made by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods against 13 bacterial isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and one strain of candida albicans. t-n essential oils showed antimicrobial activity toward streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and candida albicans as well as streptococcus agalactiae, acinetobacter spp. and haemophilus influenzae. the antimicrobial activity of t+n essential oils was greater, especially against streptococcus agalactiae, s. pyogenes, enterococcus and candida albicans, followed by haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of all tested essential oils ranged from 15-125  mul/ml. summarizing the obtained results, the antimicrobial activity of pinus peuce t+n and t-n essential oils collected from different localities in r. macedonia varied considerably. these alterations in the antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the differences in the quantitative composition and percentage amounts of the components present in the respective essential oils, although it was evident that there were no differences in the qualitative composition of the essential oils, regardless of the locality of collection, or the type of plant material (t+n or t-n).

TI  == reduction of teat skin mastitis pathogen loads: differences between strains, dips, and contact times.
AB  == the purpose of these experiments was to (1) assess differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to teat disinfectants (teat dips), and (2) determine the optimum time for premilking teat dips to remain in contact with teat skin to reduce pathogen loads on teat skin. two experiments were conducted using the excised teat model. in experiment 1, the differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to 4 commercially available dips (dip a: 1% h2o2; dip b: 1% chlorine dioxide; dip c: 1% iodophor; and dip d: 0.5% iodophor) were evaluated. four strains of 11 common mastitis pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, mycoplasma bovis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus hyicus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus haemolyticus) were tested. in experiment 2, the percentage log reduction of mastitis pathogens (escherichia coli, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, klebsiella species, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) on teat skin with 3 commercially available teat dips: dip a; dip d;  and dip e: 0.25% iodophor, using dip contact times of 15, 30, and 45 s, was evaluated. experiment 1 results indicated significant differences in strain sensitivities to dips within pathogen species: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus chromogenes, and streptococcus uberis. species differences were also found where mycoplasma bovis (97.9% log reduction) was the most sensitive to tested teat dips and staphylococcus haemolyticus (71.4% log reduction) the most resistant. experiment 2 results indicated that contact times of 30 and 45 s were  equally effective in reducing recovered bacteria for dips d and e and were also significantly more effective than a 15-s contact time. no differences were seen in recovered bacteria between tested contact times after treatment with dip a. it can be concluded that different mastitis pathogen species and strains within species may possess different sensitivities to teat dips, which may have implications in selection of teat dips on dairies. furthermore, a 30-s premilking dip contact time for iodophors and 15 s for h2o2 dips may be optimal in reducing  pathogen load in the shortest amount of time. a reduction in premilking teat dip  contact time may improve milking parlor efficiency.

TI  == synergistic effect of 2% chlorhexidine combined with proteolytic enzymes on biofilm disruption and killing.
AB  == aim: to investigate the dynamics of a disinfection regimen using 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase k in combination with 2% chlorhexidine (with or without ultrasonics) using a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies model biofilm. methodology: nutrient-stressed biofilms (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus  epidermidis, actinomyces radicidentis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecalis omgs 3202) were grown in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth. the treatment groups included 1% trypsin and 2% chlorhexidine (chx), 1% proteinase k and 2% chx (with and without ultrasonics). 2% chx was the positive control and untreated group, and sterile saline (with and without ultrasonics) was the negative control. the biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. results: the trypsin and chx group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective in reducing viable counts and the substratum coverage than those of all other groups (p < 0.05). the viable counts of the proteinase k and chx group used with (4.26 +/- 0.58 log10 cfu ml-1 ) or without ultrasonics (5.05 +/-  1.36 log10 cfu ml-1 ) were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) as compared with the  untreated control (7.67 +/- 0.84 log10 cfu ml-1 ) and saline groups used with (6.57 +/- 0.73 log10 cfu ml-1 ) and without ultrasonics (6.74 +/- 0.10 log10 cfu  ml-1 ). the chx group was less effective in biofilm disruption compared to when used in combination with trypsin and proteinase k. conclusion: the trypsin and chx group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective at reducing bacterial viable counts and disrupting biofilm.

TI  == synthesis and structure-activity relationship of amidine derivatives of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene as novel antibacterial agents.
AB  == current antibacterial chemotherapeutics are facing an alarming increase in bacterial resistance pressuring the search for novel agents that would expand the available therapeutic arsenal against resistant bacterial pathogens. in line with these efforts, a series of 9 amidine derivatives of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene were synthesized and, together with 18 previously synthesized analogs, evaluated  for their relative dna binding affinity, in vitro antibacterial activities and preliminary in vitro safety profile. encouraging antibacterial activity of several subclasses of tested amidine derivatives against gram-positive (including resistant mrsa, mrse, vre strains) and gram-negative bacterial strains was observed. the bis-phenyl derivatives were the most antibacterially active, while  compound 19 from bis-benzimidazole class exhibited the widest spectrum of activity (with mic of 4, 2, 0.5 and </=0.25 mug/ml against laboratory strains of  staphyloccocus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, moraxella catarrhalis, respectively and 4-32 mug/ml against clinical isolates of  sensitive and resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecium) and also demonstrated the strongest dna binding affinity (deltatm of 15.4 degrees c). asymmetrically designed compounds and carboxamide-amidines were, in general, less active. molecular docking indicated that the shape of the 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene derivatives and their ability to form multiple electrostatic and hydrogen bonds with dna, corresponds to the binding modes of other minor-groove binders. herein reported results encourage further investigation of this class of compounds as novel antibacterial dna binding agents.

TI  == antibacterial compounds from salvia adenophora fernald (lamiaceae).
AB  == from the aerial parts of salvia adenophora fernald four derivatives of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (1-4) together with five clerodane diterpenoids (5, 6, 8-10), and one known diterpene (7) have been isolated. compounds 1-6 and 8-10 are described for the first time. the structures were established by extensive 1d, 2d nmr and hresi-tofms spectroscopic methods. finally, the absolute configuration has been established by comparing of experimental and quantum chemical calculation of ecd spectra. despite a total lack of antimicrobial activity of the plant extract, hinting to the existence of antagonistic interactions in the crude material, three oxylipins (2-4) displayed a promising inhibition on gram-positive multidrug-resistant clinical strains including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and, particularly, staphylococcus epidermidis, while the compounds 9 and 10 revealed a specific and strain-dependent activity against s. epidermidis. interestingly, the inhibition provided by these compounds was independent of the resistance patterns of these pathogens to classic antibiotics. no action was reported on gram-negative strains nor on candida albicans. these results confirm that clerodanes and, particularly, prostaglandin-like compounds can be considered as interesting antimicrobial agents deserving further study.

TI  == oral bacterial dna findings in pericardial fluid.
AB  == background: we recently reported that large amounts of oral bacterial dna can be  found in thrombus aspirates of myocardial infarction patients. some case reports  describe bacterial findings in pericardial fluid, mostly done with conventional culturing and a few with pcr; in purulent pericarditis, nevertheless, bacterial pcr has not been used as a diagnostic method before. objective: to find out whether bacterial dna can be measured in the pericardial fluid and if it correlates with pathologic-anatomic findings linked to cardiovascular diseases. methods: twenty-two pericardial aspirates were collected aseptically prior to forensic autopsy at tampere university hospital during 2009-2010. of the autopsies, 10 (45.5%) were free of coronary artery disease (cad), 7 (31.8%) had mild and 5 (22.7%) had severe cad. bacterial dna amounts were determined using real-time quantitative pcr with specific primers and probes for all bacterial strains associated with endodontic disease (streptococcus mitis group, streptococcus anginosus group, staphylococcus aureus/staphylococcus epidermidis,  prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra) and periodontal disease (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatus, and dialister pneumosintes). results: of 22 cases, 14 (63.6%) were positive for endodontic and 8 (36.4%) for periodontal-disease-associated bacteria. only one case was positive for bacterial culturing. there was a statistically significant association between the relative amount of bacterial dna in the pericardial fluid and the severity of cad (p=0.035). conclusions: oral bacterial dna was detectable in pericardial fluid and an association between the severity of cad and the total amount of bacterial  dna in pericardial fluid was found, suggesting that this kind of measurement might be useful for clinical purposes.

TI  == infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking: a systematic review of reported cases: management, visual outcome, and treatment proposed.
AB  == abstract aim: to describe the infectious complications and the group of pathogens involved in the infection following corneal crosslinking, the visual outcome, and the treatment proposed. methods: a medline (national library of medicine, bethesda, md, usa) search from october 2000 to october 2013 was performed to identify all articles describing infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking treatment. nineteen articles were selected. ten articles reported infectious complications of corneal crosslinking treatment were included. nine articles were excluded, because seven described sterile keratitis, one article was in german, and one reported general complication without describing the infection complication. results: a total number of infections reported included 10 eyes. the infectious keratitis was associated with bacteria in five eyes (50%): gram-positive bacteria in three eyes (30%) (staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus and streptococcus salivarius plus s. oralis, respectively) and gram-negative bacteria in two eyes (20%) (e. coli; p. aeruginosa); there was herpes virus in two eyes, fungus in two eyes (fusarium and microsporidia) (20%),  and acanthamoeba in one eye (10%). conclusions: only 10 cases of infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking are published. the most virulent pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa and acanthamoeba. less virulent organisms were escherichia coli and s. epidermidis. two cases of herpes keratitis were described, suggesting the possibility of systemic antiviral prophylaxis before corneal crosslinking treatment. the most common risk factor of infections identified was postoperative incorrect patient behavior.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of azd0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against gram-positive, fastidious gram-negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  == azd0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious gram-negative (haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including  isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. azd0914 works via inhibition  of dna biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. azd0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken dna under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved dna to form fused circular dna. whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. azd0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in s. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrb. additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for azd0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. azd0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. in in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. the potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of azd0914 support its continued development.

TI  == dna extraction methods for panbacterial and panfungal pcr detection in intraocular fluids.
AB  == purpose: three different methods of dna extraction from intraocular fluids were compared with subsequent detection for bacterial and fungal dna by universal pcr  amplification. material and methods: three dna extraction methods, from aqueous and vitreous humors, were evaluated to compare their relative efficiency. bacterial (gram positive and negative) and fungal strains were used in this study: escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis and candida albicans. the quality, quantification, and detection limit for dna extraction and pcr amplification were analyzed. validation procedures for 13 aqueous humor and 14 vitreous samples, from 20 patients with clinically suspected endophthalmitis were carried out. results: the column-based extraction method was the most time-effective, achieving dna detection limits >/=10(2) and 10(3 )cfu/100 microl  for bacteria and fungi, respectively. pcr amplification detected 100 fg, 1 pg and 10 pg of genomic dna of e. coli, s. epidermidis and c. albicans respectively. pcr detected 90.0% of the causative agents from 27 intraocular samples collected from 20 patients with clinically suspected endophthalmitis, while standard microbiological techniques could detect only 60.0%. the most frequently found organisms were streptococcus spp. in 38.9% (n = 7) of patients and staphylococcus spp. found in 22.2% (n = 4). conclusions: the column-based extraction method for  very small inocula in small volume samples (50-100 microl) of aqueous and/or vitreous humors allowed pcr amplification in all samples with sufficient quality  for subsequent sequencing and identification of the microorganism in the majority of them.

TI  == false negative beta-2 transferrin in the diagnosis of cerebrospinal fluid leak in the presence of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == objectives/hypothesis: the objectives of this study were to examine the presence  of beta-2 transferrin (beta2trnsf) in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) contaminated in vitro by various bacteria and explore the mechanism (passive or active) responsible for beta2trnsf elimination. early diagnosis of csf leakage may change treatment decisions and minimize the risk of meningitis and encephalitis. beta2trnsf is a protein present exclusively in csf. its detection is highly useful in cases of csf leakage, although it has never been examined in the presence of central nervous system infection. study design: prospective patient analysis. methods: sterile csf drawn from patients was contaminated in vitro with several microorganisms chosen for their ability to cause neurosurgical-related infections: streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. beta2trnsf was examined at two time points: following immediate inoculation (t0) and following an overnight incubation (t18) over various bacterial concentrations. samples of csf inoculated with s pneumoniae were also examined in the presence of ciprofloxacin. for beta2trnsf analysis we used immunoblotting electrophoresis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). results: csf samples collected from nine patients were analyzed. beta2trnsf was not detected following s pneumoniae inoculation at both time points when immunoblotting electrophoresis was used. quantitative analysis using elisa demonstrated significant beta2trnsf concentration decrease. the addition of ciprofloxacin led to the same results. conclusions: csf leak detection using beta2trnsf may be deceiving in the presence of a s pneumoniae cerebral nervous system infection. a passive process is suggested, as beta2trnsf disappeared either immediately or following incubation with inactive bacteria.

TI  == comparative study of bacteriological culture and real-time fluorescence quantitative pcr (rt-pcr) and multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) hybridization assay in the diagnosis of bacterial neonatal meningitis.
AB  == background: bacterial meningitis is more common in the neonatal period than any other time in life; however, it is still a challenge for the evidence based diagnosis. strategy for identification of neonatal bacterial meningitis pathogens is presented by evaluating three different available methods to establish evidence-based diagnosis for neonatal bacterial meningitis. methods: the cerebrospinal fluid samples from 56 neonates diagnosed as bacterial meningitis in 2009 in beijing children's hospital were analyzed in the study. two pcr based molecular assays, real-time fluorescence quantitative pcr (rt-pcr) and multiplex  pcr based-reverse line blot hybridization (mpcr/rlb), were used to assess 7 common neonatal meningitis bacterial pathongens, including escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, listerisa monocytogenes, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus agalactiae. the findings in examinations of two assays were compared with the results obtained bacterial culture tests. results: bacterial meningitis was identified in five cases (9%) by csf cultures, 25 (45%) by rt-pcr and 16 (29%) by mpcr/rlb. one strain of s. epidermidis and one of e. faecalis were identified using mpcr/rlb but not by rt-pcr. in contrast, cultures identified one strain of s. pneumoniae which was missed by both pcr assays. overall, the bacterial pathogens in 28 cases were identified with these three methods. both rt-pcr and mpcr/rlb assays were more sensitive than bacterial culture, (p < 0.05). conclusion: our study confirmed that both rt-pcr and mpcr/rlb assays have better sensitivity than bacterial culture. they are capable of detecting the pathogens in csf samples with negative culture results.

TI  == a study on the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria involved  in skin and meibomian gland lesions of demodectic mange in cattle.
AB  == the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria involved in bovine demodectic mange lesions and the normal flora inhabiting the skin of noninfected  animals was investigated. demodex bovis and d. ghanensis mites were isolated from the infected purulent material extracted from skin and meibomian gland lesions, respectively. the mites could not be demonstrated in skin brushings or impression smears from the eyes of noninfected cattle. pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes (group a)) and opportunistic organisms (proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and trueperella pyogenes) were isolated from skin lesions of demodectic mange, and moraxella bovis and staphylococcus aureus were isolated from meibomian gland lesions. bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes (group a) were isolated from skin brushings from noninfected cattle. the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria in demodectic mange lesions is synergistic and of equal significance. pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria facilitated the establishment of demodex mites in the lesions produced and provided an excellent  microclimate for the mites to propagate and reproduce, resulting in severe and progressive disease. the "high-turnover" granulomatous reaction which characterized the histopathological changes proved that demodex mites and associated bacteria were persistent and immunogenic.

TI  == fusidic acid in skin infections and infected atopic eczema.
AB  == skin infections represent an important public health issue and cost-driver. additionally, chronic skin lesions are sometimes colonized by gram-negative species. topical therapies are a key component in the management of mild-to-moderate skin infections. in such cases, topical antibiotics may be preferable to systemic treatment, since they maximize the effective doses at the  site of infection while minimizing the systemic side effects of the drugs. however, the prevalence of resistant strains is steadily increasing and cases of  sensitization are not uncommon. as a consequence, the ideal topical antibiotic should be selective (thus, minimizing cross-resistance), have weak sensitization  potential, penetrate the skin efficiently, reach adequate local doses at the site of infection, and finally be available in different formulations matching patients' preferences and needs. fusidic acid (fa) is a selective antibiotic available in several topical formulations. pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies have shown that, contrary to other topical antibiotics such as gentamicin or mupirocin, fa reaches high antimicrobial concentration at deep skin layers after topical application either on intact or damaged epidermis. several randomized controlled trials demonstrated that fa, in its various topical formulations, is very effective in treating skin infections, given its high bactericidal activity against s. aureus (including strains resistant to penicillin, methicillin, ampicillin, cloxacillin), s. epidermidis, streptococcus  pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, corinebatteria, clostridia. additionally, fa presents a low risk of resistance even in methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, a common pathogen implied in the etiology of skin infections and infected atopic eczema. such feature makes fa particularly useful in the management of these medical conditions. finally, possibly due to its large steric effect, fa has proved a very low risk of contact sensitization. overall, data on  fa efficacy, safety, sensitization potential, resistance profile and spectrum selectivity make it a first-choice option in the treatment of primary and secondary skin infection.

TI  == novel copper (ii) alginate hydrogels and their potential for use as anti-bacterial wound dressings.
AB  == the incorporation of a metal ion, with antimicrobial activity, into an alginate dressing is an attractive approach to minimize infection in a wound. in this work, copper (ii) cross-linked alginate hydrogels were successfully prepared using a two-step cross-linking procedure. in the first step, solid alginate films were prepared using a solvent-casting method from soft gels of alginate solutions that had been lightly cross-linked using a copper (ii) (cu(2+)) sulfate solution. in the second step, the films were further cross-linked in a corresponding cu(2+) sulfate solution using a dipping method to further improve their dimensional stability. alginate solution (at 2%w/v) and cu(2+) sulfate solution (at 2%w/v) in acetate buffer at a low ph provided soft films with excellent swelling behavior.  an increase in either cu(2+) ion concentration or cross-linking time led to hydrogels with more densely-cross-linked networks that limited water absorption.  the hydrogels clearly showed antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pyogenes, which was proportional to  the cu(2+) ion concentration. blood coagulation studies showed that the tested copper (ii) cross-linked alginate hydrogels had a tendency to coagulate fibrin, and possibly had an effect on pro-thrombotic coagulation and platelet activation. conclusively, the prepared films are likely candidates as antibacterial wound dressings.

TI  == nanoscopic vibrations of bacteria with different cell-wall properties adhering to surfaces under flow and static conditions.
AB  == bacteria adhering to surfaces demonstrate random, nanoscopic vibrations around their equilibrium positions. this paper compares vibrational amplitudes of bacteria adhering to glass. spring constants of the bond are derived from vibrational amplitudes and related to the electrophoretic softness of the cell surfaces and dissipation shifts measured upon bacterial adhesion in a quartz-crystal-microbalance (qcm-d). experiments were conducted with six bacterial strains with pairwise differences in cell surface characteristics. vibrational amplitudes were highest in low ionic strength suspensions. under fluid flow, vibrational amplitudes were lower in the direction of flow than perpendicular to it because stretching of cell surface polymers in the direction  of flow causes stiffening of the polyelectrolyte network surrounding a bacterium. under static conditions (0.57 mm), vibrational amplitudes of fibrillated streptococcus salivarius hb7 (145 nm) were higher than that of a bald mutant hb-c12 (76 nm). amplitudes of moderately extracellular polymeric substance (eps)  producing staphylococcus epidermidis atcc35983 (47 nm) were more than twice the amplitudes of strongly eps producing s. epidermidis atcc35984 (21 nm). no differences were found between staphylococcus aureus strains differing in membrane cross-linking. high vibrational amplitudes corresponded with low dissipation shifts in qcm-d. in streptococci, the polyelectrolyte network surrounding a bacterium is formed by fibrillar surface appendages and spring constants derived from vibrational amplitudes decreased with increasing fibrillar density. in staphylococci, eps constitutes the main network component, and larger amounts of eps yielded higher spring constants. spring constants increased with increasing ionic strength and strains with smaller electrophoretically derived bacterial cell surface softnesses possessed the highest spring constants.

TI  == susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  == objectives: to present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, resilon/realseal (rs). to determine if  rs is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show rs degradation. method and materials: emulsions of rs were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. lipase ps served as a positive control. pseudomonas aeruginosa, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade rs. the bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for rs degradation for 7 days. results: degradation of the emulsified rs manifested in the formation of clear zones around p aeruginosa, p intermedia, p asaccharolytica, s aureus, and s epidermidis. no degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain rs emulsion. conclusion:  endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade rs. these findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with rs may be impaired by a microbial insult.

TI  == enzymatic treatment of specimens before dna extraction directly influences molecular detection of infectious agents.
AB  == introduction: biological samples, pharmaceuticals or food contain proteins, lipids, polymers, ammoniums and macromolecules that alter the detection of infectious agents by dna amplification techniques (pcr). moreover the targeted dna has to be released from the complex cell walls and the compact nucleoprotein  matrixes and cleared from potential inhibitors. the goal of the present work was  to assess the efficiency of enzymatic pretreatments on infectious agents to make  dna available for further extraction and amplification. methods: staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, aspergillus niger and fusarium solani were mixed with an internal control virus and treated with: 1) proteinase k; 2) lyticase and 3) lyticase followed by proteinase k. dnas was manually extracted using the qiamp dna mini kit or the magna pure compact automate. dna extraction yields and the inhibitors were assessed with a phocid herpesvirus. bacterial detection was performed using taqman real-time pcr and yeasts and filamentous fungi with hrm (real-time pcr followed by high-resolution melting analysis). results: viral dna was released, extracted and detected using manual and automatic methods without pre enzymatic treatments. either the manual or the automatic dna extraction systems did not meet the sensitivity expectations if enzymatic treatments were not performed before: lyticase for fungi and proteinase k for bacteria. the addition of lyticase and proteinase k did not improve results. for fungi the detection after lyticase was higher than for proteinase k, for which melting analysis did not allow fungal specification. discussion: columns and magnetic beads allowed collecting dna and separate pcr inhibitors. detection rates cannot be related to dna-avidity of beads or to elution but to the lack of proteolysis.

TI  == microbial diversity in persistent root canal infections investigated by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: the aim of the present study was to investigate the composition of  the root canal microbiota in endodontic failures in order to identify and quantify these microorganisms. methods: microbiological samples were taken from 36 root canals with persistent endodontic infection. the presence, levels, and proportions of 79 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the pearson correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relations between bacterial counts and clinical conditions (p </= .05). results:  enterococcus faecium (36%), streptococcus epidermidis (36%), eubacterium saburreum (28%), parvimonas micra (28%), streptococcus sanguis (28%), capnocytophaga sputigena (28%), leptotrichia buccalis (28%), enterococcus faecalis (28%), and staphylococcus warneri (28%) were the most prevalent species; and there was a low prevalence of treponema socranskii (3%), fusobacterium periodonticum (3%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (3%), and spiroplasma ixodetis (3%). the highest mean levels were found for the following species: e. faecium, dialister pneumosintes, staphylococcus epidermidis and helicobacter pylori. there was a statistically significant difference between the levels of gram-negative species and gram-positive species (13.5 x 10(5) vs 6.5 x 10(5), respectively). a  positive correlation was found between the area of the periapical lesion and the  levels of gram-negative and rod species (p < .05). conclusions: the microbiota from teeth with persistent apical periodontitis presents a mixed and complex profile, hosting e. faecium and s. epidermidis as the most highly prevalent species. no correlation was found between any of the species tested and clinical  findings; however, periapical lesions with the largest areas presented higher counts of gram-negative and rod species.

TI  == bacterial resistance of self-assembled surfaces using ppom-b-psbman zwitterionic  copolymer - concomitant effects of surface topography and surface chemistry on attachment of live bacteria.
AB  == three well-defined diblock copolymers made of poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (poly(sbma)) and poly(propylene oxide) (ppo) groups were synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization (atrp) method. they were physically adsorbed onto three types of surfaces having different topography, including smooth flat surface, convex surface, and indented surface. chemical state of surfaces was characterized by xps while the various topographies were examined by sem and afm. hydrophilicity of surfaces was dependent on both the surface chemistry and the surface topography, suggesting that orientation of copolymer brushes can be tuned in the design of surfaces aimed at resisting bacterial attachment. escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans and escherichia coli with  green fluorescent protein (e. coli gfp) were used in bacterial tests to assess the resistance to bacterial attachment of poly(sbma)-covered surfaces. results highlighted a drastic improvement of resistance to bacterial adhesion with the increasing of poly(sbma) to ppo ratio, as well as an important effect of surface  topography. the chemical effect was directly related to the length of the hydrophilic moieties. when longer, more water could be entrapped, leading to improved anti-bacterial properties. the physical effect impacted on the orientation of the copolymer brushes, as well as on the surface contact area available. convex surfaces as well as indented surfaces wafer presented the best  resistance to bacterial adhesion. indeed, bacterial attachment was more importantly reduced on these surfaces compared with smooth surfaces. it was explained by the non-orthogonal orientation of copolymer brushes, resulting in a  more efficient surface coverage of zwitterionic molecules. this work suggests that not only the control of surface chemistry is essential in the preparation of surfaces resisting bacterial attachment, but also the control of surface topography and orientation of antifouling moieties.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides as potential tool to fight bacterial biofilm.
AB  == recently, the topic of biofilm has met a huge interest of researchers owing to a  significant role played by this microbial life form in severe infections. these well organised three-dimensional microbial communities are characterized by a strong resistance to antimicrobials. biofilms significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality as related infections are very difficult to treat due to  their tendency to relapse after the withdrawal of antibiotics. according to the literature, antimicrobial peptides (amps) have a high potential as future antibiofilm agents. amps can influence various stages of biofilm formation and exhibit antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including multi-drug resistant strains. the purpose of the present study was to determine the activity of antimicrobial peptides against biofilms formed by a variety of bacterial strains. to do this, the following antimicrobial peptides were synthesized: citropin 1.1, lipopeptides palm-kk-nh2 and palm-rr-nh2, omiganan, pexiganan and temporin a. antimicrobial activity of the compounds and conventional antibiotics was determined for planktonic cells and biofilms formed  by reference strains of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (escherichia  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis) bacteria. amps exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against gram-positive strains, while gram-negative  bacteria were less susceptible. antimicrobial activity of the tested peptides against biofilms formed by gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger as  compared to that of conventional antimicrobials.

TI  == a multifunctional streptococcal collagen-mimetic protein coating prevents bacterial adhesion and promotes osteoid formation on titanium.
AB  == the major barriers to the clinical success of orthopedic and dental implants are  poor integration of fixtures with bone tissue and biomaterial-associated infections. although multifunctional device coatings have long been considered a  promising strategy, their development is hindered by difficulties in integrating  biocompatibility, anti-infective activity and antithrombotic properties within a  single grafting agent. in this study, we used cell adhesion assays and confocal microscopy of primary murine osteoblasts and human osteoblast cell lines mg-63 and saos-2 to demonstrate that a streptococcal collagen-like protein engineered to display the alpha1 and alpha2 integrin recognition sequences enhances osteoblast adhesion and spreading on titanium fixtures. by measuring calcium deposition and alkaline phosphatase activity, we also showed that selective activation of alpha2beta1 integrin induces osteoblast differentiation, osteoid formation and mineralization. moreover, cell adhesion assays and scanning electron microscopy of clinical isolates staphylococcus aureus philips and staphylococcus epidermidis 9491 indicated that streptococcal collagen-mimetic proteins inhibit bacterial colonization and biofilm formation irrespective of their interaction with integrins. given that streptococcal collagenous substrates neither interact with platelets nor trigger a strong immune response, this novel  bioactive coating appears to have desirable multifaceted properties with promising translational applications.

AB  == case description: a 4-year-old spayed female mastiff was evaluated for treatment  of chronic nonhealing pressure wounds over both elbow regions resulting from attempts at hypertrophic callus excision. clinical findings: the wound bed granulation tissue was mottled red and yellow with hyperemic, rolled epithelial edges. the right wound communicated with a large fluid pocket along the thoracic  wall. the dog had an inflammatory leukogram with a left shift. treatment and outcome: the wounds were debrided, and tissue specimens were collected for histologic evaluation, microbial culture, and bacterial identification by means of molecular diagnostic techniques. the left wound was closed immediately. calcium alginate rope with silver was packed into the right wound. vacuum-assisted closure was applied for 6 days. debridement was repeated, and a thoracodorsal axial pattern flap was used to cover the wound. systemic treatment  with antimicrobials was initiated, and pressure over the elbow regions was relieved. bacterial biofilms were identified histologically in tissue specimens from both wounds. staphylococcus intermedius, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus canis were cultured and identified by 16s rrna fragment sequencing. pyrosequencing identified multiple bacterial species and no fungal organisms. both wounds healed successfully. clinical relevance: biofilms are implicated in infected orthopedic implants in veterinary patients; however, this is the first report of a bacterial biofilm in chronic wounds in a dog. in human wound care, extensive debridement is performed to disrupt the biofilm; a multimodal treatment approach is recommended to delay reformation and help clear the infection. in this case, biofilm reformation was prevented by systemic treatment with antimicrobials, by reducing local pressure on the wounds, and by wound closure.

TI  == gamma-alkylidene-gamma-lactones and isobutylpyrrol-2(5h)-ones analogues to rubrolides as inhibitors of biofilm formation by gram-positive and gram-negative  bacteria.
AB  == several molecules have been discovered that interfere with formation of bacterial biofilms, opening a new strategy for the development of more efficient treatments in case of antibiotic resistant bacteria. amongst the most active compounds are some natural brominated furanones from marine algae delisea pulchra that have proven to be able to control pathogenic biofilms. we have recently reported that  some rubrolide analogues are able to inhibit biofilm formation of enterococcus faecalis. in the present letter we describe results of the biological evaluation  of a small library of 28 compounds including brominated furanones and the corresponding lactams against biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus mutans. our  results showed that in general these compounds were more active against biofilms  of s. epidermidis and p. aeruginosa, with little or no inhibition of planktonic bacterial growth. in some cases they were able to prevent biofilm formation of p. aeruginosa at concentrations as low as 0.6 mug/ml (1.3 mum, compound 3d) and 0.7  mug/ml (1.3 mum, 3f). results also indicate that, in general, lactams are more active against biofilms than their precursors, thus designating this class of molecules as good candidates for the development of a new generation of antimicrobial drugs targeted to biofilm inhibition.

TI  == combined computed tomography and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography  in the diagnosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis: a case series.
AB  == background: the diagnosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis is challenging. the gold standard for prosthetic valve endocarditis diagnosis is trans-esophageal echocardiography. however, trans-esophageal echocardiography may result in negative findings or yield images difficult to differentiate from thrombus in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis. combined computed tomography and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography is a potentially promising diagnostic tool for several infectious conditions and it has also been employed in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis but data are still scant. case presentations: we reviewed the charts of 6 patients with prosthetic aortic valves evaluated for suspicion of prosthetic valve endocarditis, at two different hospital, over a 3-year period. we found 3 patients with early-onset pve cases and blood cultures yielding pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus lugdunensis, respectively; and 3 late-onset cases in the remaining 3 patients with isolation in the blood of streptococcus bovis, candida  albicans and p. aeruginosa, respectively. initial trans-esophageal echocardiography was negative in all the patients, while fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed images suspicious for prosthetic valve endocarditis. in 4 out of 6 patients valve replacement was done with histology confirming the prosthetic valve endocarditis diagnosis. after an adequate course  of antibiotic therapy fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed resolution of prosthetic valve endocarditis in all the patients. conclusion: our  experience confirms the potential role of fluoroseoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the diagnosis and follow-up of prosthetic valve endocarditis.

TI  == effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  == bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. cell-free supernatants (cfs) were prepared from growth of enterococcus faecalis atcc 19433, pseudomonas fluorescens atcc 13525, escherichia coli 08, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, bacillus subtilis 168, bacillus coagulans 185a, b. coagulans 7050, clostridium sporogenes pa3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus salivarius, and streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. the inhibitory effects of cfs on  the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and tulane virus in raw 264.7 and llcmk2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of cfs or after exposure of host cells to cfs. slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and tulane virus in the continuous presence of cfs  of b. subtilis 168 and e. faecalis 19433, respectively. cfs cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. virus persisted in the cfs that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of cfs on virions. the viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from ankober district, north shewa zone, amhara region, ethiopia.
AB  == context: traditional medicinal plants have long been used in ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still  poorly known. objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in ankober district. methods: about 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: plant extracts from embelia schimperi vatke (myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 64 microg/ml against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. pyogenes. growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of ocimum lamiifolium hochst. (lamiaceae) against s. pyogenes, and those of rubus steudneri schweinf. (rosaceae) against s. epidermidis at an mic value of 128 microg/ml. generally, 74% of ethanol extracts  (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial  strains tested at an mic value of 512 microg/ml or below. discussion and conclusions: results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed  strong antimicrobial activities.

TI  == the effectiveness of enzymic irrigation in removing a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies biofilm.
AB  == aim: to establish a nutrient-stressed multispecies model biofilm and investigate  the dynamics of biofilm killing and disruption by 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase k  with or without ultrasonic activation. methodology: nutrient-stressed biofilms (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, actinomyces radicidentis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecalis omgs 3202) were grown on hydroxyapatite discs and in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth in modified fluid universal medium. the treatment groups included trypsin, proteinase k, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 1% sodium hypochlorite (naocl) (with and without ultrasonics). naocl and chlorhexidine were the positive controls and untreated group, and sterile saline was the negative control. the biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. results: nutrient stress in the multispecies biofilm was apparent as the medium ph became alkaline, glucose was absent, and serum proteins were degraded in the supernatant. the clsm showed the percentage reduction in viable bacteria at the biofilm surface level due to nutrient starvation. on the disc model, trypsin and proteinase k were effective in killing bacteria; their aerobic viable counts were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than the negative control and chlorhexidine. naocl was the most  effective agent (p < 0.001). in the tooth model, when compared to saline, trypsin with ultrasonics caused significant killing both aerobically and anaerobically (p < 0.05). chlorhexidine (1.46 +/- 0.42), trypsin (3.56 +/- 1.18) and proteinase k  (4.2 +/- 1.01) with ultrasonics were significantly effective (p < 0.05) in reducing the substratum coverage as compared to saline with ultrasonics (12% +/-  4.9). conclusion: trypsin with ultrasonic activation has a biofilm killing and disrupting potential.

TI  == synergetic inactivation of staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus mutansin  a tio2/h2o2/uv system.
AB  == tio 2 photocatalysis can be used to kill surface adherent bacteria on biomaterials, and is particularly interesting for use with percutaneous implants  and devices. its efficiency and safety, however, depend on the activation energy  required. this in vitro study investigates synergetic effects against the clinically relevant strains s. epidermidis and s. mutans when combining photocatalytic surfaces with h2o2. after 20 min exposure to 0.1 wt% h2o2 and uv light on tio2 surfaces, viabilities of s. epidermidis and s. mutans were reduced  by 99.7% and 98.9%, respectively. without h2o2 the corresponding viability reduction was 86% for s. epidermidis and 65% for s. mutans. this study indicates  that low concentrations of h2o2 can enhance the efficiency of photocatalytic tio2 surfaces, which could potentially improve current techniques used for decontamination and debridement of tio2 coated biomedical implants and devices.

TI  == a distinguishable role of edna in the viscoelastic relaxation of biofilms.
AB  == bacteria in the biofilm mode of growth are protected against chemical and mechanical stresses. biofilms are composed, for the most part, of extracellular polymeric substances (epss). the extracellular matrix is composed of different chemical constituents, such as proteins, polysaccharides, and extracellular dna (edna). here we aimed to identify the roles of different matrix constituents in the viscoelastic response of biofilms. staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans, and pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms were grown under different conditions yielding distinct matrix chemistries. next, biofilms were subjected to mechanical deformation and stress relaxation was monitored over time. a maxwell model possessing an average of four elements for an individual biofilm was used to fit the data. maxwell elements were defined by a relaxation time constant and their relative importance. relaxation time constants varied widely over the 104 biofilms included and were divided into seven ranges (<1, 1 to 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 50, 50 to 100, 100 to 500, and >500 s). principal-component  analysis was carried out to eliminate related time constant ranges, yielding three principal components that could be related to the known matrix chemistries. the fastest relaxation component (<3 s) was due to the presence of water and soluble polysaccharides, combined with the absence of bacteria, i.e., the heaviest masses in a biofilm. an intermediate component (3 to 70 s) was related to other epss, while a distinguishable role was assigned to intact edna, which possesses a unique principal component with a time constant range (10 to 25 s) between those of eps constituents. this implies that edna modulates its interaction with other matrix constituents to control its contribution to viscoelastic relaxation under mechanical stress. importance: the protection offered by biofilms to organisms that inhabit it against chemical and mechanical  stresses is due in part to its matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (epss) in which biofilm organisms embed themselves. mechanical stresses lead to deformation and possible detachment of biofilm organisms, and hence, rearrangement processes occur in a biofilm to relieve it from these stresses. maxwell analysis of stress relaxation allows the determination of characteristic  relaxation time constants, but the biofilm components and matrix constituents associated with different stress relaxation processes have never been identified. here we grew biofilms with different matrix constituents and used principal-component analysis to reveal that the presence of water and soluble polysaccharides, together with the absence of bacteria, is associated with the fastest relaxation, while other epss control a second, slower relaxation. extracellular dna, as a matrix constituent, had a distinguishable role with its own unique principal component in stress relaxation with a time constant range between those of other epss.

TI  == efficacy and safety of probiotics in the treatment of candida-associated stomatitis.
AB  == this study aimed at evaluating the short-term efficacy and safety of probiotics as an aid in the treatment of candida-associated stomatitis in a randomised controlled trial. a total of 65 patients were randomly assigned to receive oral local antifungal agents alone (gargle 2% sodium bicarbonate solution for 30 s, wait 10 min and then apply 2% nystatin paste) or these agents plus local probiotics (the mixture of bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus) three times per day for 4 weeks. parameters related to hyperaemia, visual analogue scale scores, culture of resting saliva and a lingual dorsum swab and adverse reactions were assessed or recorded in the beginning, middle and end of treatment. although the baseline characteristics of  the participants were similar, both groups showed a significant reduction in pain level and hyperaemia on the tongue mucosa (p = 0.000) after 4-week application. however, despite the reduction in hyperaemia in the probiotic group, these improvements did not display statistically significant differences. the detection rate of candida spp. was 100% before treatment and 8.21% in the experimental group and 34.6% in the control group after treatment. the detection rate of candida spp. decreased (p = 0.000) in both groups and was significantly lower in  the probiotic group than the control group (p = 0.038). other analysed micro-organisms, including the decreased detection rate for lactobacillus spp. (p = 0.049) and the increased detection rate for staphylococcus epidermidis (p = 0.019), did not display consistent change trends in the probiotics group. compared with conventional antifungal therapies for oral candidiasis, the inclusion of locally administered probiotics helped improve certain clinical conditions and reduced the prevalence of candida spp., although the impact of probiotics on oral bacterial species remains to be further studied.

TI  == combination of pantothenamides with vanin inhibitors as a novel antibiotic strategy against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the emergence of resistance against current antibiotics calls for the development of new compounds to treat infectious diseases. synthetic pantothenamides are pantothenate analogs that possess broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro  in minimal media. pantothenamides were shown to be substrates of the bacterial coenzyme a (coa) biosynthetic pathway, causing cellular coa depletion and interference with fatty acid synthesis. in spite of their potential use and selectivity for bacterial metabolic routes, these compounds have never made it to the clinic. in the present study, we show that pantothenamides are not active as  antibiotics in the presence of serum, and we found that they were hydrolyzed by ubiquitous pantetheinases of the vanin family. to address this further, we synthesized a series of pantetheinase inhibitors based on a pantothenate scaffold that inhibited serum pantetheinase activity in the nanomolar range. mass spectrometric analysis showed that addition of these pantetheinase inhibitors prevented hydrolysis of pantothenamides by serum. we found that combinations of these novel pantetheinase inhibitors and prototypic pantothenamides like n5-pan and n7-pan exerted antimicrobial activity in vitro, particularly against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes) even in the presence of serum. these results indicate that pantothenamides, when protected against degradation by host pantetheinases, are potentially useful antimicrobial agents.

TI  == duodenal-mucosal bacteria associated with celiac disease in children.
AB  == celiac disease (cd) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion  of cereal gluten proteins. this disorder is associated with imbalances in the gut microbiota composition that could be involved in the pathogenesis of cd. the aim  of this study was to characterize the composition and diversity of the cultivable duodenal mucosa-associated bacteria of cd patients and control children. duodenal biopsy specimens from patients with active disease on a gluten-containing diet (n = 32), patients with nonactive disease after adherence to a gluten-free diet (n = 17), and controls (n = 8) were homogenized and plated on plate count agar, wilkins-chalgren agar, brain heart agar, or yeast, casitone, and fatty acid agar. the isolates were identified by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. renyi diversity profiles showed the highest diversity values for active cd patients, followed by  nonactive cd patients and control individuals. members of the phylum proteobacteria were more abundant in patients with active cd than in the other child groups, while those of the phylum firmicutes were less abundant. members of the families enterobacteriaceae and staphylococcaceae, particularly the species klebsiella oxytoca, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus pasteuri, were more abundant in patients with active disease than in controls. in contrast, members of the family streptococcaceae were less abundant in patients with active cd than in controls. furthermore, isolates of the streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus mutans groups were more abundant in controls than in both cd patient groups, regardless of inflammatory status. the findings indicated that the disease is associated with the overgrowth of possible pathobionts that exclude symbionts or commensals that are characteristic of the healthy small intestinal microbiota.

TI  == clinical experience with the surgicel family of absorbable hemostats (oxidized regenerated cellulose) in neurosurgical applications: a review.
AB  == introduction: oxidized regenerated cellulose has a long history of safe and effective use in the surgical setting. surgicel original, fibrillar and nu-knit absorbable hemostats are composed of oxidized regenerated cellulose and are sterile, absorbable knitted fabrics that are flexible and adhere readily to bleeding surfaces. the purpose of this paper is to discuss neurosurgical applications for these absorbable hemostatic agents. methods: the authors reviewed the literature and described their clinical experience with surgicel hemostatic products. results: neurosurgical applications of the hemostatic products include the management of diffuse capillary oozing following bipolar cautery in brain tumor resection beds and the control of epidural oozing during spinal surgery. as an adjunct to standard hemostatic procedures, these products facilitate rapid hemostasis and have bactericidal activity that extend to antibiotic-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pneumonia, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa. although generally safe and well-tolerated, these hemostatic agents should be removed when used around, in, or in proximity to, foramina in bone, areas of bony confine, the spinal cord, and/or the optic nerve  or chiasm because it may otherwise swell and cause unwanted pressure. conclusion: the physical, hemostatic, and bactericidal characteristics of this material makes it a useful adjunct for conventional hemostatic and controlling capillary, venous, and small arterial hemorrhage during neurosurgery. .

TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and physicochemical properties of a crude methanol extract of the larvae of the blow fly lucilia cuprina.
AB  == the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains has prompted the reintroduction of maggot therapy in the treatment of chronic, infected wounds. many previous studies have demonstrated the potent antibacterial activity of larval excretions/secretions of the blowfly lucilia sericata (meigen) (diptera:calliphoridae) against bacteria. however, the antibacterial activity of  its sibling species, lucilia cuprina (wiedemann) (diptera:calliphoridae) against  a wide range of pathogenic bacteria has never been determined. the aim of this study was to develop a new procedure to produce whole body extract of larvae of l. cuprina via methanol extraction as well as to demonstrate the in vitro antibacterial activity of this extract against seven selected wound pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli). the turbidimetric assay demonstrated that l. cuprina larval extract was significantly potent against all bacteria tested (p < 0.001). additionally, colony-forming unit (cfu), agar well diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration assays have confirmed the apparent potency of larval extract against p. aeruginosa. the reconstituted larval extract was highly robust and thermally stable. these observations substantiated the feasibility of the methanol extraction method in the production of larval extract.

TI  == evaluation of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test for rapid detection of bacteria and resistance determinants.
AB  == rapid identification of pathogens from blood cultures can decrease lengths of stay and improve patient outcomes. we evaluated the accuracy of the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) nucleic acid test for investigational use only (nanosphere, inc., northbrook, il) for the identification of gram-positive bacteria from blood cultures. the detection of resistance genes (meca in staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis and vana or vanb in enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis) by the bc-gp assay also was assessed. a total of 186 positive blood cultures (in bact/alert fa bottles) with  gram-positive cocci observed with gram staining were analyzed using the bc-gp assay. the bc-gp results were compared with the identification and susceptibility profiles obtained with routine methods in the clinical laboratory. discordant results were arbitrated with additional biochemical, cefoxitin disk, and repeat bc-gp testing. the initial bc-gp organism identification was concordant with routine method results for 94.6% of the blood cultures. only 40% of the streptococcus pneumoniae identifications were correct. the detection of the meca  gene for 69 blood cultures with only s. aureus or s. epidermidis was concordant with susceptibility testing results. for 3 of 6 cultures with multiple staphylococcus spp., meca detection was reported but was correlated with oxacillin resistance in a species other than s. aureus or s. epidermidis. the detection of vana agreed with susceptibility testing results for 45 of 46 cultures with e. faecalis or e. faecium. comparison of the mean times to results  for each organism group showed that bc-gp results were available 31 to 42 h earlier than phenotypic identifications and 41 to 50 h earlier than susceptibility results.

TI  == novel bacteriophage lysin with broad lytic activity protects against mixed infection by streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gras]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases.  they are among the many gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. as a result, alternative therapies need to be developed  to combat these pathogens. we have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (plyss2), derived from a streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against mrsa, vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa), streptococcus suis, listeria, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus equi, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs]), s. pyogenes, streptococcus sanguinis, group g streptococci (ggs), group e streptococci (ges),  and streptococcus pneumoniae. plyss2 has an n-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (chap) catalytic domain and a c-terminal sh3b binding domain. it is stable at 50 degrees c for 30 min, 37 degrees c for >24 h, 4 degrees c for 15  days, and -80 degrees c for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. plyss2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced mrsa and s. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a mic of 16 mug/ml for mrsa. a single, 2-mg dose of plyss2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice  in a bacteremia model of mixed mrsa and s. pyogenes infection. serially increasing exposure of mrsa and s. pyogenes to plyss2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to plyss2 and resistance to mupirocin. to date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, plyss2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.

TI  == effect on quarter milk somatic cell count and antimicrobial susceptibility of staphylococcus rostri causing intramammary infection in dairy water buffaloes.
AB  == in many parts of the world, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) are the predominant cause of intramammary infections (imi) in dairy cows and in water buffaloes, as well. a longitudinal field study was carried out on one well-managed dairy water buffalo herd to determine the prevalence and distribution of cns and a recently described cns-species, staphylococcus rostri,  in milk samples to explore its relevance for buffaloes' udder health throughout lactation, and to gain insight into the susceptibility of the latter species toward commonly used antimicrobials. twice weekly quarter milk samples from a cohort of 11 lactating water buffaloes were collected over an 8-mo period. the cns (n=109; 76.2% of all culture-positive samples) were the predominant pathogens causing imi, followed by corynebacterium bovis (n=11; 7.6%) and streptococcus spp. (n=9; 6.2%) other than stretococcus uberis (n=2; 1.4%). thirty-seven hemolytic staphylococci suspected to be staphylococcus aureus were further differentiated using transfer dna-intergenic spacer-pcr and rpob-gene sequencing  because they were coagulase-negative. thirty-three of those isolates were identified as staph. rostri, whereas 2 others were identified as staphylococcus epidermidis. none of the staph. rostri isolates displayed resistance to the antimicrobial agents tested. mean quarter milk somatic cell count (qscc) of all samples collected throughout lactation was 20,970 cells/ml. the qscc at sampling  of quarters infected with staph. rostri (34,466 cells/ml) and cns other than staph. rostri (34,813 cells/ml) were significantly higher than the qscc of noninfected quarters (20,287 cells/ml), yet not significantly different from each other. these findings provide novel insight into the prevalence and distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility, and relevance of staph. rostri compared with other  cns species causing imi in water buffaloes. further studies are needed to pinpoint the relevance, niches, and transmission routes of staph. rostri, as well as other cns in water buffaloes.

TI  == antibiotic selection for the treatment of infectious complications of implant-based breast reconstruction.
AB  == background: infection requiring explantation remains the most devastating complication associated with implant-based breast reconstruction. there are many  treatment algorithms to prevent reconstructive failure in face of infection using both oral and intravenous antibiotics. in the absence of patient-specific culture data, antibiotic selection is generally directed toward broad-spectrum coverage based on historical data. we hypothesize that reviewing our institution's microbiology data obtained from explanted implant-based breast reconstructions would provide a rational basis for antibiotic selection in the future. methods: a retrospective review of 902 consecutive immediate implant-based breast reconstructions at a single institution from november 2007 to may 2011 was conducted. implant reconstructions requiring explantation or drainage by interventional radiology were identified. patient demographics, implant characteristics, presence of skin necrosis, microbiological data, and outcomes were reviewed. results: forty-three (4.76%) implant reconstructions requiring explantation or drainage by interventional radiology met the inclusion criteria for this study. five patients (11.6%) had round, smooth silicone implants, and 36 (88.4%) had textured tissue expanders. twenty-six implants were explanted because of infection; 3, because of exposure from skin necrosis; and 11, because of the combination of flap necrosis and infection; and 1, secondarily because of cancer  invasion into the skin. reconstruction was salvaged in 21 breasts (51.2%): 12 (57.1%) by implant reconstruction, 5 (23.8%) by pedicled latissimus dorsi flaps,  and 4 (19.1%) with a microvascular free flap. thirty explants had microbiology data available. the most common organism isolated was staphylococcus epidermidis  (10), followed by methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (5), serratia marcescens (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), enterococcus (3), escherichia coli (2), enterobacter (2), group b streptococcus (1), and morganella morganii (1). forty percent of the organisms were resistant to cefazolin; however, 86% were sensitive to gentamicin, 80% were sensitive to levaquin, and 63% were sensitive to ciprofloxacin. conclusions: infection associated with implant-based breast reconstructions continues to threaten explantation and reconstructive failure. based on our microbiological data, initial cellulitis amenable to oral antibiotics should be treated with oral fluoroquinolones as a first-line treatment. if this regimen fails, intravenous imipenem or gentamicin and vancomycin should be initiated. obviously, clinical judgment regarding specific patient risk factors and compliance should play a role in decision making, but these data provide an evidence-based rationale for first-line oral antibiotic selection.

TI  == verigene(r) gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test.
AB  == bloodstream infections (bsis) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and impose considerable costs on healthcare systems. a key predictor of clinical outcomes in patients with bsis is the early initiation of appropriate targeted antimicrobial therapy. however, with conventional blood culture methods, the gold standard, there is a significant time delay of approximately 2-3 days before clinical results are available, with many patients receiving inappropriate and/or unnecessary antimicrobial therapy in the interim. during the past two decades, the use of in vitro assays that utilize nucleic acid amplification-based detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns has led to a significant reduction in the time (hours vs. days with blood culture) to detection and identification of several of the causative pathogens of bsis and, potentially, earlier initiation of targeted antimicrobial therapy. this review focuses on the  properties and clinical use of one of these molecular diagnostic assays, the verigene((r)) gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp), which detects many of the potentially pathogenic gram-positive bacteria associated with bsis, including staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., listeria spp., and enterococcus spp., and specific resistance markers (meca, vana, and vanb). based  on more than 1,600 samples, there was a high degree of agreement between bc-gp test results and those obtained using conventional blood culture and assay methods, irrespective of whether samples were fresh or frozen, and a high degree  of agreement for identification of meca-mediated meticillin resistance in s. aureus and s. epidermidis organisms and vana- or vanb-mediated vancomycin resistance in e. faecalis and e. faecium organisms.

TI  == gene identification and recombinant protein of a lysozyme from freshwater mussel  cristaria plicata.
AB  == lysozymes are important proteins to bivalve in the innate immune responses against bacterial infections, and provide nutrition as digestion enzymes. a new lyz1 from the freshwater mussel cristaria plicata was cloned by rapid amplification of cdna ends (race) and nested pcr method. the full-length cdna sequence of cplyz1 was 763 bp. the cdna contained a 5'-terminal untranslated region (utr) of 21 bp, a 3'- terminal utr of 259 bp with a 29 bp poly(a) tail, a  tailing signal (aataaa) and the open reading frame of 483 bp. the cplyz1 cdna encoded a polypeptide of 160 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 17.8  kda, and a theoretical isoelectric point of 6.07. the comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences with lyzs from other species showed that the enzyme belonged to i-type lysozyme. the mrna transcript of cplyz1 could be detected in all the examined tissues with the highest expression level in hepatopancreas. the expression levels of cplyz1 in hemocytes, hepatopancreas and gill significantly increased after aeromonas hydrophila challenge. the expression level of cplyz1 in hemocytes sharply decreased from 6 h to 24 h and significantly increased at 48 h, and was the highest level in hepatopancreas at 24 h, and was the maximum level in gill at 48 h. furthermore, the recombinant cplyz1 was induced to be expressed as  an inclusion body form by iptg at 37 degrees c for 4 h, and then was purified by  using the ni(2+) affinity chromatography. the relative enzyme activity of the recombinant cplyz1 was influenced on ph and temperature. the optimal ph and temperature was 5.5 and 50 degrees c, respectively. against escherichia coli, a.  hydrophila, staphyloccocus aureus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus sp. and staphylococcus epidermidis, the recombinant cplyz1 had bacteriolytic activity.

TI  == identification of the hydroxyapatite-binding domain of salivary agglutinin.
AB  == the salivary agglutinin glycoprotein (sag) is present in saliva but is also part  of the salivary pellicle, playing a seemingly paradoxical role with regard to bacterial homeostasis. on the one hand, sag aggregates bacteria in solution, thereby preventing bacterial colonization. on the other hand, when bound to the tooth surface, sag facilitates bacterial colonization and microbial growth. the protein part of sag is predominantly composed of conserved scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (srcr) domains. previously it was found that bacterial binding and  aggregation is mediated via a single peptide loop, designated srcrp2 (p2), within the srcr domains of sag. the current data suggest that the srcr domains also harbour a hydroxyapatite (ha)-binding moiety, srcrp3 (p3). the observation that p2 and p3 individually play unique roles in the function of sags contributes to our understanding of the dual role of sags in bacterial binding. inspired by the  bacterial-modulating capacity of sags, we created a p3-polyethylene glycol (peg)  conjugate. it was found that a p3 coating resulted in an increased antifouling activity of 20% compared with the uncoated surface in vitro. an additional peg moiety resulted in an antifouling activity of up to 40% and 30% for streptococcus mutans and staphylococcus epidermidis, respectively.

TI  == periodontal status and bacteremia with oral viridans streptococci and coagulase negative staphylococci in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients: a prospective observational study.
AB  == aim: this study was aimed to investigate whether any association could be found between the presence of an inflamed and infected periodontium (e.g., gingivitis and periodontitis) and the development of bacteremia during neutropenia following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hsct). methods: eighteen patients underwent a periodontal examination before hsct. patients were classified as periodontally healthy [all periodontal pocket depths (ppd) </= 4 mm and bleeding on probing (bop) </= 10%) or as having gingivitis/periodontitis (ppd >/= 4 mm and bop > 10%]. oral mucositis (om) was scored using the daily mucositis score. blood cultures were taken at least twice weekly. results: five patients were periodontally healthy, while 13 patients had gingivitis or periodontitis. twelve patients (67%) developed bacteremia during neutropenia, of which 11 patients (61%) had one or more episodes of bacteremia due to coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons, most often staphylococcus epidermidis) or to oral viridans streptococci (ovs), or both. patients with gingivitis/periodontitis more often had bacteremia than those with a healthy periodontium (p = 0.047), and bop was associated with bacteremia (p = 0.049). all patients developed ulcerative om, but its severity and duration were not associated with bacteremia. om duration and the length of stay in the hospital were strongly correlated (r = 0.835, p </= 0.001). conclusion: this study indicates that periodontal infections may contribute to the risk of developing ovs and cons bacteremia during neutropenia following hsct. while our results point to the importance of periodontal evaluation and management before hsct, further studies on periodontal contribution to systemic infectious complications are warranted.

TI  == organism isolation in corneal ulcer: utility of different techniques.
AB  == introduction: various techniques are available for isolation of microorganism in  cases of microbial keratitis including conventional methods of scraping, re-scraping inoculation in different media and corneal biopsy. methods: this was  a cross sectional descriptive study conducted from february 2002 to july 2003. a  total of 161 eyes of corneal ulcers were evaluated with scraping inoculation. re-scraping and corneal biopsy were performed in those cases which did not grow any organism in the first scraping or which did not respond to initial treatment. results: microorganisms were isolated in 116 patients (72.04%) after first scraping. s pneumoniae was seen in 50(42%), fusarium in 21(18%) and aspergillus in 16(14%) cases. re-scraping was done in 22 culture negative and non improving cases of which 14 (63.63%) showed isolation of organisms. after re-scraping, fusarium and aspergillus were isolated in four patients each (18% each) followed  by s. pneumoniae in 3 (14%), s. aureus in 2 (9%), and penicillium in 1(5%) case.  corneal biopsy was done in 10 cases with isolation of microbial agents in 7 (70%) with aspergillus and s. aureus in three each, and s. epidermidis in 1(10%). conclusions: apart from conventional scraping, other isolation techniques should  be considered in the treatment of non-responding and culture negative cases of corneal ulcers. compared to bacteria, fungi are difficult to isolate in the first scraping and requires more frequent repeat scraping and corneal biopsy.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == ceftaroline versus isolates from animal bite wounds: comparative in vitro activities against 243 isolates, including 156 pasteurella species isolates.
AB  == more than 5 million americans are bitten by animals, usually dogs, annually. bite patients comprise approximately 1% of all patients who visit emergency departments (300,000/year), and approximately 10,000 require hospitalization and  intravenous antibiotics. ceftaroline is the bioactive component of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, which is fda approved for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssis), including those containing methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). there are no in vitro data about the activity of ceftaroline against pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida  and pasteurella multocida subsp. septica, other pasteurella spp., or other bite wound isolates. we therefore studied the in vitro activity of ceftaroline against 243 animal bite isolates. mics were determined using the broth microdilution method according to clsi guidelines. comparator drugs included cefazolin, ceftriaxone, ertapenem, ampicillin-sulbactam, azithromycin, doxycycline, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (smx-tmp). ceftaroline was the most active agent against all 5 pasteurella species, including p. multocida subsp. multocida and p. multocida subsp. septica, with a maximum mic of </=0.008 mug/ml; more active than ceftriaxone and ertapenem (mic(90)s, </=0.015 mug/ml); and more active than cefazolin (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml) doxycycline (mic(90), 0.125 mug/ml), azithromycin (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml), ampicillin-sulbactam (mic(90), 0.125 mug/ml), and smx-tmp  (mic(90), 0.125 mug/ml). ceftaroline was also very active against all s. aureus isolates (mic(90), 0.125 mug/ml) and other staphylococcus and streptococcus species, with a maximum mic of 0.125 mug/ml against all bite isolates tested. ceftaroline has potential clinical utility against infections involving p. multocida, other pasteurella species, and aerobic gram-positive isolates, including s. aureus.

TI  == bacterial superinfection in zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis.
AB  == background: zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (zcl) is a polymorphic disease. it is generally accepted that bacterial superinfection may play a role in the clinical appearance of the lesions and may delay or prevent the healing process.  however, the pattern of bacterial pathogens involved has rarely been investigated. material/methods: the aim of this study was to identify the bacterial species contaminating the suspected zcl and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics. microscopic examination of stained smears and cultures were used to differentiate zcl from non-zcl lesions in a rural area north of isfahan, iran from july to december 2009. bacteria were isolated from the lesions and identified and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard microbiological techniques. results: the results show that 602 (68%) of 855 patients were positive for zcl, of which 83.4% with volcano-shape, 8.8% psoriasiform, 6.6% popular form and 1.2% with other atypical forms of zcl. the bacteria were isolated from 66.8% of zcl (70% of volcano-shape, 60% of psoriasiform and 25% of popular form) and 64.7% of non-zcl lesions. the most common species were staphylococcus aureus (41.7%) and s. epidermidis (28%) followed by bacillus sp. streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., proteus sp., enterobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeroginosa. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, cefazolin and clindamycin were the most effective antibiotics. conclusions: bacterial superinfection appears to be very common in zcl, but its prevalence is not different from that of non-zcl lesions and it has little effect on the clinical appearance of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (acl). local  lesion care and management of bacterial superinfection must be considered in the  treatment of zcl.

TI  == comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. by use of a sensitive enrichment broth, gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the referral clinic in eritrea and at a german university hospital. in the german cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus (n=8; mrsa (n=2)), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). in comparison, the  eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. among the  identified species were s. aureus (n=2), s. epidermidis (n=13), streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and gram-negative rods including klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), escherichia coli (n=2), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). noteworthy, none of the eritrean patients were  positive for mrsa. in both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. however, we observed in two subjects of the eritrean cohort co-colonization with s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus. the occurrence of gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the german cohort, whereas in the eritrean cohort gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. continued surveillance  of s. aureus and gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.

TI  == bacteriological analysis of platelets and cases of septic reactions associated with transfusion of contaminated samples.
AB  == introduction: for years, platelet transfusion therapy has been playing an important role in controlling patients with hematological and oncological diseases. however, platelet transfusion represents a serious risk for bacterial sepsis. this study aimed to verify the bacterial contamination index in platelet  concentrates (pcs) obtained from the blood center of the state of rio grande do sul (hemorgs). methods: all 612 samples of pcs from hemorgs were analyzed in august 2009 and january 2010. we used a qualitative methodology which was modified manually in order to detect bacterial contamination. the patients who received the platelet units with confirmed positive cultures had their medical records analyzed. after the prospective study, a retrospective analysis of the samples of pcs checked by the bacteriological control from hemorgs since its foundation (2008) until 2010 was made. results: four hundred and eighty samples (10 monthly samples of plateletpheresis and 10 of whole blood-derived platelets)  were analyzed in order to compare the contamination index for both studies. of 1092 samples, 15 were found to be contaminated (6 of retrospective analysis and 9 of prospective). in prospective study, isolated microorganisms were nine staphylococcus epidermidis, but in retrospective two staphylococcus sp., two glucose non-fermenting gram negative bacilli, one streptococcus sp. and one proteus mirabilis. we report 3 feasible cases of bacterial sepsis associated with the transfusion of cps analyzed by prospective study. conclusion: bacterial sepsis associated with platelet transfusion is today the most frequent infectious complication of transfusion medicine. although complex, it is important to recognize transfusion sepsis in patients to reduce morbidity and mortality.

TI  == [antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2008].
AB  == the activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic gram-positive cocci (25 genus or species, 1029 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (21 genus or species, 187  strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2008 at 16 clinical facilities in japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. the  ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis was 59.6% and 81.2%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. vancomycin (vcm), linezolid (lzd) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (qpr/dpr) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, with mic90s of < or = 2 microg/ml. the ratio of penicillin (pc) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of pc-binding proteins among streptococcus pneumoniae was 92.0% that was highest among our previous reports. cefpirome, carbapenems, vcm, teicoplanin (teic), lzd and qpr/dpr had mic90s of <  or = 1 microg/ml against pc-intermediate and resistant s. pneumoniae strains. against all strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, the mics of vcm and teic were under 2 microg/ml, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 15.9% of e. faecalis strains and 1.2% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate to lzd. 17.1% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to qpr/dpr.  against all strains of clostridium difficile, the mic of vcm was under 1 microg/ml, suggesting that vcm had excellent activity. carbapenems showed good activity against clostridiales, bacteroides spp., and prevotella spp., but one strain of bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems. and so, the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future at detecting  continuously.

TI  == structural basis for nucleotide binding and reaction catalysis in mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase.
AB  == mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (mdd) catalyzes the final step of the mevalonate pathway, the mg(2+)-atp dependent decarboxylation of mevalonate 5-diphosphate (mvapp), producing isopentenyl diphosphate (ipp). synthesis of ipp, an isoprenoid precursor molecule that is a critical intermediate in peptidoglycan and polyisoprenoid biosynthesis, is essential in gram-positive bacteria (e.g., staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus spp.), and thus the enzymes of the mevalonate pathway are ideal antimicrobial targets. mdd belongs to the ghmp superfamily of metabolite kinases that have been extensively studied for the past 50 years, yet the crystallization of ghmp kinase ternary complexes has proven to  be difficult. to further our understanding of the catalytic mechanism of ghmp kinases with the purpose of developing broad spectrum antimicrobial agents that target the substrate and nucleotide binding sites, we report the crystal structures of wild-type and mutant (s192a and d283a) ternary complexes of staphylococcus epidermidis mdd. comparison of apo, mvapp-bound, and ternary complex wild-type mdd provides structural information about the mode of substrate binding and the catalytic mechanism. structural characterization of ternary complexes of catalytically deficient mdd s192a and d283a (k(cat) decreased 10(3)- and 10(5)-fold, respectively) provides insight into mdd function. the carboxylate side chain of invariant asp(283) functions as a catalytic base and is essential for the proper orientation of the mvapp c3-hydroxyl group within the active site  funnel. several mdd amino acids within the conserved phosphate binding loop ("p-loop") provide key interactions, stabilizing the nucleotide triphosphoryl moiety. the crystal structures presented here provide a useful foundation for structure-based drug design.

TI  == lantibiotic production by pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesised, post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides produced by gram positive bacteria, many which have broad-ranging antimicrobial activities. lantibiotics have long been the subject of investigation with a view to their application as food preservatives or chemotherapeutic agents for clinical and veterinary medicine, while the associated biosynthetic machinery has been employed for peptide engineering purposes. however, although many lantibiotics are produced by generally regarded  as safe or food-grade bacteria, it is increasingly apparent that a number of gram positive pathogens, including strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus uberis and enterococcus faecalis, also produce these compounds. it is proposed that production of these antimicrobials may provide the associated microorganisms with a competitive advantage when colonizing/infecting  a host, thereby enhancing the virulence of the producing strain. here we review the production of lantibiotics by these pathogens and discuss how their production may contribute to their disease-causing potential.

TI  == microbiological etiology and susceptibility of bacterial conjunctivitis isolates  from clinical trials with ophthalmic, twice-daily besifloxacin.
AB  == introduction: bacterial conjunctivitis is a contagious infection of the surface of the eye usually treated empirically with topical antibiotics. since the etiologic agent is rarely identified, it is important to monitor which bacteria cause conjunctivitis and determine their antibacterial resistance profiles. methods: a total of 496 bacterial samples were isolated during a randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study conducted in the united states with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% dosed twice daily. species were determined by standard biochemical and/or molecular identification methods.  minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined according to clinical and laboratory standards institute standards. results: the most prevalent species was haemophilus influenzae, followed by staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, the streptococcus mitis group, and streptococcus pneumoniae. one species  identified in this study, which was not previously noted as a common cause of bacterial conjunctivitis, was dolosigranulum pigrum. ampicillin resistance was common among h. influenzae isolates, while macrolide resistance was high among s. pneumoniae, s. epidermidis, and s. aureus. the latter two species also included a number of isolates resistant to methicillin and ciprofloxacin. conclusion: antibiotic resistance among isolates remains a concern and the appearance of an emerging ocular pathogen, d. pigrum, suggests the need for continued observation. the topical ophthalmic fluoroquinolones continue to provide a good balance of low to moderate (i.e., manageable) levels of resistance plus broad-spectrum coverage  for empiric treatment of ocular infections.

TI  == bacterial species-characteristic profiles of molecular species, and the antigenicity of phospholipids and glycolipids in symbiotic lactobacillus, staphylococcus and streptococcus species.
AB  == human symbiotic bacteria, lactobacillus reuteri (lr) in the intestines, staphylococcus epidermidis (se) in skin and streptococcus salivalis (ss) in the oral cavity, contain dihexaosyl diglycerides (dh-dg) in concentrations equivalent to those of phosphatidyl glycerol (pg) and cardiolipin (cl), together with mono-  to tetrahexaosyl dgs. the molecular species, as the combination of fatty acids in the dg moiety, were revealed to be bacterial species-characteristic, but to be similar between glycolipids and phospholipids in individual bacteria, the major ones being 16:0 and cy19:0 for lr, ai15:0 and ai17:0 for se, and 16:0 and 18:1 for ss, respectively. the carbohydrate structures of dh-dgs were also bacterial species-characteristic, being galalpha1-2glcalpha for lr, glcbeta1-6glcbeta for se, and glcalpha1-2glcalpha for ss, respectively. also, bacterial glycolipids were revealed to provide antigenic determinants characteristic of bacterial species on immunization of rabbits with the respective bacteria. anti-l. johnsonii antiserum intensely reacted with tri- and tetrahexaosyl dgs, in which galalpha was bound to dh-dg through an alpha1-6 linkage, as well as with dh-dg from lr. although anti-se antiserum preferentially reacted with dh-dg from se, anti-ss antiserum reacted with dh-dg from ss and, to a lesser extent, with dh-dgs from lr and se. but, both anti-se and anti-ss antiserum did not react at all with monohexaosyl dg or glycosphingolipids with the same carbohydrates at the nonreducing terminals. in addition, 75 % of human sera, irrespective of the abo blood group, were found to contain igm to tri- and tetrahexaosyl dgs from lr, but not to dh-dgs from lr, se and ss.

TI  == protection against staphylococcus aureus by antibody to the polyglycerolphosphate backbone of heterologous lipoteichoic acid.
AB  == type 1 lipoteichoic acid (lta) is present in many clinically important gram-positive bacteria, including enterococci, streptococci, and staphylococci, and antibodies against lta have been shown to opsonize nonencapsulated enterococcus faecalis strains. in the present study, we show that antibodies against e. faecalis lta also bind to type 1 lta from other gram-positive species  and opsonized staphylocccus epidermidis and staphylcoccus aureus strains as well  as group b streptococci. inhibition studies using teichoic acid oligomers indicated that cross-reactive opsonic antibodies bind to the teichoic acid backbone. passive immunization with rabbit antibodies against e. faecalis lta promoted the clearance of bacteremia by e. faecalis and s. epidermidis in mice. furthermore, passive protection also reduced mortality in a murine s. aureus peritonitis model. the effectiveness of rabbit antibody against lta suggests that this conserved bacterial structure could function as a single vaccine antigen that targets multiple gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == identification of conserved antigens from staphylococcal and streptococcal pathogens.
AB  == the design of vaccines containing epitopes shared between different human pathogens may lead to cross-species protection. in order to identify potentially  conserved bacterial antigens, bacteriophage expression libraries of genomic dna from streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were probed with human sera from staphylococcus aureus-infected and healthy individuals. by comparison with previous screening data from staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. aureus, putative antigenic, conserved domains across the genera were identified. in particular, three potentially antigenic conserved regions were identified based on the n-terminal domain of sacol0609 (sdrd), the c-terminal domain of sacol0723 (scab) and the c-terminus of sacol1140 (isda) from staph. aureus. the three domains were overexpressed, recombinant proteins were purified and polyclonal antisera raised against them recognized cell surface-located proteins from both staphylococcal and streptococcal species. the antisera were also able to opsonize both staph. aureus and strep. agalactiae thereby increasing their phagocytic uptake by human neutrophils. the conserved antigenic domains therefore represent potential cross-protective vaccine candidates.

TI  == a multicentre prospective study of post-traumatic endophthalmitis.
AB  == purpose: study the clinical and microbiological characteristics and the prognostic factors of post-traumatic endophthalmitis. methods: seventeen eyes were included between 2004 and 2010, with clinical and microbiological data collected prospectively. conventional cultures and panbacterial pcr were performed on aqueous and vitreous samples. results: clinical signs of endophthalmitis were observed soon after trauma (1.5 +/- 2.5 days). laceration with an intraocular foreign body (iofb) was noted in 53% of the patients. at admission, all patients had aqueous humour (71%) and/or vitreous (53%) samples. fifteen patients (88%) underwent a pars plana vitrectomy. bacteria were identified in 77% of the cases: staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 5), streptococcus (n = 4), bacillus (n = 2), pseudomonas stuzeri (n = 1), and streptococcus salivarius and gemella haemolysans (multibacterial infection, n = 1). progression toward phthisis was observed in 35% of the cases; 41% of the patients recuperated visual acuity (va) >/=20/40. a good final visual prognosis (>/=20/40) was significantly associated with initial va better than light perception (0% versus  70%, p = 0.01) and absence of pupillary fibrin membrane (80% versus 20%, p = 0.05). there was no correlation between visual prognosis and age, the type of laceration (corneal or scleral) or presence of an iofb. we found a statistical trend toward an association between bacterial virulence and poor final va. conclusion: this series showed that better final va outcomes were associated with initial va better than light perception, s. epidermidis or culture-negative cases and absence of retinal detachment during the clinical course.

TI  == temporal shifts in the skin microbiome associated with disease flares and treatment in children with atopic dermatitis.
AB  == atopic dermatitis (ad) has long been associated with staphylococcus aureus skin colonization or infection and is typically managed with regimens that include antimicrobial therapies. however, the role of microbial communities in the pathogenesis of ad is incompletely characterized. to assess the relationship between skin microbiota and disease progression, 16s ribosomal rna bacterial gene sequencing was performed on dna obtained directly from serial skin sampling of children with ad. the composition of bacterial communities was analyzed during ad disease states to identify characteristics associated with ad flares and improvement post-treatment. we found that microbial community structures at sites of disease predilection were dramatically different in ad patients compared with  controls. microbial diversity during ad flares was dependent on the presence or absence of recent ad treatments, with even intermittent treatment linked to greater bacterial diversity than no recent treatment. treatment-associated changes in skin bacterial diversity suggest that ad treatments diversify skin bacteria preceding improvements in disease activity. in ad, the proportion of staphylococcus sequences, particularly s. aureus, was greater during disease flares than at baseline or post-treatment, and correlated with worsened disease severity. representation of the skin commensal s. epidermidis also significantly  increased during flares. increases in streptococcus, propionibacterium, and corynebacterium species were observed following therapy. these findings reveal linkages between microbial communities and inflammatory diseases such as ad, and  demonstrate that as compared with culture-based studies, higher resolution examination of microbiota associated with human disease provides novel insights into global shifts of bacteria relevant to disease progression and treatment.

TI  == vitreous cultures and antibiotic analysis in puerto rican endophthalmitis patients.
AB  == objective: to analyze positive vitreous cultures and their respective antibiotic  sensitivities in patients with endophthalmitis in puerto rico. methods: we conducted a retrospective cohort study of vitreous cultures from all of the patients with a clinical diagnosis of endophthalmitis at the puerto rico medical  service administration center in san juan, puerto rico, from august 2009 to july  2010. positive isolates were selected for analysis. a retrospective chart review  was performed to establish the mechanism involved in the development of endophthalmitis. results: forty-three patients underwent vitreous cultures for a  diagnosis of endophthalmitis, of which 16 patients had positive cultures. seventy-eight percent of the isolates were bacterial and 22% fungal. staphylococcus genus was identified in 38% of patients. all of the staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pneumonia isolates were resistant to oxacillin; 66% of the staphylococcus aureus isolates were also resistant to oxacillin. all of the gram-positive isolates in our study were sensitive to vancomycin. all of the  gram-negative isolates were sensitive to ceftazidime. twenty-nine percent of the  post-traumatic endophthalmitis cases were fungal in origin. conclusion: the majority of endophthalmitis cases in our study were bacterial in origin, and the  staphylococcus genus was the most common type of organism identified. in our cohort, post-traumatic endophthalmitis was the most common mechanism leading to infection. vancomycin in combination with ceftazidime appears to be adequate for  the empiric treatment of all cases of bacterial endophthalmitis in our population. anti-fungal agents should be considered as adjuvant empiric treatment in patients with post-traumatic endophthalmitis.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of different adenosine analogues.
AB  == nucleoside analogues may represent good candidates for the discovery of new antibacterial agents, therefore, a library of adenosine analogues was assessed for their antibacterial activity, and the relationship between the structure and  activity of these molecules was outlined. antibacterial activity was evaluated against that of reference strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. we tested 54 adenosine analogues, modified both at ribose and base moieties, including adenine and 1/3-deazaadenine derivatives substituted in the 2- and/or n(6)-positions and bearing n-9 sugar moieties, such as ribose, 2'-deoxyribose, 3'-deoxyribose, 2',3'-dideoxyribose or cycloalkyl groups like cyclopentane. the data obtained, mic and minimal bactericidal concentrations demonstrated that the presence of bulky substituents such as cycloheptyl and cyclooctyl rings on the n(6)-amino, together with a chlorine atom in the 2-position, conferred antibacterial activity against the gram-positive group with mic values ranging from 16 to 128 mg l(-1). the intact sugar moiety seemed to be  not essential for antimicrobial activity and nucleosides bearing deoxyribose or cyclopentyl groups associated with bulky substituents in n(6)-position showed good antimicrobial properties. furthermore, n-1 proved to be non-crucial and the  2-chloro-n(6)-cyclooctyl-1-deaza-3'-deoxyadenosine and 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine compounds were among the more active in the series with an mic of 32 mg l(-1) against staph. aureus and strep. pneumoniae. none of the analogues was active against the two gram-negative species tested. hence, adenosine derivatives bearing bulky substituents in the n(6)-position may represent good lead compounds for the future discovery of a novel series of antibacterial agents.

TI  == bacteremia following dental implant surgery: preliminary results.
AB  == objectives: the aims of this study were to investigate the incidence of bacteremia, bacteriology and antibiotic susceptibility against to causative bacteria associated with dental implant installation. study design: 30 generally  healthy patients were enrolled in this study. blood samples were collected at baseline and at 30 minutes after dental implant installation and 24 hours after dental implant surgery. blood samples were cultured in a bactec system. the isolated bacteria were identified using conventional methods. antimicrobial sensitivity tests were performed by disc diffusion. results: no bacteria were isolated at the baseline and 24 hours after surgery, whereas the prevalence of bacteremia at 30 minutes after dental implant installation was 23%. the isolated  bacteria species were staphylococcus epidermidis, eubacterium spp., corynebacterium spp. and streptococcus viridans. the staphylococcus epidermidis,  which was isolated in three patients, was found to be resistant to penicillin which is first choice of many clinicians. conclusion: our findings suggest that installation of dental implants can produce bacteremia. within the limitations of this study, it can be speculated that the resistance of antibiotics may compromise the routine prophylaxis against infective endocarditis. therefore use  of blood cultures and antibiograms may be suggested in risky patients. the outcome of the present study should be verified using a larger patient group with varying conditions.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of td-1792, a novel glycopeptide-cephalosporin heterodimer antibiotic used against gram-positive bacteria, in a neutropenic murine thigh model.
AB  == td-1792 is a novel glycopeptide-cephalosporin heterodimer investigational antibiotic that displays potent bactericidal effects against clinically relevant  gram-positive organisms in vitro. the present studies evaluated the in vivo pharmacokinetics (pk) and pharmacodynamics (pd) of td-1792 in the neutropenic murine thigh infection animal model. td-1792, dosed subcutaneously (sc), produced dose-dependent reduction in the thigh bacterial burden of several organisms, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis (mssa, mrsa, msse, mrse, respectively), penicillin-susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), streptococcus  pyogenes, and vancomycin-intermediate-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (visa). in single-dose efficacy studies, the 1-log(10) cfu kill effective dose (ed(1-log  kill)) estimates for td-1792 ranged from 0.049 to 2.55 mg/kg of body weight administered sc, and the bacterial burden was reduced by up to 3 log(10) cfu/g from pretreatment values. against s. aureus atcc 33591 (mrsa), the total 24-h log(10) stasis dose (ed(stasis)) and ed(1-logkill) doses for td-1792 were 0.53 and 1.11 mg/kg/24 h, respectively, compared to 23.4 and 54.6 mg/kg/24 h for vancomycin, indicating that td-1762 is 44- to 49-fold more potent than vancomycin. pk-pd analysis of data from single-dose and dose-fractionation studies for mrsa (atcc 33591) demonstrated that the total-drug 24-h area under the concentration-time curve-to-mic ratio (auc/mic ratio) was the best predictor  of efficacy (r(2) = 0.826) compared to total-drug maximum plasma concentration of drug-to-mic ratio (cmax/mic ratio; r(2) = 0.715) and percent time that the total-drug plasma drug concentration remains above the mic (%time>mic; r(2) = 0.749). the magnitudes of the total-drug auc/mic ratios associated with net bacterial stasis, a 1-log(10) cfu reduction from baseline and near maximal effect, were 21.1, 37.2, and 51.8, respectively. pk-pd targets based on such data represent useful inputs for analyses to support dose selection decisions for clinical studies of patients.

TI  == bacterial colonization or infection in chronic sinusitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was the determination of bacteria present in maxillary and  ethmoid cavities in patients with chronic sinusitis and to correlate these findings with bacteria simultaneously present in their nasopharynx. the purpose of this correlation was to establish the role of bacteria found in chronically inflamed sinuses and to evaluate if the bacteria present colonized or infected sinus mucosa. nasopharyngeal and sinus swabs of 65 patients that underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery were cultivated and at the same time the presence of leukocytes were determined in each swab. the most frequently found bacteria in nasopharynx were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus spp., streptococcus viridans and streptococcus pneumoniae. maxillary or ethmoidal sinus swabs yielded bacterial growth in 47 (72.31%) patients. the most frequently found bacteria in sinuses were staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella spp. and streptococci (pneumoniae, viridans and spp.). the insignificant number of leukocytes was present in each sinus and nasopharyngeal swab. every published microbiology study of chronic sinusitis proved that sinus mucosa were colonized with bacteria and not infected, yet antibiotic therapy was discussed making no difference between infection and colonization. chronic sinusitis should be considered a chronic inflammatory condition rather than bacterial infection, so routine antibiotic therapy should be avoided. empiric antibiotic therapy should be prescribed only in cases when the acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis occurs and the antibiotics prescribed should aim the usual bacteria causing acute sinusitis. in case of therapy failure, antibiotics should be changed having in mind that under certain circumstances any bacteria colonizing sinus mucosa can cause acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.

TI  == a ten-year review of neonatal bloodstream infections in a tertiary private hospital in kenya.
AB  == introduction: neonatal mortality in developing countries is usually due to an infectious cause. the gold standard of investigation in developing countries is a positive blood culture. it is important to know the aetiology of neonatal bloodstream infections so that empiric treatment can be effective. methodology: we conducted a retrospective clinical audit over ten years between january 2000 until december 2009, looking at the aetiology of both early and late onset neonatal sepsis. we analysed data from 152 (23%) patient isolates out of 662 suspected cases of neonatal sepsis. results: our study revealed that gram-positive organisms were the predominant cause of both early and late onset sepsis; the common isolates were staphylococcus epidermidis (34%) and staphylococcus aureus (27%). there were no isolates of group b streptococcus. candida species was isolated only in patients with late onset sepsis (6.9%). bacterial isolates were relatively sensitive to the commonly used first- and second-line empiric antibiotics. conclusion: gram-positive organisms remain the major cause of neonatal bloodstream infections in our setup. the findings of this study will guide clinicians in prescribing the right empiric therapy in cases of  suspected neonatal sepsis before the definitive culture results are obtained.

TI  == extracellular dna in biofilms.
AB  == extracellular dna (edna) is an important biofilm component that was recently discovered. its presence has been initially observed in biofilms of pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, then enterococcus faecalis and staphylococci. autolysis is the common mechanism by which edna is released. in p. aeruginosa edna is generated by lysis of a bacterial subpopulation, under control of quorum sensing system. in e. faecalis autolysis proceeds in a fratricide mode, resulting from a process similar to necrosis of eukaryotic cells. in staphylococcus aureus autolysis originates by an altruistic  suicide, i.e., a programmed cell death similar to apoptosis of eukaryotic cells.  in s. aureus autolysis is mediated by murein hydrolase, while in s. epidermidis by the autolysin protein atle. in p. aeruginosa edna is located primarily in the  stalks of mushroom-shaped multicellular structures. in s. aureus the crucial role of edna in stabilizing biofilm is highlighted by the disgregating effect of dnase i. edna represents an important mechanism for horizontal gene transfer in bacteria. edna and other microbial structural motifs are recognized by the innate immune system via the tlr family of pattern recognition receptors (prrs).

TI  == microbiological profile of peritoneal dialysis peritonitis and predictors of hospitalization.
AB  == peritonitis, the major complication of peritoneal dialysis (pd), is associated with high morbidity and mortality. it is a major cause of hospitalization and transfer to hemodialysis. in the present study, we aimed to identify predictors of hospitalization in pd-related peritonitis and to examine its microbiology profile over time in our unit to determine the best therapeutic approach. we studied all peritonitis episodes that occurred in a 6-year period (january 1, 2004, to december 31, 2009), evaluating whether adequate treatment could be delivered on an outpatient basis. during the study period, 411 patients were on pd, and 229 peritonitis episodes were recorded in 91 patients. peritonitis were treated according to unit protocol. the average hospital stay was 11.6 +/- 6.6 days. we observed an increase of streptococcus (to 19.4% from 7.7%) and a stabilization of coagulase-negative staphylococcus, s. epidermidis, and s. aureus (from 9.5%, 22.6%, and 3.2% to 7.7%, 30.8%, and 3.8% respectively) peritonitis episodes. the main risk factors for hospitalization were fungal infection, poor 72-hour outcome, inability to perform self-care, and age greater than 80 years. we observed a decline in the incidence of peritonitis, and despite changes in its microbiology profile, no loss of sensitivity to antibiotics used was observed.

AB  == gentamicin is used in an ointment form for the treatment of skin infections. to investigate the effect of gentamicin used as an ointment, the antimicrobial susceptibilities against staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus pyogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from community and medical settings were studied and compared with other antibacterial agents such as fradiomycin, chloramphenicol, and bacitracin used as active ingredient for each ointment. gentamicin showed antibacterial activities for all standard bacteria tested, but fradiomycin and chloramphenicol showed no such activities for st. pyogenes and p. aeruginosa, respectively. bacitracin showed activity for  st. pyogenes only. the strains of staphylococci isolated from healthy people were highly susceptible to gentamicin, while 49.3% of the isolates from the patients with skin infections were resistant to gentamicin and 96.4% of the gentamicin-resistant staphylococci carried the aminoglycoside-resistance gene aaca-aphd. the growths of all strains tested, except for two strains of p. aeruginosa, were inhibited by close below 128 microg/ml of gentamicin. furthermore, the frequencies of spontaneous mutants resistant to gentamicin, fradiomycin, and chloramphenicol were each investigated using s. aureus, s. epidermidis, st. pyogenes, and p. aeruginosa. at doses of more than 32 microg/ml  of gentamicin, no resistant mutants in any of bacteria strains tested were obtained. the concentration of gentamicin on the skin was calculated at approximately 895 microg/ml at least when the commercially used 0.1% gentamicin ointment was applied to the skin. therefore, our study strongly indicates that the gentamicin ointment used has a potency of sufficiently inhibiting the growth  of bacteria, including gentamicin-resistant strains, which cause skin infections  in the community.

AB  == bacterial contamination of implanted devices is a common cause of their failure.  the aim of the present study was to assess the capability of electrochemical procedures to: (a) promote the formation of anatase on the surface of commercially pure grade 2 ti and ti grade 5 (ti6al4v) alloy; (b) inhibit in vitro biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis and oral plaque in vivo, (c) preserve favorable response of osteoblasts and fibroblasts to materials surfaces. ti grade 2 and ti grade 5 were respectively anodized at two different voltages: 90 and 130v for pure titanium; 100 and 120v for ti6al4v alloy. surface characterization was performed by scanning electron microscopy (sem) equipped with eds probe, laser profilometry and x-ray diffractometry. bacterial adhesion characterization was performed either in vitro and in vivo in patients. osteoblast and fibroblast response was evaluated by metabolic activity assessment. the higher voltage applied in the anodization treatment of pure titanium (130v) and ti6al4v alloy (120v) surfaces, compared to the untreated pure titanium and ti6al4v and to lower voltage treatments, resulted in a greater decrease in bacterial attachment and biofilm formation in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. in contrast, the high voltage treatments were found to promote  osteoblasts and fibroblasts proliferation. the observations indicated that the experimented high voltage anodization treatments may contribute to preserve the tissue integration and reduce bacteria colonization of titanium and titanium alloy for implantable applications.

TI  == [the characteristics of gram-positive bacteria isolated from skin lesions observed in ambulatory patients and the assessment of their susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs].
AB  == the bacterial skin and soft-tissue infections occur commonly and are characterized by more or less intensified changes within skin and subcutaneous tissue. the bacterial skin infections give rise to significant therapeutic problems associated with increasing resistance etiological agents of these infections to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. the aim of this study was to assess the distribution of various gram-positive microorganisms in skin lesion observed in ambulatory patients in a period from june 2005 to december 2006. there were 116 bacterial strains isolated and identified from clinical samples: staphylococcus aureus, coagulase - negative staphylococi (s.epidermidis, s. xylosus, s.capitis, s.saccharolyticus), propionobacterium acnes, streptococcus spp. (s.agalactiae, s.pyogenes) i corynebacterium spp. (c. striatum, c. amycolatum, c. aquaticum). in the further part of this study we analyzed a profile of their susceptibility to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics in relation  to drugs recommended for the empirical therapy. the resultant resistance patterns among the examined bacterial isolates are indicative of certain divergence between recommended empirical antibiotic therapy and actual antimicrobial susceptibility of many etiologic factors of skin and soft-tissue infections.

TI  == [urinary tract infection in patient after brain injury].
AB  == intruduction: one of the most important problems in treating patients after head  injury is urinary complication. the first place take urinary infections, which disturb rehabilitation process. clean intermittent catherization, bladder training and good care do not preserve infection. the purpose of our study was to present the frequency of urinary infections and main pathogens involved in these  infections among patients treated in the department of rehabilitation after head  injury. material and methods: we gathered microbiological tests and observations  from 398 patients (from 2 to 73 years old) after head injury treated in years 2003-2005. some of them survived head injury and some of them had also multiorgan injury. results: in 133 of them we found bladder and urethra infections, vesical  calculus in 11 cases. in one case we found prostatic abscessus and in one case urethroscrotal fistula. each patient had microbiological test of urine after he was admitted to the department. if the test was positive he had pharmacological treatment. in 157 urinary infections we selected proteus sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., enterococcus sp., acinetobacter sp. serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae and candida albicans was represented not so often. conclusions: the most frequent pathogens were: proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, e. coli. most of patients had positive microbiological tests at the admittance to our department. these complications extend the rehabilitation process and generate high costs. it is necessary to create standards of care of neuropathic bladder in patients after head injury.

TI  == fibrin- and collagen-based matrices attenuate inflammatory and procoagulant responses in human endothelial cell cultures exposed to staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == infective endocarditis (ie) remains a serious complication after heart valve replacement. autologous valves constructed by matrix-based tissue engineering are under investigation to increase biocompatibility. the impact of the underlying matrix on the risk to develop ie is not known. the ie is characterized by bacterial adhesion and subsequent interactions of disseminating bacteria with endothelial cells (ecs) and monocytes, evoking endothelial proinflammatory and procoagulant activity, leading to heart valve destruction. in the current study,  we, therefore, have seeded human ecs on a fibrin versus collagen gel matrix and,  at confluence, infected them with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguis, and staphylococcus epidermidis. especially sta. aureus infected ecs grown on fibrin (4.2% of the inoculum) and collagen (3.7%) matrices, more than on ecs grown on noncoated plates (1.2%; p<0.01). this was associated with higher monocyte adhesion (61%; p<0.01 on fibrin and 43%; p<0.05 on collagen) versus control cultures (30%), even at comparable ec surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular adhesion molecule-1. the collagen matrix attenuated the sta. aureus-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 expression  2.0-fold, compared with the noncoated control ecs. this reduction coincided with  a 4.2-5.0-fold reduction of the procoagulant activity, triggered in ecs grown on  noncoated wells, as a consequence of tissue factor (tf) expression by ecs, further stimulated by ec-bound monocytes. overall, moderate responses were seen on infection with str. sanguis and sta. epidermidis for both gel matrices. thus,  even when fibrin and collagen gel matrices equally increase bacterial adhesion, and subsequent monocyte adhesion to infected ecs, these matrices modulate ec responses to these stimuli, thus resulting in attenuated cytokine production and  attenuated adherent monocyte-dependent tf production by the ecs. further investigations will need to confirm whether also in vivo, ec-matrix interactions  can attenuate ec responses to bacteria and inflammatory cells to reduce ie at infected endovascular sites.

TI  == characterization of novel glycolipid antigens with an alpha-galactose epitope in  lactobacilli detected with rabbit anti-lactobacillus antisera and occurrence of antibodies against them in human sera.
AB  == anti-lactobacillus johnsonii (lj) antisera generated by immunization of rabbits with lj reacted with glyceroglycolipids in lj, i.e. dihexaosyl diacylglycerol (dh-dg), trihexaosyl dg (th-dg) and tetrahexaosyl dg (teth-dg), whose reactivities with antisera increased proportionally with longer carbohydrate chains of glycolipids. structural analyses of glycolipids from lj revealed that dh-dg was galalpha1-2glcalpha1-3'dg, and th-dg and teth-dg were novel derivatives of it with alpha-gal at the non-reducing terminal, i.e. galalpha1-6galalpha1-2glcalpha1-3'dg and galalpha1-6galalpha1-6galalpha1-2glcalpha1-3'dg, respectively. dh-dg was commonly present in several lactobacilli examined, but teth-dg was restricted to lj, l. intestinalis and l. reuteri, while the th-dgs from l. casei were glc1-6galalpha1-2glcalpha1-3'dg and an esterified derivative of it, glc1-6galalpha1-2glc(6-fatty acid)alpha1-3'dg, as reported in the literature. anti-lj antisera reacted with th-dg and esterified th-dg from l. casei to lesser  extents, but not at all with gentibiosyl dg from staphylococcus epidermidis or kojibiosyl dg from streptococcus salivalis or sphingoglycolipids containing alpha-gal residues. the major molecular species of glycolipids obtained from lactobacilli were 11-octadecenoic and 11,12-methylene-octadecanoic acids-containing ones. also, human igm antibodies against th-dg and teth-dg from  lj were detected in human sera, with various antibody titres, indicating that an  immune reaction to symbiotic lactobacilli occurs against their glycolipid antigens, th-dg and teth-dg.

TI  == typing of bacteriophages by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr to assess genetic diversity.
AB  == the recent boom in phage therapy and phage biocontrol requires the design of suitable cocktails of genetically different bacteriophages. the current methods for typing phages need significant quantities of purified dna, may require a priori genetic information and are cost and time consuming. we have evaluated the randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr technique to produce unique and reproducible band patterns from 26 different bacteriophages infecting staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, lactococcus lactis, escherichia coli, streptococcus thermophilus, bacillus subtilis and lactobacillus casei bacterial strains. initially, purified dna and phage suspensions of seven selected phages were used as a template. the conditions that were found to be optimal 8 mum of 10-mer primers, 3 mum magnesium oxalacetate and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. the rapd genomic fingerprints using a phage titer suspension higher than 10(9) pfu ml(-1) were highly reproducible. clustering by the pearson correlation coefficient and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages clustering algorithm correlated largely with genetically different phages infecting the same bacterial species, although closely related phages with a similar dna restriction pattern were indistinguishable. the results support the use of rapd-pcr for quick typing of phage isolates and preliminary assessment of  their genetic diversity bypassing tedious dna purification protocols and previous knowledge of their sequence.

TI  == foam sclerotherapy: investigating the need for sterile air.
AB  == background: sclerotherapy with foam is becoming increasingly popular for the treatment of varicose veins. there is no consensus on the necessity of sterile air or other gases to produce foam. objectives: to evaluate the potential risk of bacterial inoculation of polidocanol (pol) foam using room air and the antimicrobial properties of polidocanol. materials and methods: the amount of airborne microorganisms was quantitatively measured. four bacterial strains were  tested for susceptibility to polidocanol: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: air measurements varied as a result of air movement and the number of people in the room. although the risk of introducing one colony-formin unit can be calculated as less than 1 in 330, the clinical relevance is still to be determined. no inhibition of bacterial growth was achieved with pol in of any of the tested strains. conclusions: foam sclerotherapy with pol prepared in a standard treatment room is a safe procedure without the risk of introducing a severe bacterial complication. the use of sterile air, nitrogen, or carbon dioxide is unnecessary and will make foam sclerotherapy with pol more elaborate and more expensive to use.

TI  == crystal structures of staphylococcus epidermidis mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase bound to inhibitory analogs reveal new insight into substrate binding and catalysis.
AB  == the polyisoprenoid compound undecaprenyl phosphate is required for biosynthesis of cell wall peptidoglycans in gram-positive bacteria, including pathogenic enterococcus, streptococcus, and staphylococcus spp. in these organisms, the mevalonate pathway is used to produce the precursor isoprenoid, isopentenyl 5-diphosphate. mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (mdd) catalyzes formation of  isopentenyl 5-diphosphate in an atp-dependent irreversible reaction and is therefore an attractive target for inhibitor development that could lead to new antimicrobial agents. to facilitate exploration of this possibility, we report the crystal structure of staphylococcus epidermidis mdd (1.85 a resolution) and,  to the best of our knowledge, the first structures of liganded mdd. these structures include mdd bound to the mevalonate 5-diphosphate analogs diphosphoglycolyl proline (2.05 a resolution) and 6-fluoromevalonate diphosphate  (fmvapp; 2.2 a resolution). comparison of these structures provides a physical basis for the significant differences in k(i) values observed for these inhibitors. inspection of enzyme/inhibitor structures identified the side chain of invariant ser(192) as making potential contributions to catalysis. significantly, ser --> ala substitution of this side chain decreases k(cat) by approximately 10(3)-fold, even though binding interactions between fmvapp and this mutant are similar to those observed with wild type mdd, as judged by the 2.1 a cocrystal structure of s192a with fmvapp. comparison of microbial mdd structures with those of mammalian counterparts reveals potential targets at the  active site periphery that may be exploited to selectively target the microbial enzymes. these studies provide a structural basis for previous observations regarding the mdd mechanism and inform future work toward rational inhibitor design.

TI  == hiv-infected women of burkina faso: a "reservoir" of mycoplasma infection.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this work was to assess the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (bv) and genital mycoplasma colonization in 251 hiv-positive  compared to 200 hiv-negative women at the maternal and child health (mch) service of saint camille medical center ouagadougou (burkina faso). methodology: after revealing the cervix with a speculum, we collected swabs of vaginal discharge for the detection of pathogenic bacteria. results: among hiv-positive and hiv-negative women, we identified respectively: mycoplasma hominis (16.7% versus  5.5%); ureaplasma urealyticum (16.3% versus 0.0%); co-infection m. hominis with u. urealyticum (13.14% versus 0.0%); candida albicans (21.11% versus 41.5%); e. coli (9.96% versus 4.0%); and the presence of abundant vaginal discharge (27.5% versus 5.0%) respectively. the nugent's score, utilized for the diagnosis of bv,  was significantly higher in hiv-positive women (p < 0.001) associated with poor vaginal hygiene practices (p < 0.01) and no use of condoms (p < 0.01). enterobacter, klebsiella pneumonia, klebsiella oxitocica, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, trichomonas vaginalis, and gardnerella vaginalis were also isolated, but in a low prevalence  ranging from 0% to 5%. conclusion: these results demonstrate that the hiv-positive women of burkina faso are frequently affected by bv and represent a  reservoir for mycoplasma infection. since these germs can lead to sterility and premature delivery, it is important to develop a policy of screening.

TI  == changing trends in antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens, 1985-2005: a study from a medical center in northern taiwan.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance is a major health problem worldwide. we evaluated the antimicrobial resistance trends of 16 major bacterial pathogens at  a tertiary medical center in northern taiwan. methods: we conducted a retrospective review of annual summary documents for antimicrobial susceptibility of clinically isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from 1985 to 2005. the numbers of isolates and susceptibilities were calculated for three 7-year periods: first period, 1985-1991; second period, 1992-1998; and the third  period, 1999-2005. results: during the 21-year period, 219,715 bacterial pathogens were identified. a significant increase in incidence over time was found for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s epidermidis, penicillin-nonsusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, erythromycin-resistant s pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, cefotaxime/ceftriaxone-resistant escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, and  imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. additionally, a significant increase  in ciprofloxacin resistance rates over time from 1996 to 2005 was noted for e coli, enterobacter cloacae, and a baumannii (through 1997 to 2005). however, a significant decrease in erythromycin resistance rate with time from 1999 to 2005  was found for groups a and b streptococci, non-a, b, d streptococci, and s pneumoniae. conclusion: resistance to antimicrobial agents increased rapidly in the past two decades in taiwan and has become very common in major bacterial pathogens. continuous enforcement of policies to limit use of antimicrobial agents and active surveillance of antimicrobial resistance through a nationwide system are both warranted.

TI  == impact of monocytic cells on recovery of uncultivable bacteria from atherosclerotic lesions.
AB  == objective: epidemiological evidence suggests that infections may contribute to atherogenesis. however, with the exception of chlamydophila pneumoniae, cultivable bacteria have not been recovered from atherosclerotic lesions. therefore, we aimed at developing an approach to recover uncultivable bacteria from atherectomy tissues. methods: we cultured homogenates from atherectomy specimens from seven nonseptic patients undergoing surgery for arterial obstruction either alone or together with thp-1 monocyte-like cells. we performed 16s rdna analysis, biochemical tests, random amplification of polymorphic dna pcr analysis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) and immunohistofluorescence to identify the cultivated bacteria. wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to determine whether thp-1 treatment yielded a higher number of isolates than did the untreated controls. results: we recovered more bacteria from cocultures of atherectomy specimens with thp-1 cells than atherectomy specimens cultured alone. on average, tissue homogenates incubated with thp-1 cells versus control yielded 124 vs. 22 colony-forming units, a median of 140 vs. 7, respectively (p = 0.02). we recovered 872 isolates of limited number of species, including propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus infantis and the fastidious anaerobe porphyromonas gingivalis, and  confirmed its presence in tissue using double immunofluorescence imaging. qpcr demonstrated the presence of >/=3.5 x 10(3) p. gingivalis genomes per gram of atheromatous tissue. conclusions: these results indicate that viable previously uncultivable bacterial species are present within atheromas. our results suggest  revisiting the hypothesis that infections may have a causative role in atherosclerotic inflammation and have implications for research regarding novel diagnostics and treatments for cardiovascular disease.

TI  == ozone in dentistry: microbiological effects of gas action depending on the method and the time of application using the ozonytron device. experimental study.
AB  == introduction: bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal activity of ozone is generally known and has been exploited for years in industry and medicine. ozone  therapy became an inherent element of the treatment of infection in such fields as surgery, dermatology, cosmetics, and dentistry. ozone is a gas, so it penetrates very well even into such tissues and spaces that are not easily accessible. thanks to the property of deep penetration and long ozone presence in tissues after treatment, a long-lasting bactericidal effect is achieved. the action of oxygen radicals is, however, not neutral for the human organism, therefore the use of an appropriate procedure and therapy algorithms is essential. material and methods: we decided to confirm the effect of antibacterial activity of ozone applied by means of the ozonytron device (made by biozonix) on model strains of streptococcus salivarius, pneumonia, pyogenes, and  agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, using two application patterns developed by us. results: we found a statistically significant difference in the size of zones of inhibited bacterial growth on all  media depending on the time of action of ozone. in the present paper, the bactericidal activity of ozone in relation to bacterial strains that are most frequently isolated from the oral cavity was confirmed. what is more, two models  of application of the gas on the infected medium were compared. conclusion: research on the use of ozone in combatting bacteria typical for dental diseases has shown that the gas has an oxidizing effect on these bacteria and is bactericidal.

AB  == due to technical problems, biofilm biomasses are difficult to be precisely determined. one reliable strategy is based on the colorimetry of formazan compounds derived from tetrazolium salt reduction. xtt presents some desirable properties that make the biofilm measurements easier. however, cells entrapped within the extracellular matrixes normally do not metabolize the tetrazolium equally, leading to underestimation of cell contents. this study evaluated the effectiveness of d-glutamine, a plerotic substrate of tricarboxilic acid cycle (tac), as inducer of xtt reduction. the metabolic activities of aerobic and anaerobic 48 h-old monospecific biofilms of pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc(r)27853,  klebsiella pneumoniae atcc(r)13883, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc(r)12228, streptococcus mutans atcc(r)25175, and candida albicans sc5314 were evaluated. results showed that d-glutamine 50 mm (for p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and s. epidermidis) and 25 mm (for s. mutans and c. albicans) may enhance the detection  of soluble formazan in a significant manner, what becomes the xtt reduction assay more robust.

TI  == bacteriological aetiology and antimicrobial treatment of pleural empyema.
AB  == background: our aims were to describe the aetiologies of culture-positive pleural infections and to evaluate the choice of empiric antimicrobial treatment regimens according to antimicrobial sensitivity, and to evaluate the possible influence of this on outcome. methods: all cases over a 9-y period were identified from 3 hospitals using the laboratory databases of the clinical microbiology departments, and were verified by evaluating the medical records. results: we identified 291 isolates in pleural fluid cultures from 158 patients. these included viridans streptococci (25%), staphylococcus aureus (18%), anaerobic bacteria (17%), enterobacteriaceae (12%), staphylococcus epidermidis (10%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (7%), with differences between nosocomial and community-acquired infections. the mortality (overall 27%) was highest among the  patients with enterobacteriaceae (50%) and s. aureus (36%) infections, and in patients with mixed infections (34%). the actual empiric treatment or the recommended penicillin plus metronidazole had low antimicrobial coverage (49%) compared to the proposed cefuroxime plus metronidazole (78%). thoracentesis was often delayed (median 2 days). the adequacy of empiric antimicrobial therapy was  independently correlated with mortality (odds ratio 0.43, 95% confidence interval 0.30-0.62). conclusions: the early diagnosis of pleural infection could be optimized. in this north-european patient population, we suggest that the recommended empiric antimicrobial treatment be changed to cefuroxime plus metronidazole for community-acquired and nosocomial infections.

TI  == bacterial growth kinetics in acd-a apheresis platelets: comparison of plasma and  pas iii storage.
AB  == background: our objective was to determine the growth kinetics of bacteria in leukoreduced apheresis platelets (lr-ap) in a platelet (plt) additive solution (pas; intersol, fenwal, inc.) compared to lr-ap stored in plasma. study design and methods: hyperconcentrated, double-dose lr-ap were collected from healthy donors with a separator (amicus, fenwal, inc.). lr-ap were evenly divided, intersol was added to half (65% intersol:35% plasma [pas]), and plts in autologous plasma were used for a paired control (pl). bacteria were inoculated into each lr-ap pas/pl pair (0.5-1.6 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml), and bacterial growth was followed for up to 7 days. time to the end of the lag phase, doubling times, maximum concentration (conc-max), and time to maximum concentration (time-max) were estimated. results: streptococcus viridans did not  grow to detectable levels in either pas or pl units. the other bacteria had no significant overall difference in the conc-max (p = 0.47) or time-max (p = 0.7) between pl and pas lr-ap; pl had a 0.14 hours faster doubling rate (p = 0.023); and pas had a 4.7 hours shorter lag time (p = 0.016). conclusion: we observed that five index organisms will grow in lr-ap stored in a 35%:65% ratio of plasma  to intersol where initial bacterial concentrations are 0.5 to 1.6 cfus/ml. the more rapid initiation of log-phase growth for bacteria within a pas storage environment resulted in a bacterial concentration up to 4 logs higher in the pas  units compared to the plasma units at 24 hours, but with no difference in the conc-max. this may present an early bacterial detection advantage for pas-stored  plts.

TI  == limitations of current antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis.
AB  == bacterial conjunctivitis is a common ocular infection that is generally treated empirically with a broad-spectrum antibiotic. the more common pathogens causing bacterial conjunctivitis include staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, and moraxella species. several antibiotics traditionally used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis are no longer widely prescribed because of increased bacterial resistance and/or safety  concerns. the introduction of the fluoroquinolone class of anti-infectives offered effective and better tolerated treatment options. nonetheless, successful therapy for bacterial conjunctivitis continues to be limited by several factors.  a primary concern is the development of bacterial resistance that may be impacted not only by widespread antibiotic use but also by antibacterial pharmacokinetics, such as maintenance of insufficient bactericidal concentrations at the site of infection. in addition, poor adherence to prescribed regimens that require frequent administration, along with undesirable adverse events, affects the development of bacterial resistance and the success of treatment regimens. this article reviews current antibacterial agents used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis, factors that limit their successful use in treatment, and options for future development of more effective topical ophthalmic anti-infective agents.

TI  == bactericidal effects of non-thermal argon plasma in vitro, in biofilms and in the animal model of infected wounds.
AB  == non-thermal (low-temperature) physical plasma is under intensive study as an alternative approach to control superficial wound and skin infections when the effectiveness of chemical agents is weak due to natural pathogen or biofilm resistance. the purpose of this study was to test the individual susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria to non-thermal argon plasma and to measure the effectiveness of plasma treatments against bacteria in biofilms and on wound surfaces. overall, gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible to plasma treatment than gram-positive bacteria. for the gram-negative bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cenocepacia and escherichia coli, there were no survivors among the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. the susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria was species- and strain-specific. streptococcus pyogenes was the most resistant with 17 % survival of the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. staphylococcus aureus had a strain-dependent resistance with 0 and 10 % survival from 10(5) c.f.u. of the sa  78 and atcc 6538 strains, respectively. staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecium had medium resistance. non-ionized argon gas was not bactericidal. biofilms partly protected bacteria, with the efficiency of protection dependent on biofilm thickness. bacteria in deeper biofilm layers survived better after the plasma treatment. a rat model of a superficial slash wound infected with p. aeruginosa and the plasma-sensitive staphylococcus aureus  strain sa 78 was used to assess the efficiency of argon plasma treatment. a 10 min treatment significantly reduced bacterial loads on the wound surface. a 5-day course of daily plasma treatments eliminated p. aeruginosa from the plasma-treated animals 2 days earlier than from the control ones. a statistically significant increase in the rate of wound closure was observed in plasma-treated  animals after the third day of the course. wound healing in plasma-treated animals slowed down after the course had been completed. overall, the results show considerable potential for non-thermal argon plasma in eliminating pathogenic bacteria from biofilms and wound surfaces.

TI  == microbial communities in the tonsils of healthy pigs.
AB  == the tonsils of mammals such as humans and pigs are colonized with an extensive microbiota and are frequently the site for asymptomatic carriage of bacterial pathogens. the goal of this study was to determine the composition of the microbial community of the tonsils in healthy pigs. tonsils were collected from eight pigs from two different healthy herds. samples of the tonsils from each pig were used for culture dependent and culture independent identification of the microbial community. aerobic cultivation identified pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus suis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and escherichia coli from >/= 50% of the pigs in both herds. for culture independent studies, microbial community members were identified by 16s rrna sequences using the ribosomal database project pipeline programs developed at michigan state university. dominant genera identified by 16s rrna analysis in pigs from both herds included actinobacillus,  haemophilus, pasteurella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, bacteroides, and prevotella. these genera were detected in nearly every pig regardless of herd. in contrast, there was an asymmetric distribution of minor genera between the two herds, suggesting herd-specific differences in the microbial communities. in addition, we demonstrated primer bias between two frequently used forward primers when targeting the tonsillar community. our results suggest that the major bacterial community members found in porcine tonsils are the same regardless of herd, while the minor species are unique to each herd. this is the first analysis using 16s rrna sequence libraries of the composition of microbial communities in  the porcine upper respiratory tract.

TI  == use of quantitative broad-based polymerase chain reaction for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == background: conventional laboratory diagnosis of bacterial meningitis based on microscopy followed by culture is time-consuming and has only moderate sensitivity. objectives: the objective was to define the limit of detection (lod), analytic specificity, and performance characteristics of a broad-based quantitative multiprobe polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay for rapid bacterial detection and simultaneous pathogen-specific identification in patients with suspected meningitis. methods: a pcr algorithm consisting of initial broad-based  detection of eubacteriales by a universal probe, followed by pathogen identification using either pathogen-specific probes or gram-typing probes, was employed to detect pathogens. the 16s rrna gene, which contains both conserved and variable regions, was chosen as the target. pathogen-specific probes were designed for streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli,  and listeria monocytogenes. gram-positive and -negative typing probes were designed based on conserved regions across all eubacteria. the lod and time to detection were assessed by dilutional mocked-up samples. a total of 108 convenience cerebrospinal fluid (csf) clinical samples obtained from the johns hopkins hospital (jhh) microbiology laboratory were tested, and results were compared with hospital microbiologic culture reports. results: the lod of the assay ranged from 10(1) to 10(2) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. pathogen-specific probes showed no cross-reactivity with other organisms. time to detection was 3 hours. in clinical specimens, the universal probe correctly detected 16 of 22 culture-positive clinical specimens (sensitivity = 72.7%; 95% confidence interval [ci] = 49.8% to 89.3%), which were all correctly characterized by either pathogen-specific or gram-typing probes. adjusted sensitivity after removing probable microbiologic laboratory contaminants was 88.9% (95% ci = 65.3% to 98.6%). the universal probe was negative for 86 of 86 culture-negative specimens. conclusions: a broad-based multiprobe pcr assay demonstrated strong analytic performance characteristics. findings from a pilot clinical study showed promise  in translation to human subjects, supporting potential utility of the assay as an adjunct to traditional diagnostics for early identification of bacterial meningitis.

TI  == prevalence and clinical outcome of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis: a prospective observational study in  central part of croatia.
AB  == spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (sbp) is a serious complication of liver cirrhosis and is defined as infected ascites in the absence of any recognizable secondary cause of infection. the aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence, incidence, pathogens and clinical outcome of sbp. this prospective observational study included 108 cirrhotic patients with ascites treated during 18 months. patients were divided into two groups according to diagnostic criteria of sbp: sbp group (n=23) and non-sbp group (n=85). differences in clinical outcomes between the two groups were analyzed, including mortality rate, incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, bacteremia/sepsis and frequency of rehospitalization. the pathogens responsible for sbp were analyzed in sbp group.  the prevalence of sbp was 21% and incidence 14.1% per year. statistically significant between-group differences were recorded in mortality (26% vs. 4.7%; p=0.017), incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (39% vs. 11.7%; p=0.015) and rehospitalization frequency (47.8% vs. 20%; p=0.05). the incidence of sepsis following episode of gastrointestinal bleeding was similar in both groups (55.5%  vs. 50%; p=0.892). the following pathogens were responsible for sbp: escherichia  coli (n=7), mrsa (n=2), acinetobacter spp. (n=2), staphylococcus aureus (n=1), streptococcus spp. (n=1), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=1) and enterococcus faecalis (n=1). as indicated by study results, the incidence and mortality of sbp were high. patients with liver cirrhosis and gastrointestinal hemorrhage were found to be at a high risk of developing sepsis with or without clinically proven sbp. the pathogens responsible for sbp were mostly gram-negative microorganisms;  however, there were also a significant proportion of gram-positive microorganisms and hospital infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. study results suggested the spectrum of pathogens to change due to the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria within the hospital setting.

TI  == [the role of microflora in etiology of chronic tonsillitis].
AB  == analysis of the results of a bacteriological study involving 218 patients with various forms of chronic tonsillitis (ct) has demonstrated that they were significantly different in terms of the seeding rate of beta-hemolytic group a streptococci (bhas). specifically, these microorganisms were detected in patients with paratonsillar abscess 2.5 times as frequently as in those with uncomplicated forms of chronic tonsilitis. in other words, the former group is at risk of developing such concomitant diseases as post-streptococcal rheumocarditis, glomerulonephritis, and polyarthritis. it was shown that bhas are capable of forming a biological film at the surface of abiogenic carriers in vitro which may be a principal cause of chronic and recurring tonsillitis.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == periorbital and orbital cellulitis: a 10-year review of hospitalized children.
AB  == purpose: periorbital cellulitis is often difficult to distinguish from orbital cellulitis, which is a potentially lethal infection involving the contents of the orbit. a delay in diagnosis and appropriate treatment may result in serious complications. we studied the predisposing factors, microbiologic data, clinical  features, complications, and treatment of periorbital and orbital cellulitis in childhood. methods: eighty-three medical records of patients (mean age 3.7 +/- 3.1 years) admitted to the department of pediatrics with a diagnosis of periorbital or orbital cellulitis during the 10-year period january 1997 to december 2007 were retrospectively studied. results: in this series, periorbital  cellulitis occurred more frequently (83%) than orbital cellulitis (17%). of the children with periorbital cellulitis, 85% were younger than 5 years of age, while 62% of the children with orbital cellulitis were older than 5 years of age. the most common predisposing factors in periorbital cellulitis were upper respiratory infection (68%) and trauma to the eyelids (20%), while sinusitis was more frequently associated with orbital cellulitis (79%). blood and skin cultures were usually negative. the most common isolated pathogens were staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus epidermidis. forty-five of the 83 children were treated with intravenous ceftriaxone + clindamycin (mean duration 8.6 +/- 5.5 days). intravenous antibiotics alone was an effective management in most of the patients, but a small proportion (6%) required surgical intervention. conclusions: upper respiratory infection and sinusitis are the most important predisposing factors for periocular infection. streptococcus species are the predominant causative agents. both diseases can usually be successfully treated with intravenous antibiotics, but some patients may require surgery to control extensive infection.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of topical skin pharmaceuticals - an in vitro study.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of currently  available topical skin pharmaceuticals against candida albicans, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pyogenes. the agar dilution assay was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration for cream formulations and their active substances. corticosteroid  formulations with the antiseptics clioquinol or halquinol were active against all microbes. the hydrogen peroxide formulation was primarily active against staphylococci. clotrimazole, miconazole and econazole showed an effect against staphylococci in addition to their effect on c. albicans. in contrast, terbinafine had no antibacterial effect. fusidic acid was active against staphylococci, with slightly weaker activity against s. pyogenes and no activity  against c. albicans or e. coli. in summary, some topical skin pharmaceuticals have broad antimicrobial activity in vitro, clioquinol and halquinol being the most diverse. in limited superficial skin infection topical treatment can be an alternative to systemic antibiotics and should be considered. with the global threat of multi-resistant bacteria there is a need for new, topical, non-resistance-promoting, antimicrobial preparations for the treatment of skin infections.

TI  == activation of tlr2 by a small molecule produced by staphylococcus epidermidis increases antimicrobial defense against bacterial skin infections.
AB  == production of antimicrobial peptides by epithelia is an essential defense against infectious pathogens. in this study we evaluated whether the commensal microorganism staphylococcus epidermidis may enhance production of antimicrobial  peptides by keratinocytes and thus augment skin defense against infection. exposure of cultured undifferentiated human keratinocytes to a sterile nontoxic small molecule of <10 kda from s. epidermidis conditioned culture medium (secm),  but not similar preparations from other bacteria, enhanced human beta-defensin 2  (hbd2) and hbd3 mrna expression and increased the capacity of cell lysates to inhibit the growth of group a streptococcus (gas) and s. aureus. partial gene silencing of hbd3 inhibited this antimicrobial action. this effect was relevant in vivo as administration of secm to mice decreased susceptibility to infection by gas. toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) was important to this process as a tlr2-neutralizing antibody blocked induction of hbds 2 and 3, and tlr2-deficient  mice did not show induction of mbd4. taken together, these findings reveal a potential use for normal commensal bacterium s. epidermidis to activate tlr2 signaling and induce antimicrobial peptide expression, thus enabling the skin to  mount an enhanced response to pathogens.

TI  == bactericidal activity of besifloxacin against staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == objectives: besifloxacin is a novel fluoroquinolone that was recently approved for topical treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. the compound was shown to be active in vitro against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including isolates resistant to other antibacterials. here, the bactericidal activity of besifloxacin was evaluated against the most common bacterial conjunctivitis pathogens. methods: mic, mbc and time-kill experiments with besifloxacin and comparators were performed according to clsi guidelines. quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) were sequenced using standard pcr-based techniques. results: mic and mbc data indicated that besifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against staphylococcus aureus (n = 30), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 15) and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 35), while  all fluoroquinolones were highly active against haemophilus influenzae (n = 40).  besifloxacin mbc:mic ratios were < or = 4 for 97.5% of all isolates tested (n = 120). all fluoroquinolones tested, as well as tobramycin, were bactericidal, while azithromycin was bactericidal against s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae, but  bacteriostatic against the staphylococci. time-kill assays with all four species  showed that besifloxacin caused > or = 1000-fold killing within 2 h for 11 of 12  isolates. only one isolate treated with moxifloxacin and three ciprofloxacin-treated isolates achieved the same level of bactericidal activity under the same conditions. unlike the comparator fluoroquinolones, besifloxacin maintained a high potency and bactericidal activity even against strains that contained multiple mutations in the genes encoding dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv. conclusions: overall, besifloxacin demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against the four major human pathogens tested here, including isolates that showed in vitro resistance to other fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, macrolides or aminoglycosides.

TI  == new lipoglycopeptides: a comparative review of dalbavancin, oritavancin and telavancin.
AB  == dalbavancin, oritavancin and telavancin are semisynthetic lipoglycopeptides that  demonstrate promise for the treatment of patients with infections caused by multi-drug-resistant gram-positive pathogens. each of these agents contains a heptapeptide core, common to all glycopeptides, which enables them to inhibit transglycosylation and transpeptidation (cell wall synthesis). modifications to the heptapeptide core result in different in vitro activities for the three semisynthetic lipoglycopeptides. all three lipoglycopeptides contain lipophilic side chains, which prolong their half-life, help to anchor the agents to the cell membrane and increase their activity against gram-positive cocci. in addition to  inhibiting cell wall synthesis, telavancin and oritavancin are also able to disrupt bacterial membrane integrity and increase membrane permeability; oritavancin also inhibits rna synthesis. enterococci exhibiting the vana phenotype (resistance to both vancomycin and teicoplanin) are resistant to both dalbavancin and telavancin, while oritavancin retains activity. dalbavancin, oritavancin and telavancin exhibit activity against vanb vancomycin-resistant enterococci. all three lipoglycopeptides demonstrate potent in vitro activity against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis regardless of their  susceptibility to meticillin, as well as streptococcus spp. both dalbavancin and  telavancin are active against vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa), but display poor activity versus vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa). oritavancin is active against both visa and vrsa. telavancin displays greater activity against clostridium spp. than dalbavancin, oritavancin or vancomycin. the half-life of dalbavancin ranges from 147 to 258 hours, which allows for once-weekly dosing, the half-life of oritavancin of 393 hours may allow for one dose per treatment course, while telavancin requires daily administration. dalbavancin and telavancin exhibit concentration-dependent activity and auc/mic (area under the concentration-time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration ratio) is the pharmacodynamic parameter that best describes their activities. oritavancin's activity is also considered concentration-dependent in vitro, while in vivo its activity has been described by both concentration and time-dependent  models; however, auc/mic is the pharmacodynamic parameter that best describes its activity. clinical trials involving patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis) have demonstrated that all three agents are as efficacious as comparators. the most common adverse effects reported with dalbavancin use included nausea, diarrhoea and constipation, while injection site reactions, fever and diarrhoea were commonly observed with oritavancin therapy. patients administered telavancin frequently reported nausea, taste disturbance and insomnia. to date, no drug-drug interactions have been identified for dalbavancin, oritavancin or telavancin. all three of these agents are promising alternatives for the treatment of csssis in cases where more economical options such as vancomycin have been ineffective, in cases of reduced vancomycin susceptibility or resistance, or where vancomycin use has been associated with adverse events.

TI  == drug susceptibility and clonality of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis in hospitalized patients with hematological malignancies.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the clonal relatedness and drug susceptibility of streptococcus epidermidis isolated from hematological patients. methods: all s. epidermidis isolated from hematological patients who developed bloodstream infections between june 2005 and december 2007 were included. the clonal relationship was tested by means of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) analysis. results: fifteen methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse) isolates were examined from patients' blood culture samples. two subgroups that differed approximately by 40% in their pfge banding were identified. in clinical practice, two cases were cured with cephalosporin only, thus demonstrating sensitivity of the strains to beta-lactam antibiotics. conclusions: our results represent two significant findings. one is the major capability of mrse to colonize patients. the other is that some mrse isolates proved to be sensitive to clindamycin, minocycline, and cephalosporin, so that using antibiotics to which mrse is sensitive as first-line therapy can avoid the need for vancomycin in clinical settings.

TI  == a survey of veterinary hospitals in nigeria for the presence of some bacterial organisms of nosocomial and zoonotic potential.
AB  == this study was undertaken to determine the type and estimate the prevalence of bacterial organisms on contact surfaces of five close-to-patient facilities in three veterinary health care settings within the sokoto metropolis of north-western nigeria. a total of 30 samples (10 from each setting) were collected and analysed using culture, microscopy and biochemical testing. bacterial species isolated from samples in this study included the following: bacillus sp. (27.3%), staphylococcus aureus (15.9%), listeria sp. (13.6%), streptococcus sp. (11.4%), salmonella sp. (6.8%), escherichia coli (4.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (4.5%), citrobacter sp. (2.3%), klebsiella sp. (2.3%), lactobacillus sp. (2.3%), micrococcus sp. (2.3%), pasteurella sp. (2.3%), proteus sp. (2.3%), and yersinia sp. (2.3%). a higher percentage (64.3%) of the total bacterial isolates were zoonotic in nature and hence of public health significance. some pathogens have the potential of nosocomial spread. in this study, we seek to establish the first evidence of bacterial presence in the major veterinary health care settings in the sokoto region of north-western nigeria. of particular interest is the hypothesis, which has not previously been formally tested, that nosocomial infections are especially likely to be implicated in both animals and occupational diseases in nigeria. it was suggested that some of these isolates were associated with the risk of nosocomial and zoonotic infections and  hence draws attention to the need to rigorously employ standard veterinary precautions as part of the hospital's infection control programme in an attempt to protect both patients and staff from infections.

TI  == common wound colonizers in patients with epidermolysis bullosa.
AB  == one of the major morbidities of patients with epidermolysis bullosa is the tendency to develop chronic wounds, which predisposes them to multiple complications including life-threatening infections, failure to thrive, and squamous cell carcinomas. chronic wounds frequently become colonized with bacteria, and we sought to identify the most common microorganisms isolated on cultures from patients with epidermolysis bullosa. we conducted a retrospective review of positive wound, nasal, and blood cultures, including bacterial, fungal  and viral, in 30 patients with epidermolysis bullosa. staphylococcus sp., streptococcus sp., diptheroids, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida sp. were the  most commonly isolated microorganisms in wound cultures from our epidermolysis bullosa patients. two patients had viral cultures that grew herpes simplex virus  type-1. bacterial colonization of chronic wounds can lead to infections and may also impact wound healing. results from this study provide data on which to base  empiric antibiotic choice in patients with epidermolysis bullosa when needed and  may be useful in planning strategies for decolonization and improved wound healing in this population.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cem-101, a new fluoroketolide, was determined against gram-positive organisms with various macrolide susceptibility profiles. experiments for determination of the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs), timed killing, single-step and multistep mutation rates, the erythromycin induction of resistance, postantibiotic effect (pae), and drug interactions were  performed for cem-101; and the results were compared to those obtained with telithromycin, macrolides, and lincosamides. the mbcs of cem-101 remained lower overall than those of telithromycin, and cem-101 displayed a 2-fold greater potency than the ketolide. timed-killing curve testing showed that cem-101 had greater bactericidal activity than telithromycin (a >or=3-log(10)-cfu/ml decrease in the initial inoculum at 24 h) against the staphylococcal isolates tested. the  propensity of cem-101 to cause resistance was low, as determined from the rates of resistance determined in single-step mutational studies (<10(-8) or 10(-9)). in multipassaging studies, mutants of two strains (both of which were usa300 isolates) resistant to cem-101 emerged. that number was comparable to the number  resistant to clindamycin but less than the number resistant to telithromycin. erythromycin induced cem-101 resistance in staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, similar to telithromycin; however, in seven of eight beta-hemolytic streptococci, cem-101 resistance induction was not observed. cem-101 showed a significant concentration- and exposure-dependent pae against the strains tested, with the values ranging from 2.3 to 6.1 h for gram-positive organisms (these times were longer than those for telithromycin). no antagonism was found in synergy analyses, with enhanced inhibition being most noted for combinations with cem-101 and ceftriaxone, gentamicin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. overall, this new antimicrobial agent (cem-101) showed good antimicrobial characteristics compared with those of the agents in its class and exhibited measured parameter values similar or superior to those of utilized comparators, indicating that cem-101 warrants further clinical evaluation.

TI  == staphylococcus epidermidis antimicrobial delta-toxin (phenol-soluble modulin-gamma) cooperates with host antimicrobial peptides to kill group a streptococcus.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides play an important role in host defense against pathogens.  recently, phenol-soluble modulins (psms) from staphylococcus epidermidis (s. epidermidis) were shown to interact with lipid membranes, form complexes, and exert antimicrobial activity. based on the abundance and innocuity of the cutaneous resident s. epidermidis, we hypothesized that their psms contribute to  host defense. here we show that s. epidermidis delta-toxin (psmgamma) is normally present in the epidermis and sparsely in the dermis of human skin using immunohistochemistry. synthetic delta-toxin interacted with neutrophil extracellular traps (nets) and colocalized with cathelicidin while also inducing  net formation in human neutrophils. in antimicrobial assays against group a streptococcus (gas), delta-toxin cooperated with cramp, hbd2, and hbd3. in whole  blood, addition of delta-toxin exerted a bacteriostatic effect on gas, and in nets, delta-toxin increased their killing capacity against this pathogen. coimmunoprecipitation and tryptophan spectroscopy demonstrated direct binding of  delta-toxin to host antimicrobial peptides ll-37, cramp, hbd2, and hbd3. finally, in a mouse wound model, gas survival was reduced (along with mip-2 cytokine levels) when the wounds were pretreated with delta-toxin. thus, these data suggest that s. epidermidis-derived delta-toxin cooperates with the host-derived  antimicrobial peptides in the innate immune system to reduce survival of an important human bacterial pathogen.

TI  == [antibiotics in the treatment of bacterial infections of the central nervous system].
AB  == introduction: the aim of antimicrobial treatment of infections in the central nervous system (cns) is to eradicate the bacterial cause. the choice of antibiotics should take into account its activity, pharmacokinetic properties, results of clinical trials, side effects and total treatment cost. despite the fact that pharmacokinetics affects the ability of antibiotics to penetrate the blood brain barrier (bbb) significantly, the most important factor is that meningeal inflammation increases the permeability barrier. the selected antibiotic should have a bactericidal action and the achieved liquor concentration should be high above the minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc).  antibiotic therapy: empirical antibiotic therapy should be started immediate after taking the sample to make the etiological diagnosis, taking into account the patient ' age. previous diseases and immune status. the specific or targeted  antibiotic treatment is carried out according to the microbiological sensitivity  test of antimicrobial agents isolated. whenever possible, the preference should be given to a monotherapy except when it comes to a cause requiring synergistic combination of antibiotics. the length of treatment is individually assessed and  is mainly based on experience. numerous studies have shown that it is possible to reduce inflammatory response in subarachnoid space and thus improve the outcome of meningitis by using anti-inflammatory agents, along with the antibiotics. conclusion: today the increase in resistance to antibiotics is a leading medical  problem in the 21st century. the most common micro organisms isolated from csf (liquor) in our region are: staphylococcus spp. coagulase negative. haemophilus infuenzae, neisseria meningitidis, serogroup b. staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus beta haemoliticus. the resistance to antimicrobial drugs most frequently used in the treatment of bacterial meningitis is still not alarmingly. high in our country. since there is a real possibility of development of high resistance in our area, the main recommendation is to rationalize the use of antibiotics.

TI  == purulent thyroiditis--a clinical study of 5 cases.
AB  == between 1 january 1990 and 31 december 2006, 13,279 patients were operated on due to various forms of goitre, of which five cases were diagnosed with purulent thyroiditis--one child aged 8, three women and one man all between 35 and 81 years of age. the course of the disease was unusual. in three of the patients cancer was suspected. in all of the patients hard nodules were discovered within  the thyroid gland, ultrasonographically heterogeneous and hypo-echogenic, although scintigraphic examination showed "cold" nodules. the child presented regional lymph node enlargement. except in one case, all patients were apyretic.  the rapid growth of the thyroid gland and symptoms of compression were observed in 2 cases. in one of them, tracheostomy was required. fine needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid gland revealed the presence of profuse purulent infiltration in one case. neither thyroid dysfunction nor autoimmune changes were detected. a subtotal thyroidectomy was performed in all patients. in the paediatric case, the enlarged lymph nodes were also resected. in 3 cases, thyroid abscess was diagnosed and drained and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pyogenes were found. microscopic examination proved the presence of aspergillus fumigatus in one case. antibiotic therapy was applied postoperatively and all the patients recovered. conclusions: (1) the clinical course of purulent thyroiditis leads to a diagnostic challenge. the surgical treatment of purulent thyroiditis allows for a faster recovery for the patient.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility of bacterial keratitis isolates to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones.
AB  == purpose: to study the microbiological profile of bacterial keratitis in northern  india and to determine the antibiotic sensitivity pattern of bacterial keratitis  isolates to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones. methods: laboratory records of all consecutive cases of clinically suspected bacterial corneal ulcers were retrospectively reviewed. data noted included microorganism isolated and antibiotic culture sensitivity to cefazolin, tobramycin, gatifloxacin, and moxifloxacin. in vitro susceptibility toward individual antibiotics was determined and compared with the potential in vitro susceptibilities to cefazolin-tobramycin, cefazolin-gatifloxacin, and cefazolin-moxifloxacin combinations. results: a total of 292 bacterial isolates were identified. of these, 255 (87.3%) were gram-positive and 37 (12.7%) were gram-negative. staphylococcus epidermidis (n=227, 77.7%) was the most common organism. overall susceptibility of isolates was 95.52% to gatifloxacin, 92.83% to moxifloxacin, 90.07% to tobramycin, and 83.56% to cefazolin (p<0.000). organisms which showed resistance to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones included staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, viridans streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. susceptibilities to gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were comparable with each other (p=0.312) and with  potential susceptibilities to cefazolin-tobramycin (p=0.479), gatifloxacin-cefazolin (p=0.134), and moxifloxacin-cefazolin (p=0.412) combinations. conclusions: monotherapy with moxifloxacin or gatifloxacin can be an effective alternative to cefazolin-tobramycin combination as a first-line empirical therapy for bacterial keratitis. the addition of cefazolin to a fourth-generation fluoroquinolone is of limited value.

TI  == zyvox annual appraisal of potency and spectrum program: linezolid surveillance program results for 2008.
AB  == the seventh year of the zyvox annual appraisal of potency and spectrum program (2008) continues to monitor the in vitro activities of linezolid and comparator agents tested against gram-positive pathogens in latin america, europe, canada, and the asia-pacific region. linezolid is an oxazolidinone approved for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infections, complicated skin and soft tissue infections, and nosocomial pneumonia caused by various gram-positive species including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). surveillance isolates were submitted from 64 medical centers (24 countries) for a total of 6121 strains. each country was requested to send 200 consecutive isolates in 6 targeted pathogen categories to a central processing laboratory, except the united kingdom, japan, and china where more strains were processed (400, 400, and 800, respectively). reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing methods were used to test the following organism groups: s. aureus (3240), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (748), enterococci (864), streptococcus pneumoniae (655), viridans group (297), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (317). eight linezolid-resistant (lzd-r) isolates were detected in 7 countries (italy [2], france, china, brazil, sweden, germany, and united kingdom) among the enterococci (enterococcus faecalis [3] and e. faecium [2]) and cons (3  staphylococcus epidermidis). five lzd-r isolates contained 23s rrna mutations (g2576t or g2447t), and 2 strains had undeterminable resistance mechanisms. one cons (italy) contained the mobile cfr gene. vancomycin-resistant enterococci rates ranged from 0.0% in several countries to 59.4% in taiwan. all streptococci  were linezolid susceptible (mic(90), 1 microg/ml). in conclusion, the activity of linezolid remained uniform and stable across the sampled geographic regions studied when compared to the 2006 to 2007 results. documented lzd-r remains rare  (only 0.13% overall but highest for cons [0.41%] and enterococci [0.69%]) among the 24 countries sampled for the 6 different pathogen groups. rates of clindamycin resistance and the frequency of mrsa varied by geographic region and  between nations; therefore, like oxazolidinones, it requires continued surveillance for changing resistance patterns.

TI  == linezolid surveillance program results for 2008 (leader program for 2008).
AB  == the leader program was initiated in 2004 and monitors emerging linezolid resistance in sampled us medical centers. this report summarizes the data obtained in 2008, the 5th consecutive year. a total of 57 institutions participated in 2008 representing all 9 us census regions with 100 target organisms per site (6113 isolates, 101.9% compliance to protocol design). the organisms tested by reference broth microdilution methods were staphylococcus aureus (3156), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 856), enterococci (901), streptococcus pneumoniae (619), and viridans group (223) or beta-hemolytic streptococci (358); also, d-test was used to determine inducible clindamycin resistance in staphylococcus aureus. linezolid remained very potent against all sampled species with mic(90) results ranging from 1 microg/ml (streptococci and cons) to 2 microg/ml (staphylococcus aureus and enterococci). only 0.36% of sampled strains were nonsusceptible to linezolid, a slight decrease from 0.45% and 0.44% in 2006 and 2007, respectively. the nonsusceptible strains (22) were staphylococcus aureus (3), cons (14), and enterococcus faecium (5) each with defined target mutations (g2576t in 19 strains; t2504a in 1 strain), mobile cfr element (1 strain staphylococcus epidermidis with an identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern to a cfr-positive staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from the same center in leader 2007), or an unknown (1 strain) mechanism. the mobile cfr resistance found in a staphylococcus aureus strain in 2007 was not observed in 2008. in conclusion, linezolid activity sampled by the 5th year of this leader program showed sustained potency and spectrum (99.64% susceptibility  levels). the nonsusceptible strain isolation rates remained stable and the plasmid-mediated ribosomal-based resistance mechanism that emerged in staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis strains in 2007 showed no evidence of dissemination or increased prevalence. however, there was evidence of cfr persistence with the s. epidermidis strain. the leader program continues to be an effective and sensitive surveillance tool to detect and monitor novel oxazolidinone resistance phenotypes and genotypes.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and stability of rhinacanthins-rich rhinacanthus nasutus extract.
AB  == rhinacanthins-rich rhinacanthus nasutus (rrn) extract was prepared and standardized to contain total rhinacantins not less than 70% w/w. in this study,  antimicrobial activities of the rrn extract as well as rhinacanthin-c against streptococcus mutans, propionibacterium acnes, helicobacter pylori, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and candida albicans were evaluated by microdilution assay. it was found that the rrn extract exhibited potent bactericidal activity against s. mutans with mic and mbc of 4 microg/ml, and potent bacteriostatic activity against s. epidermidis, p. acnes and s. aureus with the mics of 8-16 microg/ml. however, the rrn extract was not active against  c. albicans at concentration up to 2000 microg/ml. the antimicrobial activities of the rrn extract was almost equal to those of rhinacanthin-c. stability evaluations of the rrn extract through a period of 4 months found that the rrn extracts were stable when kept in a well-closed container protected from light and stored either under 4+/-2 degrees c or 30+/-2 degrees c. the rrn extracts that were exposed to light were not stable after 1 week of storage. under accelerated conditions at 45 degrees c with 75% relative humidity, the rrn extracts were not stable after 8 weeks of storage. study on the effect of ph on the stability of the aqueous methanolic solution of the rrn extract found that the solutions were not stable at ph 5.5, ph 7.0, and ph 8.0. however, the rhinacanthin solution at ph 5.5 was more stable than those at ph 7.0 and ph 8.0.

TI  == [etiology, resistance and diagnostic techniques in skin and skin structure infections].
AB  == skin and soft tissue infections (ssti) are common and, generally, uncomplicated at the time of initial presentation. however, these infections can worsen quickly when there are delays in diagnosis and treatment. the clinical presentation of most ssti is the culmination of a microbial three-step process as follow: i) bacterial adherence to host cells; ii) invasion of tissue with evasion of host defences, and iii) elaboration of toxins. even if the microbiology of wounds has  been actively investigated in recent years, there is still much to be learned about the microbial mechanisms that induce infection and prevent wound healing. there are also several means by which bacteria penetrate the skin barrier. the most common route is through a break in the barrier (lacerations, bite wounds, scratches, instrumentations, pre-existing skin conditions, wounds or ulcers, burns and surgery); other routes of penetration include contiguous spread from adjacent infections (e.g. osteomyelitis), entry of water into the skin pores, and, rarely, haematogenous seeding (i.e septic emboli). from what it was said, many microorganisms, above all from the normal skin microbiota, can be involved in these often polymicrobial infections, with gram-positives such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium spp being predominant. many other aerobic and anaerobic species,  including gram-negative bacilli, can also be involved. even if the diagnosis of most ssti is based on clinical examination, laboratory investigations, guided by  clinical information, can help to confirm the diagnosis and elucidate the characteristics of specific pathogens. these microbiological investigations may include blood cultures, tissue swabs with culture, and needle aspiration. in rapidly progressing infections, empirical therapy is essential, although microbiological data are important in confirming subsequently that the chosen regimen is appropriate. furthermore, the number of microorganisms becoming resistant to many usual drugs and the changing microbial epidemiology of these infections, such as the emergence of ca-mrsa, required a constant cooperation between the microbiology lab and the clinician in order to address microbiological aspects that can be critical to the successful management of ssti.

TI  == selective antimicrobial action is provided by phenol-soluble modulins derived from staphylococcus epidermidis, a normal resident of the skin.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides serve as a first line of innate immune defense against invading organisms such as bacteria and viruses. in this study, we hypothesized that peptides produced by a normal microbial resident of human skin, staphylococcus epidermidis, might also act as an antimicrobial shield and contribute to normal defense at the epidermal interface. we show by circular dichroism and tryptophan spectroscopy that phenol-soluble modulins (psms) gamma and delta produced by s. epidermidis have an alpha-helical character and a strong lipid membrane interaction similar to mammalian amps such as ll-37. both psms directly induced lipid vesicle leakage and exerted selective antimicrobial action against skin pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus. psms functionally cooperated with each other and ll-37 to enhance antimicrobial action. moreover, psms reduced group a streptococcus (gas) but not the survival of s. epidermidis on mouse skin. thus, these data suggest that the production of psmgamma and psmdelta by s. epidermidis can benefit cutaneous immune defense by selectively inhibiting the survival of skin pathogens while maintaining the normal skin microbiome.

TI  == combining use of a panel of ssdna aptamers in the detection of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == in this article, a panel of ssdna aptamers specific to staphylococcus aureus was  obtained by a whole bacterium-based selex procedure and applied to probing s. aureus. after several rounds of selection with s. aureus as the target and streptococcus and s. epidermidis as counter targets, the highly enriched oligonucleic acid pool was sequenced and then grouped under different families on the basis of the homology of the primary sequence and the similarity of the secondary structure. eleven sequences from different families were selected for further characterization by confocal imaging and flow cytometry analysis. results showed that five aptamers demonstrated high specificity and affinity to s. aureus individually. the five aptamers recognize different molecular targets by competitive experiment. combining these five aptamers had a much better effect than the individual aptamer in the recognition of different s. aureus strains. in addition, the combined aptamers can probe single s. aureus in pyogenic fluids. our work demonstrates that a set of aptamers specific to one bacterium can be used in combination for the identification of the bacterium instead of a single aptamer.

AB  == purpose: studies were conducted to evaluate the ocular penetration and systemic exposure to besifloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, following topical ocular  administration to animals and humans. methods: besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension (0.6%) was administered as a topical ocular instillation to pigmented rabbits, cynomolgus monkeys, and human subjects. at predetermined intervals after dosing,  samples of ocular tissues and plasma were collected and analyzed for besifloxacin levels using hplc/ms/ms methods. results: besifloxacin demonstrated good ocular penetration in rabbits and monkeys, with rapid absorption and sustained concentrations observed in anterior ocular tissues through 24 h after a single administration. maximum besifloxacin concentrations in conjunctiva, cornea, and aqueous humor of monkeys were 6.43 microg/g, 2.10 microg/g, and 0.796 microg/ml,  respectively, after a single topical dose, and concentrations declined in these tissues with an apparent half-life of 5-14 h. following a single topical ocular administration to humans, the maximum besifloxacin concentration in tears was 610 microg/g with concentrations decreasing to approximately 1.6 microg/g at 24 h. the resulting pharmacokinetic parameters for besifloxacin in human tears were evaluated relative to the mic(90) values (microg/ml) for besifloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae (0.125), staphylococcus aureus (0.25), staphylococcus epidermidis (0.5), and haemophilus influenzae (0.06). following a single topical  administration, the c(max)/mic(90) ratios for besifloxacin in human tears were >  or =1,220, and the auc((0-24))/mic(90) ratios were > or =2,500 for these relevant ocular pathogens. following repeated 3-times daily (tid) topical ocular administration to human subjects with clinically diagnosed bacterial conjunctivitis, maximum besifloxacin concentrations in plasma were less than 0.5  ng/ml, on average. conclusions: taken together, the results of the current investigation provide a pk/pd-based rationale that supports the use of besifloxacin for the safe and effective treatment of ocular infections.

TI  == [an eight-year review of sensitivity to antimicrobials against isolated microorganisms from ocular infections].
AB  == objective: to obtain data beneficial for future treatment by observing the circumstances relating to microorganisms isolated in external ocular infections and drug sensitivity, along with changes in drug-resistant bacteria. subjects and methods: for an eight-year period from april 1998 to march 2006, the cultivation  and identification of secretions from conjunctival sac and drug sensitivity tests were conducted at ja gifu koseiren chuno general hospital involving 3,876 patients (1,809 males and 2,067 females; average age: 44.2 +/- 29.3 years old, ranging from 0-99 years old) diagnosed with external ocular infections by the department of ophthalmology. sensitivity test results were evaluated based on the us clsi standards. results: of the 5,002 samples, 3,447 tested positive for cultures (isolation rate: 68.9%). a total of 4,537 strains were isolated. in descending order, the microorganisms isolated were 1,706 strains of coagulase negative staphylococcus (cns), including staphylococcus epidermidis (37.6%), 936  strains of corynebacterium spp. (20.6%), 635 strains of staphylococcus aureus (14.0%), 412 strains of haemophilus influenzae (9.1%), and 246 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (5.4%). cns, corynebacterium and s. aureus were isolated in relatively large numbers in patients of all ages. h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae were common in children six and under and from winter to spring. at the sametime, resistant bacteria (prsp or pisp: 166 strains; 2000 onward, blnar:  192 strains; and blpacr: 6 strains) were detected more frequently than sensitive  bacteria. h. influenzae was hypersensitive to cefotaxime (ctx) and levofloxacin.  almost no toleration of ctx was observed in s. pneumoniae. discussion and conclusion: there are distinctions in the isolated bacteria according to age and  season, and the use of drugs that are appropriate to the antibiograms of each facility should be considered.

TI  == prevalence of resistance phenotypes and genotypes to macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin antibiotics in gram-positive cocci isolated in tunisian bone marrow transplant center.
AB  == to investigate the prevalence of resistance to macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin (mls) antibiotics in gram-positive cocci isolated in a bone marrow  transplant center of tunisia, we tested the antibiotic susceptibility of 172 clinical isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecium to macrolide erythromycin and spiramycin, the lincosamide clindamycin and the streptogramin pristinamycin. these three groups of organisms  were mostly resistant to macrolides and lincosamide, but were commonly susceptible to pristinamycin. the resistance phenotypes of erythromycin-resistant isolates were determined by the five-disc test with erythromycin, spiramycin, lincomycin, clindamycin and pristinamycin, which showed that most exhibited constitutive mls resistance. in order to determine the prevalence of the resistance genotypes and the resistance mechanisms, the prevalence of the erythromycin resistance methylase (erm) (a), erm(b), erm(c), msr(a) and macrolide efflux (mef) (a) genes in the erythromycin-resistant isolates was identified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis. the resistance was due mainly to the presence of ermb in e. faecium (80%), ermc in s. epidermidis (53%) and mefa in s. mitis (65%).

TI  == microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women.
AB  == background: the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals is a recently created microbial niche which thus far has been characterized only to a very limited extent. yet the knowledge of this microflora can be considered as essential to the follow-up of transsexual women. the primary objective of this study was to map the neo-vaginal microflora in a group of 50 transsexual women for whom a neovagina was constructed by means of the inverted penile skin flap technique. secondary objectives were to describe possible correlations of this microflora with multiple patients' characteristics, such as  sexual orientation, the incidence of vaginal irritation and malodorous vaginal discharge. results: based on gram stain the majority of smears revealed a mixed microflora that had some similarity with bacterial vaginosis (bv) microflora and  that contained various amounts of cocci, polymorphous gram-negative and gram-positive rods, often with fusiform and comma-shaped rods, and sometimes even with spirochetes. candida cells were not seen in any of the smears. on average 8.6 species were cultured per woman. the species most often found were: staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus anginosus group spp., enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium sp., mobiluncus curtisii and bacteroides ureolyticus. lactobacilli were found in only one of 30 women. there was no correlation between dilatation habits, having coitus, rinsing habits and malodorous vaginal discharge on the one hand and the presence of a particular species on the other. there was  however a highly significant correlation between the presence of e. faecalis on the one hand and sexual orientation and coitus on the other (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027 respectively). respectively 82%, 58% and 30% of the samples showed an amplicon after amplification with m. curtisii, atopobium vaginae and gardnerella  vaginalis primer sets. conclusion: our study is the first to describe the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women. it reveals a  mixed microflora of aerobe and anaerobe species usually found either on the skin, in the intestinal microflora or in a bv microflora.

TI  == ceftaroline: a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == ceftaroline is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (csssi), including those caused by meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and community-acquired pneumonia (cap). ceftaroline has the ability to bind to penicillin-binding protein (pbp)2a, an mrsa-specific pbp that has low affinity for most other beta-lactam antibacterials. the high binding affinity of  ceftaroline to pbp2a (median inhibitory concentration 0.90 microg/ml) correlates  well with its low minimum inhibitory concentration for mrsa. ceftaroline is active in vitro against gram-positive cocci, including mrsa, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (not e. faecium). the broad-spectrum activity of ceftaroline includes many gram-negative pathogens but does not extend to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing or ampc-derepressed enterobacteriaceae or most nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. ceftaroline demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis and  non-fragilis bacteroides spp. limited data show that ceftaroline has a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug)  is rapidly converted by plasma phosphatases to active ceftaroline. for multiple intravenous doses of 600 mg given over 1 h every 12 hours for 14 days, the maximum plasma concentration was 19.0 microg/ml and 21.0 microg/ml for first and  last dose, respectively. ceftaroline has a volume of distribution of 0.37 l/kg (28.3 l), low protein binding (<20%) and a serum half-life of 2.6 hours. no drug  accumulation occurs with multiple doses and elimination occurs primarily through  renal excretion (49.6%). based on monte carlo simulations, dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/min); no adjustment is needed for mild renal impairment. currently, limited clinical trial data are available for ceftaroline. a phase ii study randomized 100 patients with csssi to intravenous ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours or intravenous vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours with or without intravenous aztreonam 1 g every 8 hours (standard therapy) for 7-14 days. clinical cure rates were 96.7% for ceftaroline compared with 88.9% for standard therapy. adverse events were similar between groups and generally mild in nature. in a phase iii trial, 702 patients with csssi were randomized to ceftaroline 600 mg or vancomycin 1 g plus aztreonam 1 g, each administered intravenously every 12 hours for 5-14 days. ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam in treating csssi caused by both gram-positive and -negative pathogens. adverse event rates were similar between groups. ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is  consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. in summary, ceftaroline is a promising treatment for csssi and cap, and has potential to be used as monotherapy for polymicrobial infections because of its broad-spectrum activity. further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline, and to define its role in patient care.

TI  == dark secrets behind the shimmer of contact lens: the indian scenario.
AB  == background: we studied the bacteriological profile of soft contact lens and its accessories among the asymptomatic subjects and monitored the compliance level with the lens use and its cleaning protocol. findings: a total of 115 (104 daily  wear and 11 extended wear) subjects using contact lens were studied. data regarding the duration of use and frequency and method of cleaning were recorded. contact lens, lens cases, preserving solutions and tips of solution bottles were  the samples collected. the isolates were identified on the basis of their phenotypic characters. samples from 24 subjects (21 daily wear and 3 extended wear) were found contaminated. of the 24 contaminated cases, 23 showed medium adherence to the cleaning protocol. contamination rate was higher among the 56 daily wear lens users who used same lens for 2 years and more, than the 48 users  who used their lenses for less than 2 years. lens case contamination was found in all the 24 cases. the bacteria isolated were citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pneumoniae. in extended wear lens users, there was no change in microbial flora on repeating the cultures on day 7 and 14. conclusion: non-compliance with contact lens use may lead to invitation of microbial flora. the accumulation of these bacteria may act as a precursor to biofilm formation, thus colonizing the lens accessories as well. the bacteria isolated in this study were similar to the ones causing microbial keratitis thus, predisposing the otherwise asymptomatic subjects to permanent visual damage.

TI  == rate of bacterial eradication by ophthalmic solutions of fourth-generation fluoroquinolones.
AB  == introduction: antibacterial activity of ophthalmic fourth-generation fluoroquinolones has traditionally been evaluated by comparing only their active  ingredients, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin. however, ophthalmic formulations of fourth-generation fluoroquinolones differ in terms of the inclusion of preservatives. while gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.3% (zymar; allergan, inc., irvine, ca, usa) contains 0.005% benzalkonium chloride (bak), moxifloxacin  ophthalmic solution 0.5% (vigamox; alcon laboratories, inc., fort worth, tx, usa) is preservative-free. recent studies have demonstrated that the presence of bak dramatically affects the antibacterial activity of the ophthalmic formulation of  gatifloxacin. this study was designed to compare the kill rates of ophthalmic solutions of fourth-generation fluoroquinolones against isolates of common ocular bacterial pathogens. methods: approximately 5.6 log(10) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml of haemophilus influenzae (n=1), streptococcus pneumoniae (n=1), staphylococcus aureus (n=2), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (n=4), methicillinresistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (n=4), and fluoroquinolone-resistant s. epidermidis (n=1) were incubated with ophthalmic solutions of either gatifloxacin or moxifloxacin. viable bacteria were quantified at specific time points up to 60 minutes. results: gatifloxacin 0.3% completely eradicated h. influenzae and strep. pneumoniae in 5 minutes, one of two s. aureus isolates in 15 minutes, and the other s. aureus isolate in 60 minutes. gatifloxacin 0.3% completely killed all mrsa, mrse, and fluoroquinolone-resistant s. epidermidis isolates in 15 minutes. moxifloxacin 0.5% completely eradicated strep. pneumoniae and one of four mrsa isolates in 60 minutes. all other isolates incubated with moxifloxacin 0.5% retained viable bacteria ranging from 1.8 to 4.4 log(10) cfu/ml. conclusions: the ophthalmic solution of gatifloxacin 0.3% eradicated bacteria that frequently cause postoperative ocular infections substantially faster than did the ophthalmic solution of moxifloxacin 0.5%.

TI  == improved photodynamic inactivation of gram-positive bacteria using hematoporphyrin encapsulated in liposomes and micelles.
AB  == background and objectives: antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (pdi) is a promising treatment modality for local infections. to increase the efficacy of photosensitizer, hematoporphyrin (hp) was used as a model drug and encapsulated in liposomes and micelles. the bactericidal efficacy of the carrier-entrapped hp  was assessed against gram-positive bacteria. study design/materials and methods:  hp was encapsulated in liposomes by a modified reversed-phase evaporation and extrusion method. micelle-hp was prepared by the reversed-phase evaporation method. spectroscopic analysis was used to characterize the properties of hp in pbs, liposome or micelle. the pdi efficacy was examined by using gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-susceptible, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: the absorption and fluorescence emission spectra indicated that hp encapsulated in liposomes and micelles is less likely to exist in aggregated form compared to that generally seen in an aqueous medium. liposome- or micelle-hp can induce complete eradication of the bacteria above a critical hp dose, which is significantly lower than the dose required when using the non-encapsulated hp. furthermore, the pdi effect of the hp encapsulated in micelles was superior to the hp encapsulated in liposomes at lower hp doses. similar pdi results were also found in s. epidermidis and s. pyogenes. conclusions: our results indicate that photosensitizer entrapped in micelle exert similar or better pdi efficacy than that of liposome, which indicates this formulation may be useful for the treatment of local infections in the future.

TI  == neonatal blood cultures: effect of delayed entry into the blood culture machine and bacterial concentration on the time to positive growth in a simulated model.
AB  == aims: to determine if: time from blood culture inoculation to positive growth (total time to positive) and time from blood culture machine entry to positive growth (machine time to positive) is altered by delayed entry into the automated  blood culture machine, and if the total time to positive differs by the concentration of organisms inoculated into blood culture bottles. methods: staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli and group b beta-haemolytic streptococci were chosen as clinically significant representative organisms. two  concentrations (> or =10 colony-forming units per millilitre and <1 colony-forming units per millilitre) were inoculated into peds bact/alert blood culture bottles and randomly allocated to one of three delayed automated blood culture machine entry times (30 min/8.5 h/15.5 h). results: for all organisms at  all concentrations, except the staphylococcus epidermidis, the machine time to positive was significantly decreased by delayed entry. for all organisms at all concentrations, the mean total time to positive significantly increased with increasing delayed entry into the blood culture machine. higher concentrations of group b beta-haemolytic streptococci and escherichia coli grew significantly faster than lower concentrations. conclusion: bacterial growth in inoculated bottles, stored at room temperature, continues although at a slower rate than in  those blood culture bottles immediately entered into the machine. if a blood culture specimen has been stored at room temperature for greater than 15.5 h, the currently allowed safety margin of 36 h (before declaring a result negative) may  be insufficient.

AB  == acetic acid has been commonly used in medicine for more than 6000 years for the disinfection of wounds and especially as an antiseptic agent in the treatment and prophylaxis of the plague. the main goal of this study was to prove the suitability of acetic acid, in low concentration of 3%, as a local antiseptic agent, especially for use in salvage procedures in problematic infections caused  by organisms such as proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter baumannii or pseudomonas aeruginosa. this study was designed to compare the in vitro antimicrobial effect  of acetic acid with those of common local antiseptics such as povidone-iodine 11% (betaisodona), polyhexanide 0.04% (lavasept), mafenide 5% and chlohexidine gluconate 1.5% cetrimide 15% (hibicet). former studies suggest the bactericidal effect of acetic acid, but these data are very heterogeneous; therefore, a standardised in vitro study was conducted. to cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial  strains were tested: escherichia coli, p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa, a. baumannii,  enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and beta-haemolytic streptococcus group a and b. the tests showed excellent bactericidal effect of acetic acid, particularly with problematic gram-negative bacteria such as p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii. the microbiological spectrum of acetic acid is wide, even when tested  at a low concentration of 3%. in comparison to our currently used antiseptic solutions, it showed similar - in some bacteria, even better - bactericidal properties. an evaluation of the clinical value of topical application of acetic  acid is currently underway. it can be concluded that acetic acid in a concentration of 3% has excellent bactericidal effect and, therefore, seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but further clinical studies are necessary.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of some thiourea derivatives and their nickel and copper complexes.
AB  == five thiourea derivative ligands and their ni(2+) and cu(2+) complexes have been  synthesized. the compounds were screened for their in vitro anti-bacterial activity using gram-positive bacteria (two different standard strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus) and gram-negative bacteria (esherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris, enterobacter aerogenes) and in vitro anti-yeast activity (candida albicans, candida krusei, candida glabrata, candida tropicalis, candida parapsilosis). the  minimum inhibitory concentration was determined for all ligands and their complexes. in vitro anti-yeast activity of both ligands and their metal complexes is greater than their in vitro anti-bacterial activity. the effect of the structure of the investigated compounds on the antimicrobial activity is discussed.

TI  == constituents and antimicrobial properties of blue honeysuckle: a novel source for phenolic antioxidants.
AB  == the fruit of lonicera caerulea l. (blue honeysuckle; caprifoliaceae) and its phenolic fraction were analyzed for nutrients and micronutrients. the phenolic fraction was prepared from berries percolated with 0.1% h3po4 and spe using sepabeads sp207. the sugar and lipid content was analyzed by hplc and gc-ms. the  total content of anthocyanins was determined using the ph differential absorbance method and aliphatic acids by capillary electrophoresis. microlc-ms/ms was used for determination of cyanidin-3-glucoside (the predominant anthocyanin), 3,5-diglucoside, and 3-rutinoside, paeonidin-3-glucoside, 3,5-diglucoside, and 3-rutinoside, delphinidin-3-glucoside and 3-rutinoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, 3,5-diglucoside, and 3-rutinoside, quercetin, its 3-glucoside, and 3-rutinoside,  epicatechin, protocatechuic, gentisic, ellagic, ferulic, caffeic, chlorogenic, and coumaric acids. the phenolic fraction displayed folin-ciocalteu reagent reducing (335 +/- 15 microg of gallic acid equivalent/mg) and dpph and superoxide scavenging activity (ic50 12.1 +/- 0.1 and 115.5 +/- 6.4 microg/ml) and inhibited rat liver microsome peroxidation (ic50 160 +/- 20 microg/ml). the freeze-dried fruit and its phenolic fraction reduced the biofilm formation and adhesion to the artificial surface of candida parapsilosis, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus mutans.

TI  == antibacterial activity of preservative-free topical anesthetic drops in current use in ophthalmology departments.
AB  == aim: the antibacterial effect of topical anesthetics may lead to false-negative cultures from corneal specimens of bacterial keratitis. this in vitro study compared the antibacterial effect of 3 unpreserved topical anesthetics to indicate the most appropriate agent for corneal scrapes. methods: four bacterial  strains (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pneumoniae) derived from the most frequently isolated microorganisms from corneal ulcers were cultured from stored control stocks and clinical specimens. these strains were used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 3 preservative-free anesthetic eyedrops: proxymetacaine 0.5%, oxybuprocaine 0.4%, and tetracaine 1%. results: there was no inhibition of growth seen with proxymetacaine 0.5% (5000 microg/ml) with any of the organisms except s. epidermidis, which demonstrated an mic of 2500 microg/ml  (equivalent to a dilution of (1/2)). tetracaine 1% (10,000 microg/ml) produced an mic ranging between 625 and 1250 microg/ml, inhibiting all 4 strains at the commercially available dilution. oxybuprocaine 0.4% (4000 microg/ml) resulted to  be the second most inhibitory preparation with an mic ranging between 1000 and 2000 microg/ml. conclusions: currently used preservative-free topical anesthetics differ in bacterial growth inhibition. this in vitro study showed that proxymetacaine 0.5% is the least inhibitory on bacterial growth and therefore the most appropriate to be used before corneal scrapes.

AB  == the leader program (2007) monitors for emerging linezolid resistance in sampled us medical centers, initiated in 2004. for the current reported year, the number  of sites participating was increased from 50 to 60 institutions representing all  9 us census regions with 100 target organisms per site (6305 isolates, 105.1% compliance to protocol design). the organisms tested by reference broth microdilution methods were staphylococcus aureus (3318), coagulase negative staphylococci (cons, 1020), enterococci (705), streptococcus pneumoniae (622), and viridans group (249) or beta-hemolytic streptococci (391); also, d-test was used to determine inducible clindamycin resistance in s. aureus strains. linezolid remained very potent against all sampled species with mic(90) results ranging from 1 microg/ml (streptococci and cons) to 2 microg/ml (s. aureus and enterococci). only 0.44% of sampled strains were nonsusceptible to linezolid, compared with 0.45% in 2006. the nonsusceptible strains (23) were usually staphylococci (20) or enterococcus faecium (8), each with defined target mutations (g2576t, 24 strains) or a novel mobile cfr element in staphylococci (2  strains). in conclusion, linezolid activity sampled by the 4th year of this leader program showed sustained potency and spectrum (99.56% susceptibility). although the nonsusceptible strain isolation rates remained stable, a new plasmid-mediated ribosomal-based resistance mechanism emerged in s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis strains from arizona and ohio. the leader program appears to be an effective and sensitive surveillance tool to detect novel resistance phenotypes and genotypes.

TI  == bacteriology of non-surgical wound infections in ibadan, nigeria.
AB  == previous studies done on wound infections in this environment had been mostly on  the surgical variety rather than the non-surgical. however,few studies available  on the non-surgical type have indicated that changes do occur in the pattern and  antibiogram of the bacterial isolates of these non-surgical wound infections. this study was therefore designed to investigate the bacteriology of non-surgical wound infections in this environment. a retrospective review of seven hundred and fifty four cases of non-surgical wound infections was conducted between september 2002 and february 2005 at the university college hospital, ibadan, nigeria. a total number of 871 bacterial, and seven fungal isolates were obtained from these wound cultures. in 477 (70.3%) cases, cultures were monomicrobial and 202 (29.8%) polymicrobial. staphylococcus aureus (38%) was the predominant pathogen, followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.7%), klebsiella species (17%), escherichia coli (10.6%), proteus species (7.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (4.4%), streptococcus species (1.6%), enterococcus faecalis (1.4%), and candida albicans (0.8%). high rates of antibiotic resistance were recorded among these isolates. 53.4% of them  were sensitive to ceftriaxone, 42.5% to gentamycin and 39.3% to ofloxacin. this high antibiotic resistance gives credence to the value of determining the antibiogram of these pathogens in their management. continuous interaction between the wound care practitioners and microbiology department is also advocated.

AB  == mycobacterium leprae is not cultivable in axenic media, and direct microscopic enumeration of the bacilli is complex, labor intensive, and suffers from limited  sensitivity and specificity. we have developed a real-time pcr assay for quantifying m. leprae dna in biological samples. primers were identified to amplify a shared region of the multicopy repeat sequence (rlep) specific to m. leprae and tested for sensitivity and specificity in the taqman format. the assay was specific for m. leprae and able to detect 10 fg of purified m. leprae dna, or approximately 300 bacteria in infected tissues. we used the rlep taqman pcr to assess the short and long-term growth results of m. leprae in foot pad tissues obtained from conventional mice, a gene knock-out mouse strain, athymic nude mice, as well as from reticuloendothelial tissues of m. leprae-infected nine-banded armadillos. we found excellent correlative results between estimates  from rlep taqman pcr and direct microscopic counting (combined r = 0.98). the rlep taqman pcr permitted rapid analysis of batch samples with high reproducibility and is especially valuable for detection of low numbers of bacilli. molecular enumeration is a rapid, objective and highly reproducible means to estimate the numbers of m. leprae in tissues, and application of the technique can facilitate work with this agent in many laboratories.

TI  == microbial contamination associated with mascara use.
AB  == background: microbial organisms are normally present on human eyelashes. application of mascara to lashes has the potential to inoculate the mascara tube  with microbes. this pilot study of a real-world situation investigated the microbial contamination of 2 brands of mascara used daily for 3 months. methods:  forty women between the ages of 18 and 39 were randomly assigned to use 1 of 2 brands of nonwaterproof mascara. all mascara tubes were unexpired and purchased on the same day. subjects were instructed to use the mascara on both the upper and lower lids every day for 3 months. after 3 months, the mascara tubes were collected, cultured, and examined for microbial growth. results: mascara tubes were collected from 33 of 40 (82.5%) subjects who began the study. microbial growth was found in 36.4% of the subject tubes. based on growth on selective media, most of the organisms were determined to be staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus species, or fungi. we did not attempt to quantify the numbers of bacteria or fungi present within the tubes. conclusions: because microbial presence was found in 36.4% of the mascara tubes cultured after 3 months of use,  we recommend a maximum 3-month use of a mascara tube used on a daily basis. more  frequent replacement may be warranted with further study.

AB  == the dynamics of intramammary infection (imi) during the dry period were studied in 435 half-udders of 229 assaf ewes, belonging to 2 flocks with high and medium  imi prevalences. ewes were randomly assigned to 2 lots: 1) treated lot (tl) with  223 half-udders (118 ewes), which received complete dry therapy (1 syringe/teat)  of an antibiotic combination containing 100 mg of penethamate hydriodide, 280 mg  of benethamine penicillin, and 100 mg of framycetin sulfate, and 2) control lot (cl) with 212 nontreated half-udders (111 ewes). two samplings per half-udder were carried out on 2 different days in the 5 d preceding drying-off, and 2 other samplings were again carried out in the 5 first d of the postpartum period. the length of the dry period averaged 109.0 d. cure, persistent infections, reinfection, and new infection rates were 81.7, 12.8, 5.5, and 7.9%, respectively, for tl and 13.3, 70.4, 16.3, and 22.8%, respectively, for the cl. the prevalence of imi decreased significantly from 48.9% at drying-off to 13.0% at lambing for the tl, but it did not vary for the cl (46.2 and 52.4%, respectively). within the tl, imi prevalence significantly diminished for staphylococcus (41.3 to 9.9%) and streptococcus (5.8 to 1.8%) genera, and more specifically this decrease was most evident for staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus agalactiae species. log somatic cell count (scc) diminished significantly between drying-off (5.68) and lambing (5.33) in the tl, whereas log scc did not vary in the cl (5.61 vs. 5.66). this scc reduction was very significant in the flock with the greater imi prevalence. as a conclusion, the antibiotic formulation used as dry therapy drastically diminished imi prevalence  and scc during the dry period in dairy ewes as a result of greater imi cure rates and lower reinfection and new infection rates in the tl compared with the cl.

TI  == effect of electrical current on the activities of antimicrobial agents against pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms.
AB  == bacterial biofilms are resistant to conventional antimicrobial agents. prior in vitro studies have shown that electrical current (ec) enhances the activities of  aminoglycosides, quinolones, and oxytetracycline against pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus gordonii. this phenomenon, known as the bioelectric effect, has been only partially defined. the purpose of this work was to study the in vitro bioelectric effect on the activities of 11 antimicrobial agents representing a variety of different classes against p. aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and s. epidermidis. an eight-channel current generator/controller and eight chambers delivering a continuous flow of fresh medium with or without antimicrobial agents and/or ec to biofilm-coated coupons were used. no significant decreases in the numbers of log(10) cfu/cm(2) were seen after exposure to antimicrobial agents alone, with the exception of a 4.57-log-unit reduction for s. epidermidis and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. we  detected a statistically significant bioelectric effect when vancomycin plus 2,000 microamperes ec were used against mrsa biofilms (p = 0.04) and when daptomycin and erythromycin were used in combination with 200 or 2,000 microamperes ec against s. epidermidis biofilms (p = 0.02 and 0.0004, respectively). the results of these experiments indicate that the enhancement of  the activity of antimicrobial agents against biofilm organisms by ec is not a generalizable phenomenon across microorganisms and antimicrobial agents.

TI  == antibacterial properties of synovial fluid in the knee.
AB  == this study evaluated antimicrobial properties of synovial fluid against 3 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus epidermidis. synovial fluid was collected from the knees of 52 patients. three gram-positive bacteria culture lines were incubated in wells containing either synovial fluid and broth, or broth alone. fluid was plated and  incubated, and colonies were counted after 1, 4, and 24 hours to determine bacterial growth. statistically significant differences in bacterial counts were  found between control and experimental groups at 0, 4, and 24 hours for all 3 bacterial species. bacterial counts in the control specimens demonstrated exponential growth over 24 hours as would be expected in the absence of growth inhibition. in contrast, bacterial counts in all of the synovial fluid specimens  decreased steadily over 24 hours. these results demonstrate synovial fluid possesses potent bactericidal activity against the most common gram-positive pathogens responsible for septic arthritis. delineating these antimicrobial properties further may offer avenues to augment the body's protection against bacterial infections.

TI  == bacteriocin st91km, produced by streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus st91km, is a narrow-spectrum peptide active against bacteria associated with mastitis in dairy cattle.

TI  == [the assessment of bacterial flora and antibiotic-sensitivity of bacteria isolated from conjunctival sac, skin of the eyelids and inflammatory lesions in patients with acne vulgaris and rosacea].
AB  == aim: to evaluate bacterial flora of conjunctival sac, the skin of the eyelids and inflammatory lesions in patients with acne vulgaris, rosacea and of healthy people. bacterial colonization of conjunctival sac, the skin of the eyelids and skin lesions is more frequent in patients with acne vulgaris and rosacea. because antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria are quite often met, it seems important  to determine antibiotic-sensitivity of isolated bacteria. material and methods: 178 people underwent bacteriological examination of conjunctival sac, skin of the eyelids and skin lesions: 64 patients with acne vulgaris, 59 patients with rosacea and 55 healthy persons. microorganisms were identified with laboratory techniques with the use of bio-merieux kits and determination of drug-sensitivity was performed with recognized laboratory techniques. results: positive cultures and general frequencies of the isolations were found to be higher in both groups  in comparison with the reference group (the group of clinically healthy people).  in healthy persons practically the only saprophytic bacteria--the most often s. epidermidis and s. viridans--were isolated. whereas in patients suffering from acne vulgaris and rosacea the pathogenic bacteria--s. aureus, p. fluorescens, p.  acnes, p. aeruginosa--were additionally isolated. different spectrum of sensitivity to antibiotics of bacteria isolated from conjunctival sac, the skin of the eyelids and skin lesions in the cases of acne vulgaris and rosacea was proved. conclusions: 1. in the cases of acne vulgaris the majority of isolated bacteria from conjunctival sac included streptococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and enterobacteriaceae. 2. in the severe cases of rosacea the main bacteria found in conjunctival sac were s. aureus, s.pyogenes, p.aeruginosa, e. faecalis, a. baumanii, p. fluorescens. 3. because of changeable drug-sensitivity of bacterial  strains, it seems to be necessary to perform individual culture and antibiogram in every patient with inflammatory lesions, in particular in clinically severe and resistant to therapy cases of acne vulgaris and rosacea. 4. the higher frequency of the bacterial colonisations in the conjunctival sac in patients with acne vulgaris and rosacea can be a potential source of ocular infections in the cases of local and systemic disorders of protective mechanisms. 5. estimation of  bacterial flora and antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from conjunctival sac, the skin of the eyelids and skin lesions should be perform, especially when  patients are prepared for eye surgery.

TI  == bacterial resistance surveillance in china: a report from mohnarin 2004-2005.
AB  == the aim of this study was to establish a nationwide antimicrobial resistant surveillance network and obtain information on bacterial resistance in china. a total of 4075 clinical bacterial isolates were collected from 17 hospitals in 15  cities throughout china. antibacterial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by the standard agar dilution method recommended by clinical and  laboratory standards institute. the results of the mics revealed the following bacterial resistance characteristics. oxacillin resistance was shown by 62.9% of  staphylococcus aureus and 82.89% of staphylococcus epidermidis strains. penicillin non-sensitivity was show by 40.7% of the streptococcus pneumoniae strains, which included 10.5% penicillin-resistant strains and 30.2% penicillin-intermediate strains. five strains of enterococci were vancomycin-intermediate, but all enterococci strains were sensitive to teicoplanin. all staphylococci were susceptible to glycopeptides. a high resistance to macrolides was a predominant characteristic of the gram-positive cocci. enterobacteriaceae strains were clearly resistant to the third generation  cephalosporins, with the exception of ceftazidime, and the resistance rates ranged from 20 to 70%. about 65% of the escherichia coli strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones. carbapenems remained highly active against all the target bacteria. latamoxef, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime were all active against enterobacteriaceae, which showed resistant rates of less  than 10%. imipenem resistance was found in 10.6% of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 10.4% of acinetobacter baumannii strains, most of which were multidrug resistant  isolates. combinations of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor and fluoroquinolones also had potent antibacterial activity against non-fermenters. amikacin was active against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa. in conclusion,  methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-insensitive s. pneumoniae, macrolides-resistant gram-positive cocci, cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae, multidrug-resistant nonfermenters and fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli were revealed to be the most serious problems in terms of bacteria resistance in china. no glycopeptides-resistant staphylococcus strains were isolated, and the appearance of glycopeptides-resistant enterococci was seldom.

TI  == bovine mastitis and antibiotic resistance patterns in selalle smallholder dairy farms, central ethiopia.
AB  == a study was conducted to determine the prevalence of mastitis, identify the major bacterial pathogens and test the antimicrobial resistance of milk bacterial isolates in smallholder dairy farms in selalle area, ethiopia. a total of 109 smallholder dairy farms comprising 500 crossbred lactating cows were included. the prevalence of clinical mastitis at herd, cow and quarter level was 8.3% (n=9), 1.8% (n=9) and 0.51% (n=10), respectively, while that of sub-clinical mastitis was 54.7%, 22.3% and 10.1%, respectively. the univariate logistic regression showed that among the risk factors considered, presence of teat lesion, stage of lactation and parity number had significant effect on the prevalence of sub-clinical mastitis. however, after multivariate analysis, only presence of teat lesion and stage of lactation had significant effect. the common isolates from the clinical mastitic quarters were st. agalactiae (30%, n=3) and st. dysgalactiae (30%, n=3), while from sub-clinical cases were s. aureus (42.6%, n=83), s. epidermidis (22.1%, n=43), st. agalactiae (12.8%, n=25) and st. uberis  (10.3%, n=20). staphylococcus intermedius and streptococcus dysgalactiae were the species, which showed high level of susceptibility for most of the antimicrobials tested, while the remaining had varying levels of resistance for almost all the antimicrobials used. among the antimicrobials employed, erythromycin and sulphonamide showed the lowest proportion of resistant isolates. considering the  possible significant economic losses that could be incurred by both clinical and  sub-clinical mastitis, attention should be paid for further detailed investigations including the economic losses and benefits of interventions in the study area.

TI  == in vitro investigation of the antibacterial effect of ketamine.
AB  == background: antibacterial activity of local anesthetics especially lidocaine has  been shown previously. in this study, the antibacterial effect of ketamine, a general anesthetic agent was investigated. methods: the antibacterial effect of ketamine was studied using six different strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, entecoccus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes,  pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli) with disc diffusion method. ciprofloxacine discs (cip, oxoid) were used as a control to verify the methodology. minimal inhibition concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) of ketamine for these bacteria were also determined. results: no inhibition was evident in discs containing 62.5 microg of ketamine. ketamine 125 microg showed activity on all the bacteria tested with the exception of e. coli. the inhibition rates of ketamine were more prominent at the doses of 250 microg and 500 microg similar to the inhibition rate of cip. whereas mic and mbc  values of ketamine for s. aureus and s. pyogenes were 500 microg ml(-1), mic and  mbc values for p. aeruginosa were above 2000 microg ml(-1). for other bacteria, these values ranged between these levels. conclusions: ketamine with higher doses showed antibacterial activity. we thought that it will be proper to use ketamine  hesitantly in experimental animal studies like sepsis and translocation.

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of cbr-2092, a novel rifamycin-quinolone hybrid antibiotic: microbiology profiling studies with staphylococci and streptococci.
AB  == we present data from antimicrobial assays performed in vitro that pertain to the  potential clinical utility of a novel rifamycin-quinolone hybrid antibiotic, cbr-2092, for the treatment of infections mediated by gram-positive cocci. the mic(90)s for cbr-2092 against 300 clinical isolates of staphylococci and streptococci ranged from 0.008 to 0.5 mug/ml. against staphylococcus aureus, cbr-2092 exhibited prolonged postantibiotic effects (paes) and sub-mic effects (smes), with values of 3.2, 6.5, and >8.5 h determined for the pae (3x mic), sme  (0.12x mic), and pae-sme (3x mic/0.12x mic) periods, respectively. studies of genetically defined mutants of s. aureus indicate that cbr-2092 is not a substrate for the nora or mepa efflux pumps. in minimal bactericidal concentration and time-kill studies, cbr-2092 exhibited bactericidal activity against staphylococci that was retained against rifampin- or intermediate quinolone-resistant strains, with apparent paradoxical cidal characteristics against rifampin-resistant strains. in spontaneous resistance studies, cbr-2092 exhibited activity consistent with balanced contributions from its composite pharmacophores, with a mutant prevention concentration of 0.12 mug/ml and a resistance frequency of <10(-12) determined at 1 mug/ml in agar for s. aureus. similarly, cbr-2092 suppressed the emergence of preexisting rifamycin resistance  in time-kill studies undertaken at a high cell density. in studies of the intracellular killing of s. aureus, cbr-2092 exhibited prolonged bactericidal activity that was superior to the activities of moxifloxacin, rifampin, and a cocktail of moxifloxacin and rifampin. overall, cbr-2092 exhibited promising activity in a range of antimicrobial assays performed in vitro that pertain to properties relevant to the effective treatment of serious infections mediated by  gram-positive cocci.

TI  == frequency and expression of mutacin biosynthesis genes in isolates of streptococcus mutans with different mutacin-producing phenotypes.
AB  == the aim of this study was to analyse the frequency and expression of biosynthesis genes in 47 streptococcus mutans isolates with different mutacin-producing phenotypes. detection of the frequency and expression of genes encoding mutacin types i, ii, iii and iv were carried out by pcr and semi-quantitative rt-pcr, respectively, using primers specific for each type of biosynthesis gene. in addition, a further eight genes encoding putative bacteriocins, designated bsm 283, bsm 299, bsm 423, bsm 1889c, bsm 1892c, bsm 1896, bsm 1906c and bsm 1914, were also screened. there was a high phenotypic diversity; some streptococcus mutans isolates presented broad antimicrobial spectra against other streptococcus mutans clinical isolates, including bacteria resistant to common antibiotics, as  well as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis  and streptococcus pyogenes. the expression frequency of the bsm gene was higher than that of the previously characterized mutacins (i-iv). there was no positive  correlation between the number of indicator strains inhibited (antimicrobial spectra) and the number of biosynthesis genes expressed (spearman correlation test, r=-0.03, p>0.05). in conclusion, the high diversity of mutacin-producing phenotypes, associated with high frequency of expression of the biosynthesis genes screened, reveals a broad repertoire of genetic determinants encoding antimicrobial peptides that can act in different combinations.

TI  == infection associated with hematoma formation after shoulder arthroplasty.
AB  == hematoma formation requiring operative treatment after shoulder arthroplasty may  be associated with higher patient morbidity. we therefore determined whether there was an association of hematoma formation requiring operative treatment with deep infection after shoulder arthroplasty. between 1978 and 2006, we performed 4147 shoulder arthroplasties in 3643 patients. of these, 12 shoulders (0.3%) underwent reoperation for hematoma formation. the mean time interval from arthroplasty to surgery for the hematoma was 7 days (range, 0.5-31 days). among nine cases in which cultures were taken, six had positive cultures; the organisms included propionibacterium acnes in three, staphylococcus epidermidis in one, streptococcus species in one, and staphylococcus epidermidis with peptostreptococcus in one. the minimum followup was 12 months (mean, 68 months; range, 12 to 294 months). two of the 12 patients eventually underwent resection arthroplasty for deep infection. the neer score was excellent in one, satisfactory in six, and unsatisfactory in five patients. the data suggest hematoma formation after shoulder arthroplasty is often accompanied by positive intraoperative cultures. the surgeon should be aware of the high rate of unsatisfactory results associated with this complication as well as the possibility of developing a deep infection requiring additional surgery. level of evidence: level iv, prognostic study. see guidelines for authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

TI  == emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacterial pathogens.
AB  == development of multiple resistances to antibiotics in staphylococci, enterococci  and pneumococci became a health threat during the past 20 years, not only with respect to nosocomial infections. this resistance development is based on acquisition of resistance genes by predominant epidemic subpopulations (clonal complexes). although emergence and spread of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus is associated with a limited number of epidemic clones which have been widely disseminated, acquisition of sccmec elements by susceptible ancestors has  taken place at different times and at different locations. among staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecium, one clonal complex, which had acquired resistance genes at several occasions, is widely disseminated in hospitals. also  in streptococcus pneumoniae, antibiotic resistance is preferentially associated with clonal lineages which have a capacity for spreading. they became, however, more rare after introduction of the 7-valent conjugate vaccine.

TI  == aggressive management of shunt infection: combined intravenous and intraventricular antibiotic therapy for twelve or less days.
AB  == objective: this report is limited to patients with a single cerebrospinal fluid (csf) shunt infected by a single organism, and compares two treatment protocols.  methods: in the initial protocol (1975-1991), patients underwent removal of the shunt system and received intravenous and intraventricular antibiotics. intraventricular antibiotics were administered twice daily to those with external ventricular drainage. when csf was cultured 48 h off all antibiotics and found to be sterile at 24 h of incubation, a new shunt was inserted. follow-up csf cultures were obtained in all patients between 1-6 months following placement of  the new shunt. results: there were 25 patients (ages 1 month to 16 years; mean +/- sd: 23 +/- 4.0 months). csf obtained from the shunt yielded the following: staphylococcus epidermidis (19), staphylococcus aureus (2), streptococcus species (2), serratia marcescens (1), and propionebacterium species (1). the duration of  intravenous antibiotics was 7-12 days (mean +/- sd: 9.7 +/- 1.3 days), and intraventricular antibiotic therapy was 6.2 +/- 1.7 days. total hospital stay was 15.2 +/- 2.3 days. the follow-up period was 7.7 +/- 3.6 years. following the initial protocol in another 15 patients (1992-2004), the treatment regime was modified in that intraventricular antibiotics were administered once daily in patients with external ventricular drainage, and the csf was cultured at 24 h off antibiotics, instead of 48 h. results were similar to the initial protocol with respect to days of antibiotic therapy and hospital stay. conclusion: based on our retrospective nonrandomized series, we believe patients with a single shunt and noncompartmentalized hydrocephalus can be successfully treated without a prolonged antibiotic course and lengthy hospital stay.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of dx-619, a novel des-f (6)-quinolone against clinical isolates in china.
AB  == the aim of the study was to investigate in vitro antibacterial activity and bactericidal effect of dx-619 and other nine comparators against 1,101 recently collected clinical bacterial isolates in china. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of antimicrobials were determined by a clsi recommended standard agar dilution method and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs)  were examined by the broth dilution method. time-kill curves against representative isolates of staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and klebsiellia pneumoniae were also conducted. dx-619 exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against 1,101 clinical isolates, especially to multi-drug resistant gram-positive cocci. the mic(90)s of dx-619 were < or =0.016 and 0.125 mg/l against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus, 0.062 and 0.125 mg/l against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. epidermidis, respectively, which were 8-512 and 64-128 fold lower than those of comparative fluoroquinolones. the mic(90)s of dx-619 for penicillin-sensitive and -non-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were 0.016, 0.062, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/l, respectively. the mic(90)s of dx-619 against enterobacteriaceae (except for escherichia coli) and glucose-nonfermenting bacilli were < or =4 mg/l, which were comparable to other comparators. mbcs and time-kill curves showed that dx-619 was a potent bactericidal agent. there was no significant inoculum effect on mics. but the activities of dx-619 against s. aureus, k. pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were decreased by acidic ph and  human serum. dx-619 was a potent antibacterial compound against multi-drug resistant bacteria including gram-positive cocci, such as s. aureus and enterococci, which may warrant further exploration.

TI  == decontamination effects of low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge.  part ii: new insights.
AB  == the second part of our paper presents the results of experiments with the decontamination of surfaces by low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge in air at atmospheric pressure. a simple device is described and the effects of the corona discharge on model microorganisms, viz. the yeast candida albicans, gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, neisseria sicca, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, gram-positive bacteria deinococcus radiodurans, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus sanguinis, and vegetative and spore forms of geobacillus stearothermophilus are discussed. a similar microbicidal effect after about one-minute exposure was observed in all vegetative forms of the microorganisms. measurement in growth inhibition zones on a semisolid medium was used to determine the dependence of the microbicidal effect on exposure time and the distance between electrodes. counting of colonies served to assess the microbicidal effect of the discharge on contaminated inert surfaces observable after more than 1 min exposure. geobacillus stearothermophilus spores were found to have several times lower susceptibility to the action of the discharge and the microbicidal effect was observed only after an 8 min exposure. reaction with the iodide reagent did not unambiguously demonstrate the difference between ozone and singlet oxygen as presumed active components of the corona. the area distribution of reactive oxygen species was determined; it was found to differ from the wartburg law depending on exposure time. qualitative evidence was obtained on the penetration  of the reactive oxygen species into the semisolid medium.

TI  == stimulation of fusobacterium nucleatum biofilm formation by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background/aims: bacterial infection is a major cause of periapical periodontitis. eradication of these microorganisms from apical lesions is essential to the success of endodontic treatment. the aim of this study was to clarify the molecular interaction between fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas  gingivalis and other microorganisms associated with periapical periodontitis. methods: microorganisms isolated from periapical lesions were inoculated into type-i collagen-coated polystyrene microtiter plates and maintained at 37 degrees c under anaerobic conditions for 2 days, after which, the quantity of organized biofilm on the plates was evaluated by crystal violet staining. growth enhancement via soluble factor was evaluated by separated coculture using a 0.4-mum membrane filter. results: f. nucleatum exhibited strong adherence to type-i collagen-coated polystyrene microplates. biofilm formation by f. nucleatum was significantly enhanced by p. gingivalis. it was complemented by compartmentalized coculture with p. gingivalis. enhancement of biofilm formation  by p. gingivalis was only slightly reduced by inactivation of its autoinducer-2-producing gene luxs. conclusion: the results suggest that p. gingivalis enhances biofilm formation by f. nucleatum by releasing diffusible signaling molecules other than autoinducer-2.

TI  == reliability of serum procalcitonin concentrations for the diagnosis of sepsis in  neonates.
AB  == the evaluation of tests for neonatal sepsis is important because the infection may present a very serious threat to the baby. extensive literature exists on single laboratory test or combinations of tests, as well as tests used together with risk factors and/or clinical signs, to diagnose neonatal sepsis. in many instances, the results of the evaluations have been conflicting. it has recently  been suggested that serum procalcitonin (pct) is of value: in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, with varying results. this study was designed to determine the reliability of pct concentrations as a new marker for the diagnosis of early neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission comparing to the traditional inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6 (il-6) and c-reactive protein (crp) values. the current study included 69 newborn babies. after full history and clinical examination, they were classified into 2 groups: group 1, included 27 of asymptomatic newborn infants admitted during the first 24 h of life to the neonatal unit because of prematurity, low birth weight. they had no clinical signs of sepsis during their first week of life and had a negative blood culture, and they did not receive antibiotic treatment. the second group: group 2, included 42 symptomatic neonates who were admitted to the neonatal care unit and  were evaluated for sepsis during the first 48 h of life, they were subclassified  into twosubgroups: group 2a; included 22 neonates of confirmed vertical neonatal  sepsis, defined as they had at least three clinical signs of infection with culture proven sepsis, and group 2b included 20 neonates of vertical clinical sepsis (they had at least three clinical signs of infection) with negative blood  culture. blood sampling for blood culture, complete blood count, blood gases and  blood chemistry, additionally, crp, serum il-6 and pct were measured. the microbial organisms isolated from the blood culture of group 2a; escherichia coli was isolated from 9 cases, staphylococcus aureus from 6 cases, staphylococcus epidermidis from 2 cases, group b streptococci (gbs) from 2 cases, ureaplasma from 2 cases and one case was gbs positive mother. the comparison between the studied groups revealed that, white blood cell counts (wbcs) and crp levels were  significantly increased in group 2a more than in group 1 and group 2b. while in group 2b the wbcs not differed from group 1 but crp differed from group 1. il-6 and pct values were significantly increased in group 2a more than in group 1 and  group 2b. furthermore in group 2b both were significantly increased as compared to group 1. for the diagnosis of neonatal infection, at cutoff >1.5 ng/ml, pct give a sensitivity of 92.9%, specificity of 85.2%, positive predictive value (ppv) of 84.8%, and negative predictive value (npv) of 76.7%. at a cutoff >140 ng/ml, il-6 gives a sensitivity of 76.2%, specificity of 70.4%, ppv of 64%, npv of 63.3%. however, at a cutoff >12 mg/l, crp gives a sensitivity of 88%, specificity of 77.8%, ppv of 77.1%, npv of 70%. we conclude that the serum pct concentration showed a good diagnostic value for the early detection of neonatal  sepsis of vertical transmission comparing with the other traditional markers of inflammations, thus may facilitate early therapeutic intervention in those high risk group.

TI  == a critical review of oxazolidinones: an alternative or replacement for glycopeptides and streptogramins?
AB  == objective: to review the available data on the oxazolidinones linezolid and eperezolid. data selection: published reports were obtained by searching medline  for articles published between 1992 and 2000, inclusive. references of published  papers were also obtained and reviewed. abstracts from scientific proceedings were reviewed. data extraction: due to the limited data available regarding these agents, the criteria for study inclusion were not restrictive. data synthesis: the oxazolidinones (eg, linezolid) are a new antimicrobial class with a unique mechanism of action. they are active against resistant gram-positive cocci including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococccus epidermidis, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp). linezolid is active against anaerobes and displays modest activity against fastidious gram-negative pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae, but is not active against enterobacteriaceae. linezolid is available  both orally and parenterally, and has a bioavailability of 100%. clinical trials  comparing linezolid with standard therapy have demonstrated similar bacteriological and clinical cures rates to standard therapy in community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia, uncomplicated and complicated skin and soft tissue infections, and infections caused by mrsa and vre. adverse effects have been minor and infrequent; however, platelets should be monitored in patients who have received more than two weeks of linezolid therapy. it is expected that these agents will have a bright future due to their excellent spectrum of activity against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive organisms, such as mrsa, vre and prsp, and their excellent bioavailability. conclusion: the oxazolidinones represent a new class of antimicrobials with a unique mechanism of action. they have excellent activity against susceptible and resistant gram-positive organisms such as mrsa, methicillin-susceptible s epidermidis, vre and prsp, and a good adverse  effect profile; they can be administered both intravenously and orally. their potential use in canada may be as an intravenous and oral alternative to glycopeptides and streptogramins.

TI  == necrotizing fasciitis in children: diagnostic and therapeutic aspects.
AB  == background: necrotizing fasciitis (nf) is a severe life-threatening soft tissue infection characterized by rapidly spreading necrosis of the fascia and the subcutaneous tissue. its incidence owing to invasive streptococcus pyogenes has significantly increased in children recently. our experience with nf in children  to describe diagnostic and therapeutic aspects is hence presented herein. methods: records of children who were treated for nf in our unit from 1999 to 2006, inclusive, were reviewed retrospectively. information recorded for each patient included medical history, clinical characteristics, diagnostic procedures, treatment methods, and the outcome. results: thirteen patients with a mean age of 35 months were treated for nf during the study period. all of the 13  children had no previous immunosuppression. the predisposing factors were composed of varicella lesions, intramuscular injections, application of a cream containing menthol to the cervical region, penetrant gluteal trauma, omphalitis,  dental abscess, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. the most common site of the initial involvement was the abdominal wall, followed by the gluteal region and thigh, head and neck, and upper and lower extremities. the initial skin presentations were induration or cellulitis and erythema and edema with progression to skin discoloration and bullae formation. fever and tachycardia were the most common clinical features. s. pyogenes was the most common causative microorganism, followed by staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all patients underwent extensive surgical debridement and received appropriate antibiotics and supportive therapy. twelve patients survived, and 1 patient with  delayed diagnosis of nf died of septic shock. conclusion: although these infections are rare in children, their lethal potential and early diagnostic signs must be recognized. all children with nf should undergo early surgical debridement to prevent delay in treatment. the mortality and morbidity associated with nf in children can be decreased with clinical awareness, early diagnosis, and adequate and urgent surgical debridement followed by intensive supportive care and early wound resurfacing.

TI  == review. leukocyte and endothelial cell adhesion molecules in inflammation focusing on inflammatory heart disease.
AB  == in multicellular organisms the development of adhesion bonds, either among cells  or among cells and components of the extracellular matrix, is a crucial process.  these interactions are mediated by molecules which are named adhesion molecules and play a main role both at the early stages of the development of tissue integrity and later. cell adhesion molecules (cams) have a key role in several pathologies such as cancer and inflammatory diseases. selectins, integrins and immunoglobulin gene superfamily of adhesion receptors mediate different steps of  leukocyte migration from the bloodstream towards the inflammatory foci. leukocyte interactions with the vascular endothelium are highly orchestrated processes that include the capture of free-flowing leukocytes from the blood with subsequent leukocyte rolling, arrest, firm adhesion and ensuing diapedesis. these interactions occur under high shear stresses within venules and depend on multiple families of adhesion molecules. as a response to infection mediators, leukocyte gathering is considered to be crucial for the adequate defence of the organism to any kind of injury or infection. endothelial activation contributes significantly to the systemic inflammatory response to bacteraemia and increased  expression. release of soluble endothelial markers into the circulation has been  demonstrated together with elevated plasma levels of cams and has been reported in bacteraemic patients. it has been proposed that infection of endothelial cells with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguis, or staphylococcus epidermidis  induces surface expression of icam-1 and vcam-1 and monocyte adhesion. in general, leukocyte/endothelial cell interactions such as capture, rolling, and firm adhesion can no longer be viewed as occurring in discrete steps mediated by  individual families of adhesion molecules but rather as a series of overlapping synergistic interactions among adhesion molecules resulting in an adhesion cascade. these cascades thereby direct leukocyte migration, which is essential for the generation of effective inflammatory responses and the development of rapid immune responses.

AB  == among several important considerations for implantation of a biomaterial, a main  concern is the introduction of infection. we have designed a hydrogel scaffold from the self-assembling peptide, max1, for tissue regeneration applications whose surface exhibits inherent antibacterial activity. in experiments where max1 gels are challenged with bacterial solutions ranging in concentrations from 2 x 10(3) colony forming units (cfus)/dm2 to 2 x 10(9) cfus/dm2, gel surfaces exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. results show that the hydrogel surface is  active against gram-positive (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli) bacteria, all prevalent in hospital settings. live-dead assays  employing laser scanning confocal microscopy show that bacteria are killed when they engage the surface. in addition, the surface of max1 hydrogels was shown to  cause inner and outer membrane disruption in experiments that monitor the release of beta-galactosidase from the cytoplasm of lactose permease-deficient e. coli ml-35. these data suggest a mechanism of antibacterial action that involves membrane disruption that leads to cell death upon cellular contact with the gel surface. although the hydrogel surface exhibits bactericidal activity, co-culture experiments indicate hydrogel surfaces show selective toxicity to bacterial versus mammalian cells. additionally, gel surfaces are nonhemolytic toward human  erythrocytes, which maintain healthy morphologies when in contact with the surface. these material attributes make max1 gels attractive candidates for use in tissue regeneration, even in nonsterile environments.

TI  == characterization of the physicochemical, antimicrobial, and drug release properties of thermoresponsive hydrogel copolymers designed for medical device applications.
AB  == in this study, a series of hydrogels was synthesized by free radical polymerization, namely poly(2-(hydroxyethyl)methacrylate) (phema), poly(4-(hydroxybutyl)methacrylate) (phbma), poly(6-(hydroxyhexyl)methacrylate) (phhma), and copolymers composed of n-isopropylacrylamide (nipaa), methacrylic acid (ma), nipaa, and the above monomers. the surface, mechanical, and swelling properties (at 20 and 37 degrees c, ph 6) of the polymers were determined using dynamic contact angle analysis, tensile analysis, and thermogravimetry, respectively. the t(g) and lower critical solution temperatures (lcst) were determined using modulated dsc and oscillatory rheometry, respectively. drug loading of the hydrogels with chlorhexidine diacetate was performed by immersion  in a drug solution at 20 degrees c (<lcst) and subsequent characterization of the drug release and antimicrobial properties performed at 20 and 37 degrees c. the composition of the hydrogels directly affected the advancing contact angle, mechanical properties, and swelling. thermoresponsive behavior was only observed  with hydrogels composed of hema, nipaa, ma, and nipaa in which pulsatile drug release was obtained by elevating the temperature from below to above the lcst. a greater mass and enhanced pulsatile release of drug, with the associated greater  antimicrobial properties (an 10(8) reduction in viability of staphylococcus epidermidis in 15 min), was associated with poly(nipaa-co-hema, 1:1). it is suggested that the pulsatile drug release and favorable antimicrobial and mechanical properties of candidate hydrogels, particularly poly(hema-co-nipaa), offer promise as thermoresponsive, antimicrobial biomaterials that may be used as wound dressings, medical implants, or coatings of medical devices. furthermore, it is suggested that drug loading may be effectively performed in situ by lowering the temperature of the device/dressing.

TI  == inhibitory effect of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  == objectives: to determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several gram-negative  and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. methods: the in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against h. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. time-kill assay was performed with two staphylococcus spp. strains. results: anti-h. pylori activity was detected with saccharomyces cerevisiae, bacillus spp., 1 enterococcus faecium and 2 lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 h. pylori strains tested. all staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-h. pylori effect: one staphylococcus auricularis and two staphylococcus epidermidis against all h. pylori tested; staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hominis and s. auricularis against six, five and seven h. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative staphylococcus against one h. pylori strain. an inhibitory effect was detected with one escherichia coli against one h. pylori. klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella spp. and acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four h. pylori strains, and enterobacter cloacae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14  h. pylori isolates. no anti-h. pylori activity was detected with one lactobacillus spp., two lactococcus lactis, four streptococcus spp., one bacillus cereus, one e. faecium, one enterococcus faecalis, one e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella oxytoca. time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two staphylococcus spp. strains tested. conclusions: several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit h. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of two antitumour agents and ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and the acetate form of its copper(ii) chelate.
AB  == some copper chelates have potent antitumour activity, and in some cases also the  free ligands have activity in vivo. yet, little is known about their antimicrobial properties. copper(ii) chelates of the thiosemicarbazones of a-n-heterocyclic carboxaldehydes constitute one important group of such agents, also their ligands having marked antitumour activity. both the ligands and chelates inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. some ligands have been or are under clinical trials as antineoplastic agents. i report here a study on the antimicrobial properties of the prototype compounds of this group, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and its copper(ii) chelate. they were tested against nine microbes, including bacteria (bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus lactis), yeasts (candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisiae) and one mold (aspergillus niger). two clinical isolates of bacillus sp. and one reference strain were also studied. both the ligand and the chelate had marked activity. the ligand displayed considerable activity against all bacteria except  for s. lactis, and its activity against e. coli and p. aeruginosa was that high that practical applications might be considued. it was highly active against a. niger and moderately active against c. albicans. the chelate was highly active against s. epidermidis and s. cerevisiae. both compounds inhibited the clinical isolates markedly. since some related ligands have been or are in clinical trials on humans or are entering them, their route to clinical use, also as antimicrobials, might be much more straightforward than that of substances, whose toxicity in humans is wholly unexplored.

TI  == mode of antibacterial action of a signal peptide, pep27 from streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity of pep27  and its mode of action. the results indicated pep27 exhibited antibacterial activities against pathogenic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria without hemolytic effect on human erythrocytes, but it did not exhibit antifungal activity. to understand the mode of action of pep27, the cellular distribution of the peptide was investigated. flow cytometry analysis exhibited pep27 penetrated  the bacterial membrane by an energy-independent pathway without any damage to the membrane when examined using liposome and membrane probe. after penetration into  the bacterial cells, pep27 was not affected by macromolecular synthesis, but activated protein phosphatase activity in dose ranges of 10-15 microm and time range of 5-10 min in case of staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. these results demonstrated the antibacterial activities of pep27 are fundamentally attributable to a physiological change by activated phosphatase activity.

TI  == levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced from cord blood in-vitro are pathogen dependent and increased in comparison to adult controls.
AB  == background: overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines may play a role in increased morbidity and mortality from neonatal sepsis. objective of this study was to compare secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by the cord blood cells of healthy term neonates to the venous blood cells of healthy adults in vitro after  stimulation with common neonatal pathogens. method: blood samples were cultured in the presence of heat-killed group b beta-hemolytic streptococci (gbs), escherichia coli (e. coli) and staphylococcus epidermidis (s. epi). concentrations of secreted cytokines (interleukine-6, il-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, tnf-alpha, interleukine-1 beta, il-1beta and interleukine-8, il-8)  were measured after 0, 1, 2 and 4 h of incubation using chemiluminescent immunometric automated assay. results: blood samples from 22 neonates and 16 adults were compared. after stimulation by gbs and e. coli, cord blood cells secreted significantly higher levels of il-6 and il-8 than blood cells of healthy adults. in cord blood, e. coli induced secretion of higher concentration of il-6, tnf-alpha, il-1beta and il-8 than s. epi, and more il-6 than gbs; gbs induced more il-1beta than s.epi. conclusions: response of cord blood to microbial activators is different from that of adult controls. each isolate of heat-killed  bacteria induced different amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro. this may represent a useful in vitro virulence test.

TI  == penetration of gatifloxacin eye drops into the aqueous humor in humans.
AB  == the authors topically administered gatifloxacin (gflx) into the eye before cataract surgery and measured the concentrations of this agent to determine its penetration into aqueous humor. seventy-seven patients with age-related cataracts who underwent cataract surgery were enrolled in this study. they received 0.3% gflx ophthalmic solution 4 times at 30-min intervals, beginning 2 h before surgery. aqueous humor was aspirated from the anterior chamber and assayed for gflx concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography. the mean intraoperative gflx concentration in aqueous humor was 0.485 +/- 0.328 microg/ml. gflx level was 0.573 +/- 0.367 microg/ml in elderly patients, at least 70 years of age, and was significantly higher than that (0.322 +/- 0.135 microg/ml) in the patients less than 70 years old. this concentration was close to or higher than the minimum inhibitory concentrations required to inhibit the growth of 90% of major pathogens of endophthalmitis (mic90), such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis associated with poor prognosis, other than staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) in vitro. the gflx concentrations found in aqueous humor samples were sufficient to kill bacteria other than s. epidermidis, p. aeruginosa, and mrsa in vitro.

TI  == microcalorimetry: a novel method for detection of microbial contamination in platelet products.
AB  == background: measuring heat from replicating microorganisms in culture may be a rapid, accurate, and simple screening method for platelets (plts). microcalorimetry for detection of microorganisms in in vitro contaminated plt products was evaluated. study design and methods: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguinis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and candida albicans were inoculated in single-donor apheresis plts to achieve target concentrations of 10(5), 10(3), 10, or 1 colony-forming units (cfu) per ml of plts. contaminated plts in growth medium were incubated at 37 degrees c for 5 days in a calorimeter. positivity was defined as heat flow of at least 10 microw above the lowest value of the power-time curve. results: with microcalorimetry, inocula of 10 cfus per ml plts  could be detected with the following detection times: s. epidermidis (31.65 hr),  s. aureus (24.24 hr), s. sanguinis (7.82 hr), e. coli (7.53 hr), p. acnes (73.57  hr), and c. albicans (43.77 hr). the detection time was less than 4 hr at 10(5) cfus per ml plts for s. aureus, s. sanguinis, and e. coli. noncontaminated plts remained negative. the total heat ranged from 2.8 (s. sanguinis) to 8.3 j (e. coli). the shape of the power-time curve was species-specific and independent from the initial concentration of microorganisms. conclusion: the detection limit of microcalorimetry was 1 to 10 cfus per ml plts. microcalorimetry is a promising novel method for detection of contaminated plts. applying this method to all plt  products could reduce the frequency of transfusion-related sepsis and prolong the shelf life of plts.

AB  == this study was undertaken to test the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 117 clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens and to correlate this activity with their resistance gene content. overall, tigecycline showed a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) range of 0.015-0.5mg/l, able to inhibit potently all multiresistant streptococci, enterococci and mr staphylococci. tigecycline was active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococci, with mics for 90% of the organisms (mic(90)) of 0.25 mg/l and 0.12 mg/l, respectively, being more active than linezolid (mic(90)=2 mg/l) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (mic(90)=0.5 and 2-4 mg/l, respectively). molecular characterisation of resistance determinants demonstrated the concomitant presence of different classes of genes: in particular, tet(m), erm(b) and erm(c) in streptococcus agalactiae; tet(o), variably associated with different erm genes, in streptococcus pyogenes; vana, tet(m) and erm(b) in enterococcus faecalis, and  vana and erm(b) in enterococcus faecium. all the mrsa strains harboured sccmec and erm genes and 50% possessed tet(k) with tet(m) genes. staphylococcus epidermidis strains were only resistant to erythromycin. these results clearly demonstrate that tigecycline has a mic(90) range of 0.015-0.5 mg/l both against tetracycline-susceptible and -resistant isolates carrying other resistance determinants, suggesting that this drug could play an important role in the treatment of infections caused by these multiresistant gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == reduced medical infection related bacterial strains adhesion on bioactive rgd modified titanium surfaces: a first step toward cell selective surfaces.
AB  == ideally, implants should inhibit nonspecific protein adsorption, bacterial adhesion, and at the same time, depending on the final application be selective toward cellular adhesion and spreading for all or only selected cell types. poly(l-lysine)-grafted-poly(ethylene glycol) (pll-g-peg) polymers have been shown to adsorb from aqueous solution onto negatively charged metal oxide surfaces, reducing protein adsorption as well as fibroblast, osteoblast and epithelial cell adhesion significantly. pll-g-peg can be functionalized with bioligands such as rgd (arg-gly-asp), which then restores host cell adhesion, but the surface remains resistant to nonspecific protein adsorption. previously, it was also shown that both nonfunctionalized pll-g-peg and rgd-peptide functionalized pll-g-peg reduced the adhesion of staphylococcus aureus to titanium (ti) surfaces. the present study looked at the effect of other implant associated infection relevant bacteria, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans and pseudomonas aeruginosa towards the same surface chemistries. the different surfaces were exposed to the bacteria for 1-24 h, and bacteria surface density was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (sem) and fluorescence light microscopy (fm). the adhesion of all bacteria strains tested was reduced on ti surfaces coated with pll-g-peg compared to uncoated ti surfaces even in the presence of rgd. the percentage reduction in bacterial adhesion over the 24-h culture time investigated was 88%-98%, depending on the bacteria type. therefore, coating surfaces with pll-g-peg/peg-rgd allows cells such as fibroblasts and osteoblasts to attach but not bacteria, resulting in a selective biointeractive pattern that may be useful on medical implants.

AB  == objectives: to review patients with toxic shock syndrome (tss) in a pediatric intensive care unit. methods: we performed a retrospective study of patients with tss admitted to the intensive care unit in the previous 15 years. the patients included were those that met the clinical and microbiological criteria for tss proposed by the centers for disease control and prevention. results: there were nine patients (four boys). the mean age was 7 years. the most frequent findings were fever (100 %), hypotension (100 %), erythroderma (100 %), multisystem organ  failure [coagulopathy (100 %), lethargy (89 %), hypertransaminasemia (89 %), increased creatine phosphokinase levels (78 %), renal failure (66 %)] and cutaneous desquamation (100 %). laboratory studies showed changes in the leukocyte count and c-reactive protein value in all patients. the etiology was as follows: staphylococcus was detected in six patients (s. epidermidis in three and s. aureus in three) and streptococcus was detected in two patients (s. pyogenes in one and s. pneumoniae in one); no microorganisms were detected in only one patient. the origin of the infection was identified in seven patients (cutaneous  in six patients and tonsillar in one). all patients received life support and antibiotic treatment. six patients received corticosteroid treatment and one received intravenous immunoglobulins. patients with tss secondary to streptococcus showed the greatest severity, exhibiting renal failure and requiring greater respiratory and circulatory support. all patients recovered well from the infection, without serious long-term sequelae. conclusion. tss should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with fever, exanthema and shock, since early diagnosis has been shown to improve outcomes. s. pneumoniae should be included among the microorganisms that cause tss. treatment  is based on life support measures and antibiotic therapy.

TI  == prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  == background: this study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (plt)  components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. study design and methods: twenty-one double-dose plts were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml). after split, each plt unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 cfus. one unit was photochemically treated (pct; 150 micromol/l amotosalen and 3 j/cm(2) ultraviolet a). the other unit was untreated. all units were stored and sampled on days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the bact/alert system (biomerieux). plts were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. results: in all pct plts, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. in untreated plts, staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. growth of 1 to 10 cfus per unit staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 cfus per unit of klebsiella pneumoniae, and  1 to 1000 cfus per unit propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. low levels of streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 cfus/unit), escherichia coli (1-100 cfus/unit), and clostridium  perfringens (1-100 cfus/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. conclusions: for the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated plts may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. in contrast, bacterial  inactivation by pct could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of plts contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.

TI  == identification of antibacterial constituents from the indigenous australian medicinal plant eremophila duttonii f. muell. (myoporaceae).
AB  == this paper reports on the isolation and identification of antibacterial constituents from the indigenous australian medicinal plant eremophila duttonii f. muell. (myoporaceae). preparations derived from this plant are used by indigenous populations in the topical treatment of minor wounds, otitis and ocular complaints, and as a gargle for sore throat. several authors have reported extracts of this plant to effect rapid bacteriolysis and inhibit growth of a wide range of gram-positive micro-organisms. in other studies involving screening of native medicinal plants for antibacterial activity, extracts of eremophila duttonii have been reported to consistently exhibit the highest potency amongst all species included. from a hexane extract, we identified two diterpenes of the  serrulatane class, the principal constituents responsible for antibacterial activity and present as major constituents of the resinous leaf cuticle: serrulat-14-en-7,8,20-triol (1) and serrulat-14-en-3,7,8,20-tetraol (2). in addition, a hydroxylated furanosesquiterpene with mild antibacterial activity which appeared to be a novel compound was isolated from the extract and tentatively identified as 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-1-(2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-5-methyl[2,3'-bifuran]-5-yl) pentan-2-one. minimum inhibitory concentrations for each of the compounds against three gram-positive bacteria: staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), staphylococcus  epidermidis (atcc 12228) and streptococcus pneumoniae (arl 10582), were determined using a micro-titre plate broth dilution assay.

TI  == synthesis and in vitro evaluation of substituted phenyl-piperazinyl-phenyl oxazolidinones against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == with the incidence of linezolid-resistant enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium and staphylococcus aureus, modification of linezolid at the 5- and/or 3-positions led to the development of a series of 3-(methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl-phenyl oxazolidinone analogues. these compounds were tested in vitro against six gram-positive standard organisms (s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. pneumoniae, s. albus, streptococcus enteridis and s. nonhemolyticus). 5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinones bearing fluorine at 3'-position of phenyl ring showed activities against several gram-positive bacteria (mic: 3.13-6.25 mug/ml). the position of methoxyl group on the phenyl ring of piperazine group affected antibacterial spectrum. 3-(4'- (para-methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl)-(3'-fluoro)-phenyl-5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinone was found active against 5 gram-positive organisms except s. nonhemolyticus, whereas 3-(4'-(ortho-methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl)-(3'-fluoro)-phenyl-5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinone was found active only against 2 gram-positive organisms, namely s.  albus, s. enteridis.

TI  == albomycin is an effective antibiotic, as exemplified with yersinia enterocolitica and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == albomycin belongs to the class of sideromycins, compounds composed of iron carriers linked to antibiotic moieties. albomycin was found to be active against  bacteria that have a functional ferric hydroxamate transport system meaning that  bacteria will actively transport albomycin until they die. we examined the activity spectrum of albomycin for bacterial pathogens and found that enterobacteriaceae except species of proteus and morganella were sensitive. resistance in the two genera was due to the lack of the ferric hydroxamate transport system. among gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive, whereas streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus epidermidis were resistant. the in vivo efficacy of albomycin was examined in mice infected with s. pneumoniae or yersinia enterocolitica. a single dose of 10mg albomycin/kg body weight reduced the colony-forming units of y. enterocolitica by three to four orders of magnitude. a single dose of 1mg albomycin/kg body weight was sufficient to clear  s. pneumoniae infections in mice. in direct competition experiments with wild-type s. pneumoniae and its albomycin-resistant mutant, the recovery rate of  the mutant was lower than for the wild-type indicating that the mutant had reduced fitness in the mouse model. we conclude that albomycin is effective in clearing infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in a  mouse model. albomycin treatment reduces the bacterial load allowing the immune system to remove residual albomycin-resistant bacteria, and as such would make albomycin-based antibiotics an adjunct to treatment. the ferrichrome transport system serves as a trojan horse to get albomycin into bacteria.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == reversal of resistance in microorganisms by help of non-antibiotics.
AB  == intracellular efflux pumps have been largely the research focus in multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms and parasites including cancers. however, drug efflux mechanisms other than pumps per se have been observed, supported by the effects of isomeric, non-antibiotic depressant (dpr), phenothiazines and thixenes, and antidepressant (adpr) phenylpiperidine neurotropic drugs, alone or in combination with classical antimicrobials on mdr staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. of the non-antibiotics we investigated, the dpr l-thioridazine, trans-clopenthixol and isomers of phenylpiperidines nnc 20-4962 (isomer of femoxetine) and nnc 20-7052 (isomer of paroxetine) were potent antimicrobials with the least neurotropic activity, pointing to a possible general isomeric structure-activity  relationship. these compounds may be regarded as new efflux inhibitors. moreover, these isomers have considerably reduced, in some cases absent, neurotropism and reduced mammalian toxicity. this may alleviate concerns about adverse effects and therapeutic safety for infected patients in life-threatening situations where the non-antibiotic dosage would be in the lower, non-chronic dosage ranges generally  prescribed for individuals with mild mental health problems. the results point to the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms' phospholipid/protein domain involvement of the cationic, amphiphilic, non-antibiotic dpr and adpr, with the phospholipids being the initial sites attracting and concentrating the neurotropes to induce a form of suspended animation, followed by gross changes of cell wall and membrane structure, and thereby potentiating their destructive or immobilizing effects on various as yet only hinted at resistance and efflux mechanisms. combination of appropriate isomeric non-antibiotic dpr and adpr of low neurotropism and toxicity with conventional and classical antimicrobials promises early, new therapeutic strategies salutary against microbial resistance, resistance development, pathogenicity and virulence.

TI  == increased blood levels of igg reactive with secreted streptococcus pyogenes proteins in chronic plaque psoriasis.
AB  == a pathogenic role for streptococcus (s) pyogenes infections in chronic plaque psoriasis is suspected but poorly defined. we separated cellular and supernatant  proteins from s. pyogenes cultures by high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and used immunoblotting to demonstrate the diversity of serum or plasma iggs that react with elements of the proteome of this bacterium. we have shown that a substantial proportion of igg-reactive proteins from cultured s. pyogenes are secreted. the total secreted protein fraction, including diverse igg-binding elements, was subsequently used in an elisa to measure blood titers of reactive igg. this elisa showed that blood samples from patients with chronic  plaque psoriasis contained significantly higher titers of reactive igg than samples from age- and sex-matched healthy controls (p=0.0009). in contrast, neither a standard assay measuring antistreptolysin o titers nor elisas measuring titers of igg reactive with protein fractions from staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, were able to distinguish between blood samples from the two groups. these findings justify the hypothesis that s. pyogenes infections are more important in the pathogenesis of chronic plaque psoriasis than has previously been recognized, and indicate the need for further controlled therapeutic trials of antibacterial measures in this common skin disease.

TI  == characterization of macrolide resistance in gram-positive cocci from colombian hospitals: a countrywide surveillance.
AB  == objective: the characterization of macrolide resistance in gram-positive cocci recovered from colombian hospitals. methods: the resistance profiles and mechanism of macrolide resistance were investigated in isolates of streptococcus  pneumoniae (1679), staphylococcus aureus (348), coagulase-negative staphylococci  (cons) (175), and enterococcus spp (123). minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for erythromycin (ery) and clindamycin (cli), detection of macrolide resistance genes, phenotypic characterization, and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge) of macrolide-resistant pneumococci were performed. results: resistance to ery and cli was 3.3% and 2.3% for s. pneumoniae, 58% and 57% for s. aureus (94% for both compounds in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa)), and 78.6% and 60.7% in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, respectively. ery resistance was 62% in enterococcus faecalis and 82% in enterococcus faecium. the mls(b)-type accounted for 71% of s. pneumoniae and 100% of mrsa. the erm(a) gene was prevalent in mrsa, erm(b) in s. pneumoniae  and enterococci, and erm(c) in cons isolates. efflux pump genes (mef(a) genes) were mostly identified in s. pneumoniae (24%). the most common genotype amongst ery-resistant pneumococci was the spain(6b)-2 clone. conclusions: the prevalence  of macrolide resistance is low in colombian pneumococci and high in mrsa (cmls(b)-type).

TI  == antimicrobial properties of nanocrystalline tetracalcium phosphate cements.
AB  == the antimicrobial properties of cements prepared from mechanically activated tetracalcium phosphate (mattcp) were tested with the agar diffusion test using streptococcus salivarius, staphylococcus epidermidis, and a clinically isolated plaque mixture. all mattcp cements showed a significantly higher antimicrobial potency as revealed by inhibition zones of approximately 3-5 mm width, compared with a commercial ca(oh)(2)//salicylate cement which only produced small inhibition zones around the cement specimens of 1.5 mm or less. this behavior was explained by the formation of amorphous ca(oh)(2) during setting of mattcp cements, which is thought to have a higher solubility and may release more oh(-)  ions than conventional ca(oh)(2)//salicylate cements. in fact, the ph value in the agar gel around the specimens was higher in the case of mattcp cements (7.8-8.7) compared with the ca(oh)(2)//salicylate control (7.0-8.0). the mattcp cements did not affect the photoactivation of resin-based composites, and their antimicrobial activity is making them interesting candidates for the use as pulp-capping agents, endodontic sealers, or cavity liners in dentistry.

TI  == dry reagent dipstick test combined with 23s rrna pcr for molecular diagnosis of bacterial infection in arthroplasty.
AB  == periprosthetic joint infections present a challenging problem in orthopaedics. conventional methods for detection of arthroplasty infections rely on bacterial culture of synovial fluid aspirates. during recent years, however, molecular tests that are based on dna amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr), followed by electrophoretic analysis of the products, have been introduced. we report a simple and inexpensive assay that allows visual detection and confirmation of the pcr-amplified sequences by hybridization within minutes. the  assay is performed in a dry reagent dipstick format (strip) and does not require  special instrumentation. universal primers are used for pcr of the 23s ribosomal  rna (rrna) gene. the biotinylated amplification product is hybridized with da-tailed probes that are specific for six pathogens commonly involved in periprosthetic joint infections. the mixture is applied to the strip, which is then immersed in the appropriate buffer. the buffer migrates along the strip by capillary action and rehydrates gold nanoparticles with oligo(dt) strands attached to their surface. the nanoparticles bind to the target dna through hybridization, and the hybrids are captured by immobilized streptavidin at the test zone of the strip, producing a characteristic red line. unbound nanoparticles are captured by immobilized oligo(dt) strands at the control zone of the strip, generating a second line. the dipstick test was applied to the detection of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faesium, and haemophilus influenza. twelve samples of synovial fluids from patients were analyzed for the detection and identification of the infection caused by the six pathogens. the results were compared with bacterial cultures.

TI  == influence of harvest bacterial contamination on autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells post-transplant.
AB  == microbiological contamination of manipulated blood products, including hematopoietic progenitors obtained from peripheral blood, is an infrequent but persistent problem in transplant units. the relevance of such contamination in causing patient infection has been reported as insignificant, but the effect on the post-transplant course has not been well documented. we studied the incidence of bacterial contamination in autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplants in two of the bench processing steps, as well as the repercussions in the post-transplant course affecting incidence of infections, transfusion requirements and time to engraftment. a total of 365 aphereses performed on 152 patients were cryopreserved in 617 bags. in 31 of these bags (5.0%), bacterial cultures were positive for coagulase-negative staphylococcus (31.1%), s. epidermidis (21.9%), corynebacterium sp. (6.3%), s. warneri (6.3%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (6.3%), streptococcus sp. (9.4%), viridans group streptococcus (3.1%) and more than one bacteria (coagulase-negative staphylococcus plus corynebacterium) (15.6%). half of the bags were contaminated  at the time of freezing and the others at the time of thawing. the 31 contaminated bags were infused into 17 patients. in five of these the same contaminating bacteria was found. no difference between the two groups of patients (contaminated and non-contaminated) was found on the day the fever started, length of fever, blood transfusion requirements and engraftment, but length of hospitalization was significantly greater in patients receiving contaminated transplants.

TI  == first complete genome sequence of two staphylococcus epidermidis bacteriophages.
AB  == staphylococcus epidermidis is an important opportunistic pathogen causing nosocomial infections and is often associated with infections in patients with implanted prosthetic devices. a number of virulence determinants have been identified in s. epidermidis, which are typically acquired through horizontal gene transfer. due to the high recombination potential, bacteriophages play an important role in these transfer events. knowledge of phage genome sequences provides insights into phage-host biology and evolution. we present the complete  genome sequence and a molecular characterization of two s. epidermidis phages, phiph15 (ph15) and phicnph82 (cnph82). both phages belonged to the siphoviridae family and produced stable lysogens. the ph15 and cnph82 genomes displayed high sequence homology; however, our analyses also revealed important functional differences. the ph15 genome contained two introns, and in vivo splicing of phage mrnas was demonstrated for both introns. secondary structures for both introns were also predicted and showed high similarity to those of streptococcus thermophilus phage 2972 introns. an additional finding was differential superinfection inhibition between the two phages that corresponded with differences in nucleotide sequence and overall gene content within the lysogeny module. we conducted phylogenetic analyses on all known siphoviridae, which showed ph15 and cnph82 clustering with staphylococcus aureus, creating a novel clade within the s. aureus group and providing a higher overall resolution of the siphophage branch of the phage proteomic tree than previous studies. until now, no s. epidermidis phage genome sequences have been reported in the literature, and thus this study represents the first complete genomic and molecular description of two s. epidermidis phages.

TI  == an alternative infrared spectroscopy assay for the quantification of polysaccharides in bacterial samples.
AB  == the ability of bacteria to produce extracellular polysaccharides has been regarded as an indication of biofilm-forming capacity. therefore, the determination of the sugar content in bacterial samples becomes a significant parameter. the colorimetric methods currently used are rather sensitive to the nature of the sugars and therefore require knowledge of the sugar types present in the samples. unfortunately, the types of sugars present in bacteria are generally unknown and often composed of a complex mixture. in this article, we propose an alternative method based on fourier transform infrared (ftir) spectroscopy for the estimation of the total sugar content in bacterial samples.  the method is based on a systematic treatment of ftir spectra obtained from dried bacteria samples. it is assumed that the total sugar amount can be estimated from the area of characteristic bands between 970 and 1182 cm(-1). in parallel, the amide ii band (1560-1530 cm(-1)) associated with proteins, or the c-h stretching  region (2820-3020 cm(-1)) associated with the biomass, can be used for normalization purposes. therefore, the ratio of the band area in the sugar window over that of the amide ii or c-h stretching can be used to report the sugar content in bacterial samples. this method has been validated on model bacterial mixtures containing sugars, proteins, and dna. results with real bacterial samples are also provided and show conclusively that increased sugar contents in  biofilms can be identified. the proposed ftir approach requires minimal sample preparation and a single acquisition, is rapid, and may be applied to any kind of bacterial growth.

AB  == purpose of the study: infection is a rare complication of shoulder arthroplasty.  various therapeutic solutions have been proposed: antibiotics alone, one-stage or two-stage reimplantation, surgical or arthroscopic cleaning without prosthesis removal, scapulohumeral arthrodesis or simple arthroscopic resection. we evaluated the mid-term clinical outcome after resection arthroplasty for the treatment of infected shoulder arthroplasty. material and methods: the series included ten infected arthroplasties in ten patients. mean duration of implantation was two years seven months (range nine months to five years). bacteriological diagnosis was established from intraoperative articular samples or systematic samples taken during surgical revision procedures: meti-s staphylococcus aureus strains (n=4), coagulase-negative staphylococcus (n=5 including three s. epidermidis) streptococcus mitis (n=1) and citrobacter koseri  (n=1). the mean constant score before revision was 58 (range 23-77). subjective patient satisfaction before surgical revision was rated good in six cases, fair in one and poor in three. surgery associated removal of the implant, complete resection of the cement, resection of the fistular tracts, wide debridement of infected tissues and total synovectomy. results: patients were seen at an average follow-up of three years eight months. the objective functional outcome measured  with the constant score was only fair, 28 points (range 20.6-36), and corresponded to a loss of 29 points compared with the preoperative score. this was explained mainly by lower scores for joint motion, function and muscle force  but with persistently satisfactory scores for pain. all patients remained pain-free (daytime and nighttime). patient satisfaction was rated good for two, fair for five and mediocre for three. clinical and biological proof of eradicated infection was obtained in all patients. discussion: infection remains a serious devastating problem for shoulder arthroplasty with an important functional impact. resection only has a modest clinical effect. precise identification of the causal germ with institution of adapted antibiotic therapy is required for eradication of the infection. early diagnosis is probably the most important parameter affecting clinical outcome and surgical options. functional results after resection arthroplasty are modest. this procedure should be reserved for patients with reduced functional demands. improved management of the infectious load and reduction of diagnostic delay should help improve functional outcome and favor use of stow-stage procedures for reinsertion.

TI  == pyrazolidine-3,5-diones and 5-hydroxy-1h-pyrazol-3(2h)-ones, inhibitors of udp-n-acetylenolpyruvyl glucosamine reductase.
AB  == a series of pyrazolidine-3,5-dione and 5-hydroxy-1h-pyrazol-3(2h)-one inhibitors  of escherichia coli udp-n-acetylenolpyruvyl glucosamine reductase (murb) has been prepared. the 5-hydroxy-1h-pyrazol-3(2h)-ones show low micromolar ic(50) values versus e. coli murb and submicromolar minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) against staphylococcus aureus gc 1131, enterococcus faecalis gc 2242, streptococcus pneumoniae gc 1894, and e. coli gc 4560 imp, a strain with increased outer membrane permeability. none of these compounds show antimicrobial activity against candida albicans, a marker of eukaryotic toxicity. moreover, these compounds inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis, as assessed by measuring the  amount of soluble peptidoglycan produced by streptococcus epidermidis upon incubation with compounds. a partial least squares projection to latent structures analysis shows that improving murb potency and mic values correlate with increasing lipophilicity of the c-4 substituent of the 5-hydroxy-1h-pyrazol-3(2h)-one core. docking studies using flo and pharmdock produced several binding orientations for these molecules in the murb active site.

TI  == antibacterial agent discovery using thymidylate synthase biolibrary screening.
AB  == thymidylate synthase (ts, thya) catalyzes the reductive methylation of 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate to 2'-deoxythymidine 5'-monophosphate, an essential precursor for dna synthesis. a specific inhibition of this enzyme induces bacterial cell death. as a second round lead optimization design, new 1,2-naphthalein derivatives have been synthesized and tested against a ts-based biolibrary, including human thymidylate synthase (hts). docking studies have been performed to rationalize the experimentally observed affinity profiles of 1,2-naphthalein compounds toward lactobacillus casei ts and hts. the best ts inhibitors have been tested against a number of clinical isolates of gram-positive-resistant bacterial strains. compound 3,3-bis(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyphenyl)-1h,3h-naphtho[1,2-c]furan-1-one (5) showed significant antibacterial activity, no in vitro toxicity, and dose-response effects against staphylococcus epidermidis (mic=0.5-2.5 microg/ml) clinical isolate strains, which are resistant to at least 17 of the best known antibacterial agents, including vancomycin. so far this compound can be regarded  as a leading antibacterial agent.

TI  == surgical site infections in day surgery settings.
AB  == background: because major complications are rare in day surgery, minor morbidities such as surgical site infections, which become evident only after patient discharge, have a major impact on the perceived quality of care. we performed an audit of such infections over a oneyear period. methods: all procedures were performed in a multidisciplinary day surgery setting. there were  155 inguinal hernia repairs, 44 excisions of lipomas, and 27 excisions of pilonidal cysts. all patients received antibiotic prophylaxis according to a rotation protocol. results: one patient (0.65%) operated on for inguinal hernia developed a deep incisional infection caused by staphylococcus schleiferi. the patient was treated using selective antibiotics, and complete recovery ensued. one patient (2.27%) who underwent excision of a lipoma revealed developed a deep  incisional infection associated with fever (39 degrees c) caused by staphylococcus aureus. he was treated by daily antibiotics and application of dressings for two weeks and recovered. one patient (3.7%) treated for pilonidal cyst developed a deep incisional surgical site infection. a group a streptococcus was isolated, and he received an intravenous antibiotic for ten days. in the seven patients treated for pilonidal cyst with the wound left open, swab specimens were taken because of persisting local pain, and the following bacteria were found: pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus vulgaris, and streptococcus constellatus. no antibiotic therapy was given, and local wound care led to complete recovery. conclusion: in our day surgery unit, the rates of surgical site infection are similar to those described in the literature. continuing audit is essential to maintain and improve the quality and standard of the surgery provided. prevention of surgical site infection is very much the responsibility of the persons working in the operating theater. therefore, it is vital not only to apply strict regulations concerning everyday management but also to maintain a high degree of motivation among the personnel.

TI  == microchip-based one step dna extraction and real-time pcr in one chamber for rapid pathogen identification.
AB  == optimal detection of a pathogen present in biological samples depends on the ability to extract dna molecules rapidly and efficiently. in this paper, we report a novel method for efficient dna extraction and subsequent real-time detection in a single microchip by combining laser irradiation and magnetic beads. by using a 808 nm laser and carboxyl-terminated magnetic beads, we demonstrate that a single pulse of 40 seconds lysed pathogens including e. coli and gram-positive bacterial cells as well as the hepatitis b virus mixed with human serum. we further demonstrate that the real-time pathogen detection was performed with pre-mixed pcr reagents in a real-time pcr machine using the same microchip, after laser irradiation in a hand-held device equipped with a small laser diode. these results suggest that the new sample preparation method is well suited to be integrated into lab-on-a-chip application of the pathogen detection  system.

TI  == effect of bacteriocin produced by lactococcus sp. hy 449 on skin-inflammatory bacteria.
AB  == this study was carried out to evaluate the effect of bacteriocin produced by lactococcus sp. hy 449 against skin-inflammatory bacteria such as staphylococcus  epidermidis atcc 12228, staphylococcus aureus atcc 65389, streptococcus pyogenes  atcc 21059, and propionibacterium acnes atcc 6919. the spot-on-the-lawn method was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin against indicator strains on the human skin. the bacteriocin produced by lactococcus sp. hy 449 inhibited the growth of s. epidermidis atcc 12228, s. aureus atcc 65389, strep. pyogenes atcc 21059, and p. acnes atcc 6919. the treatment of crude bacteriocin caused a rapid inactivation of p. acnes atcc 6919. the lc50 of bacteriocin on human fibroblast was ca. 50mg/ml at which the inhibition of cell proliferation was not observed. neither any irritations nor allergic reactions by the bacteriocin were evident in a human patch test. the bacteriocin produced by lactococcus sp. hy 449 may be a useful antimicrobial substance to control the growth of p. acnes and to prevent skin inflammation and acne.

TI  == capillary isoelectric focusing of microorganisms in the ph range 2-5 in a dynamically modified fs capillary with uv detection.
AB  == the isoelectric points of many microbial cells lie within the ph range spanning from 1.5 to 4.5. in this work, we suggest a cief method for the separation of cells according to their isoelectric points in the ph range of 2-5. it includes the segmental injection of the sample pulse composed of the segment of the selected simple ampholytes, the segment of the bioanalytes and the segment of carrier ampholytes into fused silica capillaries dynamically modified by poly(ethylene glycole). this polymer dissolved in the catholyte, in the anolyte and in the injected sample pulse was used for a prevention of the bioanalyte adsorption on the capillary surface and for the reduction of the electroosmotic flow. between each focusing run, the capillaries were washed with the mixture of  acetone/ethanol to achieve the reproducible and efficient cief. in order to trace of ph gradients, low-molecular-mass pi markers were used. the mixed cultures of microorganisms, escherichia coli ccm 3954, candida albicans ccm 8180, candida parapsilosis, candida krusei, candida glabrata, candida tropicalis, ccm 8223, proteus vulgaris, klebsiela pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus ccm 3953, streptococcus agalactiae ccm 6187, enterococcus faecalis ccm 4224 and staphylococcus epidermidis ccm 4418, were focused and separated by the cief method suggested here. this cief method enables the separation and detection of the microbes from the mixed cultures within several minutes. the minimum detectable number of microbial cells was less than 10(3).

TI  == vancomycin tolerance, a potential mechanism for refractory gram-positive bacteremia observational study in patients with cancer.
AB  == background: the clinical significance of infections caused by vancomycin-tolerant (vt) gram-positive organisms in patients with cancer remains unclear. methods: twenty-five patients with nonenterococcal gram-positive bloodstream infection, which was refractory to vancomycin therapy, were identified by reviewing the infectious diseases consultation database at the tertiary care cancer center. among these, 8 patients in whom vancomycin-tolerance was documented are described. antibiotic tolerance was defined as a > 32 times increase in minimum bactericidal concentration compared with minimum inhibitory concentration. results: eight patients with persistent fever and bacteremia of > 72 hours' duration after the initiation of vancomycin therapy were treated. the median age  of these patients, which included 3 men and 5 women, was 44 years +/- 11 years. solid tumors were more common (6 patients) and 2 patients had acute leukemia. six patients (75%) were neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count < 500/mm3), including  2 breast cancer patients who had undergone autologous stem cell transplantation.  the causative organisms were staphylococcus aureus (n = 3 patients), group g streptococci (n = 2 patients), and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus sanguis (1 patient each). all isolates demonstrated a minimum bactericidal concentration for vancomycin that was at least 32 times greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration. rapid defervescence (< or = 24 h) and resolution of bacteremia occurred with the addition of gentamicin (4 patients) or gentamicin plus rifampin (4 patients). none of these infections recurred after discontinuation of therapy. conclusions: lack of clinical and/or microbiologic response to vancomycin should raise the suspicion of possible infection due to vt gram-positive bacteria, and alternative bactericidal therapy  should be instituted early, especially in patients with underlying immune suppression.

TI  == bacteraemia in homozygous sickle cell disease in africa: is pneumococcal prophylaxis justified?
AB  == background: the high frequency of streptococcus pneumoniae as a cause of bacteraemia in homozygous sickle cell (ss) disease and its effective prevention has led to the routine use of pneumococcal prophylaxis in developed countries. the reported infrequency of this organism as a cause of bacteraemia in ss disease in africa raises questions on the epidemiology of bacterial infection and on the  need for pneumococcal prophylaxis in that continent. methods: a study of blood cultures in 155 ugandan children (165 episodes) with ss disease and axillary temperatures of > or =38 degrees c, attending the university teaching hospital in kampala (uganda, east africa). results: positive blood cultures, obtained in 47/165 episodes, showed staphylococcus aureus in 28 (60%) samples, haemophilus influenzae in 9 (19%), staphylococcus epidermidis in 4 (9%), and single cases of  streptococcus viridans, escherichia coli and an unidentified gram negative rod. streptococcus pneumoniae was identified in only 3 (6%) episode. conclusion: the infrequent isolation of streptococcus pneumoniae from febrile children with ss disease in this study and in four other studies from nigeria raises questions on  a different spectrum of bacterial causes for bacteraemia in malarial areas. there are several possible explanations for this finding, but the data cast sufficient  doubt on the case for pneumococcal prophylaxis for a controlled trial on its effectiveness in that environment to seem justified. these data are necessary to  determine its role in african children and to provide the evidence base for healthcare authorities in equatorial africa.

TI  == promotion of opsonization by antibodies and phagocytosis of gram-positive bacteria by a bifunctional polyacrylamide.
AB  == this paper describes the application of a bifunctional polyacrylamide (pa-v-f) presenting both vancomycin and fluorescein groups, to modify the surfaces of multiple species of gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis) to control molecular recognition of these surfaces. the vancomycin groups allowed the specific recognition of a structural component of the bacterial cell wall: peptides terminated in d-ala-d-ala. the fluorescein groups allowed the imaging of binding of polymer to the surfaces of bacteria by fluorescence, and are representative, low molecular weight haptens; their recognition by anti-fluorescein antibodies provides proof-of-principle that bifunctional polymers can be used to introduce haptens onto the surface of the bacteria. flow  cytometry revealed that polymer-labeled s. aureus and s. pneumoniae were opsonized by anti-fluorescein antibodies approximately 20-fold more than were untreated bacteria; nearly all ( approximately 92%) polymer-labeled s. aureus, and a large (76%) fraction of polymer-labeled s. pneumoniae were opsonized. the bound antibodies then promoted phagocytosis of the bacteria by cultured j774 macrophage-like cells. flow cytometry revealed that macrophages ingested s. aureus decorated with the polymer-antibody complexes approximately 2-fold more efficiently than s. aureus in control groups, in spite of the high background (caused by efficient antibody-independent ingestion of s. aureus by macrophages). this paper, thus, demonstrates the ability of a bifunctional polymer to carry out three distinct functions based on polyvalent molecular recognition: (i) recognition of the surface of gram-positive bacteria, (ii) modification of this surface to generate specific binding sites recognized by an antibody, and (iii) promotion of phagocytosis of the opsonized bacteria.

AB  == rapid detection of micro-organisms from blood is one of the most critical functions of a diagnostic microbiology laboratory. automated blood-culture systems reduce the time needed to detect positive cultures, and reduce specimen handling. the false-positive rate of such systems is 1-10%. in this study, the presence of pathogens in 'false-positive' bottles obtained from bactec 9050 (becton dickinson) and bact/alert (biomerieux) systems was investigated by eubacterial and fungal pcr. a total of 169 subculture-negative aerobic blood-culture bottles (104 bact/alert and 65 bactec) were evaluated. both fungal  and eubacterial pcrs were negative for all bactec bottles. fungal pcr was also negative for the bact/alert system, but 10 bottles (9.6%) gave positive results by eubacterial pcr. sequence analysis of the positive pcr amplicons indicated the presence of the following bacteria (number of isolates in parentheses): pasteurella multocida (1), staphylococcus epidermidis (2), staphylococcus hominis (1), micrococcus sp. (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (1), corynebacterium spp. (2), brachibacterium sp. (1) and arthrobacter/rothia sp. (1). antibiotic usage by the  patients may be responsible for the inability of the laboratory to grow these bacteria on subcultures. for patients with more than one false-positive bottle, molecular methods can be used to evaluate the microbial dna in these bottles. false positives from the bactec system may be due to elevated patient leukocyte counts or the high sensitivity of the system to background increases in co(2) concentration.

TI  == novel synthetic molecules targeting the bacterial rna polymerase assembly.
AB  == objectives: despite extensive functional screening of the bacterial rna polymerase (rnap) over the past years, very few novel inhibitors have been reported. we have, therefore, decided to screen with a radically different, non-enzymic, protein-protein interaction assay. our target is the highly conserved rnap-sigma interaction that is essential for transcription. methods: small molecule inhibitors of the rnap-sigma interaction were tested for their activity on transcription and on bacteria. results: these compounds have antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria including multiresistant clinical isolates. conclusions: this is, to our knowledge, the first example of a small molecule inhibitor of this interaction.

TI  == etiology of implant orthopedic infections: a survey on 1027 clinical isolates.
AB  == in spite of the recent achievements derived from modern protocols of prophylaxis, orthopedic surgical infections still remain unacceptably frequent, especially in  light of the often devastating outcomes of septic complications. the spectrum and the prevalence of the bacteria most frequently involved in orthopedic infections  are here explored, with particular reference to those infections associated to implant biomaterials, which were grouped based on device typology. during a 30 months period (from september 2000 to april 2003), 1027 microbial strains were consecutively isolated from 699 patients undergoing revision surgery at the rizzoli orthopedic institute. 775 (75.5%) of all these microorganisms were identified as belonging to the staphylococcus genus, 82 (8%) to the enterobacteriaceae family, 75 (7.3%) to the pseudomonas genus, 54 (5.3%) to the enterococcus genus and 20 (1.9%) to the streptococcus genus. while confirming the importance of staphylococci as the most diffuse cause of infection, our data indicate an unexpectedly high prevalence of s. epidermidis on infected hip and knee arthroprostheses, respectively of 42% and 44%. the spectrum of bacteria infecting either internal or external fracture fixation devices appears to differ from that of hip and knee arthroprostheses and more closely resembles that of infections non-associated to medical devices, being characterized by a relatively higher prevalence of staphylococcus aureus (over 40%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa. enterobacteriaceae and members of the streptococcus and corynebacterium genera are frequently associated with implants in which surgical incisions were made near the perineum, determining a completely altered spectrum.

TI  == environmental contamination before, during, and after dental treatment.
AB  == purpose: to verify environmental contamination by collecting microorganisms from  dental equipment surfaces before, during and after clinical procedures. methods:  sterile swabs were used to collect the samples from dental-chair push buttons, 3-in-1 syringes, x-ray tubes, computer keys, doorknobs, and light handles before  (p1), during (p2) and after (p3) clinical procedures, in the undergraduate clinic of the dental school of piracicaba, university of campinas, brazil. these samples were spread on bhi agar and incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 hours. other dishes  containing the same material were incubated at 37 degrees c in 10% co2 for 48 hours. the resulting microorganisms were counted and classified using the gram staining and biochemical tests. microorganism counts among the periods and groups were analyzed by kruskal-wallis test (alpha=5%). results: the most prevalent microorganisms were viridans group streptococci, sthaphylococcus epidermidis and  baccillus subtilis. push buttons were the most contaminated (p< 0.05). microorganisms were most prevalent during clinical procedures (p< 0.05). microorganism counts were higher in p2 than in p1 and p3 (p< 0.05). clinical activity caused an increase in the number of environmental microorganisms, where  viridans group streptococci were the most prevalent contaminant found on equipment surfaces.

TI  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (cis). when chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of  cis using various microbes such as escherichia coli, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, saccharomyces cerevisiae, saccharomyces ludwigii, and schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. in particular, recovery was improved when l-cysteine was added. a mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto cis could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. most of the desorbed cells were alive. thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by  employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.

TI  == ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  == although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, enterococcus  faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. to investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might  use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including e. faecalis, e. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. streptococcus bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis showed increased adherence to arh-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of s. bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, and s. aureus by ht-29 enterocytes (prominent  syndecan-1 expression), but not caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). data from experiments with chinese hamster ovary cells with altered  glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. thus, although e. faecalis, e. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical,  and trauma patients.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid against key gram-positive organisms isolated in the united states: results of the leader 2004 surveillance program.
AB  == since the approval of linezolid in 2000, sporadic reports of resistance have been given and a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of resistance has  been gained. however, since these developments, an updated status of the in vitro activity of linezolid against gram-positive organisms from the united states has  not been reported. the leader 2004 surveillance initiative was undertaken to obtain current and representative data on the activity of linezolid against key species, including isolates with significant resistance phenotypes. organisms were isolated during 2004 and included 2,872 staphylococcus aureus, 496 coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cns), 428 enterococcus faecalis, 196 enterococcus faecium, and 422 streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. all s. aureus isolates (54.2% oxacillin resistant) were susceptible to linezolid (mic90 = 2 microg/ml); mic distributions were consistent, regardless of oxacillin or multidrug resistance status. for cns, one nonsusceptible isolate was encountered  (staphylococcus epidermidis; mic = 32 microg/ml), but overall, the mic(90) (1 microg/ml) was lower than that obtained with s. aureus. for e. faecalis and e. faecium, 99.5% and 96.4% of isolates, respectively, were linezolid susceptible. both species had an mic90 of 2 microg/ml, and mic distributions did not vary with the vancomycin susceptibility status of the populations analyzed. linezolid nonsusceptibility was not encountered among the s. pneumoniae isolates. these findings indicate that linezolid nonsusceptibility has remained rare among staphylococci and uncommon and sporadic among enterococci. nonetheless, careful and ongoing monitoring of the in vitro effectiveness of linezolid will be needed  so that any changes to the current status may be detected as soon as possible.

TI  == a study of the role of multiple site blood cultures in the evaluation of neonatal sepsis.
AB  == background: the optimal number of blood cultures needed to document sepsis in an  ill neonate has undergone little critical evaluation. multiple site cultures may  improve pathogen detection if intermittent bacteremia occurs, or if a low density of bacteria is present in the blood. we hypothesized, however, that bacterial clearance is slower and bacteremia more continuous in septic neonates, so that a  single site blood culture should be sufficient to accurately document true septicemia. objective: to determine the need for multiple site blood cultures in  the evaluation of neonates for sepsis. design/methods: clinical data were prospectively collected for 216 neonates who had 269 pairs of blood cultures taken from two different peripheral sites for the evaluation of possible sepsis.  a minimum of 1 ml of blood was obtained from the two peripheral sites within 15-30 min of each other. based on prior retrospective data, we determined that 203 infants would need to have two site blood cultures to demonstrate a significant improvement in pathogen detection at an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.20 (80%) power. results: a total of 186 culture pairs were taken for evaluation of early-onset sepsis in 186 neonates, while 83 pairs were drawn for evaluation of late-onset sepsis in 43 neonates. in all, 21 neonates from the late-onset group were evaluated more than once, and 12 neonates were evaluated for both early- and late-onset sepsis. in all, 20 (9.2%) of 216 neonates had 22 episodes of culture-proven sepsis at a median age of 18 days. all neonates with positive cultures had the same organism with a similar sensitivity pattern obtained from the two different peripheral sites. the other 196 study neonates had negative blood cultures from both sites. the single episode of early-onset sepsis was caused by listeria monocytogenes, while all remaining episodes were late-onset with the following organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis (7), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (3), combined mrsa and candida albicans (2), candida albicans alone (2), late-onset group b beta-hemolytic streptococcus (gbs) (2), klebsiella pneumoniae (2), enterococcus fecalis (1), escherichia coli (1), and serratia marcescens (1). since no infant grew organisms from only one of the two sites, the data indicate that the diagnosis of sepsis would have been made correctly in all infants with a single site culture. conclusions: two site blood cultures for the initial evaluation of neonatal sepsis do not have a better yield in pathogen detection. sepsis in neonates can be detected with no loss of accuracy with a single site blood culture with blood  volume of>or=1 ml.

AB  == objective: to describe the patterns of antimicrobial resistance organisms isolated in blood cultures from patients detected in a tertiary level of care, teaching oncological hospital. material and methods: all strains obtained from blood cultures from 1998 to 2003 were included and processed using the bactec and microscan system to determinate isolates and susceptibility to antimicrobials. the percent difference (increase or decrease) was obtained by comparing the frequency of resistance at baseline and at the end of the study. results: a total of 2071 positive blood cultures were obtained; 59.7% of isolates were gram negative bacteria, 35.7% gram-positive bacteria and 4.6% were yeasts. e. coli was the most frequent isolated (18.6%), followed by. staphylococcus epidermidis (12.7%) and klebsiella spp (9%). throughout the study the susceptibility of gram  negative bacteria was stable and over 88% for most of the antimicrobials tested (except for pseudomonas aeruginosa). ciprofloxacin susceptibility for escherichia coli stayed around 50%. susceptibility to amikacin was higher than that to gentamicin. staphylococcus aureus susceptibility for oxacillin was 96% and that for vancomycin 100%. s. epidermidis susceptibility for oxacillin was 14% and for  vancomycin was 98.6%. no strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found.  all streptococcus pneumoniae strains were penicillin susceptible. conclusions: the drug-resistance found in this hospital is the result of the control in the use of antimicrobials, the hospital nosocomial infection program and the use of drug combination in all patients with bacteremia.

TI  == mechanisms of inhibition by fluoride of urease activities of cell suspensions and biofilms of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii and of dental plaque.
AB  == background/aims: fluoride is known to be a potent inhibitor of bacterial ureases  and can also act in the form of hydrofluoric acid as a transmembrane proton conductor to acidify the cytoplasm of intact cells with possible indirect, acid inhibition of urease. our research objectives were to assess the inhibitory potencies of fluoride for three urease-positive bacteria commonly found in the mouth and to determine the relative importance of direct and indirect inhibition  of ureases for overall inhibition of intact cells or biofilms. methods: the experimental design involved intact bacteria in suspensions, mono-organism biofilms, cell extracts, and dental plaque. standard enzymatic assays for ammonia production from urea were used. results: we found that ureolysis by cells in suspensions or mono-organism biofilms of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus salivarius or actinomyces naeslundii was inhibited by fluoride at plaque levels of 0.1-0.5 mm in a ph-dependent manner. the results of experiments  with the organic weak acids indomethacin and capric acid, which do not directly inhibit urease enzyme, indicated that weak-acid effects leading to cytoplasmic acidification are also involved in fluoride inhibition. however, direct fluoride  inhibition of urease appeared to be the major mechanism for reduction in ureolytic activity in acid environments. results of experiments with freshly harvested supragingival dental plaque indicated responses to fluoride similar to  those of s. salivarius with ph-dependent fluoride inhibition and both direct and  indirect inhibition of urease. conclusion: fluoride can act to diminish alkali production from urea by oral bacteria through direct and indirect mechanisms.

TI  == pentadactylin: an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the south american bullfrog leptodactylus pentadactylus.
AB  == norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions were obtained from male specimens of the south american bullfrog, leptodactylus pentadactylus and shown to contain two peptides that inhibited the growth of microorganisms. the primary structure of a  previously undescribed peptide, termed pentadactylin, was established as gly-leu-leu-asp-thr-leu-lys-gly-ala-ala-lys-asn-val-val-gly-ser-leu-ala-ser-lys-v al-met-glu-lys-leu.nh2. the second peptide, which differs from pentadactylin by eight amino acid residues, is identical to fallaxin previously isolated from skin secretions of the caribbean mountain chicken frog l. fallax. pentadactylin inhibited the growth of reference strains of both gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus group b) but potencies were relatively low (mic values in the range 25-200 microm). the peptide showed very low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (ld50>400 microm).

TI  == increase of faecal bifidobacteria due to dietary oligosaccharides induces a reduction of clinically relevant pathogen germs in the faeces of formula-fed preterm infants.
AB  == in a previous study on formula-fed preterm infants, we were able to demonstrate that dietary oligosaccharides (a mixture of 90% galacto-oligosaccharides and 10%  fructo-oligosaccharides in a concentration of 1 g/dl) stimulate the growth of faecal bifidobacteria. in the present explorative analysis of this study, we focus on the effect of the dominance of bifidobacteria on the presence of clinically relevant pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter, klebsiella, proteus, streptococcus group b, clostridium difficile, bacillus subtilis and acinetobacter). conclusion: the data demonstrate that stimulation of bifidobacteria by prebiotic oligosaccharides reduces the presence of clinically relevant pathogens in the faecal flora, indicating that prebiotic substances might have the capacity to protect against enteral infections.

AB  == rep8839 is a novel methionyl-trna synthetase (mets) inhibitor with potent antibacterial activity against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and other clinically important gram-positive bacteria but little activity against gram-negative bacteria. all isolates of s. aureus, including strains resistant to methicillin, mupirocin, vancomycin, and linezolid  were susceptible to rep8839 at concentrations of < or =0.5 microg/ml. rep8839 was also active against staphylococcus epidermidis, including multiply resistant strains (mic, < or =0.25 microg/ml). all s. pyogenes isolates were susceptible to rep8839 at concentrations of < or =0.25 microg/ml, suggesting that mets2, a second enzyme previously identified in streptococcus pneumoniae, was not present  in this organism. rep8839 was highly bound to the protein of human serum, and activity was not greatly influenced by inoculum size but was affected by ph, exhibiting optimal antibacterial activity in a neutral medium rather than a weak  acidic medium. like mupirocin, rep8839 exhibited bacteriostatic activity against  key pathogens. the emergence of mupirocin resistance in s. aureus highlights the  need for a new topical antibiotic with the ability to inhibit high-level mupirocin-resistant strains and other emerging phenotypes, such as vancomycin-resistant and community-acquired methicillin-resistant isolates.

TI  == [study on treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus].
AB  == objective: to study the treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculo peritoneal shunt for hydrocephalus. methods: for all of the patients suspected to have cerebrospinal fluid (csf) infections, the first step of treatment was removal of the "infected" shunts, then a ventricular drainage was placed in frontal horn of the ventricle, and at the same time csf was obtained from the ventricle for bacterial culture and tests of bacterial sensitivities to  antibiotics. after the shunt removal and before the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, 25-50 mg of vancomycin was administered intraventricularly daily. as soon as the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, antibiotics should be adjusted according to the sensitivity test result. by the time of the infections being controlled, appropriate treatments including reshunting would finally be given for hydrocephalus if necessary. results: among 11 patients, 9 were infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci or staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus, one of them with concomitant infection of aerobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacteriaceae aerogenesis, 1 patient with streptococci, and another one with mycobacterium stercoris bovis. the tests of drug sensitivity showed that cocci in infection of 9 patients were all sensitive  to vancomycin, but only 1 of them sensitive to gentamycin. there were other sensitive antibiotics for streptococcus in 1 case and for bacillus in 2 patients. practically vancomycin was effective for 8 of 11 patients, including one case of  streptococcal infection. the duration for anti-infection treatment was in a range of 16-36 days. finally, all of 11 patients survived from the shunt ventriculitis, and 9 of them had significant improvement in their neurological functions. conclusion: (1)intraventricular administration of proper antibiotics is a reliable and effective way to treat ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. (2)vancomycin is the preferred antibiotic for ventriculitis, but other kind(s) of some antibiotics are necessary in a few patients in addition to or instead of vancomycin. (3)the effect of systemic use of antibiotics could not be defined in this series of patients, but this may be used as an adjunct in the practice. (4)there are many problems related to diagnosis and treatment of shunt ventriculitis that should be studied more extensively and deeply.

AB  == background: in certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (plt)-rich plasma  plts can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. one prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single  unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 cfus/ml). this study evaluated the bact/alert (biomerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. study design and methods: bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single plt units (target, 10 and 100 cfus/ml; mean recovered, 5 and 92 cfus/ml) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 ml was plated (10 sets). results: all cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 cfus per ml. with b. cereus (< or =2 cfus/ml), all bottles were reactive. with k. pneumoniae and s. viridans (< or =3 cfus/ml), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. with s. marcescens (< 2 cfus/ml), only 7  of the 10 sets were reactive. with c. perfringens (0.2 cfus/ml), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. conclusions: this study evaluates the use of the bact/alert system for detection of bacteria in plt pools. overall, the bact/alert detected all contaminated pooled plts when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 cfus per ml with 10 different species of bacteria. low recovered concentrations (< or =2 cfus/ml) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.

AB  == blood, stool and urine samples were collected from 100 patients diagnosed as having typhoid in 5 hospitals in akwa ibom state and analyzed for the presence of salmonella species and other bacteria. of the 100 blood samples screened, 55 (55%) were positive with the widal test and 39 (39%) were positive on blood culture. thirteen (14.1%) out of 92 urine samples were positive for bacterial growth, while 22 (26.8%) of the stool cultures were positive out of the 82 samples screened. those within the age range 11-20 years old were infected most frequently (33%), followed by the age range 21-30 (19%) and 41-50 (18%) years old. those in the age range of 0-2 years old (4%) were least infected. female subjects were more infected than males. the commonest organisms isolated from the blood samples were staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, streptococcus faecalis, salmonella paratyphi and salmonella typhi. s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli, k. aerogenes, s. faecalis, proteus mirabilis and p. aeruginosa were isolated from urine, while those isolated from stool were s. aureus, e. coli, s. typhi, s. paratyphi, shigella sp, k. pneumoniae, p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa and vibrio cholerae 01. the isolates were sensitive to peflacine, ceftazidine, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and chloramphenicol. these antibiotics are recommended as the drugs of choice in therapy. the results suggest the existence  of symptomless carriers of enteric fever bacilli in the state. this is worrisome, since some of the s. typhi isolates exhibited multiple resistance to commonly used antibiotics.

TI  == pd-140248 (parke-davis & co).
AB  == pd-140248 is an isomerase inhibitor and topoisomerase ii inhibitor under development by parke-davis and co as a potential treatment for bacterial infection. although no details of active development have been published in the scientific literature since 1996, in september 1999, the company confirmed that pd-140248 is still in active development [338530]. the compound is one of two new pyrrolidinyl naphthyridines (the other compound being pd-131628) with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, including activity against quinolone-resistant bacteria. pd-140248 demonstrates strong in vitro activity, particularly against gram-positive bacteria, such as quinolone-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (s aureus), staphylococcus epidermidis (s epidermidis), staphylococcus haemolyticus (s haemolyticus), methicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant s aureus, streptococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae (s pneumoniae) and enterococcus faecalis (e faecalis). an mic90 value of 0.015 microg/ml was obtained against haemophilus influenzae (h influenzae) and moraxella catarrhalis [160129]. the (3r,1s) enantiomer, pd-140248, demonstrated a 1- to 10-fold enhanced activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms in vitro and in vivo compared to its stereoisomers, and has thus been targeted for further preclinical studies [133377].

TI  == evaluation of pooled cultures for bacterial detection in whole blood-derived platelets.
AB  == background: the bact/alert (biomerieux) system is highly efficient for bacterial  detection in apheresis platelets (plts) and whole blood-derived plts produced by  the buffy-coat method. detection of bacterial contamination in whole blood-derived plts produced by the plt-rich plasma (prp) method, however, is problematic. prestorage pooling of these plts is not permitted in some countries  including canada and the united states, and culturing individual units is costly  and may significantly reduce the plt unit content. in this study, the sensitivity and specificity of bact/alert cultures performed on pools derived from prp plts are reported. study design and methods: the sensitivity of the bact/alert system  was evaluated for bacterial detection in prp plts with a dilution effect. thirty  plt pools were produced with 1 plt unit previously spiked with bacteria and then  pooled with other four nonspiked plt units. three bacteria, usually associated with plt contamination, were selected for spiking. the specificity of this method was evaluated in 40 nonspiked plt pools. results: the method was found to be 100  percent specific and 97 percent sensitive. of the five spiked pools with streptococcus pneumoniae at levels of less than 2 colony-forming units (cfus) per ml, four were found to be positive whereas all 25 spiked pools with greater than  9 cfus per ml of any of the chosen bacteria gave positive results. the mean time  of detection was 17 to 19 hours for staphylococcus epidermidis and 14 to 15 hours for s. pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa when spiked with similar bacterial inocula. conclusion: the evaluated system is highly sensitive and specific and may be a feasible method for bacterial detection in prp plts.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-023 (ro4908463), a novel parenteral carbapenem.
AB  == cs-023 (ro4908463, formerly r-115685) is a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem with 5-substituted pyrrolidin-3-ylthio groups, including an amidine moiety at the c-2  position. its antibacterial activity was tested against 1,214 clinical isolates of 32 species and was compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, amikacin, and levofloxacin. cs-023 exhibited a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. cs-023 showed the most potent activity among the compounds tested against p. aeruginosa and mrsa, with mics at  which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited of 4 microg/ml and 8 microg/ml, respectively. cs-023 was stable against hydrolysis by the beta-lactamases from enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris. cs-023 also showed potent activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli. the in vivo  efficacy of cs-023 was evaluated with a murine systemic infection model induced by 13 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens and a lung infection model induced by 2 strains of prsp (serotypes 6 and 19). against the systemic infections with prsp, mrsa, and p. aeruginosa and the lung infections, the efficacy of cs-023 was comparable to those of imipenem/cilastatin and vancomycin  (tested against lung infections only) and superior to those of meropenem, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime (tested against p. aeruginosa infections only). these results suggest that cs-023 has potential for the treatment of nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and -negative pathogens, including mrsa and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == the fixed combination of fortified vancomycin and amikacin ophthalmic solution--va solution: in vitro study of the potency and stability.
AB  == purpose: we compared the in vitro potency and stability of a fixed combination of vancomycin and amikacin solution (va solution) with amikacin or vancomycin solution. methods: solutions of 2% amikacin (20 mg/ml) and of 5% vancomycin (50 mg/ml) and va solution (each 1 ml contained 20 mg of amikacin and 50 mg of vancomycin) were prepared from parenteral antibiotics by reconstituting them with sterile injection water and refrigerated (4 degrees c) in the dark. triplicate 5-ml portions of each solution were tested before storage and 7 and 14 days after preparation for potency of antimicrobial activity by the disk diffusion method and for stability. results: there were no significant differences in the diameter of zones of inhibition of va solution compared with amikacin or vancomycin solution within a 2-week period. visual inspection revealed that all solutions remained clear, colorless, and particle-free at 4 degrees c throughout the study  period. for osmolarity, the va solution was much higher than that of either amikacin or vancomycin solution at all tested times and more near the well-tolerated range of human eyes. there were no significant differences at days 0, 7, or 14 for either vancomycin, amikacin, or va solution. for ph, the va solution was higher than that of vancomycin solution (nearly equal to that of amikacin solution) at each time and more near the level of normal tear film. the  ph did not differ significantly for either vancomycin, amikacin, or va solution at all tested times. conclusions: the vancomycin and amikacin ophthalmic solutions can be mixed together with the same potency and stable physical properties. it may be useful in the treatment of bacterial keratitis pending clinical trials to determine its effectiveness and safety.

TI  == the streptogramin antibiotics: update on their mechanism of action.
AB  == antibiotics of the streptogramin class are an association of two types of chemically different compounds, group a molecules and group b molecules, acting in synergy. the combination of these molecules generally inhibits bacterial growth at a lower concentration than does either the group a or group b molecule  alone and is often bactericidal against strains of bacteria for which each type of molecule alone is only bacteriostatic. the semisynthetic streptogramin quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500), the first water-soluble member of this class, is under development for the treatment of severe infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, glycopeptide-resistant enterococcus faecium, and other organisms. the streptogramins block the translation of mrna into protein. both group a and group b molecules bind to the peptidyl-transferase domain of the bacterial ribosome. the group b molecule stimulates the dissociation of peptidyl-trna from the ribosome and may interfere with the passage of the completed polypeptide away from the peptidyl-transferase centre. the group a molecule inhibits the elongation of the polypeptide chain by preventing both the binding of aminoacyl-trna to the ribosomal a site and the formation of the peptide bond. when the two types of molecule are used in combination, the binding of the group  a molecule alters the conformation of the ribosome such that the affinity of the  ribosome for the b molecule is increased. this accounts, in part or entirely, for the observed synergy. this synergy is unaffected by ribosomal modifications conferring resistance to the macrolides, lincosamides, and group b molecules alone.

TI  == in-house validation of the bactec 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: at present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the fda for the purpose of quality control (qc) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates: the bact/alert blood culture system (biomerieux) and the pall ebds (pall corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived plts. after the decision of the aabb to institute universal qc testing of plt concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the  performance of our current blood culture system, the bactec 9240, was carried out for this purpose. study design and methods: serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with plt contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis plt unit per organism. four ml of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (cfus) per ml was inoculated into blood culture bottles (standard 10 aerobic/f, becton-dickinson diagnostic systems) and incubated in a bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to  insure the identity of bacterial growth. results: with the exception of streptococcus mitis, the bactec system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 cfus per ml for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the limit of detection for the  s. mitis test strain was 61 cfus per ml. detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis plt products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. conclusion: this study validates the use of the bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis plts in  less than 24 hours.

TI  == [multiple cerebral abscess caused by nocardia brasilientis].
AB  == streptococcus aureus, streptococci, and enterobacteria were major causative agents of abscesses of the brain. at present, associated infection is responsible for 60% of cerebral abscesses. when systemic and specific immunities are diminished, a risk for cerebral abscesses caused by fungi increases. among them,  there are the most common fungi candida species or aspergillus species. the paper gives an example of successful complex treatment of multiple cerebral abscesses caused by an association of nocardia brasiliensis and staphylococcus epidermidis. the specific feature of the observation was the correct diagnosis before intraoperative verification of cerebral abscesses. the disease developed in the presence of diminished systemic immunity and in the absence of specific immunity  to nocardia. immunodeficiency could be caused by prior herpetic infection, epstein-barr disease, a wasp bite. the pathogen that was able to cause microstrokes played an indubitable role in the pathogenesis of the disease, which predisposed to the development of cerebral abscesses in patients with immunodeficiency. impaired blood circulation in the occipital region could be also induced by wasp venom.

TI  == trends in linezolid susceptibility patterns in 2002: report from the worldwide zyvox annual appraisal of potency and spectrum program.
AB  == oxazolidinones have become reliable clinical and candidate antimicrobial agents to be utilized for infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive cocci,  especially vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. however, mutational resistance of the ribosomal target has been described for several species. longitudinal surveillance remains necessary to monitor for this evolving linezolid resistance pattern. a survey of linezolid and several comparison gram-positive focused agents was initiated in 2002 (7971 strains, >99.0% compliance) for 54 participating sites in the united states, canada, europe (6 nations), latin america (2 nations), and the asia pacific (2 nations). the 5 and 25 sites in canada and the united states, respectively, submitted 200 strains each to a central laboratory for organism identification/confirmation and reference mic processing. the 10 remaining nations had 200 strain samples from 1 to 4 separate institutions. linezolid resistance (mic >/= 8 microg/ml) was confirmed by alternative susceptibility testing methods (etest, ab bio disk, solna, sweden; disk diffusion method) and target mutation characterization by pcr and sequence analysis. linezolid activity against the 6 major organism groups did not vary between geographic areas. a total of 98.1% of linezolid mic values were between 0.5 and 2 microg/ml, and only 0.5% of results were at 4 microg/ml, which included 32 staphylococcus aureus (0.9%) and 5 (0.5%) enterococcal isolates. linezolid resistance was detected in only 4 isolates (0.05%): 1 each staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecium, and a viridans group streptococcus. all 4 isolates had a g2576u mutation in the 23s rrna target. linezolid activity as outlined by these zyvox annual appraisal of potency and spectrum (zaaps) program  results demonstrate sustained, near complete activity against contemporary gram-positive isolates on 4 monitored continents and in centers utilizing oxazolidinones. rare linezolid-resistant strains were identified in the united states only (0.05% resistance overall).

AB  == background: the reported incidence of pacing system-related infections (psis) varies widely, and the roles of leads and blood cultures remain poorly defined. methods: leads and blood cultures were obtained prospectively in 224 patients with suspected psis, and the results of cultures of blood and extravascular and intravascular lead fragments were compared. results: in 12.3% of the patients, no microorganism was found on the leads. lead cultures with > or =1 microorganism cultured on the extravascular and intravascular fragments of the leads were found in 88.5% of the positive lead cultures. infection was caused by staphylococcus epidermidis and coagulase-negative staphylococci in 66.0% and 29.5%, respectively. only 33 patients had positive blood cultures according to the duke  criteria with the same microorganism found by lead cultures in 30 cases. infection was caused by multiple organisms in 39 (25%) patients. conclusion: (1)  regardless of the clinical presentation, the extravascular and intravascular body of the lead is infected, even when the infection is local. more than one microorganism may be implicated. (2) bacteriologic analyses must be performed on  several segments of each implanted lead. (3) more than 2 positive blood cultures  are a reliable clinical criterion for the diagnosis of pacemaker lead-related infection, but blood cultures alone are an insensitive method to identify the cause of infection. (4) up to 50% of microorganisms isolated in a single blood culture are also recovered in lead cultures.

AB  == objectives: although active chlorine compounds are well-known antimicrobial agents in human medicine, their initial steps of action have not been completely  clarified. using n-chlorotaurine (nct), an endogenous mild representative, we observed persisting oxidation capacity affixed to bacteria. it was the aim of this study to investigate this 'chlorine cover'. methods: pathogens were incubated in nct, which was subsequently washed off. the oxidation capacity on the bacterial surface was measured photometrically. results: superficial chlorination in the form of covalent n-cl bonds to staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans could be attached before killing took place. for s. aureus, 3 min incubation with nct produced a cover of  3.3 x 10(-16) mol cl(+)/cfu, while the cfu count was reduced by only 26%. the kind of microorganism, coating time, ph, buffer system and, basically, the chlorine compound, influenced the cover strength. the relative cover strength on  s. aureus by nct, chloramine t, sodium dichloro-isocyanurate or n,n-dichlorotaurine was 1:15.7:38.7:0.24. chlorine covers were surprisingly stable and could be detected for 3 h at 20 degrees c (>8 h at 1 degrees c), even  without a reduction of cfu. however, addition of 5% ammonium chloride caused a rapid loss of viability, explained by formation of highly bactericidal nh(2)cl, an effect that resembles the ignition of a time-bomb. conclusions: the chlorine cover can be regarded as the first sign of interaction between chlorinating agent and microorganism, and may explain the non-lethal features of postantibiotic effect and attenuation of bacterial virulence. furthermore, it may be a decisive  step in bacterial inactivation by the myeloperoxidase-hypochlorite system in innate immunity.

TI  == successful liver and kidney transplantation from cadaveric donors with left-sided bacterial endocarditis.
AB  == bacterial infections are frequent in cadaveric organ donors and can be transmitted to the transplantation recipient, which could have devastating consequences for the recipients if adequate preventive measures are not adopted.  from the 355 consecutive brain dead cadaveric organ donors procured at our center in the last four years, 2000-2003, four of them (1.1%) had bacterial endocarditis as cause of death. the bacteria responsible for the endocarditis were staphylococcus epidermidis, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, staphylococcus hominis and streptococcus viridans, respectively. we performed five kidney and two liver transplantations on seven recipients. all donors and recipients received antibiotic treatment against the germ causing the respective endocarditis. infection by the bacteria responsible for the endocarditis in the respective donors was not transmitted to any of the recipients. six of the seven  recipients were alive with normal-functioning grafts after between 13 and 24 months' follow-up. transplantectomy was performed on one kidney recipient due to  thrombosis of the renal vein of the graft not related to the endocarditis. liver  and kidney transplantation from donors dying from bacterial endocarditis can be performed without causing the transmission of infection to the recipient or the dysfunction of the graft.

TI  == production of bacteriocins by coagulase-negative staphylococci involved in bovine mastitis.
AB  == in the present study, 188 coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cns) strains were isolated from bovine mastitis cases from 56 different brazilian dairy herds, located in the southeast region of the country, and were tested for antimicrobial substance production. twelve cns strains (6.4%) exhibited antagonistic activity against a corynebacterium fimi indicator strain. most antimicrobial substances were sensitive to proteolytic enzymes suggesting that they might be bacteriocins  (bac). amongst the cns producers, six were identified as s. epidermidis, two as s. simulans, two as s. saprophyticus, one as s. hominis and one as s. arlettae. plasmid profile analysis of these strains revealed the presence of at least one plasmid. the bac(+) strains presented either no or few antibiotic resistance phenotypes. three strains were shown to produce a bacteriocin either identical or similar to aureocin a70, a bacteriocin previously isolated from an s. aureus strain isolated from food. the remaining bac(+) strains produce antimicrobial peptides that seem to be distinct from the best characterised staphylococcal bacteriocins described so far. some of them were able to inhibit listeria monocytogenes, an important food-borne pathogen, and several strains of streptococcus agalactiae associated with bovine mastitis, suggesting a potential  use of these bacteriocins either in the prevention or in the treatment of streptococcal mastitis.

TI  == bacterial populations on silicone hydrogel and hydrogel contact lenses after swimming in a chlorinated pool.
AB  == purpose: a number of reports have indicated an association between swimming with  contact lenses and subsequent eye infection. this study tests whether a hydrophilic contact lens worn while swimming accumulates bacteria present in the  water. it was of interest to determine whether lens type (silicone hydrogel vs. hydrogel) affected the result. methods: fifteen healthy noncontact lens wearers swam for 30 minutes with a silicone hydrogel lens (purevision, bausch & lomb, rochester, ny) on one eye and a hydrogel lens (acuvue 2, vistakon inc., jacksonville, fl) on the other. lenses were removed aseptically and placed in sterile vials 10 minutes after the subjects left the water. microbial growth was  enumerated for total numbers of colonies and categorized by species present. numbers of colonies were compared between the two lens groups and with a water sample taken from the pool at the time of the experiment. eight of the subjects returned on a different day and wore new lenses for 50 minutes in normal room conditions. results: two lenses were lost while swimming. twenty-seven of the remaining 28 lenses worn while swimming showed colonization, principally with staphylococcus epidermidis, which was also by far the most common species identified from the water itself. small numbers of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus salivarius were also present in the water and on the lenses. numbers of colonies varied among subjects (range, 0 to 230), but no differences were observed between the two lens groups. lenses removed after 30 minutes of wear without swimming were mostly sterile, with 3 of 16 lenses showing just two colonies each. conclusion: it appears that wearing a hydrophilic lens while swimming allows accumulation of microbial organisms on or in the lens, regardless of lens material. swimmers should be advised to wear tight-fitting goggles if lenses are worn while swimming, and thorough disinfection of the lenses before overnight wear seems prudent.

AB  == a surveillance study was performed throughout germany from november 2001 to june  2002 to assess the prevalence of linezolid-resistant isolates among gram-positive bacteria from routine susceptibility data and to compare the in-vitro activity of linezolid to that of other antibacterial agents. each of 86 laboratories provided routine susceptibility data for 100 consecutive isolates. most laboratories (c. 60%) used the disk diffusion test. laboratories were also requested to send a representative sample of their isolates, as well as all isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid, to a reference laboratory for mic determination. susceptibility data for 8594 isolates were evaluated. sites of infection were skin and soft tissue (29.9%), upper and lower respiratory tract (19.1%), foreign body or catheter (10.5%), or urinary tract (9.8%). routine linezolid susceptibility data were reported for 6433 isolates. the prevalence of  linezolid resistance, as reported to the clinician, was 0.4% in staphylococcus aureus, 0.3% in staphylococcus epidermidis, 2.9% in enterococcus faecalis, 2.3% in enterococcus faecium, 1.4% in streptococcus pyogenes and 2.9% in streptococcus agalactiae. linezolid resistance was not detected in streptococcus pneumoniae or  in viridans group streptococci. sixty-nine of 115 isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid were retested, but none was resistant to linezolid. linezolid exhibited excellent in-vitro activity against representative isolates of the six most frequently encountered species (mic90, 1-2 mg/l). the prevalence of resistance to linezolid was very low in germany. organisms reported as linezolid-resistant should be retested, either in the same laboratory with an  alternative method or in a reference laboratory.

TI  == penetration pharmacokinetics of topically administered 0.5% moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution in human aqueous and vitreous.
AB  == objective: to investigate the penetration of 0.5% moxifloxacin hydrochloride into the aqueous and vitreous after topical administration in humans. methods: a prospective, nonrandomized study of 20 patients scheduled for vitrectomy surgery  between september 1 and december 31, 2003. aqueous and vitreous samples were obtained and analyzed after topical administration of 0.5% moxifloxacin hydrochloride, every 2 hours (q2h) or every 6 hours (q6h), for 3 days before surgery. assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: mean +/- sd moxifloxacin concentrations in the q2h group for the aqueous (n = 9) and vitreous (n = 10) were 2.28 +/- 1.23 and 0.11 +/- 0.05 microg/ml, respectively. mean +/- sd moxifloxacin concentrations in the q6h group for the aqueous (n = 10) and vitreous (n = 9) were 0.88 +/- 0.88 and 0.06 +/- 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. the minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of isolates (mic(90)) was far exceeded in the aqueous for a wide spectrum of key pathogens, whereas it was not exceeded in the vitreous for several organisms. however, the minimum inhibitory concentration for 50% of the isolates was exceeded in the q2h  vitreous group for staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, bacillus cereus, and other gram-negative pathogens. conclusions: the endophthalmitis vitrectomy study revealed that 94.2% of isolates from postoperative endophthalmitis are gram-positive pathogens. moxifloxacin has a spectrum of coverage that appropriately encompasses the most common organisms in endophthalmitis. the pharmacokinetic findings of this investigation show that relatively high aqueous  levels can be achieved after topical administration. further studies will help define the precise role of 0.5% moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution in the treatment of or prophylaxis against intraocular infections.

TI  == [initial antibiotic therapy of neonatal sepsis].
AB  == it is certain that in the past the types of bacterial agents responsible for neonatal sepsis and their sensitivity to antibiotics were not the same in all historical periods. however, the reports confirming the conclusion have been published only in the last three years. according to these facts, the bacterial causes of neonatal sepsis were analyzed in patients treated at the university children's hospital in belgrade (s&m) as well as their sensitivity to antibiotics to determine the most effective initial therapy. between january 2001 and june 2004, 35 neonates, aged from 1-30 days, with positive blood culture were treated. gram-negative bacteria were the cause of sepsis in 57% of patients (pseudomonas--20%, klebsiella--20%, e. coli--8.5%, acinetobacter--8.5%), gram-positive in 43% (coagulase-negative staphylococci--14%, staphylococcus epidermidis--14%, staphylococcus aureus--9%, streptococcus group b--3%, listeria  monocytogenes--3%). the bacteria were the most sensitive to carbapenems (85-89%), amikacin (68%), third-generation cephalosporins (47-50%), while the sensitivity to gentamicin was less than expected (48.5%). sensitivity to ampicillin (8%) confirmed a high level of resistance to this antibiotic. all isolated staphylococci were sensitive to vancomycin, and the overall methicillin resistance was 46%. combined cefotaxime and amikacin therapy was the most effective of all suggested initial combinations of antibiotics (74%). the sensitivity to all other combinations of antibiotics was 51-71%. the most adequate initial combination of antibiotics for the treatment of neonatal sepsis  is cefotaxime plus amikacin. the most adequate antibiotic for the treatment of nosocomial neonatal sepsis is carbapenem.

TI  == direct detection of bacterial pathogens in brain abscesses by polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing of partial 16s ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid fragments.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the feasibility of detecting bacterial pathogens directly  from the clinical brain abscess specimens by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification and sequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rdna). methods: a total of 14 specimens were tested by both culture and pcr amplification, targeting the full-length or a partial region of 16s rdna. 16s rdna is known to be conserved in bacteria. sequencing of partial-length and full-length 16s rdna was performed. the sequence data were compared with known sequences of 16s rdna in the national center for biotechnology information genbank by using the basic local alignment search tool (blast) algorithm. the species with the best match of similarity were regarded as the pathogenic species in the samples. we also developed a streptococcus-specific multiplex pcr analysis for identifying members of the streptococcus species, the most common pathogen of brain abscesses. results: the 10 culture-positive specimens were all pcr-positive for partial 16s rdna, but only seven were positive for full-length 16s rdna amplification. bacterial dna was not detected in the remaining four specimens with a negative culture. species identification by phenotypes from culture was in agreement with that by sequencing results of partial-length (or full-length) 16s  rdna. the streptococcus-specific pcr analysis could detect streptococcus species  correctly in one step. conclusion: bacterial 16s rdna sequences provide reliable  clues to the identification of unknown pathogens. pcr analysis of 16s rdna and sequencing may identify pathogens to the species level directly from brain abscesses. this approach is rapid and is useful especially in the identification  of slow-growing and fastidious organisms.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

AB  == objective: to explore a method for rapid diagnosis of sepsis in newborn infants.  methods: (1) the primers and oligonucleotide probes were designed and synthesized based on the sequences of bacterial 16srrna gene. the gene chip was prepared through the probes printed onto special glass slides. the gene chip included 18 special probes: universal probe 1, universal probe 2, gram positive bacterial probe, gram negative bacterial probe 1, gram negative bacterial probe 2, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons) 1, cons 2, escherichia coli, hemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus, meningococcus, corynebacterium, propionibacterium; (2) blood specimens from 285 cases of suspected septicemia were cultured and bacterial 16s rrna gene was detected separately; dna isolated from blood specimens and cerebrospinal fluid was amplified by pcr, and pcr products were hybridized with the probes on the gene chips. hybridization results were scanned and read by laser-scanner. results: (1) of the 285 cases, 17 were positive by pcr and the positive rate (5.96%) was significantly higher than that of blood culture (2.81%) (p < 0.01). when blood culture was taken as control, the sensitivity of pcr was 100% and specificity was 96.75%, the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.968. (2) the 17 specimens which showed positive results by pcr were further hybridized on the gene chip. all were positive by universal probes. among all of them, 5 were positive by e. coli probe; 4 were positive by staphylococcus epidermidis; two were positive by bacillus and propionibacterium probes, separately; 4 were positive by cons. the 8 specimens which showed positive results by both pcr and blood culture, the result of gene chip hybridization coincided with the result of blood culture. conclusion: detection of the bacterial 16srrna genes in clinical specimens by gene chip hybridization technology can diagnose neonatal septicemia  rapidly. this method has higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture or other methods and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia. therefore the genechip method may be valuable and practical  in early diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.

TI  == bacteriostatic properties of biomatrices against common orthopaedic pathogens.
AB  == tissue-engineered grafts for tissue regeneration include either mature or progenitor cells seeded onto biomatrices that provide shape and support for developing tissue. popular biomaterials used in orthopaedic surgery include collagen type i, hyaluronic acid, hydroxyapatite, and polylactic polyglycolic acid (plga). biomatrices with bacteriostatic properties may be beneficial in promoting tissue-engineered graft survival in patients susceptible to infection.  we evaluated the bacteriostatic effects of these biomaterials on the growth of the four most common orthopaedic bacterial pathogens: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. hyaluronic acid demonstrated the largest bacteriostatic effect on these pathogens by inhibiting bacterial growth by an average of 76.8% (p = 0.0005). hydroxyapatite and collagen inhibited growth on average by 49.7% (p = 0.011) and 37.5% (p = 0.102), respectively. plga exhibited the least bacteriostasis with an average inhibition of 9.8% (ns) and actually accelerated the growth of beta-hemolytic streptococcus and p. aeruginosa.

AB  == bacterial adherence to medical devices has been recognized as an important initial step in the infectious process, but it has not been fully elucidated regarding ventriculoperitoneal (vp) shunts. the aim of the present study was to quantitatively determine the adherence in vitro of bacteria known to cause vp shunt infections and to identify factors affecting the process. clinical isolates studied included staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. adherence was examined quantitatively per square centimeter, visualized by electron microscopy and related to slime production and hydrophobicity. although all four strains adhered to vp shunts, there were marked differences, with s. epidermidis and s. aureus showing the highest adherence (67.0 x 10(3) and 15.2 x 10(3) bacteria/cm(2), respectively). factors affecting adherence included incubation time and temperature, bacterial concentration, device material (lower for silicone than teflon), slime production and hydrophobicity. these data might be helpful for devising novel strategies to  reduce vp shunt infections.

TI  == biosurfactant from lactococcus lactis 53 inhibits microbial adhesion on silicone  rubber.
AB  == the ability of biosurfactant obtained from the probiotic bacterium lactococcus lactis 53 to inhibit adhesion of four bacterial and two yeast strains isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber. the microbial cell surfaces and the silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer were characterized using contact-angle measurements. water contact angles indicated that the silicone-rubber surface with adsorbed biosurfactant was more hydrophilic (48 degrees) than bare silicone rubber (109 degrees). the results showed that the biosurfactant was effective in decreasing the initial deposition rates of staphylococcus epidermidis gb 9/6 from 2,100 to 220 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), streptococcus salivarius gb 24/9 from 1560 to 137 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), and staphylococcus aureus gb 2/1 from 1255 to 135 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), allowing for a 90% reduction of the deposition rates. the deposition rates of rothia dentocariosa gbj 52/2b, candida albicans gbj 13/4a, and candida tropicalis gb 9/9 were far less reduced in the presence of the biosurfactant as compared with the other strains. this study constitutes a step ahead in developing strategies to prevent microbial colonization of silicone-rubber voice prostheses.

TI  == validation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing of whole-blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich-plasma-derived platelets.
AB  == background: bacterial detection of platelet (plt)-rich-plasma (prp)-derived plts  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. this study validated the bact/alert for use in testing pooled prp-derived plts with nine contaminating organisms. study design and methods: isolates of bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two prp-derived plt pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 cfus/ml). four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 ml was plated onto blood agar. results: all organisms (excluding p. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respective). p. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively). with e. cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. this was most notable with s. viridans where  the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. conclusions: this study validates the use of the bact/alert system for the detection of bacteria in prp-derived plts in a pooled format. overall, the use of the bact/alert system allowed the detection of pooled prp-derived plts inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 cfus per ml in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding p. acnes).

TI  == evaluation of the hyplex bloodscreen multiplex pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  == we evaluated the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) system (bag, lich, germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification  of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive bactec 9240 blood culture bottles. the test involves amplification of the bacterial dna by multiplex pcr and subsequent hybridization  of the pcr product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an elisa-based format. the available probes allow the separate detection of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal meca  gene. the hyplex bloodscreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (s. aureus, 100%; s. epidermidis, 97.2%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). the specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (escherichia coli, 92.5%; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; klebsiella spp., 100%; enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; s. aureus, 100%, s. epidermidis, 97.7%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus  faecium, 99.6%; streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). the result of the meca gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of staphylococcus aureus investigated. in conclusion, the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-elisa system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the meca gene of staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.

TI  == daptomycin in vitro susceptibility in european gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine the activity of daptomycin, a novel  lipopeptide, against european gram-positive isolates (n = 1539). the mic(90)-values of daptomycin against staphylococcus aureus isolates was 0.25 mg/l, against enterococcus faecalis 4 mg/l, against enterococcus faecium 8 mg/l,  0.25 mg/l against staphylococcus epidermidis, and 0.25mg/l against streptococcus  pneumoniae. daptomycin was equally potent against antibiotic-susceptible and resistant strains within a particular species. based on a breakpoint of 1 mg/l for s. aureus and group a streptococci, all isolates tested were susceptible to daptomycin. based on a breakpoint of 4 mg/l for vancomcyin-susceptible e. faecalis 99.7% of these isolates were susceptible to daptomycin.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == acute neck infections in children.
AB  == a retrospective review was conducted on 132 patients aged between two and 15 years with cervical lymphadenitis and/or with abscess formation to determine the  epidemiologic and clinical presentation of these infections. the most common locations were the upper anterior cervical space (43.2%) and the submandibular space (27.3%). the duration of symptoms ranged from 12 hours to 20 days. results  of the pus cultures were available in 31 patients (23.5%). of these, 16 cultures  (51.6%) were positive. the isolated organisms were staphylococcus aureus (50%), staphylococcus epidermidis (31.3%), group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus (12.5%), streptococcus pneumoniae (6.3%) and escherichia coli (6.3%). one of the specimens yielded mixed organisms (staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pneumoniae). penicillin resistance was documented in six (37.5%) of the 16 gram-positive bacteria isolated from the pus culture. both throat and blood cultures were available in all 132 patients. seven throat cultures (5.3%) were positive for group a beta hemolytic streptococci, whereas five blood cultures (3.8%) were reported to have bacterial growth. sixty-seven patients (50.8%) were  treated with ampicillin-sulbactam, 53 patients (40.1%) with ampicillin-sulbactam  and ornidazole and 12 patients (9.1%) with ceftriaxone parenterally. the mean duration of hospital stay related to the infection was 7.30 +/- 3.89 days (range, 2-28 days). the mean period for downsizing of the cervical mass by half was 4.05  +/- 2.05 days, and the recovery period (total antibiotic usage period) was 13.72  +/- 5.33 days. all of the patients had an uneventful recovery without complications. results of both throat and blood cultures were not predictive for  etiologic agents in our study group. since ultrasonographic evaluation of each patient has limited additional benefits in clinical management, it must be reserved for selected cases to document abscess formation.

TI  == applicability of rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing in the management of bacterial endophthalmitis.
AB  == purpose: to compare the applicability of the kirby-bauer disk diffusion method (conventional method) and the rapid antibiotic susceptibility test (rast) for susceptibility testing of bacteria in the management of bacterial endophthalmitis. methods: vitreous samples from 114 consecutive patients with endophthalmitis who were seen between june 2002 and october 2002 were subjected to microbiological processing (smears and cultures for bacteria and fungi). forty-seven of 114 samples could be tested by rast. in addition, the bacterial isolates from 47 patients were tested for antibiotic susceptibility by the conventional method, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of various antibiotics were determined. clinical and microbiological data for these 47 patients were analyzed. results: bacteria were isolated by routine culture from 18 (38.3%) of 47 samples; all 18 were tested by the conventional method, and mics were determined for antibiotic susceptibility. only 10 (55.6%) of these 18 samples were analyzed by rast. low inoculum and the slow-growing nature of the organisms (streptococcus, 3; staphylococcus epidermidis, 5) accounted for no growth on rast plates in eight cases. of four patients who were treated with repeated intraocular antibiotics, only one received rast result-guided intraocular injection. considering mic testing as the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of rast were either equal to (gentamicin, cefazolin,  vancomycin, and chloramphenicol) or lower than (ciprofloxacin) those of the conventional technique. conclusion: this comparative study failed to demonstrate  a distinct advantage of rast as a routine procedure in the management of bacterial endophthalmitis because of the need for trained staff to perform rast,  the nearly 50% negativity of culture, and the occasionally unreliable results.

TI  == defective neutrophil oxidative burst in preterm newborns on exposure to coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  == the neutrophil oxidative burst is a product of the regulated assembly of the multicomponent oxidase enzyme. our aim was to compare the oxidative burst in term (n = 10) and preterm newborns <31 wk gestational age (n = 10) after stimulation with coagulase-negative staphylococci in vitro. strains of streptococcus epidermidis with different invasive and slime-producing properties, one strain of s. haemolyticus, and one strain of group b-streptococcus were investigated. a whole-blood flow cytometric assay using the oxidation of hydroethidine to ethidium bromide was used. the oxidative activity in unstimulated neutrophil granulocytes [polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnls)] was similar in term and preterm newborns, but the preterm newborns showed a significantly lower capacity  to up-regulate the oxidative burst intensity after bacterial stimulation (p = 0.004). in the term but not in the preterm group, the oxidative burst intensity after bacterial stimulation correlated with the baseline oxidative burst intensity. after bacterial stimulation, there was a trend toward a greater percentage of activated neutrophils in the term group than in the preterm group,  but the difference was less pronounced than that in oxidative burst intensity. significant differences in oxidative burst response to different bacterial strains were observed (p < 0.001), but the differences could not be correlated exclusively to invasive capacity or slime-producing properties. it is concluded that the baseline oxidative activity is similar in term and preterm pmnls but that preterm pmnls have a decreased capacity to increase the oxidative burst in response to bacterial stimulation.

TI  == sterility of glaucoma medications among chronic users in the community.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the sterility of topical glaucoma medications among chronic  glaucoma medication users in the community. setting: glaucoma service, sanz medical center, laniado hospital, netanya. research mode: cross-sectional laboratory and clinical study. patients and methods: chronic glaucoma patients were asked to submit their topical glaucoma preparations to the microbiology laboratory at laniado hospital. samples taken from the interior of the bottle and the tip were cultured using macconkey agar, blood agar, and chocolate agar plates. results: sixty-two bottles of topical glaucoma medications used by 27 patients were tested. bacterial growth was detected in eight (12.9%) preparations, three of which revealed pseudomonas aeruginosa, three staphylococcus epidermidis, one streptococcus viridans, and one klebsiella. during the study, acute conjunctivitis was found in one patient, possibly due to  the use of infected drops. in another case, two identical medications, which had  been used simultaneously for more than 6 weeks by the same patient, were found to be infected. conclusions: glaucoma topical preparations are generally found safe  in terms of sterility, though bacterial growth may be found in a small percentage. in most cases, the cause of the loss of sterility could not be determined. however, in two preparations, contamination was related to the noncompliance of the patient who continued using the same preparation longer than instructed. it is imperative to increase the awareness of glaucoma patients to the fact that improper use can lead to eye-drop contamination.

TI  == algorithm for the identification of bacterial pathogens in positive blood cultures by real-time lightcycler polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with sequence-specific probes.
AB  == we developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays for rapid detection of the most common and clinically relevant bacteria in positive blood culture bottles, including staphylococcus spp., s. epidermidis, s. aureus, enterococcus spp. (including differentiation of e. faecalis and e. faecium), streptococcus spp., streptococcus agalactiae, enterobacteriaceae, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter spp., bacteroides spp., haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. a total of 507 positive blood cultures were investigated according to a specific pcr algorithm based on the microscopic result of the blood culture, and the pcr results were compared to the culture results. apart from-cross reactions between e. coli and chryseomonas luteola and enterococcus faecium and e. durans, the pcr assay correctly identified all bacteria in the blood cultures and did not show any false-positive results. regarding blood cultures positive with a single species of bacteria (n = 474), 98.3% of all bacteria were correctly detected by the pcr algorithm within a few hours. however, in mixed infections, the sensitivity was lower. the pcr algorithm is well suited for rapid identification of the most common bacteria in  positive blood cultures.

TI  == bacteremia in cirrhotic patients submitted to endoscopic band ligation of esophageal varices.
AB  == background: endoscopic procedures can develop bacteremia. patients with chronic liver disease are more predisposed to undergo bacteremia and infections because they are immunocompromised. aims: the purpose of this study was to determine the  incidence of bacteremia in cirrhotics submitted to endoscopic variceal ligation.  methods: three groups of 40 patients each were studied. one group was made up of  patients with cirrhosis who were submitted to ligation, a second group was composed of cirrhotics who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy only, and a third group was composed of patients without liver disease who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy. blood was sampled from all patients for culture, both in aerobic and in anaerobic mediums, immediately before endoscopy and at 5 and 30 minutes after its completion. results: blood culture was positive in 6 samples. in 4 of these, the bacteria (staphylococcus hominis hominis, staphylococcus auricularis, acinetobacter lwoffii, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus) were isolated before the endoscopic procedure and thus were considered as contamination. in the ligation group, a streptococcus of the viridans group was isolated 5 minutes after the procedure, and in the cirrhosis without ligation group, a staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated at 30 minutes. none of the patients showed clinical evidence of infection. conclusions: the bacteremia incidence in cirrhotic patients submitted to variceal ligation was 2.5%, showing  no difference from the control groups.

TI  == [nationwide sensitivity surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antibiotics against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--the first ciproxan iv special investigation in 2001].
AB  == the parenteral injection of ciprofloxacin (cpfx), a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drug, was approved in september 2000 and a re-examination period of 6 years was set at that time. as a special investigation to apply for re-examination of this  drug, it has been planned to conduct 3 nationwide surveillances during the re-examination period by collecting clinically isolated bacteria from patients with severe infections, to whom the drug was mainly indicated, and examining drug susceptibilities of the bacteria to various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx. this time, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx against 1,220 strains isolated from patients with severe infections by the micro-liquid dilution method and compared susceptibilities of various clinically isolated bacteria to cpfx with those to other antimicrobial drugs. gram-positive bacteria  were less susceptible to cpfx than to carbapenems except 2 bacterial species, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium but susceptibilities of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), staphylococcus epidermidis  and enterococcus faecalis to cpfx were comparable to those to cefozopran. susceptibility of streptococcus pneumoniae to cpfx did not differ among ampicillin (abpc)-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic of abpc: < 0.25 microgram/ml), abpc-intermediate s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: 0.25-2 micrograms/ml) and abpc-resistant s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: > or = 4 micrograms/ml) mic90 of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) and a decrease in the antimicrobial activity seen among cephem and carbapenem antimicrobial drugs against penicillin-intermediate strains was not noted with cpfx. gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to cpfx similarly to carbapenems and the mic90 values of cpfx were in the range from < or = 0.063 to 2 micrograms/ml against strains except stenotrophomonas maltophilia and burkholderia cepacia. pseudomonas aeruginosa was most susceptible to cpfx among the antibacterial drugs examined and the mic90 was 2 micrograms/ml. cpfx also showed the lowest mic90 value (0.5 microgram/ml) against beta-lactam-resistant p. aeruginosa among the drugs examined. when extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production and class b beta-lactamase production were examined in 439 strains of enterobacteriaceae and 168 strains of  glucose non-fermentative bacteria out of the gram-negative bacteria collected this time, 3 strains (0.49%) producing esbl and 7 strains (1.15%) producing class b beta-lactamase were found. the mic range of cpfx to these 10 strains was between < or = 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml and 5 strains among those showed susceptibilities (mic of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) based on the nccls breakpoint. cpfx also showed a satisfactory result concerning susceptibilities of major causal bacteria based on the report of the committee of japan society of chemotherapy on the standard method for determination of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, the breakpoint of pneumonia. furthermore, susceptibilities  of various bacteria isolated clinically from patients with severe infections this time did not differ much from the result of the nationwide surveillance which we  conducted in 1997. thus, it was concluded that the antimicrobial activity of cpfx was maintained in the post-marketing surveillance for its parenteral preparation.

TI  == evaluation of a new generation of plastic culture bottles with an automated microbial detection system for nine common contaminating organisms found in plt components.
AB  == background: a microbial detection system (bact/alert 3d, biomerieux [formerly organon teknika]) has previously been validated with a variety of bacterial contaminants in plts. the recovery of nine organisms seeded into plts with new plastic culture bottles was studied in comparison to the current glass bottles. the use of plastic instead of glass would be expected to reduce the risk of injury. study design and methods: isolates of bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into day 2 (>24 hr <48 hr) apheresis plt  units to 10 and 100 cfus per ml. replicate samples (4 ml) were inoculated into both current- and new-generation standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles. results: all organisms (with the exception of p. acnes) were detected in a mean time of 9.3 to 18.9 hours (10 cfus/ml) or 8.7 to 18.2 hours (100 cfus/ml). in aggregate (with the exception of p. acnes), the plastic and glass aerobic bottles had a mean difference in detection of 1.2 hours (p < 0.0001), and the plastic and glass anaerobic bottles had a mean difference of 3.3 hours (p < 0.0001). in all cases,  the mean detection time was superior or clinically comparable (within 0.1 hr) with the new plastic bottles. p. acnes (an anaerobic organism) was detected with  the new and current anaerobic bottles in a mean of 72.8 and 90.4 hours (10 cfus/ml) or 64.0 and 80.8 hours (100 cfus/ml), respectively. the narrower bottle  neck and smaller inoculation septum present with the new-generation plastic bottles were inoculated with comparable ease to that of the glass bottles. conclusions: these data demonstrate that the new plastic bottles are clinically comparable or superior to the current glass standard aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

TI  == treatment of experimental bacterial keratitis with topical trovafloxacin.
AB  == objective: to investigate the therapeutic role of trovafloxacin mesylate, a newer-generation fluoroquinolone with an expanded spectrum of activity, in the treatment of experimental bacterial keratitis. methods: susceptibility studies were performed on various strains of ocular isolates to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of trovafloxacin compared with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, using the e-test method. pharmacokinetic studies were performed by a single topical administration of trovafloxacin to rabbit eyes with either an intact or denuded corneal epithelium. aqueous humor, vitreous, and corneal concentrations of trovafloxacin were determined at different time points. experimental bacterial keratitis studies were performed in rabbit eyes. three identical studies were conducted using staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. therapy groups included 0.5% trovafloxacin, 0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. after 12 hours of drops administration, corneas were excised, homogenized, and serially plated. the main outcome measure was quantitative bacteriologic analysis for residual colony-forming units. results: in vitro susceptibility study findings indicated that the mic of trovafloxacin was significantly lower than the mic of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae, lower than the mic of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for staphylococcus epidermidis, and intermediate between ciprofloxacin  and ofloxacin for p. aeruginosa. pharmacokinetic studies showed a significant concentration of trovafloxacin in the treated corneas, especially in eyes with a  denuded epithelium. all serum samples had undetectable trovafloxacin concentrations. experimental keratitis studies showed a statistically significant decrease of colony-forming units in trovafloxacin-treated eyes in the s. aureus model and a similar decrease in the s pneumoniae and p aeruginosa models. conclusions: topical 0.5% trovafloxacin proved to be an effective ocular medication for the therapy of gram-positive and gram-negative keratitis. clinical relevance trovafloxacin may provide an excellent therapeutic alternative in bacterial keratitis.

AB  == objective: to determine the efficacy and safety of topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension compared with ofloxacin otic solution in the treatment of acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes (aomt) in pediatric patients. methods: this multicenter, prospective, randomized, observer-masked, parallel-group study was conducted at 39 sites in 599 children aged >or=6 months to 12 years with an aomt episode of <or=3 weeks' duration. the  mean age of patients was 2.5 years (standard deviation: 2.37 years). patients received either ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% otic suspension 4 drops twice daily for 7 days or ofloxacin 0.3% otic solution 5 drops twice daily for 10 days. clinical signs and symptoms of aomt were evaluated at clinic visits on days 1 (baseline), 3 (on therapy), 11 (end of therapy), and 18 (test of cure). a patient diary was used to measure time to cessation of otorrhea. principal pretherapy pathogens included streptococcus pneumoniae (16.8%), staphylococcus aureus (13.0%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.7%), haemophilus influenzae (12.4%), s epidermidis (10.2%), and moraxella catarrhalis (4.1%). results: ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone is superior to ofloxacin for clinical cure (90% vs 78%) and microbiologic success (92% vs 81.8%) at the test-of-cure visit, produces fewer treatment failures (4.4% vs 14.1%), and results in a shorter median time to cessation of otorrhea (4 days vs 6 days). ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone treatment is also superior to improvement in clinical response by visit, absence of otorrhea by visit, and reduction of otorrhea volume by visit. both topical otic preparations are safe and well tolerated in pediatric patients. no change in speech recognition threshold or decrease in hearing from baseline, based on audiometric testing, was noted with either regimen. conclusion: topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone treatment is superior to topical ofloxacin in the treatment of aomt.

TI  == endophthalmitis isolates and antibiotic sensitivities: a 6-year review of culture-proven cases.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the spectrum of organisms causing culture-proven endophthalmitis and their sensitivities to commonly used antimicrobial agents. design: retrospective, noncomparative, consecutive case series. methods: medical  records were reviewed of all patients with culture-proven endophthalmitis at a single institution between january 1, 1996, and december 31, 2001. endophthalmitis categories included postoperative, posttraumatic, endogenous, and miscellaneous (for example, keratitis). the outcome measures included intravitreal isolates identified, antibiotic sensitivities, and category of endophthalmitis. results: in all, 313 organisms were isolated from 278 patients during the study interval. the most common organisms identified were staphylococcus epidermidis in 27.8% (87/313), streptococcus viridans group in 12.8% (40/313), other coagulase-negative staphylococci in 9.3% (29/313), staphylococcus aureus in 7.7% (24/313), and propionibacterium acnes in 7.0% (22/313). overall, 246 of 313 (78.5%) isolates were gram-positive organisms, 37 (11.8%) were gram-negative organisms, and 27 (8.6%) were fungi. for gram-positive organisms, sensitivities were the following: vancomycin 100%, gentamicin 78.4%, ciprofloxacin 68.3%, ceftazidime 63.6%, and cefazolin 66.8%. for gram-negative organisms, sensitivities were the following: ciprofloxacin 94.2%, amikacin 80.9%, ceftazidime 80.0%, and gentamicin 75.0%. fungal isolates were candida species (9/313), aspergillus species (9/313), and other molds (9/313). among the endophthalmitis categories, the most frequent organisms were the following: (1) acute-onset postoperative: s epidermidis, 46.9%; (2) delayed-onset postoperative: s epidermidis, 22.7%; (3) delayed-onset bleb-associated: fastidious gram-negative rods, 20.4%; (4) posttraumatic: s epidermidis, 20.8%; (5) endogenous: aspergillus species, 20.8%; and (6) miscellaneous: molds (other), 36.4%. conclusions: in considering antibiotic treatment of endophthalmitis, it is important to recognize that no single antibiotic provided coverage for all of the microbes isolated from eyes with endophthalmitis. combination therapy is recommended as the initial empiric treatment of suspected bacterial endophthalmitis. appropriate history and characteristic clinical features may justify the use of initial antifungal agents. knowledge of the most frequent causative organisms in various categories  will help direct appropriate initial therapy.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

TI  == innate immune response of oral and foreskin keratinocytes: utilization of different signaling pathways by various bacterial species.
AB  == the innate immune response is critical for the epithelial antimicrobial barrier.  the human beta-defensins are small, cationic antimicrobial peptides that are made by epithelial cells and that play a role in mucosal and skin defenses. human beta-defensin 1 (hbd-1) is expressed constitutively in epithelial tissues, whereas hbd-2 and hbd-3 are expressed in response to bacterial stimuli or inflammation. previous studies showed that hbd-2 was induced by fusobacterium nucleatum cell wall extract without the involvement of the nf-kappab transcription factors, which typically are associated with innate immunity and inflammation. the goal of this study was to characterize signaling pathways involved in hbd-2 induction in response to commensal and pathogenic bacteria. cultured human oral and foreskin keratinocytes were treated separately with inhibitors of nf-kappab, c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk), and p38 and then stimulated with oral commensal streptococcus gordonii, oral pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, skin commensal staphylococcus epidermidis, or skin pathogen streptococcus pyogenes. different bacteria induced different levels of hbd-2 and in response to the various inhibitors tested, although certain common patterns were observed for commensal-  and pathogen-stimulated cells. hbd-2 induction by all bacteria tested was partially or completely blocked by inhibitors of the jnk and p38 pathways. however, in addition, hbd-2 induction by pathogenic bacteria in both oral and foreskin keratinocytes was blocked by inhibitors of nf-kappab. the results indicate that commensal and pathogenic bacteria utilize different pathways in hbd-2 induction and suggest that epithelial cells from different body sites have  common signaling mechanisms to distinguish between commensal and pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == hiv infected adults do not have an excess of colonising bacteria in their large airways.
AB  == background: hiv infected adults have increased susceptibility to bacterial pneumonia but the underlying immune defect is poorly understood. we tested the hypothesis that hiv infection might be associated with increased bacterial colonisation of distal airways by nasal flora, which would then predispose patients to bacterial pneumonia. methods: healthy volunteer adults with normal chest radiographs were recruited. bronchoscopy was carried out and uncontaminated mucosal samples were collected from proximal and distal sites in the large airways using a protected specimen brush. samples were cultured to detect typical respiratory tract colonising organisms, and the proportion of samples found to contain colonising bacteria compared between hiv infected and uninfected subjects using non-parametric tests. results: forty-nine subjects were studied of whom 27  were hiv infected. colonising bacteria were identified in the nasopharynx of all  subjects including streptococcus pneumoniae in 6/49 subjects (5 hiv uninfected).  colonising bacteria were found in the distal airway of 6 subjects (3/27 hiv infected vs 3/22 hiv uninfected; chi2 = 0.07, p = 0.8). streptococcus pneumoniae  was identified in the trachea of all subjects with nasal colonisation but in the  distal airway of only 1 subject. conclusions: there was no evidence to support a  hypothesis of increased airway bacterial colonisation in healthy hiv infected subjects.

TI  == increased killing of staphylococci and streptococci by daptomycin compared with cefazolin and vancomycin in an in vitro peritoneal dialysate model.
AB  == peritoneal dialysate fluid (pdf) is a bacteriostatic medium that compromises the  antibacterial activity of cell wall-active agents. by use of an in vitro static model, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus  epidermidis (msse), and streptococcus sanguis were exposed to daptomycin at concentrations of 10, 30, and 100 mg/liter, cefazolin at 125 mg/liter, and vancomycin at 25 mg/liter in cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth or todd hewitt  broth (for s. sanguis) and pdf at phs of 5.5 and 7.4. the ph had no effect on antibacterial activity. neither cefazolin nor vancomycin produced a bactericidal  or a bacteriostatic effect versus mrsa, mssa, msse, or s. sanguis in pdf, while all concentrations of daptomycin were bactericidal against all organisms in pdf.  daptomycin did not exhibit concentration-dependent activity in pdf. daptomycin appears to be a promising agent for use in peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis, producing bacterial kill to a greater extent and at a higher rate than cefazolin or vancomycin in pdf.

TI  == an engineered multidomain bactericidal peptide as a model for targeted antibiotics against specific bacteria.
AB  == we constructed a peptide consisting of a staphylococcal agrd1 pheromone fused to  the channel-forming domain of colicin ia and named it pheromonicin. this fusion peptide had bactericidal effects against methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mssa and mrsa, respectively), but not against staphylococcus epidermidis or streptococcus pneumoniae. growth rates, vital staining and colony forming unit (cfu) counts showed that pheromonicin did  not merely suppress growth but killed s. aureus cells. the specificity of pheromonicin was shown by the absence of bactericidal effects against an accessory gene regulator (agr) locus knockout of s. aureus, and a dose-dependent  inhibition of the bactericidal effects of pheromonicin by competition with corresponding free agrd pheromone. in vivo, all pheromonicin-treated mice survived administration of mrsa that was lethal to controls. no toxicity was detectable in human liver or renal cells in culture, or in livers, kidneys or spleens of pheromonicin-treated mice. the results suggest that these types of chimeric peptides may be of value as antibiotics against specific bacterial infections.

TI  == inhibition of adhesion of yeasts and bacteria by poly(ethylene oxide)-brushes on  glass in a parallel plate flow chamber.
AB  == poly(ethylene oxide) (peo)-brushes are generally recognized as protein-repellent  surfaces, and although a role in discouraging microbial adhesion has been established for some strains and species, no study exists on the effects of peo-brushes on a large variety of bacterial and yeast strains. in this paper, a peo-brush has been covalently attached to glass and silica by reaction in a polymer melt. subsequently, the presence of a peo-brush was demonstrated using contact angle measurements, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ellipsometry. for five bacterial (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus salivarius, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and two yeast strains (candida albicans and candida tropicalis), adhesion to peo-brushes  was compared with adhesion to bare glass in a parallel plate flow chamber. the initial deposition rates of sta. epidermidis, sta. aureus and str. salivarius to  glass were relatively high, between 2400 and 2600 cm(-2) s(-1), while e. coli and p. aeruginosa deposited much more slowly. the initial deposition rates of the yeasts to glass were 144 and 444 cm(-2) s(-1) for c. albicans gb 1/2 and c. tropicalis gb 9/9, respectively. coating of the glass surface with a peo-brush yielded more than 98 % reduction in bacterial adhesion, although for the more hydrophobic p. aeruginosa a smaller reduction was observed. for both yeast species adhesion suppression was less effective than for the bacteria and here too the more hydrophobic c. tropicalis showed less reduction than the more hydrophilic c. albicans. the peo-brush had a thickness of 22 nm in water, as inferred from ellipsometry. assuming that on bare glass the adhered micro-organisms are positioned only a few nanometers away from the surface and that the brush keeps them at a distance of 22 nm, it is calculated that the brush yields a sevenfold attenuation of the lifshitz-van der waals attraction to the surface between the micro-organisms and the surface. decreased lifshitz-van der waals attraction may be responsible for the suppression of the microbial adhesion observed.

TI  == [vitrectomy for endophthalmitis after cataract surgery].
AB  == purpose: to identify risk factors of poor visual outcome with vitrectomy for early-onset endophthalmitis after cataract surgery. patients and methods: clinical records of 29 consecutive eyes with endophthalmitis developing within 6  weeks after cataract surgery and that underwent therapeutic vitrectomy between june 1996 and april 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. twenty-two of the eyes received intravitreal injections of vancomycin and ceftazidime at the time of vitrectomy, and all patients received intravenous antibiotics. eyes were divided  into two groups; group a consisted of 22 eyes with a final visual acuity of 0.2 or greater, and group b consisted of 7 eyes with a final visual acuity of less than 0.2. results: fifteen eyes (52%) in group a achieved a visual acuity of 0.5  or better and 8(28%) achieved a visual acuity of 1.0, while 4 eyes in group b developed phthisis bulbi. for eyes with a preoperative visual acuity of hand motions or worse, there was no correlation between final visual acuity and preoperative visual acuity. the overall culture-positive rate was 57%. in group a, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis was identified in 6 eyes, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) in 3 eyes and enterococcus in  2 eyes. in group b, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (ahs) was identified in 4 eyes, aspergillus in 1 eye, and mrsa in 1 eye. all isolates were sensitive to vancomycin with the exception of the aspergillus. ahs infection appeared to be associated with wound failure from the initial cataract surgery and a poor visual outcome. among 3 of the eyes that developed phthisis bulbi, intravitreal injection of antibiotics was not performed. conclusion: early vitrectomy and intravitreal injection of vancomycin may improve visual outcomes, but infection with ahs may be associated with cataract surgery wound failure and poor visual outcomes.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of oxidized regenerated cellulose against antibiotic-resistant microorganisms.
AB  == background: the emergence of multi-drug resistant microorganisms presents a critical problem for patients undergoing surgery. acidic ph, which is produced by oxidized regenerated cellulose (orc), is a broad-spectrum physiological detriment to survival of microorganisms known to cause surgical infections. the purpose of  this study was to examine the antimicrobial effect of orc against antibiotic-resistant organisms. methods: orc products were challenged with atcc reference strains and clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp), and non-resistant atcc strains of s. aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. samples of three orc products (surgicel absorbable hemostat, surgicel fibrillar absorbable hemostat, and surgicel nu-knit absorbable hemostat and identified, respectively, as orc-r, orc-f, and orc-n for this study) were inoculated with challenge organisms in nutrient broth to produce a weight to volume ratio of 15 mg orc/ml. plate counts were performed at 0, 1, 6, and 24 h. results: antimicrobial activity was seen with all three orc products against the  challenge organisms. data indicate that antibiotic-resistant microorganisms remain susceptible to the antimicrobial activity of orc. in testing with nine of  10 bacteria, including four antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates (vre, mrsa, and prsp) three-log or greater reductions were seen at 24-h exposure. one atcc strain of vre demonstrated some level of resistance to the acidic ph effect. orc-n showed a three-log reduction with this organism, whereas the reductions with orc-r and orc-f were less than one log. conclusion: since low ph affects a relatively broad-spectrum of bacteria and does not act in a mechanism-specific manner, as do antibiotics, antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria are unlikely  to resist the orc ph effect. results of this in vitro assessment support the hypothesis that the antimicrobial activity of orc is effective against antibiotic-resistant microorganisms.

AB  == aim: to identify key risk factors and the management and outcome of severe infective keratitis leading to public hospital admission in new zealand. methods: over a 2 year period, all admissions of presumed infective keratitis to auckland  hospital were identified. the clinical records of all 103 cases were retrospectively reviewed with respect to clinical features, risk factors, management, and outcomes. results: the mean time from first symptoms or signs and presentation to hospital was 8.9 (sd 15.5) days. the majority of subjects, 88%, had at least one of the risk factors commonly associated with infective keratitis including previous ocular surgery (30%), contact lens wear (26%), topical corticosteroid use (25%), and ocular trauma (24%). corneal scraping was performed in 92% and of a total of 105 scrapes, 71% were positive. bacteria were isolated in all these cases, the majority being gram positive organisms (72%). the most common isolates identified were coagulase negative staphylococcus (16%), propionibacterium acnes (14%), staphylococcus epidermidis (11%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (9%). in addition, yeasts were isolated in 5%, fungi in  4%, virus in 2%, and chlamydia in 1%. importantly, polymicrobial infection accounted for 33% of culture positive cases. antimicrobial treatment was changed  on the basis of culture results in 17 cases (16.5%). median initial visual and final best corrected visual acuity was 6/36-6/48 (logmar 0.86) (iqr 0.39-2.00) and 6/12-6/15 (logmar 0.360) (iqr 0.15-1.70), respectively. previous ocular surgery and topical corticosteroid use were significantly associated with poorer  visual acuity. the mean hospital stay was 5.8 days and the median 4.0 (iqr 2.0-8.0) days. longer duration of stay was associated with the presence of hypopyon, larger ulcers, previous ocular surgery, and poor visual acuity. conclusions: infectious keratitis is an important cause of ocular morbidity. a significant proportion of cases have potentially modifiable risk factors. previous ocular surgery and topical corticosteroid use, in particular, were associated with poorer visual outcomes. many cases of severe keratitis might be avoided, or their severity reduced, by appropriate education of patients and ophthalmologists.

AB  == background: in recent years, the diagnosis of infective endocarditis has been enhanced by the use of echocardiography. we sought, therefore, to review its effect on the management of endocarditis in children. methods: we reviewed all the patients presenting to our institution for evaluation for infective endocarditis from may 1994 to january 2002. the patients were stratified according to whether or not they had congenitally malformed hearts. results: of the 90 referred patients identified, 46 (51%) had positive ultrasonic findings. of these, we excluded 26 patients because of the presence of indwelling lines. the remaining 20 patients with features of endocarditis had a median age of 6.5 years, and a range from 0.14 to 8.5 years. there were 4 patients with normal hearts, and 16 with congenital cardiac malformations. we identified rupture of a  sinus of valsalva in four patients, with rupture into the left ventricle in two,  and into the right ventricle and right atrium in one each. the mitral valve was involved in six patients, the aortic valve in another six, including all four with rupture of the sinus of valsalva, both mitral and aortic valves in three, the pulmonary trunk in three patients, and the tricuspid valve and a blalock-taussig shunt in one patient each. organisms isolated included streptococcus mitis in 4 patients, streptococcus pneumoniae in 2 patients, streptococcus sanguis in 1, staphylococcus aureus in 3, staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, and enteroccocus in 2. cultures proved negative in 7 patients.  surgical intervention was needed in 12 patients, and one died (5%). only the left-sided chambers were involved in those with normal hearts. both patients infected with streptococcus pneumoniae had rupture of a sinus of valsalva. conclusion: involvement of the left-sided chambers is more likely in structurally normal hearts, and in cases with rupture of a sinus of valsalva, in which case infection with streptococcus pneumonia should be suspected.

AB  == sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the c-2 side chain. in agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) with a mic(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. furthermore, sm-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against mrsa, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the mic. sm-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of mrsa in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. the mics of sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and  penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. these drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against enterococcus faecium, and the mic(90) s for ampicillin-resistant e. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. however, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity  of sm-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an e. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in cfu at four times the mic after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. in addition, sm-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the e. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the mics (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), moraxella catarrhalis, and bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus spp. thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

TI  == small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of gram-positive and gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus  pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, helicobacter pylori, chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni. large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two s. aureus libraries, highly representative. consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the  identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. the use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.

TI  == comparative bactericidal activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and norfloxacin against clinical isolates conventionally classified as resistant to fluoroquinolones were compared at their maximum concentrations in serum, urine (except moxifloxacin) and bronchial mucosa (except norfloxacin). time killing curves against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pneumoniae  were performed. serum concentrations of the tested drugs were not able to produce a bactericidal effect on fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. in the urine series,  levofloxacin was always bactericidal (decrease > or = 3 logs cfu/ml), while norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were bactericidal on e. coli (both), p. mirabilis (norfloxacin) and p. aeruginosa (ciprofloxacin). in the bronchial mucosa series,  s. pneumoniae was rapidly killed by levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, and k. pneumoniae by levofloxacin after 12 hours. in conclusion, the maximum levofloxacin concentrations achievable at certain body sites allowed killing even of strains defined as resistant by conventional breakpoints.

TI  == linezolid resistance since 2001: sentry antimicrobial surveillance program.
AB  == background: the oxazolidinone class of antimicrobials has demonstrated remarkable activity against gram-positive cocci. linezolid has proven to be a first-line therapeutic option for vancomycin-resistant strains. linezolid clinical trial results and subsequent published case reports cite rare resistance emerging in patients receiving prolonged therapy. objective: to report the initial linezolid-resistant organisms from cases obtained through the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, after screening >40,000 gram-positive cocci without resistance between 1998 and 2000. methods: during 2001-2002, 8 resistant  strains (from 8 different patients) located in 6 states from 7 different participating sentry institutions in the us were identified among bloodstream, respiratory, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract infection isolates of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus oralis. resistance was detected by reference broth microdilution methods and confirmed by identical results using etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) and the standardized disk diffusion method. results: minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and disk diffusion tests showed elevated mics (> or =8 microg/ml) and small inhibitory zone diameters (< or =15 mm) for all strains to both linezolid and the investigational oxazolidinone azd2563. vancomycin resistance was detected in 2 of the 8 linezolid-resistant strains. all enterococci and the viridans-group streptococcus (s. oralis) strain showed resistance to erythromycin. e. faecium strains were resistant to penicillins, but susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin. only 3 of the patients had previously received the drug. conclusions: linezolid resistance remains rare, with only 8 isolates among 9833 (0.08%) monitored isolates identified between january 1, 2001, and june 30, 2002. resistance, however, was no longer limited to enterococci. clinical laboratories should test linezolid more widely to detect emerging resistance, especially for patients receiving oxazolidinone therapy. longitudinal surveillance programs are warranted to detect a trend in the development of resistance, determine the molecular mechanism of resistance, and recommend alternative therapies or epidemiologic interventions.

TI  == central line sepsis.
AB  == since 1980, the placement of central venous access devices has become routine, and these catheters have been of great benefit in the treatment of patients with  cancer. unfortunately, central venous catheters have not been without complications. central line sepsis has been reported to be one of the most frequently occurring complications, and although it is extremely costly to treat, more importantly, this condition is potentially life threatening to patients. developing strategies that would prevent central line catheter infections has been a continual challenge for healthcare providers. studies have been conducted  on the use of catheters with antiseptic coatings, antimicrobial coatings, impregnated antimicrobial cuffs, prophylactic antibiotic therapy, antibiotic locks, use of antithrombolytics, different exit site dressings, and the use of various disinfectants for cleansing catheter exit sites. healthcare providers, including oncology nurses, need to be knowledgeable concerning potential sources  of infection and factors that may lead to central line sepsis (chaiyakunapruk, veenstra, lipsky, & saint, 2002; darouiche et al., 1999; little & palmer, 1998; veenstra, saint, saha, lumley, & sullivan, 1999). they need to advocate for the use of sterile technique during catheter insertion and aseptic technique when routine maintenance is provided and be aware of the standard treatments for and potential outcomes of central line catheter infections. in addition, oncology nurses should be encouraged to support and participate in controlled, randomized  studies that may provide scientific-based practices that decrease the number of catheter-related infections in the future.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of s-3578, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against clinical isolates was evaluated. the mics of the drug at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited were 4 micro g/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and 2 micro g/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, which were fourfold higher than and equal to those of vancomycin, respectively. the anti-mrsa activity of s-3578 was considered to be due to its high affinity for penicillin-binding protein 2a (50% inhibitory concentration, 4.5 micro g/ml). in time-kill studies with 10 strains each of mrsa and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, s-3578 caused more than a 4-log(10) decrease of viable cells on the average at twice the mic after 24 h of exposure,  indicating that it had potent bactericidal activity. furthermore, in population analysis of mrsa strains with heterogeneous or homogeneous resistance to imipenem, no colonies emerged from about 10(9) cells on agar plates containing twice the mic of s-3578, suggesting the low frequency of emergence of s-3578-resistant strains from mrsa. s-3578 was also highly active against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp), with a mic(90) of 1 micro g/ml, which was comparable to that of ceftriaxone. s-3578 also had antibacterial  activity against a variety of gram-negative bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa, though its activity was not superior to that of cefepime. in conclusion, s-3578 exhibited a broad antibacterial spectrum and, particularly, had excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and prsp. thus, s-3578 was considered to be worthy of further evaluation.

TI  == keratinocyte expression of human beta defensin 2 following bacterial infection: role in cutaneous host defense.
AB  == human beta defensin 2 (hbetad-2) is thought to play an important role in cutaneous immune defense. we hypothesized that (i) keratinocyte expression of hbetad-2, measured by reverse transcription-pcr, would be upregulated in response to challenge with pathogenic bacteria, particularly highly adherent strains of streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus, and (ii) hbetad-2 would have potent antimicrobial activity against pathogenic but not commensal organisms. expression of hbetad-2 was induced consistently by s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas strains of s.  pyogenes were poor and variable inducers of hbetad-2. no correlation was found between levels of bacterial adherence and keratinocyte expression of hbetad-2. s. pyogenes was significantly more sensitive to killing by hbetad-2 than s. epidermidis. we conclude that the ability to induce hbetad-2 expression in combination with sensitivity to its antimicrobial effects may contribute to the rarity of skin infections with the gram-negative bacterial organisms, whereas lack of stimulation of hbetad-2 expression by s. pyogenes may be important in its ability to evade innate defenses and cause skin disease. induction of expression  of hbetad-2 but relative tolerance to it may enable s. epidermidis to survive on  the skin surface and modulate hbetad-2 expression when the stratum corneum barrier is disrupted.

AB  == subdural empyema represents loculated infection between the outermost layer of the meninges, the dura, and the arachnoid. the empyema may develop intracranially or in the spinal canal. intracranial subdural empyema is most frequently a complication of sinusitis or, less frequently, otitis or neurosurgical procedures. spinal subdural empyema is rare and may result from hematogenous infection or spread of infection from osteomyelitis. the most common organisms in intracranial subdural empyema are anaerobic and microaerophilic streptococci, in  particular those of the streptococcus milleri group (s. milleri and streptococcus anginosus). staphylococcus aureus is present in a minority of cases, and multiple additional organisms, including gram-negative organisms, such as escherichia coli, and anaerobic organisms, such as bacteroides, may be present. pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus epidermidis may be present in cases related to neurosurgical procedures, and salmonella species have been detected in patients with advanced aids; multiple organisms may be present simultaneously. spinal subdural empyemas are almost invariably caused by streptococci or by s. aureus. subdural empyema--whether it occurs in the skull or the spinal canal--may cause rapid compression of the brain or spinal cord, and represents an extreme medical  and neurosurgical emergency. the diagnostic procedure of choice for intracranial  and spinal subdural empyema is mri with gadolinium enhancement. computed tomography scan may miss intracranial subdural empyemas detectable by mri. conversely, occasion spinal subdural empyemas may be detected by ct myelography where mri is negative. treatment in virtually all cases of intracranial or spinal subdural empyema requires prompt surgical drainage and antibiotic therapy. pus from the empyema should always be sent for anaerobic, as well as aerobic, culture. because intracranial subdural empyemas may contain multiple organisms, provisional antibiotic therapy of intracranial subdural empyema, where the organism is unknown, should be directed against s. aureus, microaerophilic and anaerobic streptococci, and gram-negative organisms. antibiotics should include 1) nafcillin, oxacillin, or vancomycin; plus 2) a third generation cephalosporin; plus 3) metronidazole. provisional antibiotic therapy of spinal subdural empyemas should be directed against s. aureus and streptococci, and should include nafcillin, oxacillin, or vancomycin. morbidity and mortality in intracranial and  spinal subdural empyema relate directly to the delay in institution of therapy. both conditions should, thus, be treated with great urgency.

TI  == ultrasonic enhancement of antibiotic action on several species of bacteria.
AB  == the effect of the antibiotics gentamicin, streptomycin, kanamycin, tetracycline,  and ampicillin on planktonic cultures of enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, salmonella derby, streptococcus mitis, and staphylococcus epidermidis with and without an application of 70 khz ultrasound was studied. the ultrasound  was applied at levels that had no inhibitory effect on planktonic cultures of bacteria. measurements of viability at, above, and below the minimum inhibitory concentration of the above antibiotics on the planktonic cultures of these bacteria showed that a simultaneous application of 70 khz ultrasound and antibiotic significantly increased the effectiveness of selected antibiotics. bacterial viability was reduced several orders of magnitude when harmless levels  of ultrasound were combined with some antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides. similar synergistic effects of combined ultrasound and antibiotic treatment were seen in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with several classes of antibiotics. these results may have application in the treatment of bacterial infections normally resistant to some antibiotics.

TI  == development of broad-range polymerase chain reaction (pcr) bacterial identification in diagnosis of infective endocarditis.
AB  == background and aims of the study: the study aim was to identify the value of broad-range bacterial pcr in infective endocarditis (ie) of bacterial etiology, and to determine its specificity and sensitivity. methods: thirty blood samples were taken for analysis from patients with ie (diagnosed according to duke criteria) and acquired valvular heart disease. two control groups of patients with (n = 10) or without (n = 15) urinary tract infection were defined. dna was isolated, and three different primer pairs for the region of the gene coding for  16s rrna were tested, to determine the most specific pair. amplification products were analyzed with gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and located under uv light. results: positive blood cultures were found in 25 patients with ie. a typical echocardiography picture with bacterial vegetations was found in all patients with sterile blood cultures, and in 20 patients with positive blood cultures. the highest specificity was found for forward/reverse (f/r) primers, as the relevant amplified pcr product was present in all blood samples with ie, and in four of 10 patients with urinary tract infection. conclusion: broad-range pcr in bacterial endocarditis is a rapid, sensitive and inexpensive technique for the detection of bacteria, but is far more prone to contamination than species-specific pcr. however, under controlled conditions, broad-range pcr may be valuable for the identification of non-specific infection, permitting a more rapid clinical diagnosis of endocarditis.

TI  == sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  == aims: to test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. methods: the bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 iu/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin b was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees c with five inocula of 14 bacteria. two yeasts  (candida spp) and one aspergillus were also tested. contaminated media were then  inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened  daily by visual inspection. the sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. results: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria  irrespective of the starting inoculums: streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and haemophilus influenzae. for micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal  only (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida kruzei, aspergillus  fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (sd 13.8, range 2-52). in cases of detection by the  blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. conclusions: blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.

TI  == replacing the ascending aorta and aortic valve for acute prosthetic valve endocarditis: is using prosthetic material contraindicated?
AB  == background: the use of prosthetic material (rather than a homograft) for ascending aorta/aortic valve replacement (bentall procedure) in cases of acute prosthetic valve endocarditis is controversial. we report favorable results using this technique almost exclusively (a homograft was used in only 3 patients with hematological problems) during a 12-year interval. methods: twenty-eight patients (55 +/- 14 years; 22 male) underwent a bentall procedure for acute prosthetic valve endocarditis between 1988 and 2000. twenty-five patients had undergone previous aortic valve replacement (1 with concomitant mitral valve replacement, 4 with coronary artery bypass grafting), and 3 had had a previous bentall operation. the median interval between initial surgery and reoperation was 13 months (range, 1 to 106). sixty-eight percent of operations were urgent or emergencies. ninety-three percent of patients had significant aortic regurgitation; complete annuloaortic dehiscence occurred in 71%, and in 57%, an abscess was found. causative organisms were identified in 25 of 28 patients: staphylococcus epidermidis (9), staphylococcus aureus (7), streptococcus viridans (6), pseudomonas (2), and legionella (1). results: twenty-three patients had mechanical and 5 had biological valves implanted during the bentall procedure. hypothermic circulatory arrest was used in 64%. hospital mortality was 11%: there was one intraoperative death, and two before discharge (one cardiac, one sepsis). eighty-nine percent survived without stroke. during follow-up (median, 44.5 months; complete in 92%), 1 patient died of recurrent endocarditis at 4 months. conclusions: these results indicate that prosthetic root replacement may be superior to use of a homograft for acute aortic prosthetic valve endocarditis, with only a 4% incidence of recurrent endocarditis and reoperation.

TI  == a retrospective investigation of advanced periodontal disease as a risk factor for septicemia in hematopoietic stem cell and bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  == objective: septicemia is a cause of death in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct) recipients. extraction of teeth with advanced periodontitis has been advocated before hsct to prevent septicemia in myeloablated hosts. the primary aim of the present study was to determine impact of chronic periodontitis, as measured by radiographic alveolar bone loss, on septicemia and transplant mortality. study design: a retrospective design was used to study 77 subjects who received pretransplant dental evaluation, panoramic radiography, and full myeloablative allogeneic hsct to treat hematologic malignancies. radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss was measured with a schei ruler on all teeth. microorganisms isolated from positive blood cultures within the first 100 days after transplant were categorized as of likely origin from periodontal, oral, or  any body sites. spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis assessed associations between positive blood cultures, mean subject whole-mouth percent radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss, and 100-day survival. results: radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss per study subject averaged 13% +/- 7%, with 18.2% exhibiting bone loss of 20% or greater. during the initial 100 days after transplant, 63.6% subjects yielded septicemia-associated positive blood cultures, with staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli as the most common isolates recovered. no statistically significant associations were found between mean subject radiographic alveolar bone loss and septicemia of likely periodontal or oral origin. conclusion: in this preliminary study, no relationship was found between radiographic periodontal status and septicemia or  mortality within the initial 100 days after transplant. a larger-sized, prospective study is warranted to further delineate the risk of septicemia from periodontal and other oral diseases in immunocompromised patients.

AB  == aerobic bacterial examination for sinusitis was conducted using specimens from maxillary sinuses collected by antral puncture in 540 patients--284 men and 256 women aged 6-89 years--between may 1999 and april 2000. we obtained 528 strains of bacteria. our results were as follows: 1. we obtained 303 pathogens from 540 patients. in acute sinusitis, the most frequently found was streptococcus pneumoniae (30.4%), followed by hemophilus influenzae (27.7%). in chronic cases,  the most frequently found was streptococcus pneumoniae (16.0%), followed by hemophilus influenzae (15.1%) and staphylococcus epidermidis (12.6%). 2. we found an increase in bacteria resistant to multiple drugs, with 11.1% of the staphylococcus aureus isolates methicillin-resistant in acute sinusitis and 40% methicillin-resistant in chronic sinusitis, and that 30.6% of streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were penicillin-resistant. 3. ciclacillin was effective against 64.7% of all pathogens isolated in this study, cefpodoxime proxetil effective against 6.5%, and cefixime effective against 2.4%. 4. in considering pathogens, we therefore choose antibiotics and make a maxillary aspiration puncture.

TI  == monocytes maintain tissue factor activity after cytolysis of bacteria-infected endothelial cells in an in vitro model of bacterial endocarditis.
AB  == intravascular infection with staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, or streptococcus sanguis can initiate fibrin formation on endocardial tissue, causing bacterial endocarditis. the ability of these bacteria to injure intact endothelial cells (ecs) and to aggravate tissue factor (tf)-dependent coagulation in the presence of blood leukocytes was investigated. cytolysis of ecs occurred after infection with s. aureus and, with membrane-bound monocytes or granulocytes present, also after infection with s. sanguis or s. epidermidis. monocytes that subsequently bound to the resultant bacteria-infected subcellular ec matrix (ecm) elicited tf mrna, tf antigen, and tf activity (tfa). this was most pronounced in  ecm prepared after the cytolysis of ecs by infection with s. aureus or s. epidermidis. we demonstrate that monocytes continue and intensify fibrin formation after lysis of bacteria-infected ecs, which suggests that, during the course of intravascular infection, early fibrin formation shifts from being mediated by ec-derived tfa to being mediated by tfa of monocytes bound to bacteria-infected ecm.

TI  == intravitreal penetration of cefepime after systemic administration to humans.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the penetration of cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) into the vitreous after single-dose intravenous administration to  human subjects. methods: thirty phakic patients about to undergo vitreous surgery received 1 g (group 1, 15 patients) or 2 g cefepime (group 2, 15 patients) in a single intravenous injection before surgery. the indications for vitreous surgery were retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (24 patients), retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tear (4 patients), macular hole  (1 patient) and intraocular foreign body (1 patient). samples of vitreous and serum were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 h after injection. three patients were used for each sampling time and for 1 g and 2 g of cefepime. samples were assayed for cefepime concentrations with high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). results: all the patients had detectable cefepime in their vitreous and serum measurable by hplc. the level of cefepime in the vitreous peaked at 2 h and reached a minimum at 12 h after intravenous injection in both groups. a mean peak vitreous level of cefepime was 1.91 +/- 0.13 microg/ml in group 1 and 2.86 +/- 0.37 microg/ml in group 2. the level of cefepime in the vitreous at 12 h after injection was 0.89 +/- 0.14 microg/ml in group 1 and 0.97 +/- 0.30 microg/ml in group 2. conclusion: the vitreous level of cefepime after intravenous injection was below the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic(90)) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was over the mic(90) against proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp., haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and enterobacter spp.

TI  == discovery of a novel and potent class of fabi-directed antibacterial agents.
AB  == bacterial enoyl-acyl carrier protein (acp) reductase (fabi) catalyzes the final step in each elongation cycle of bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis and is an attractive target for the development of new antibacterial agents. high-throughput screening of the staphylococcus aureus fabi enzyme identified a novel, weak inhibitor with no detectable antibacterial activity against s. aureus. iterative medicinal chemistry and x-ray crystal structure-based design led to the identification of compound 4 [(e)-n-methyl-n-(2-methyl-1h-indol-3-ylmethyl)-3-(7-oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1,8-na phthyridin-3-yl)acrylamide], which is 350-fold more potent than the original lead compound obtained by high-throughput screening in the fabi inhibition assay. compound 4 has exquisite antistaphylococci activity, achieving mics at which 90%  of isolates are inhibited more than 500 times lower than those of nine currently  available antibiotics against a panel of multidrug-resistant strains of s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. furthermore, compound 4 exhibits excellent in vivo efficacy in an s. aureus infection model in rats. biochemical and genetic approaches have confirmed that the mode of antibacterial action of compound 4 and related compounds is via inhibition of fabi. compound 4 also exhibits weak fabk inhibitory activity, which may explain its antibacterial activity against streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, which depend on fabk and both fabk and fabi, respectively, for their enoyl-acp reductase function. these results show that compound 4 is representative of a new, totally synthetic series of antibacterial agents that has the potential to provide novel alternatives for  the treatment of s. aureus infections that are resistant to our present armory of antibiotics.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  == background: retinoids such as retinoic acid (ra), retinol (rol) and retinaldehyde (ral) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. aim: to analyse the potential anti-infective  activities of topical rol, ral and ra. methods: microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of rol, ral and ra were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus flavus, propionibacterium acnes, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus hominis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus group b, enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and pseudomonas/klebsiella. in two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% ral or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% ral or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. results: of the three retinoids tested, only ral showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like s. aeureus, micrococcus spp. or  p. acnes. no activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. these results on  reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. mic(50) and mic(90) values for ral were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with ral had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. in the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2)  for p. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. no resistant bacteria were  found after 2 weeks of topical use. preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of ral is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. conclusion: we have shown that ral differs from parent natural retinoids such as rol and ra in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. this activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the  potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 127), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; n = 123), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), enterococcus faecium (n = 50), enterococcus avium (n = 50), and peptostreptococcus spp. (p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. magnus, p. micros, p. prevotii; n = 125). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also  observed with ceftazidime (caz), cpr, cfpm, fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. the decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual mic range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.

TI  == bacterial adhesion to titanium-oxy-nitride (tinox) coatings with different resistivities: a novel approach for the development of biomaterials.
AB  == in this study the quantitative adhesion of a strain of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans and pseudomonas aeruginosa to and the ease of removal from different tinox coatings was investigated by means of a parallel plate flow chamber and in situ image analysis. quality of adhesion was determined by counting bacteria which remained attached to the surface after exposure to an  air-liquid interface. s. epidermidis and s. mutans showed a bipolar adhesion pattern with highest numbers of adhesion at low and high resistivity with lowest  adhesions at a resistivity of 10(4) microohms cm. p. aeruginosa was the least adherent organism. these results indicate that the affinity of these three strains under the current experimental conditions is minimal for tinox coatings with a specific resistivity. tinox coatings with pre-adsorbed fibrinogen showed different numbers of s. epidermidis adhered to the different coatings. however, the affinity of this strain for fibrinogen-coated tinox remains low when the resistivity is around 10(4) microohms cm. this indicates that the specific influence of the resistivities of the tinox coatings is transferred through the adsorbed fibrinogen film to the interface with adhering bacteria.

TI  == novel agents for resistant gram-positive infections--a review.
AB  == gram-positive infections have increased in recent years, particularly those that  are of nosocomial origin, leading to a broad use of agents with activity against  these pathogens. concomitantly, antimicrobial resistance of these pathogens also  became widespread. among the most common gram-positive resistant pathogens are: streptococcus pneumoniae, resistant to penicillin and macrolides, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-intermediately-resistant s. aureus (gisa), methicillin-resistant s.  epidermidis, glycopeptide-resistant enterococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). the response of the pharmaceutical industry to this challenge  was the development of new antibiotics active against these pathogens. among these antibiotics, this review will focus on: linezolid, an oxazolidinone; gar-936, a tetracycline derivative; daptomycin, a lipopeptide; and ortivancin (ly-333328), a glycopeptide related to vancomycin. except for linezolid, which has been recently launched in many countries, all other agents referred to in this review are still at various developmental stages. it is hoped that in the near future most of these agents will be approved and thus the grim outlook of patients infected with resistant gram-positive bacteria may improve.

TI  == [neonatal meningitis. epidemiological study of the grupo de hospitales castrillo].
AB  == objectives: a prospective multicenter study was designed to assess the incidence, etiology, risk factors and outcomes of vertically transmitted and nosocomial meningitis in neonates over a two-year period. patients and methods: cases of neonatal meningitis diagnosed between january 1, 1997 and december 31, 1998 in the neonatology departments of 28 acute-care hospitals in spain ("grupo de hospitales castrillo") were prospectively studied. bacteriological meningitis was considered confirmed when cerebrospinal fluid culture (csf) was positive for bacteria, virus or fungi, probable when csf culture was negative but blood culture was positive, and unconfirmed when both cultures were negative. results:  during the study period, 151 cases of meningitis were diagnosed. transmission was vertical in 84 cases and nosocomial in 67. the incidence of vertically transmitted meningitis was 0.51 of live births, and was significantly higher in very low birth weight (vlbw) infants. confirmed bacteriological meningitis was diagnosed in 66 patients (78.6 %). no risk factors were identified in 46.4 % of the patients. group b streptococcus (agalactiae) was isolated in 48.5 % of cases  of confirmed meningitis and escherichia coli was isolated in 18.2 %. in 69.7 % of cases the results of blood culture were in agreement with those of csf culture. the overall mortality rate was 8.3 %; mortality was significantly higher in vlbw  infants (33.3 % vs 4.2 % in infants weighing 1,500 g). thirteen percent of survivors had sequelae. the incidence of meningitis of nosocomial transmission was 0.2 % of admissions and was more frequent in vlbw infants. confirmed bacteriological meningitis was diagnosed in 49 patients (73.1 %). two or more risk factors were present in 62.7 % of patients. e. coli was isolated in 26.5 % of cases of nosocomial meningitis and staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in  24.5 %. in 55 % of patients the results of blood culture agreed with those of csf culture. the overall mortality rate was 19.4 %. mortality was significantly higher in vlbw infants and 18.5 % of survivors showed sequelae. conclusions: the  incidence, mortality and sequelae of neonatal meningitis in spain were similar to those reported in recent studies. the most commonly isolated pathogens were group b streptococcus in vertically transmitted meningitis and e. coli and s. epidermidis in nosocomial meningitis. we believe the distinction between vertical and nosocomial meningitis to be appropriate because the epidemiology of these diseases is different, which implies a different therapeutic approach. the high percentage of positive blood cultures indicates the need to include lumbar puncture whenever systemic infection is suspected in the neonatal period.

TI  == bacterial contamination of saline nasal spray/drop solution in patients with respiratory tract infection.
AB  == this study evaluated the potential for bacterial contamination of saline nasal spray/drop solution after 3 days of clinical use in patients. twenty patients with upper respiratory infection used the saline as a spray, and 20 patients used the solution as drops. bacterial growth was present in 18 (907%) solution containers of the spray group and in 3 (157%) solution containers of the drops group (p <.005). twenty isolates were recovered from the spray group and 3 from the drops group. the predominate isolates included staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha streptococcus species, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  escherichia coli, and proteus spp. this study demonstrates the contamination of nasal saline-dispensing solution used as a spray with micro-organisms that are part of the normal skin and nasal flora and gram-negative organisms of potential  enteric origin. these data support the use of nasal saline-dispensing solution as drops, rather than as spray. they also illustrate the risk for crossinfection if  a nasal solution is used by more than 1 patient.

TI  == identification and characterization of genes encoding sex pheromone cam373 activity in enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the sex pheromone cam373 of enterococcus faecalis and the related staph-cam373 of staphylococcus aureus were found to correspond to heptapeptides located within the c-termini of the signal sequences of putative prelipoproteins. the deduced mature forms of the lipoproteins share no detectable homology and presumably serve unrelated functions in the cells. the chromosomally encoded genetic determinants for production of the pheromones have been identified and designated came (encoding cam373) and cams (encoding staph-cam373). truncated and full-length clones of came were generated in escherichia coli, in which cam373 activity was expressed. in e. faecalis, insertional inactivation in the middle of came had no detectable phenotypic effects on the pheromone system. establishment  of an in frame translation stop codon within the signal sequence resulted in reduction of cam373 activity to 3% of normal levels. the cams determinant has homologues in staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis and listeria monocytogenes; however, corresponding heptapeptides present within those sequences do not resemble staph-cam373 closely. the particular significance of staph-cam373 as a potential intergeneric inducer of transfer-proficient genetic elements is discussed.

AB  == to assess the safety and accuracy of the camino intraparenchymal sensor, we prospectively evaluated hemorrhagic complications, zero-drift, infection, and system malfunction in 163 patients monitored after a severe head injury. mean duration of intracranial pressure (icp) monitoring was 5 +/- 2.2 days (range: 12  h to 11 days). of the 141 patients with a control ct scan, four showed a 1-2-cc collection of blood at the catheter's end. when removed, the sensors underread the true icp value (negative zero-drift) in 80 of the 126 sensors evaluated (63.5%). fourteen sensors showed no zero-drift, and 32 sensors overread the true  icp value (positive zero-drift) (median: -1 mm hg; interquartile range: -4 to +1  mm hg). no significant relationship was found between zero-drift, the surgeon who implanted the sensor, intracranial hypertension, or duration of icp monitoring. no clinical infections could be attributed to the devices. sixteen patients (9.8%) required more than one icp sensor due to malfunctioning of the system. in  conclusion, continuous icp monitoring using the camino intraparenchymal sensor has a low complication rate. however, this sensor may underread the real icp values in a high number of patients. the lack of correlation between duration of  icp monitoring and zero-drift suggests that, contrary to the recommendations of other reports, the intraparenchymatous camino sensor can provide reliable readings after the fifth day of use.

TI  == antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  == in this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (hsp) and fresh frozen plasma (ffp) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. due to the clinical use of hsp and ffp for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that hsp contains marked igg antibody reactivity against antigens of escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter sakazakii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, and candida albicans. although no igm antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in hsp, moderate iga reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. immunoblot analysis  demonstrated specific iga and igg responses against the endoproteinase glu-c and  the superantigens enterotoxin a and b of s. aureus, the iga-protease of neisseria gonorrhoeae, and shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic e. coli. by using 3 different hsp batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. this antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of ffp.

TI  == evaluation of the vitek 2 system for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == a study was conducted to evaluate the new vitek 2 system (biomerieux) for identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gram-positive cocci. clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (n = 100), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (n = 100), enterococcus spp. (n = 89), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 29), and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 66) were examined with the id-gpc identification card and with the ast-p515 (for staphylococci), ast-p516 (for enterococci and s. agalactiae) and ast-p506 (for pneumococci) susceptibility cards. the identification comparison methods were the api staph for staphylococci and the api 20 strep for streptococci and enterococci; for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the agar dilution method according to the procedure of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) was used. the vitek 2 system correctly identified to the species level (only one choice or after simple supplementary tests) 99% of s. aureus, 96.5% of s. agalactiae, 96.9% of s. pneumoniae, 92.7% of enterococcus faecalis, 91.3% of staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 88% of staphylococcus epidermidis but was least able to identify enterococcus faecium (71.4% correct). more than 90% of gram-positive cocci were identified within 3 h. according to the nccls breakpoints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the vitek 2 system gave 96% correct category agreement, 0.82% very major errors, 0.17% major errors, and 2.7% minor errors. antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed category agreement from 94 to 100% for s. aureus, from 90 to 100% for cns, from 91 to 100% for enterococci, from 96 to 100% for s. agalactiae, and from 91 to 100% for s. pneumoniae. microorganism-antibiotic combinations that gave very major errors were cns-erythromycin, cns-oxacillin, enterococci-teicoplanin, and enterococci-high-concentration gentamicin. major errors were observed for cns-oxacillin and s. agalactiae-tetracycline combinations. in conclusion the results of this study indicate that the vitek 2 system represents an accurate and acceptable means for performing identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests with medically relevant gram-positive cocci.

TI  == skin and soft tissue infection.
AB  == abstract. normal skin is heavily colonized by bacterial flora. the most common are the various nonpathogenic gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus epidermidis (coagulase-negative). skin and soft tissue infections are usually caused by staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and streptococcus pyogenes. this article discusses common and some not so common bacterial skin infections, including impetigo, folliculitis, furncles and carbuncles, cellulitis and erysipelas, gangrenous cellulitis, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and scarlet fever. impetigo and ecthyma are common bacterial infections of the skin commonly caused by s. aureus and / or group a streptoccus. in mild and localized  impetigo topical antibiotics whereas in widespread or severe one and in ecthyma systemic antibiotics like, cloxacillin, erythromycin, azithromycin or cephalexin  should be used. folliculitis, furunculosis and carbuncle are folliculocentric infections caused by s. aureus involving the variable depth and extent of the follicle(s) and surrounding tissue. these conditions can be treated with topical  or systemic antibiotics like cloxacillin, cephalexin, erythromycin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or vancomycin. staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is a toxin mediated exfoliative dermatosis caused by s. aureus of phase group ii. intravenous penicillinase-resistant anti-staphylococcal antibiotics like methicillin, cloxacillin, cephalosporin or erythromycin are required. erysipelas  and cellulitis are acute infections of dermal and subcutaneous tissues caused most frequently by group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (erysipelas) or s. aureus  requiring systemic antibiotics like oral or intravenous penicillin, erythromycin, cephalexin, cloxacillin, vacomycin, minocycline or ciprofloxacin depending upon the severity, suspected causative organism and culture/sensitivity results. gangrenous cellulitis is characterized by infection with necrosis of skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue due to various pathogens occurring at different site. ampicillin, gentamicin, and either metronidazole or clindamycin intravenously in standard doses are recommended for the treatment.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial sensitivity for czop were  also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen  species (1,913 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 178), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse; n = 98), methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse; n = 164), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), enterococcus faecium (n  = 91), enterococcus avium (n = 72), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp; n = 100), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp; n = 29), streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). czop possessed comparable antibacterial activities against mssa and msse to other cephems, and was also effective on mrse but not on mrsa. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. czop, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. an antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (cpr) and higher than other cephems. no antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, just like other drugs. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (ctm), cefepime (cfpm) and cpr, and that against s. agalactiae was also preferable. czop and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against s. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. an antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, ctm and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint mic of czop was 96.5% in mrsa, 93.1% in prsp, 60.0% in  pisp, 40.3% in s. haemolyticus, 22.3% in e. faecalis, and 15.9% in mrse. those resistance ratios were similar to those for cfpm, but e. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. in conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria was observed. the sensitivities of pisp and prsp to czop, however, was suggested to be decreasing.

TI  == septic arthritis in postoperative anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
AB  == a review of postoperative infected anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions was done on 3500 consecutive arthroscopic procedures. the purpose was to assess incidence, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome factors. six postoperative intraarticular infections were detected. average followup was 3 years (range, 2-8 years). the rate of infection was 0.14%. five men and one woman with a median age of 32.5 years (range, 20-51 years) comprised the study group. the average interval from the onset of symptoms to the initial arthroscopic intervention was  7.5 days (range, 2-20 days). staphylococcus aureus was present in three knees, staphylococcus epidermidis in two, and streptococcus nonhemolytic in one. all patients had initial arthroscopic debridement and lavage followed by 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics. two grafts were removed: one patient had delayed ligament reconstruction and the other had total knee arthroplasty. the remaining  patients had full range of motion. in the group with the best result, two patients had staphylococcus epidermidis and one had staphylococcus aureus, which  was treated 2 days after clinical symptoms began. the other two patients infected with staphylococcus aureus had unsatisfactory results. anterior cruciate ligament infection is rare, but diagnosable. when treated early with appropriate antibiotic therapy and arthroscopic debridement, four of six grafts were retained. if the infection does not respond rapidly to early therapy, then graft  removal is an option.

TI  == nb2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae.  the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent  and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.

TI  == the superoxide dismutase gene sodm is unique to staphylococcus aureus: absence of sodm in coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  == superoxide dismutase (sod) profiles of clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) were determined by using whole-cell lysates and activity gels. all s. aureus clinical isolates exhibited three closely migrating bands of activity as previously determined for laboratory strains of s. aureus: sodm, soda, and a hybrid composed of sodm and soda (m. w. valderas and m. e. hart, j. bacteriol. 183:3399-3407, 2001). in contrast, the cons produced only one sod activity, which migrated similarly to soda of s. aureus. southern analysis of eight cons species identified only a single sod gene in each case. a full-length sod gene was cloned from staphylococcus epidermidis and determined to be more similar to soda than to sodm of s. aureus. therefore, this gene was designated soda. the deduced amino acid sequence of the s. epidermidis soda was 92 and 76% identical to that of the soda and sodm proteins of s. aureus, respectively. the s. epidermidis soda gene expressed from a plasmid complemented a soda mutation in s. aureus, and the protein formed a hybrid with sodm of s. aureus. both hybrid sod forms as well as the sodm and soda proteins of s. aureus and the s. epidermidis soda protein exist as dimers. these data indicate that sodm is found only in s. aureus and not in the cons, suggesting an  important divergence in the evolution of this genus and a unique role for sodm in s. aureus.

AB  == the in vitro and in vivo activity of t-3912, a novel non-fluorinated topical quinolone, was compared with that of nadifloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin and gentamicin. the in vitro activity of t-3912 against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, ofloxacin-resistant  s. epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and propionibacterium acnes was four-fold to 16 000-fold greater than that of other agents at the mic90 for the clinical isolates. the activity of t-3912 was not influenced by grla mutation in s. aureus, and the degree of mic increase of t-3912 for grla-gyra double and triple mutants was lowest among the quinolones tested (nadifloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin). the inhibitory activity of t-3912 was compared with other quinolones for dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv of  s. aureus sa113. t-3912 showed the greatest inhibitory activity for both enzymes  among the quinolones tested. the isolation frequency of spontaneous mutants resistant to t-3912 was < 1.7 x 10(-9) and < 2.0 x 10(-9) for s. aureus sa113 and p. acnes jcm 6425, respectively. furthermore, resistance to t-3912 could not be clearly detected in the 28th transfer by the serial passage method. t-3912 exhibited more potent bactericidal activity against s. aureus and p. acnes than nadifloxacin and clindamycin in a short time period. t-3912 in a 1% gel formulation showed good therapeutic activity against a burn infection model caused by s. aureus sa113, p. acnes jcm6425 and multidrug-resistant s. aureus f-2161. these results indicate that t-3912 is potentially a useful quinolone for  the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections and that its potent bactericidal activity might be able to shorten the treatment period.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against clinical isolates of enterococcus spp., staphylococcus spp., and streptococcus spp. tested by etest.
AB  == the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of everninomicin, a novel oligosaccharide antibiotic, was tested against clinical isolates of 11 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) strains, 11 methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) strains, 22 staphylococcus epidermidis strains, 23 enterococcus faecalis strains, 23 enterococcus faecium strains, 23 enterococcus avium strains, 27 streptococcus  pneumoniae strains, 22 streptococcus pyogenes strains, and 20 streptococcus agalactiae strains. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of everninomicin were determined by etest and compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and  minocycline. the etest showed that everninomicin exhibited excellent activity (mic, <0.016 to 1.5 microg/ml) against the gram-positive cocci tested. the antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against s. aureus and s. epidermidis was  stronger than that of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and minocycline, in particular against mrsa, with an mic50 of 0.38 microg/ml and an mic90 of 0.5 microg/ml. against strains of enterococci and streptococci, everninomicin was more active than vancomycin, but as active as teicoplanin.

TI  == the bacterial peptide n-formyl-met-leu-phe inhibits killing of staphylococcus epidermidis by human neutrophils in fibrin gels.
AB  == to study human neutrophil (polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmn)) migration and killing of bacteria in an environment similar to that found in inflamed tissues in vivo, we have used fibrin gels. fibrin gels (1500 microm thick) containing staphylococcus epidermidis were formed in boyden-type chemotaxis chambers. pmn migrated < 300 microm into these gels in 6 h and did not kill s. epidermidis when the gels contained heat-inactivated serum, c5-deficient serum, a streptococcal peptidase specific for a fragment of cleaved c5 (c5a), or anti-c5ar igg. in contrast, in gels containing normal human serum, pmn migrated approximately 1000  microm into the gels in 4 h and into the full thickness of the gels in 6 h, and killed 90% of s. epidermidis in 6 h. fmlp reduced pmn migration into fibrin gels  and allowed s. epidermidis to increase by approximately 300% in 4 h, whereas leukotriene b(4) stimulated pmn to migrate the full thickness of the gels and to  kill 80% of s. epidermidis in 4 h. we conclude that both complement opsonization  and c5a-stimulated chemotaxis are required for pmn bacterial killing in fibrin gels, and that fmlp inhibits pmn bactericidal activity in fibrin gels. the latter finding is surprising and suggests that in the presence of fibrin fmlp promotes bacterial virulence.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a castor oil-based irrigant.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of irrigating solutions--endoquil (castor oil detergent), 2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution, and 0.5% naocl solution-was evaluated against gram-positive cocci (micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus), gram-negative rods (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the yeast candida albicans. activity was evaluated using the two-layer agar diffusion technique. the base layer was obtained by pouring 10.0 ml of muller hinton medium or 10.0 ml of brain heart infusion agar in a petri dish. after solidification a 5.0 ml seed layer of muller hinton medium or brain heart infusion agar with inoculum (106/ml) was added. absorbent paper disks (6.0  mm in diameter) immersed in the solutions were placed at equidistant points. plates were maintained at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion of the solutions and incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. the candle jar system was used  for the brain heart infusion agar plates. all tests were performed in duplicate.  after incubation the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% triphenyltetrazolium chlorate gel and inhibition halos were measured. all bacterial strains were inhibited by 2.0% chlorhexidine gluconate. endoquil was effective against gram-positive microorganisms, and 0.5% naocl was effective only against s. aureus.

TI  == the evaluation of microbial contamination in platelet concentrates prepared by two different methods.
AB  == the microbial contamination of platelet concentrates (pcs) prepared by two different methods both with a high risk of bacterial contamination during preparation and storage were evaluated. for apheresis platelets, the concentrates were obtained using the haemonetics mcs 3p device. for the random method, platelets were obtained by two phase centrifugation, in the heraeus cryofuge 8500 i device using the kansuk 3-way bags which permit storage for five days. 1620 plateletpheresis units prepared by apheresis, and 9838 units prepared by the random method, were included in the study. of the 11,458 pcs studied. 32 (0.27%)  were false positives and 24 (0.2%) were real positives. all of the positive results occurred in platelets prepared by the random method. c. xerosis and s. epidermidis, s. hominis, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, all flora of the skin, were isolated in the contaminated concentrates. the risk of microbial contamination of pcs, prepared both by apheresis and from whole blood, continues  at a low rate although the products were collected into specific bags following rules including appropriate disinfection of the skin, correct centrifugation collection time and optimal storage conditions including temperature and agitation. these results again emphasize the importance of: obeying phlebotomy rules and hand disinfection of the person who collects the blood as well as the need for careful skin decontamination of the donor, during donation.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin with ciprofloxacin and beta-lactams against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == gatifloxacin is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone. the in-vitro antibacterial activity of gatifloxacin was compared to that of ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid against 165 streptococcal isolates, 369 staphylococcal isolates, and 50 enterococcal isolates recently recovered from clinical isolates. gatifloxacin was the most active agent tested against streptococci including penicillin-nonsusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0.5 microg/ml). imipenem and gatifloxacin (mic(90) 0.5 microg/ml) were the most active agents tested against viridans group streptococci. all the agents demonstrated excellent activity against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus. imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and gatifloxacin had good activity against methicillin-sensitive s. epidermidis. among the methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci tested, gatifloxacin was the most active agent. amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and gatifloxacin were the most active agents against e. faecalis. thus, gatifloxacin possesses equal or superior activity when compared to ciprofloxacin and beta-lactams making it a promising new fluoroquinolone for clinical use in treating gram-positive infections.

TI  == clear corneal wound infection after phacoemulsification.
AB  == objective: to evaluate clear corneal wound infections after phacoemulsification.  materials and methods: the medical records of 7 patients with clear corneal wound infections after phacoemulsification were reviewed retrospectively. data that were reviewed included patient age, sex, onset of symptoms and signs after surgery, possible risk factors for infection, concomitant ocular disease, use of  perioperative prophylactic antibiotics and steroids, culture and antibiotic sensitivity results, treatment regimen, and outcome. results: the median onset of signs and symptoms after surgery was 10 days (range, 4-60 days). corneal cultures yielded methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 2 cases, streptococcus pneumoniae in 1 case, and staphylococcus epidermidis in 1 case. cultures yielded  no microorganisms for 1 patient. corneal cultures were not obtained in 2 patients. in 3 of the 4 culture-positive cases, the isolated microorganisms were  resistant to the perioperative prophylactic antibiotics (fluoroquinolones and tobramycin) that were used. no possible risk factors were noted except use of topical steroids 4 times a day without antibiotic coverage for iritis before referral in one of our patients. six of these 7 wound infections healed with topical antibiotic therapy. one of the patients required lamellar keratectomy and conjunctival flap for complete healing. in 4 of the 7 cases, best-corrected visual acuity at the last follow-up visit was better than 20/40. conclusions: clear corneal wound infection after phacoemulsification is a serious complication of cataract surgery. infections are caused by gram-positive organisms sensitive to bacitracin and the combination of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole but often resistant to aminoglycosides and/or fluoroquinolones.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides isolated from skin secretions of the diploid frog, xenopus tropicalis (pipidae).
AB  == seven peptides (xt-1-xt-7) with antimicrobial activity were isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the diploid clawed frog, xenopus tropicalis. structural characterization of the peptides demonstrated that amino acid sequence similarity to antimicrobial peptides previously isolated from xenopus laevis was low, suggesting that the species are not closely related phylogenetically. peptides xt-5 and xt-3 are probably the orthologs of x. laevis  peptide glycine-leucine amide (pgl(a)) and the n-terminal spacer region of prolevitide, respectively. xt-1, xt-6 and xt-7 show limited structural similarity to the spacer region of x. laevis procaeruleins and the paralogs xt-2 and xt-4 are similar to corresponding regions of proxenopsin. orthologs of the magainins were not identified. the c-terminally alpha-amidated peptide xt-7 (gllgpllkiaakvgsnll.nh2) showed the lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations against reference microorganisms (staphylococcus aureus 5 microm, escherichia coli 5 microm, and candida albicans 40 microm) and was also active against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus group c, shigella sonnei, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae. the peptide was, however, hemolytic against  human erythrocytes (50% lysis at 70 microm). circular dichroism studies showed that xt-7 has a random structure in aqueous solution, ph 7.0 but adopts an alpha-helical conformation in the presence of 50% trifluoroethanol. decreasing the cationicity of xt-7 either by replacement of the c-terminal conh2 group by cooh or by deletion of the lys(8) residue produced analogs with greatly (>10-fold) decreased antimicrobial potencies.

TI  == staphylococci in orthopaedic surgical wounds.
AB  == from 50 infected surgical wounds of orthopaedic patients, 43 (86%) staphylococcal strains were isolated. 34 of all these staphylococci belonged to staphylococcus aureus species (i.e. 68 % of all isolates from surgical wounds; 79% of staphylococcal isolates); 9 were coagulase-negative staphylococci (i.e. 21% of all isolates from surgical wounds; 18% of staphylococcal isolates). among microorganisms isolated from the wounds we also found 2 (4%) of the enterobacteriaceae family; 2 (4%) of the pseudomonas genus; 3 (6%) of the streptococcus genus. thus, orthopaedic surgical wounds were infected by staphylococci (mainly s. aureus) more frequently than by other micro-organisms. all the staphylococcal strains were screened for methicillin resistance by agar disk diffusion testing and for the presence of meca gene responsible for methicillin resistance by pcr. 32% of the s. aureus and 33% of the s. epidermidis strains resulted methicillin resistant and meca-positive. the data confirm the diffusion of methicillin resistant s. aureus in surgical site infections and shows that the so-called "new pathogens", i.e. s. epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci, also exhibit a frequent and hazardous methicillin-resisting ability.

TI  == infection in total knee replacement: a retrospective review of 6489 total knee replacements.
AB  == six thousand four hundred eighty-nine knee replacements were done in 6120 patients at the authors' institution between 1993 and 1999. operations were done  in a theater with vertical laminar flow and with the surgical team using body exhaust suits. of these knee replacements, 116 knees became infected and 113 were available for followup. one hundred of the infections occurred in patients undergoing primary knee replacement, whereas the remaining infections occurred in patients undergoing revision knee replacement. ninety-seven of these knees (86%)  had deep periprosthetic infections and the remaining 16 knees had superficial wound infections. one third of the deep infections occurred within the first 3 months after surgery and the remaining 2/3 occurred after 3 months. the overall early deep infection rate for patients undergoing a primary knee replacement was  0.39%, whereas the rate for patients undergoing a revision knee replacement was 0.97%. a cohort of noninfected knee replacements from patients matched for gender, age, and month of surgery was used as a control group. those comorbidities that were statistically significant in increasing the risk of infection were prior open surgical procedures, immunosuppressive therapy, poor nutrition, hypokalemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and a history of smoking. patients undergoing revision procedures had a statistically higher risk of infection than did patients undergoing primary surgeries. if the surgery took longer than 2.5 hours, the risk of infection was increased significantly. there was no change in the infection rate when the perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis was decreased from 48 to 24 hours after surgery. the predominant infectious organisms were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  and streptococcus group b). twenty percent of the knees that were infected clinically had no organisms that could be identified. in each case, the patient had been treated empirically at another institution with antibiotics before a culture of the joint was obtained.

TI  == evaluation of the bact/alert automated blood culture system for detecting bacteria and measuring their growth kinetics in leucodepleted and non-leucodepleted platelet concentrates.
AB  == background and objective: to evaluate the bact/alert automated blood culture system for the detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates, and to determine bacterial growth kinetics in leucodepleted and non-leucodepleted units. materials and methods: apheresis (cobe leucocyte reduction system [lrs]) and pooled buffy coat-derived (optipress) platelet concentrates (pcs) were tested. six organisms were used for spiking the pcs: clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus, group b  streptococcus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli. units were inoculated to give a final concentration of approximately equal  to 1 and 50 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. on days 0, 2 and 5, bact/alert standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles were inoculated with a 5-ml fill volume and bacteria were enumerated. results: the bact/alert automated blood culture system gave rapid determination times of spiked units, with all positives detected within 48 h and 98.1% detected within 24 h. in general, as the inoculum  concentration increased, the detection time decreased. rapid growth was obtained  with all organisms tested except for b. cereus, which failed to grow on four occasions. bacterial numbers on day 2 ranged from 10(5) to 10(11) cfu/ml and on day 5 ranged from 10(4) to 10(12) cfu/ml. growth was not significantly greater in leucodepleted units. conclusions: the study confirmed that pcs are an excellent growth medium for bacteria. rapid and substantial growth was obtained with all organisms under test. leucodepletion does not appear to enhance bacterial proliferation. the bact/alert automated blood culture system could rapidly detect contamination of units. bacterial screening using an automated blood culture system is therefore a potential option.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum  inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.

AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == [infective endocarditis in the elderly].
AB  == to elucidate clinical features of infective endocarditis in the elderly, 20 elderly patients aged > or = 60 years were compared in detail with 30 others aged < 60 years retrospectively. twelve of the 20 elderly patients had a calcific aortic valve or an artificial device as a predisposing heart disease, whereas 16  middle-aged patients had mitral valve prolapse or congenital heart disease (p = 0.001). the prevalence of major extracardiac disorders such as neurological disease were higher in the elderly than in the middle (9/20 vs 3/30; p < 0.01). the frequency of infected valve was similar; mitral in 8, aortic in 11 and other  valves or congenital defect in 2 in the elderly versus 14, 11 and 6, respectively in the middle. among 39 patients in whom causative microorganisms were identified, staphylococcus epidermidis was most frequently identified in the elderly (5/20), whereas streptococcus species was found in the middle (12/30). time from the onset of symptoms to correct diagnosis was usually delayed in the entire group; the delay was longer particularly in the elderly than in the middle-aged patients (72 +/- 87 vs 36 +/- 32 days; p < 0.1). maximal body temperature was less in the elderly than in the middle-aged patients (38.5 +/- 0.7 vs 39.3 +/- 1.1 degrees c; p < 0.01), whereas peak level of c-reactive protein (10.4 +/- 6.1 vs 13.0 +/- 7.9 mg/dl), the incidences of heart failure (9/20 vs 10/30), and embolic complications (7/20 vs 10/20) were similar in the 2  groups. cardiac operation was performed less in the elderly than in the middle-aged patients (9/20 vs 21/30; p < 0.08). five elderly patients had disease-related mortality, whereas only one middle-aged patient died (p = 0.02).  these results suggest that although predisposing heart disease and causative microorganism in infective endocarditis are different between the elderly and middle-aged patients, the incidence of major complications are similar. however,  due to the delay of correct diagnosis in the elderly who usually have major extracardiac disorders, the prognosis of infective endocarditis in the elderly is poor.

TI  == bacterial keratitis: a prospective clinical and microbiological study.
AB  == aim: to define the clinical and microbiological profile of bacterial keratitis at the jules gonin eye hospital and to test the in vitro bacterial resistance. methods: patients presenting with bacterial keratitis were prospectively followed; clinical features (age, risk factors, visual acuity) and response to therapy were analysed. bacteriological profile was determined and the sensitivity/resistance of isolated strains were tested towards 12 ocular antibiotics (nccls disc diffusion test). results: 85 consecutive patients (mean age 44.3 (sd 20.7) years) were prospectively enrolled from 1 march 1997 to 30 november 1998. the following risk factors were identified: contact lens wear, 36%; blepharitis, 21%; trauma, 20%; xerophthalmia, 15%; keratopathies, 8%; and eyelid abnormalities, 6%. the most commonly isolated bacteria were staphylococcus epidermidis, 40%; staphylococcus aureus, 22%; streptococcus pneumoniae, 8%; others streptococcus species, 5%; pseudomonas, 9%; moraxella and serratia marcescens, 5% each; bacillus, corynebacterium, alcaligenes xyloxidans, morganella morganii, and haemophilus influenza, 1% each. 1-15% of strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones, 13-22% to aminoglycosides, 37% to cefazolin, 18% to chloramphenicol, 54% to polymyxin b, 51% to fusidic acid, and 45% to bacitracin. five of the 85 patients (5.8%) had a poor clinical outcome with a visual loss of one or more lines of visual acuity. conclusion: fluoroquinolones appear to be the therapy of choice for bacterial keratitis, but, based upon these in vitro studies, some strains may be resistant.

TI  == structure and dissemination of a chromosomal insertion element encoding macrolide efflux in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == macrolide resistance associated with macrolide efflux (mef) has rapidly increased in streptococcus pneumoniae. we defined the genetic structure and dissemination of a novel mefe-containing chromosomal insertion element. the mefe gene was found on the 5' end of a 5.5- or 5.4-kb insertion designated as the macrolide efflux genetic assembly (mega), which is found in > or =4 distinct sites of the pneumococcal genome. the element was transformable and conferred macrolide resistance to susceptible s. pneumoniae. the first 2 open-reading frames (orfs) of the element formed an operon composed of mefe and a predicted adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette homologous to msra. convergent to this efflux operon were 3 orfs with homology to stress response genes of tn5252. mega was related to the recently described mefa-containing element tn1207.1 but lacked the genes necessary for transposition and had unique termini and insertion sites. in  metropolitan atlanta, macrolide resistance due to mega rapidly increased in s. pneumoniae by clonal expansion and horizontally by transformation.

TI  == the replicon of the cryptic plasmid psbo1 isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1.
AB  == the cryptic plasmid psbo1 (3904 bp) was isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1. psbo1 contained an open reading frame (orf) that is homologous to sequences encoding the replication protein (rep) in pefc1 (isolated from enterococcus faecalis), psk639 (staphylococcus epidermidis), pla103 (lactobacillus acidophilus), and pucl287 (tetragenococcus halophila). in addition, four 22-bp direct repeats (drs) were located upstream of the putative replication gene (rep) of psbo1. recombinant plasmids (psbe10 and psbe11) containing the drs and putative rep of psbo1 replicated in s. bovis 12-u-1 and no8 strains. this result  indicates that the putative rep encoded rep and that the replicon of psbo1 contained the drs and the rep. gel shift assays showed that the rep of psbo1 bound the 22-bp drs.

TI  == resistance studies with daptomycin.
AB  == we studied the in vitro emergence of resistance to daptomycin using three methods: spontaneous resistance incidence, serial passage in the presence of increasing drug concentrations, and chemical mutagenesis. no spontaneously resistant mutants were obtained for any organism tested (<10(-10) for staphylococcus aureus, <10(-9) for staphylococcus epidermidis, <10(-9) for enterococcus faecalis, <10(-9) for enterococcus faecium, <10(-8) for streptococcus pneumoniae). population analysis demonstrated that bacterial susceptibility to daptomycin is heterogeneous. assay results were sensitive to calcium concentration and culture density, both of which can affect apparent resistance rates. stable s. aureus mutants were isolated by both serial passage in liquid media and chemical mutagenesis. the daptomycin mics for these isolates  were 8- to 32-fold higher than for the parental strain. many mutants with high mics (>12.5 microg/ml) had significant growth defects but did not display phenotypes typical of s. aureus small colony variants. the voltage component (delta psi) of the bacterial membrane potential was increased in three independent resistant isolates. in vivo data showed that some daptomycin-resistant mutants had lost significant virulence. for other mutants, the degree of in vitro resistance was greater than the change in in vivo susceptibility. these results suggest that infection with some daptomycin-resistant organisms may still be easily treatable.

TI  == endophthalmitis after keratoprosthesis: incidence, bacterial causes, and risk factors.
AB  == objectives: to determine the rate of endophthalmitis in a group of patients with  keratoprostheses and to analyze possible risk factors. methods: a total of 108 patient eyes, operated on between 1990 and 2000 with double-plated keratoprostheses, were analyzed with regard to the surface flora, the incidence and cause of bacterial endophthalmitis or sterile vitreitis, the keratoprosthesis design, prophylactic antibiotics, concomitant immunosuppression, and preoperative diagnosis. results: surveillance cultures were obtained from 30 uninfected eyes.  the flora was similar to that reported in the normal population and did not vary  significantly with time. thirteen cases of bacterial endophthalmitis occurred 2 to 46 months postoperatively in the patient population that had been followed up  for 2 months to 17 years (average, 3 years 4 months). the incidence was 39% in 13 patients with stevens-johnson syndrome, 19% in 27 patients with ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, and 7% in 28 patients with ocular burns. only 1 of the other 40 cases (consisting mostly of repeated graft failures in noncicatrizing conditions) developed endophthalmitis; this patient had a filtering bleb. all endophthalmitis pathogens were gram positive: streptococcus pneumoniae, 23%; other streptococci, 39%; staphylococcus aureus, 23%; and staphylococcus epidermidis, 15%. conclusions: the most important risk factor for endophthalmitis after these keratoprostheses was found to be preoperative diagnosis. the rate of  infection was very high in stevens-johnson syndrome and ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, moderate in chemical burns, and low in noncicatrizing corneal disease.

TI  == evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == in vitro activities of rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. in a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), rwj-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)) of 2 microg/ml. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, rwj-54428 was 32  times more active than imipenem, with an mic(90) of 2 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was active against s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (rwj-54428 mic range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). rwj-54428 was eight times more potent than  methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml). for ampicillin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), rwj-54428  had an mic(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was also active against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. the potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; rwj-54428 mics ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. rwj-54428 was more active than penicillin g and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). rwj-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). this survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to rwj-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.

TI  == monocytes augment bacterial species- and strain-dependent induction of tissue factor activity in bacterium-infected human vascular endothelial cells.
AB  == in bacterial endocarditis (be), intravascular infection with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguis, or staphylococcus epidermidis can lead to formation of a fibrin clot on the inner surface of the heart and cause heart dysfunction. the events that start the coagulation in the early stage of the disease are largely unknown. we have recently shown that human endothelial cells  (ec) upon binding and internalization of s. aureus, but not s. sanguis or s. epidermidis, express tissue factor (tf)-dependent procoagulant activity (tfa). the present study shows that infection of ec with these three pathogens induces surface expression of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (icam-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (vcam-1) and monocyte adhesion. subsequent coculture of  these cells synergistically enhanced tfa, which was exclusively dependent on tf molecules that were expressed on ec during coculture. tfa induction required direct contact between monocytes and bacterium-infected ec, but the signals for this response were not generated by the binding of monocytes through their beta(2)- or alpha(4)-integrins to icam-1 or vcam-1, respectively, on infected ec. the mechanism by which monocytes induce tfa in bacterium-infected ec was partly mediated by the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 produced by the cells during coculture. endogenous tumor necrosis factor alpha was not involved. this modulating effect of monocytes on species- and strain-dependent tfa of bacterium-infected ec supports our hypothesis that in an early stage in the pathogenesis of be, as well as other intravascular infections that lead to detrimental fibrin formation, the coagulation cascade can be activated on the surfaces of ec as a consequence of specific interactions between pathogenic bacteria, ec, and monocytes.

TI  == interaction of bladder glycoprotein gp51 with uropathogenic bacteria.
AB  == purpose: a major component of bladder surface mucin is a glycoprotein gp51 (molecular weight 51 kd.). gp51, which has previously been isolated from rabbit mucosa, appears to function as part of the defense mechanism in an in vivo infection model. gp51 coats the epithelium and is secreted into the urine, as detected by immunohistochemical testing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). increased urinary gp51 occurs during urinary tract infection. to elucidate the role of gp51 as a component of the primary defense mechanism we studied interactions with uropathogenic bacterial isolates and urine from symptomatic patients with urinary tract infection. materials and methods: elisa was performed to demonstrate the binding of gp51 and various uropathogens. immunochemical studies were done using monoclonal antibodies to gp51 to determine the interaction of gp51 with certain uropathogenic isolates, including escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and streptococcus faecalis. infected urinary sediments and uropathogenic bacterial cultures were examined by immunocytochemical testing to localize gp51. antigen inhibition elisa was done to quantitate urinary gp51 in the urine of 17 normal controls and 19 patients with urinary tract infection. results: elisa revealed that gp51 binds to a wide spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative uropathogens in semiquantitative fashion. immunochemical methods confirmed that purified gp51 binds to bacteria, encapsulating and aggregating the bacteria. clinical specimens showed gp51 localized to bacteria and uroepithelial  cells. we observed a significant increase in urinary gp51 in urinary tract infection compared to uninfected urine (p = 0.0003). conclusions: these studies suggest that gp51, a component of bladder mucin, may be a strategic factor in the primary defense mechanism of the bladder.

AB  == background: photodynamic therapy (pdt) utilizes photosensitizers and light. whereas pdt use in cancer treatment has been widely accepted, antimicrobial pdt (apdt) is still in its early stages of development. objectives: to study microbial killing in vitro using apdt. methods: we used a combination of methylene blue and visible light, and a range of microbial species representative of those encountered on the skin in health and disease. using standard light intensity conditions (slide projector, 25 cm distance from target, 42 mw cm(-2))  and methylene blue dye at 100 microg ml(-1), kill rates and subsequent d-values were determined against staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, corynebacterium minutissimum, propionibacterium acnes and candida albicans. results: d-values for these species were 72, 66, 48, 120, 30 and 660 s, respectively. the effects of light intensity on the killing of s. epidermidis showed the kill rate to be proportional to the light intensity. a high rate of cell kill was also obtained using natural sunlight. conclusions: overall, these results indicate that apdt of the skin may represent a useful alternative to conventional antimicrobial treatment.

AB  == diskitis, an inflammation of the intervertebral disk, is generally attributable to staphylococcus aureus and rarely staphylococcus epidermidis, kingella kingae,  enterobacteriaciae, and streptococcus pneumoniae. in many cases, no bacterial growth is obtained from infected intervertebral discs. although anaerobic bacteria were recovered from adults with spondylodiscitis, these organisms were not reported before from children. the recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 2 children with diskitis is reported. patient 1. a 10-year-old male presented with  6 weeks of low back pain and 2 weeks of low-grade fever and abdominal pain. physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between thoracic vertebra 11 and lumbar vertebra 2. the patient had a temperature of 104 degrees f. laboratory tests were within normal limits, except  for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr), which was 58 mm/hour. blood culture showed no growth. magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast revealed minimal inflammatory changes in the 12th thoracic vertebra/first lumbar vertebra  disk. there was no other abnormality. a computed tomography (ct)-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded bloody material, which was sent for aerobic  and anaerobic cultures. gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and gram-positive cocci in chains. cultures for anaerobic bacteria yielded heavy growth of peptostreptococcus magnus, which was susceptible to penicillin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. the patient was treated with intravenous penicillin  600 000 units every 6 hours for 3 weeks, and then oral amoxicillin, 500 mg every  6 hours for 3 weeks. the back pain resolved within 2 weeks, and the esr returned  to normal at the end of therapy. follow-up for 3 years showed complete resolution of the infection. patient 2. an 8-year-old boy presented with low back pain and low-grade fever, irritability, and general malaise for 10 days. he had had an upper respiratory tract infection with sore throat 27 days earlier, for which he  received no therapy. the patient had a temperature of 102 degrees f, and physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between the second and fourth lumbar vertebrae. laboratory tests were normal, except for  the esr (42 mm/hour). radiographs of the spine showed narrowing of the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space and irregularity of the margins of the vertebral endplates. a ct scan revealed a lytic bone lesion at lumbar vertebra 4, and bone scan showed an increase uptake of (99m)technetium at the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space. ct-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded cloudy nonfoul-smelling material, which was sent for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and fusiform gram-negative bacilli.  anaerobic culture grew light growth of fusobacterium nucleatum. the organism produced beta-lactamase and was susceptible to ticarcillin-clavulanate, clindamycin, metronidazole, and imipenem. therapy with clindamycin 450 mg every 8 hours was given parenterally for 3 weeks and orally for 3 weeks. back pain resolved within 2 weeks. a 2-year follow-up showed complete resolution and no recurrence. this report describes, for the first time, the isolation of anaerobic bacteria from children with diskitis. the lack of their recovery in previous reports and the absence of bacterial growth in over two third of these studies may be caused by the use of improper methods for their collection, transportation, and cultivation. proper choice of antimicrobial therapy for diskitis can be accomplished only by identification of the causative organisms and its antimicrobial susceptibility. this is of particular importance in infections caused by anaerobic bacteria that are often resistant to antimicrobials used to empirically treat diskitis. this was the case in our second patient, who was infected by f nucleatum, which was resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. the origin of the anaerobic bacteria causing the infection in our patient is probably of endogenous nature. the presence of abdominal pain in the first child may have been attributable to a subclinical abdominal pathothology. the preceding pharyngitis in the second patient may have  been associated with a potential hematogenous spread of f nucleatum. p magnus has been associated with bone and joint infections. this report highlights the importance of obtaining disk space culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from all children with diskitis. future prospective studies are warranted to elucidate the role of anaerobic bacteria in diskitis in children.

TI  == origins of staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus oralis causing bacteraemia in a bone marrow transplant patient.
AB  == coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteraemia in immunocompromised patients is often associated with the use of central venous catheters, while the proposed origin of viridans streptococci causing bacteraemia in this patient group is the  oral cavity. this report describes an episode of polymicrobial bacteraemia caused by staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus oralis followed by several further episodes of s. epidermidis bacteraemia in a 15-year-old boy after bone marrow transplantation. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) of smai chromosomal dna digests was used to compare blood culture and oral isolates of s. epidermidis and str. oralis. the results indicated that the mouth was the source  of both s. epidermidis and str. oralis causing the first episode of bacteraemia.  pfge further demonstrated that the central venous catheter was the origin of a second strain of s. epidermidis responsible for subsequent episodes of staphylococcal bacteraemia. both the oral mucosa and central venous lines should  be considered as potential sources of organisms, including coagulase-negative staphylococci, associated with bacteraemia in immunocompromised patients.

TI  == ability of laboratories to detect emerging antimicrobial resistance: proficiency  testing and quality control results from the world health organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility data submitted by microbiology laboratories to national and international surveillance systems has been debated  for a number of years. to assess the accuracy of data submitted to the world health organization by users of the whonet software, the centers for disease control and prevention distributed six bacterial isolates representing key antimicrobial-resistance phenotypes to approximately 130 laboratories, all but one of which were outside of the united states, for antimicrobial susceptibility  testing as part of the world health organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. each laboratory also was asked to submit 10 consecutive quality control values for several key organism-drug combinations. most laboratories were able to detect methicillin (oxacillin) resistance in staphylococcus aureus, high-level vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium, and resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in klebsiella pneumoniae. many laboratories, particularly those using disk diffusion tests, had difficulty in recognizing reduced susceptibility to penicillin in an isolate of streptococcus pneumoniae. the most difficult phenotype for laboratories to detect was reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in an isolate of  staphylococcus epidermidis. the proficiency testing challenge also included a request for biochemical identification of a gram-negative bacillus, which most laboratories recognized as enterobacter cloacae. although only a small subset of  laboratories have submitted their quality control data, it is clear that many of  these laboratories generate disk diffusion results for oxacillin when testing s.  aureus atcc 25923 and s. pneumoniae atcc 49619 that are outside of the acceptable quality control range. the narrow quality control range for vancomycin also proved to be a challenge for many of the laboratories submitting data; approximately 27% of results were out of range. thus, it is important to establish the proficiency of laboratories submitting data to surveillance systems in which the organisms are tested locally, particularly for penicillin resistance in pneumococci and glycopeptide resistance in staphylococci.

TI  == limited role of direct exchange arthroplasty in the treatment of infected total hip replacements.
AB  == a literature review was performed to determine when direct exchange was most likely to be successful. twelve reports provided outcome data on infected hip replacements treated with direct exchange. the average duration of followup was 4.8 years, but the range was broad (0.1-17.1 years). of the 1,299 infected hip replacements treated with direct exchange, 1,077 (83%) were thought to be free of infection at the last followup. antibiotic-impregnated bone cement was used in 1,282 of the cases (99%). there was wide variability in the duration of parenteral antibiotic therapy, ranging from just 24 hours to as many as 8 weeks.  in some cases, no oral antibiotics ever were given, whereas in others, oral antibiotics were given for as many as 8 months after parenteral therapy. factors  associated with a successful direct exchange included: (1) absence of wound complications after the initial total hip replacement; (2) good general health of the patient; (3) methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus species; and (4) an organism that was sensitive to the  antibiotic mixed into the bone cement. factors associated with failure included:  (1) polymicrobial infection; (2) gram-negative organisms, especially pseudomonas  species; and (3) certain gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis and group d streptococcus. methicillin-resistant organisms have become more common. many current revision surgical techniques use  cementless implants. fixation without any cement (no depot antibiotics) may be a  contraindication to direct exchange. additionally, there essentially are no data  on the use of bone graft in association with direct exchange. for these reasons,  the indications for direct exchange are limited.

TI  == use of rifampin-soaked gelatin-sealed polyester grafts for in situ treatment of primary aortic and vascular prosthetic infections.
AB  == background: in situ treatment of artery/graft infection has distinct advantages compared to vessel excision and extra-anatomic bypass procedures. based on animal studies of a rifampin-soaked, gelatin-impregnated polyester graft that demonstrated prolonged in vivo antibacterial activity, this antibiotic-bonded graft was used selectively in patients for in situ treatment of low-grade gram-positive prosthetic graft infections or primary aortic infections not amenable to excision and ex situ bypass. methods: in a 5-year period (1995-1999), 27 patients with prosthetic graft infection (aortofemoral, n = 18, femorofemoral, n = 3; axillofemoral, n = 1) or primary aortic infection (mycotic aneurysm, n = 3; infected aaa, n = 2) underwent excision of the infected vessel and in situ replacement with a rifampin soaked (45-60 mg/ml for 15 min) gelatin-impregnated polyester graft. all prosthetic graft infections were low grade in nature, caused gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis, 16; staphylococcus aureus, 5; streptococcus, 1), and were treated electively. patients with mycotic aortic aneurysm presented with sepsis and underwent urgent or emergent surgery. results: two (8%) patients died-1 as a result of a ruptured salmonella mycotic aortic aneurysm and the other from methicillin-resistant s. aureus infection following deep vein replacement of an in situ replaced femorofemoral graft. no amputations  or late deaths as the result of vascular infection occurred in the 25 surviving patients. two patients developed recurrent infection caused by a rifampin-resistant s. epidermidis in a replaced aortofemoral graft limb and were  successfully treated with graft excision and in situ autogenous vein replacement. eighteen patients remain alive and clinically free of infection after a mean follow-up interval of 17 months. conclusions: in situ replacement treatment using a rifampin-bonded prosthetic graft for low-grade staphylococcal arterial infection was safe, durable, and associated with eradication of clinical signs of infection. failure of this therapy was the result of virulent and antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains.

TI  == hepcidin, a urinary antimicrobial peptide synthesized in the liver.
AB  == cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides are abundant in animal and plant tissues involved in host defense. in insects, most are synthesized in the fat body, an organ analogous to the liver of vertebrates. from human urine, we characterized a cysteine-rich peptide with three forms differing by amino-terminal truncation, and we named it hepcidin (hepc) because of its origin in the liver and its antimicrobial properties. two predominant forms, hepc20 and hepc25, contained 20  and 25 amino acid residues with all 8 cysteines connected by intramolecular disulfide bonds. reverse translation and search of the data bases found homologous liver cdnas in species from fish to human and a corresponding human genomic sequence on human chromosome 19. the full cdna by 5' rapid amplification  of cdna ends was 0.4 kilobase pair, in agreement with hepcidin mrna size on northern blots. the liver was the predominant site of mrna expression. the encoded prepropeptide contains 84 amino acids, but only the 20-25-amino acid processed forms were found in urine. hepcidins exhibited antifungal activity against candida albicans, aspergillus fumigatus, and aspergillus niger and antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and group b streptococcus. hepcidin may be a vertebrate counterpart of cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides produced in the fat body of insects.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of meropenem versus other extended-spectrum antimicrobial agents against 2,085 clinical isolates tested in 13 brazilian centers.
AB  == meropenem is a parenteral carbapenem antibacterial agent with a very broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. it is the second agent of its class to become available in brazil. the in vitro antibacterial activity of meropenem was compared with imipenem and four other antimicrobial agents in a multicenter study. this study involved 13 clinical microbiology laboratories, 10 of which came from 8 brazilian states. a total of 2,085 clinical isolates consecutively collected between december 1995 and march 1996 were susceptibility tested using the etest and following the nccls procedures. meropenem inhibited more than 90% of isolates of enterobacteriaceae at 0.5 microg/ml, except for citrobacter sp. (1 microg/ml). generally, meropenem was slightly more active than imipenem against gram-negative organisms and its spectrum of antimicrobial activity was broader than those of all other drugs tested. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, meropenem (mic50, 0.38 microg/ml) was approximately 8-fold more active than imipenem (mic 50,3 microg/ml). imipenem was two-to eight-fold more active than meropenem against some gram-positive specees oxacillin, including enterococcus faecalis (mic 50 of 0.75 microg/ml and 2 microg/ml respectively), oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic 50 of 0.47 &mul;g/ml and 0.094 microg/ml), oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (mic 50 of 0.064 microg/ml and 0.5mg/ml). against streptococcus sp. meropenem was slightly more active than imipenem (mic 50, 0.016 microg/ml). the results of this study may be used to guide empiric therapy in brazil and indicates that meropenem may have an important role in the treatment of infections caused by multiresistant strains of bacteria.

TI  == a high incidence of staphylococcus aureus colonization in the external eyes of patients with atopic dermatitis.
AB  == objective: to determine the frequency distribution of bacteria on the external surface of eyes of patients with atopic dermatitis (ad) and to investigate the relationship between the frequency of bacterial colonization and the grade of atopy or ocular diseases associated with ad. design: comparative cross-sectional  study. participants: thirty-six ad patients (mean age, 24.5 years) and 16 nonatopic, age-matched control participants (mean age, 25.5 years). intervention: the eyelid margins and conjunctival sacs were scraped with sterile swabs. these samples were inoculated into aerobic and anaerobic culture media. main outcome measures: the frequency distribution of bacteria isolated from the eyelid margins and conjunctival sacs. results: bacteria isolated from ad patients were: staphylococcus aureus in 21 of 36 patients (including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in two patients); staphylococcus epidermidis in two patients (including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis in one patient); other coagulase-negative staphylococcus in six patients;alpha-streptococcus in three patients; corynebacterium species in three  patients; neisseria species in two patients; and propionibacterium acnes in one patient. from the nonatopic control participants, we isolated s. aureus in one patient, s. epidermidis in two patients and alpha-streptococcus in one patient. s. aureus was isolated from 67% of the ad patients, and any type of bacteria was  isolated from 86% of the patients. these rates were significantly higher than those of nonatopic control participants (6% s. aureus and 25% any bacteria). there was no significant relationship between the frequency distribution of bacteria and the grade of atopy or associated ocular diseases. conclusions: high  rates of bacterial colonization, especially s. aureus, were found in the conjunctival sacs and eyelid margins of ad patients. in case management of ad patients, this unique distribution of bacteria must be carefully considered.

TI  == electrostatic interactions in the adhesion of an ion-penetrable and ion-impenetrable bacterial strain to glass.
AB  == deposition to glass of streptococcus salivarius hb-c12 and staphylococcus epidermidis 3399 in a parallel plate flow chamber has been studied as a function  of ionic strength. electrophoretic mobility measurements revealed that s. epidermidis 3399 possesses a thick ion-penetrable layer, probably associated with its encapsulation, while s. salivarius hb-c12 has an ion-impenetrable surface. streaming potential measurements indicated that also the glass surface was covered with a relatively thin, ion-penetrable layer. theoretical initial deposition rates of both strains to glass were obtained by numerically solving the convective-diffusion equation, while accounting for the ion-penetrability of  the interacting surfaces. experimentally, the initial deposition rate of the ion-penetrable strain s. epidermidis 3399 was found to be higher and less dependent on ionic strength than of the ion-impenetrable s. salivarius hb-c12, in accordance with theoretical expectations. agreement between theoretical and experimental deposition rates could be obtained when glass was considered ion-penetrable when interacting with the ion-penetrable organism s. epidermidis 3399, while glass behaved as an ion-impenetrable surface when interacting with the ion-impenetrable s. salivarius hb-c12. probably, interaction with an ion-impenetrable strain drives the diffuse double layer charges into the limited  volume of the thin ion-penetrable layer on the glass, readily filling it up and making it appear ion-impenetrable. during interaction of glass with another ion-penetrable surface, as of s. epidermidis 3399, diffuse double layer charges move into both ion-penetrable surfaces, resulting in a much lower mobile charge density in the ion-penetrable layer on the glass which consequently continues to  behave as ion-penetrable.

TI  == ecological antibiotic policy.
AB  == development of resistance to antibiotics is a major problem worldwide. the normal oropharyngeal flora, the intestinal flora and the skin flora play important roles in this development. within a few days after the onset of antibiotic therapy, resistant escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae and staphylococcus epidermidis can be detected in the normal flora of volunteers or patients. horizontal spread  of the resistance genes to other species, e.g. salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, occurs by conjugation or transformation. an  ecologically sound antibiotic policy favours the use of antibiotics with little or no impact on the normal flora. prodrug antibiotics which are not active against the bacteria in the mouth and the intestine (before absorption) and which are not excreted to a significant degree via the intestine, saliva or skin are therefore preferred. prodrugs such as pivampicillin, bacampicillin, pivmecillinam and cefuroxime axetil are favourable from an ecological point of view. experience from scandinavia supports this, since resistance to mecillinam after 20 years of  use is low (about 5%) and stable.

TI  == evaluation of gemifloxacin (sb-265805, lb20304a): in vitro activity against over  6000 gram-positive pathogens from diverse geographic areas.
AB  == gemifloxacin (gemi), formerly sb-265805 and lb20304, is a newer fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum activity against a wide variety of bacterial pathogens. the present investigation extended earlier observations by sampling an additional 6790 gram-positive organisms from more than 50 medical centres on three continents. the reference broth microdilution method with recommended medium supplements was used throughout. selected results (number strains tested; mic90 for gemi/trovafloxacin in mg/l; % < or = 1 mg/l for gemi/trovafloxacin) were: staphylococcus aureus (3672; 2/2; 86/85), s. epidermidis (404; 1/>4; 92/71), enterococcus faecalis (630; 4/>4; 76/66), e. faecium (216; > 4/>4; 15/11), streptococcus pneumoniae (300; 0.06/0.25; 100/97), beta-haemolytic streptococci (150; 0.06/0.25; 100/100) and viridans group streptococci (150; 0.12/0.25; 99/97). gemifloxacin appeared equal or superior to trovafloxacin in its overall gram-positive spectrum of activity pending a choice of the susceptible breakpoint concentration. continued in vitro, pharmacodynamic and clinical investigations of gemifloxacin appear warranted.

TI  == role of monocytes in experimental staphylococcus aureus endocarditis.
AB  == in the pathogenesis of bacterial endocarditis (be), the clotting system plays a cardinal role in the formation and maintenance of the endocardial vegetations. the extrinsic pathway is involved in the activation of the coagulation pathway with tissue factor (tf) as the key protein. staphylococcus aureus is a frequently isolated bacterium from patients with be. we therefore investigated whether s. aureus can induce tf activity (tfa) on fibrin-adherent monocytes, used as an in vitro model of be. we also assessed in vivo in rabbits with catheter induced vegetations, the effect of s. aureus infection on vegetational tfa. in vitro experiments showed that adherent s. aureus induced tfa on fibrin-adherent monocytes which was optimal at a bacterium/monocyte ratio of 1 to 1. monocyte damage occurred when this ratio exceeded 4 to 1 (visually) or 6 to 1 (propidium iodide influx) consequently, tfa decreased. in vivo s. aureus led to very high bacterial numbers in the vegetations and a significant increase of their weight.  however, tfa of infected vegetations was the same as of sterile ones. this may be due to the high bacteria to monocyte ratio as well as bacterium-induced monocyte  damage. teicoplanin treatment of infected rabbits reduced bacterial numbers in the blood and in the vegetations. two-day treatment resulted in an increase of vegetational tfa, but after four-day treatment vegetational tfa dropped, most probably due to a suboptimal bacterium/monocyte ratio. s. aureus endocarditis in  etoposide (vepesid)-treated rabbits, leading to a selective monocytopenia, caused a rapid death of the animals. in these rabbits no vegetations were found at all.  we conclude that, like streptococcus sanguis and staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus is able to induce tfa in fibrin-adherent blood monocytes. in addition, monocytes have a protective effect during the course of s. aureus endocarditis.

TI  == peritonitis prevention in capd: to mask or not?
AB  == objective: to assess the efficacy of wearing a face mask to prevent peritonitis during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (capd) bag exchange. setting: renal unit at a university hospital. patients: two groups of patients on capd were compared: those performing bag exchange with (n = 24) and those without a face mask (n = 40). outcomes: occurrence of first episode of peritonitis and total number of episodes. results: no difference was found between groups with respect to probability of developing the first episode of peritonitis (p = 0.757). patients holding university degrees had evidence of protection, with borderline significance [relative risk (rr) 0.52; confidence interval (ci) 95%, 0.23 -1.18; p= 0.109]. cox's proportional hazard regression analysis also demonstrated a significant protective factor for patients with university level education (rr 0.42; cl 95%, 0.18 - 0.98; p = 0.04). incidence of peritonitis was  not significantly different between groups: with-mask group had 1.0 episode/year, and without-mask group had 0.94 episodes/year. staphylococcus epidermidis was the most commonly identified agent. staphylococcus aureus was found more frequently in the with-mask group (p = 0.003). peritonitis due to streptococcus viridans and enterococci were detected only in the without-mask group. conclusion: the current study suggests that routine use of face masks during capd bag exchanges may be unnecessary and could be discontinued.

TI  == musculoskeletal infections in intravenous drug addicts: report of 34 cases with analysis of microbiological aspects and pathogenic mechanisms.
AB  == objective: to analyse characteristics of musculoskeletal infections in spanish intravenous (i.v.) drug addicts. methods: a retrospective analysis of 34 medical  records was carried out and the aetiologic agent was confirmed in all cases. results: the mean age was 26 years and the sex ratio was 25m/9f. twenty-four patients were hiv-positive and 10 hiv-negative. there were no differences between the 2 subgroups. septic arthritis, seen in 27 cases (79%), was the most common type of infection. axial involvement was present in 23 cases (67%). the organisms isolated included staphylococcus aureus (25 cases), candida albicans (3 cases), mycobacterium tuberculosis (2 cases), and neisseria gonorrhoeae, salmonella typhi, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pyogenes in one case each. candida albicans affected the sternocostal joints. laboratory data showed non-specific findings. the outcome was mostly good and only one patient died. conclusion: human immunodeficiency virus does not affect characteristics of musculoskeletal infections in i.v. drug addicts. staphylococcus aureus is the most frequently isolated pathogen in this population.

TI  == effect of radiographic contrast agents on leukocyte metabolic response.
AB  == background: the use of radiographic contrast media in the setting of possible bowel ischemia and potential perforation is known to carry a risk of morbidity and mortality. however, studies of the effect of available contrast media on host immunological defense mechanisms are lacking. we have examined the effect of barium and of two water-soluble contrast agents of differing iodine concentration and osmolality, conray 30 and cysto conray ii, on leukocyte phagocytosis. materials and methods: blood samples were incubated with the contrast media alone (termed the "resting state"), and in combination with a standard phagocytic challenge (zymosan polysaccharide extract) and with staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis and escherichia coli, to determine the effect of contrast  media upon leukocyte phagocytic response. incubation with saline was used as control. in the case of barium, the "resting state" and standard challenge experiments were repeated at nine dilutions, ranging from 1:1 to 1:1000. the leukocyte phagocytic response was measured in two ways: co2 generation (an index  of metabolic activity) and chemiluminescence (an index of generation of reactive  oxygen species and bacterial killing). results: barium, at clinical dilutions, causes a significant increase of baseline "resting state" phagocytic activity, which in turn leads to significant blunting of subsequent response to phagocytic  challenge and adversely affects the response to all bacteria tested. there is no  baseline activation of leukocytes by the water-soluble media, although there was  some inhibition (rather than activation) of leukocyte metabolic activity. the effect of the water-soluble media on bacteria was more complex (although inhibition is minor compared to barium). conclusions: our data demonstrate that barium is a significant activator of phagocytic cells, which results in deactivation of phagocytic response when challenged; these data serve to explain  the enhanced adverse effect of barium in cases of fecal peritonitis.

TI  == the fib locus in streptococcus pneumoniae is required for peptidoglycan crosslinking and pbp-mediated beta-lactam resistance.
AB  == penicillin resistance in pneumococci is mediated by modified penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) that have decreased affinity to beta-lactams. in high-level penicillin-resistant transformants of the laboratory strain streptococcus pneumoniae r6 containing various combinations of low-affinity pbps, disruption of the fib locus results in a collapse of pbp-mediated resistance. in addition, crosslinked muropeptides are highly reduced. the fib operon consists of two genes, fiba and fibb, homologous to staphylococcus aureus fema/b which are also required for expression of methicillin resistance in this organism. fiba and fibb belong to a family of proteins of gram-positive bacteria involved in the formation of interpeptide bridges, thus representing interesting new targets for  antimicrobial compounds for this group of pathogens.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == comparative efficacy of gemifloxacin in experimental models of pyelonephritis and wound infection.
AB  == gemifloxacin (sb-265805) is a potent, novel fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. in this study, the efficacy of gemifloxacin was studied in experimental models of gram-negative pyelonephritis (caused by escherichia coli or proteus mirabilis) and gram-positive wound infection resulting from streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis or staphylococcus aureus. gemifloxacin activity against these pathogens was compared with those of amoxycillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime, azithromycin, trovafloxacin,  grepafloxacin, levofloxacin and tosufloxacin. oral treatment was initiated 1 h after infection and continued once or twice daily for 3 days. around 17 h after the end of treatment, animals were killed and the infected kidneys or the skin around the wound site were excised for the enumeration of viable bacteria. in the pyelonephritis model (either microorganism), gemifloxacin reduced bacterial numbers significantly (p < 0.01) compared with no treatment. no comparator agent  had a greater effect than gemifloxacin. notably, grepafloxacin and azithromycin were significantly less effective (p < 0.01) than gemifloxacin against e. coli pyelonephritis, and amoxycillin-clavulanate, azithromycin and trovafloxacin were  inferior (p < 0.01) against p. mirabilis infection. in the s. pyogenes wound infection model, gemifloxacin, amoxycillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime and azithromycin reduced bacterial numbers significantly compared with controls (p <  0.01). results for the comparator quinolones were not significantly different from untreated controls (p > 0.05). gemifloxacin was also effective against staphylococcal infection, as were grepafloxacin and levofloxacin, while ciprofloxacin, trovafloxacin and tosufloxacin were significantly less effective against these pathogens than gemifloxacin (p < 0.01). no comparator agent had greater activity than gemifloxacin against s. pyogenes or s. aureus infections. these data demonstrate the potential benefit of gemifloxacin in the treatment of  gram-negative urinary tract infection and gram-positive skin and soft tissue infection.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == stimulation of bacterial adherence by neutrophil defensins varies among bacterial species but not among host cell types.
AB  == adherence of haemophilus influenzae to bronchial epithelial cells is enhanced by  neutrophil defensins, which are released from activated neutrophils during inflammation [gorter et al. (1998) j. infect. dis. 178, 1067-1078]. in this study, we showed that the adherence of h. influenzae to various epithelial, fibroblast-like and endothelial cell types was significantly enhanced by defensins (20 microg ml(-1)). defensins stimulated also the adherence of moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis and nonencapsulated streptococcus pneumoniae to the nci-h292 cell line. in contrast, defensins did not affect the adherence of pseudomonas aeruginosa, encapsulated s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis. these results suggest that the defensin-enhanced  adherence might support the adherence and possibly persistence of the selected bacterial species using the respiratory tract as port of entry.

AB  == in this study, the in vitro activity of levofloxacin (lvfx) against 1,020 fresh bacterial clinical isolates was compared with the activities of a range of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin (cpfx), ampicillin (abpc), cefaclor, cefpodoxime, methicillin and benzylpenicillin. the clinical isolates except vibrio cholerae were collected in japan during 1998 from patients with infectious diseases. mics  were determined using the agar dilution method according to the recommendations by the japan society of chemotherapy. some isolates of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and coagulase negative staphylococcus were resistant to fluoroquinolones, but the mic50 of lvfx against mrsa was 6.25 micrograms/ml. lvfx was the most active against mrsa among the antibiotics tested. most of staphylococcus epidermidis strains were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. lvfx showed greater activity against all streptococci strains compared with fluoroquinolones tested. in particular, all streptococcus pneumoniae strains including prsp were susceptible to lvfx at < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. among enterococcus, abpc showed superior activity against enterococcus faecalis but many isolates of enterococcus species were resistant to abpc. lvfx was more active against to these enterococcus species compared with other fluoroquinolones. on the other hand, lvfx and cpfx showed similar activity against isolates of enterobacteriaceae. cpfx had an mic50/90 of 0.20, 0.39 microgram/ml and lvfx showed an mic50/90 of 0.78, 1.56 micrograms/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa. lvfx (mic50/90 0.10, 0.20 microgram/ml) was more active against acinetobacter species than cpfx (mic50/90 0.10, 0.39 microgram/ml). haemophilus influenzae, branhamella (moraxella) catarrhalis and v. cholerae were  inhibited by low concentration of the fluoroquinolones tested. the mic90 of lvfx  and cpfx were < or = 0.10 microgram/ml against above three species. some isolates of neisseria gonorrhoeae and campylobacter species were moderately resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested but the mic50 of lvfx and cpfx were < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. among anaerobes, propionibacterium acnes was more susceptible than  peptostreptococcus species, and the mic90 of beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones tested were < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. in conclusion, this study, performed on large number of strains, confirmed an excellent and wide spectrum antibacterial activity of lvfx compared with the fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams tested. and  our results suggest that lvfx may be useful in the treatment of various bacterial infections.

AB  == mefloquine was found to have bactericidal activity against methicillin- and fluoroquinolone-susceptible and -resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis and gentamicin- and vancomycin-resistant strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. the mics were 16 microg/ml, and the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were 16 to 32 microg/ml. these concentrations cannot be achieved in serum. mefloquine was active at a more achievable concentration against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, with mics of 0.2 to 1.5 microg/ml. mefloquine was not active against gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. in an attempt to find more active derivatives, 400 mefloquine-related compounds were selected from the chemical inventory of the walter reed army institute of research. we identified a series of compounds containing a piperidine methanol group attached to pyridine,  quinoline, and benzylquinoline ring systems. these had activities similar to that of mefloquine against s. pneumoniae but were far more active against other gram-positive bacteria (mics for staphylococci, 0.8 to 6.3 microg/ml). they had activities similar to that of amphotericin b against candida spp. and cryptococcus neoformans. combinations of the compounds with gentamicin and vancomycin were additive against staphylococci and pneumococci. the mic and mbc of gentamicin were decreased by four- to eightfold when this drug was combined with limiting dilutions of the compounds. there was no antagonism with other antimicrobial drugs. the compounds were rapidly bactericidal. they appear to act  by disrupting cell membranes. combinations of the compounds with aminoglycoside antibiotics may have potential for therapeutic use.

TI  == a shift from oral to blood ph is a stimulus for adaptive gene expression of streptococcus gordonii ch1 and induces protection against oxidative stress and enhanced bacterial growth by expression of msra.
AB  == viridans group streptococci (vs) from the oral cavity entering the bloodstream may initiate infective endocarditis (ie). we aimed to identify genes expressed in response to a ph increase from slightly acidic (ph 6.2) to neutral (ph 7.3) as encountered by vs entering the bloodstream from the oral cavity. using a recently developed promoter-screening vector, we isolated five promoter fragments from the genomic dna of streptococcus gordonii ch1 responding to this stimulus. no common  regulatory sequences were identified in these promoter fragments that could account for the coordinate expression of the corresponding genes. one of the isolated fragments contained the promoter region and 5' end of a gene highly homologous to the methionine sulfoxide reductase gene (msra) of various bacterial and eukaryotic species. this gene has been found to be activated in s. gordonii strain v288 in a rabbit model of ie (a. o. kilic, m. c. herzberg, m. w. meyer, x. zhao, and l. tao, plasmid 42:67-72, 1999). we isolated and characterized the msra gene of s. gordonii ch1 and constructed a chromosomal insertion mutant. this mutant was more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, suggesting a role for the streptococcal msra in protecting against oxidative stress. moreover, msra appeared to be important for the growth of s. gordonii ch1 under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. both these properties of msra may contribute to the ability of s. gordonii to cause ie.

TI  == pyogenic psoas abscess: analysis of 27 cases.
AB  == from 1993 to 1998, 29 pyogenic psoas abscesses occurring in 27 patients were seen in taichung veterans general hospital. their age range was 25 to 85 years. diabetes mellitus was the leading underlying disease. fever and pain in the flank area, back and hip were the usual manifestations. the duration of symptoms prior  to the diagnosis ranged from 3 days to 6 months. most abscesses were diagnosed by computed tomography (ct) images and proven by abscess cultures, which were divided into primary and secondary types. eighteen of 29 abscesses were regarded  as primary. staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen in the primary abscesses, followed by streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, viridans streptococci, s. epidermidis, and salmonella spp.. in the secondary abscess category, e. coli was the leading organism in this series, followed by s. aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridans streptococci and candida albicans. the associated conditions included epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, perirenal  abscess, pulmonary tuberculosis, empyema, hydronephrosis and trauma history. the  initial empiric therapy comprised mostly of cefazolin or oxacillin with or without an aminoglycoside. thirteen patients underwent percutaneous drainage, while six received surgical debridement, including two with a recurrent abscess.  one patient had both drainage and debridement. others received medical treatment  only. two of the patients with primary abscess died in spite of percutaneous drainage. therefore, open drainage, besides appropriate antibiotic treatment, is  still required to control complex abscesses with sepsis.

TI  == mannose-binding lectin binds to a range of clinically relevant microorganisms and promotes complement deposition.
AB  == mannose-binding lectin (mbl) is a collagenous serum lectin believed to be of importance in innate immunity. genetically determined low levels of the protein are known to predispose to infections. in this study the binding of purified mbl  to pathogens isolated from immunocompromised children was investigated by flow cytometry. diverse candida species, aspergillus fumigatus, staphylococcus aureus, and beta-hemolytic group a streptococci exhibited strong binding of mbl, whereas  escherichia coli, klebsiella species, and haemophilus influenzae type b were characterized by heterogeneous binding patterns. in contrast, beta-hemolytic group b streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus epidermidis showed low levels of binding. bound mbl was able to promote c4 deposition in a concentration-dependent manner. we conclude that mbl may be of importance in first-line immune defense against several important pathogens.

TI  == corneal ulceration in the elderly in hyderabad, south india.
AB  == aims: to report demographic, microbiological, therapeutic, anatomical, and visual results of corneal ulceration in the elderly patients seen at a tertiary eye care centre in south india. methods: 102 consecutive cases of microbial keratitis in patients 65 years and older were studied. inclusion criteria were: (i) presence of corneal stromal infiltrate upon slit lamp examination; and (ii) microbiological evaluation of corneal scrapings for suspected microbial keratitis. results: the principal predisposing factors identified in this study were ocular disease (38.2%), previous ocular surgery in the same eye (29.4%), trauma (17.6%), and severe systemic disease (16.7%). contact lens wear was associated with only two cases (2.0%). 99 organisms were isolated in cultures of  corneal scrapings from 74 (72.5%) of the 102 cases. staphylococcus epidermidis (31.1%), filamentous fungi (25.7%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (13.5%) were the most common isolates. 12 eyes (11.8%) required surgery, 15 (14.7%) eventually required evisceration, and nine (9.6%) of the 94 followed patients achieved an unaided vision of 20/60 or better at last follow up. conclusions: this work represents the largest recent single centre study on (non-viral) microbial keratitis in the elderly, its management, and outcomes of therapy. while the predisposing factors differ from those of general population, the spectrum of microbes responsible for keratitis in the elderly appears to reflect the local microbial flora rather than a predilection for elderly patients. delay in diagnosis and systemic conditions associated with advancing age probably contribute to poorer outcome from therapeutic measures.

TI  == molecular and physiological characterization of dominant bacterial populations in traditional mozzarella cheese processing
AB  == the development of the dominant bacterial populations during traditional mozzarella cheese production was investigated using physiological analyses and molecular techniques for strain typing and taxonomic identification. analysis of  rapd fingerprints revealed that the dominant bacterial community was composed of  25 different biotypes, and the sequence analysis of 16s rdna demonstrated that the isolated strains belonged to leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides,  leuc. lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, strep. bovis, strep. uberis, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, l. garviae, carnobacterium divergens, c. piscicola, aerococcus viridans, staphylococcus carnosus, staph. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, ent. sulphureus and enterococcus spp. the bacterial populations were characterized for their physiological properties. two strains, belonging to strep. thermophilus and l. lactis subsp. lactis, were the most acidifying; thel. lactis subsp. lactis strain was also proteolytic and eight strains were positive to citrate fermentation. moreover, the molecular techniques allowed the identification of potential pathogens in a non-ripened cheese produced from raw milk.

TI  == bacterial species- and strain-dependent induction of tissue factor in human vascular endothelial cells.
AB  == a cardinal process in bacterial endocarditis (be) is the activation of the clotting system and the formation of a fibrin clot on the inner surface of the heart, the so-called endocardial vegetation. the processes that lead to the activation of the clotting system on endothelial surfaces upon exposure to bacteria are largely unknown. in the present study, we investigated in an in vitro model whether infection of human endothelial cells (ec) with bacteria that  are relevant to be, such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguis, and staphylococcus epidermidis, leads to induction of tissue factor (tf)-dependent procoagulant activity (tfa) and whether this process is influenced by host factors, such as interleukin-1 (il-1), that are produced in response to the bacteremia in vivo. the results show that s. aureus binds to and is internalized  by ec, resulting in expression of tf mrna and tf surface protein as well as generation of tfa within 4 to 8 h after infection. no tfa was found when ec were  exposed to uv-irradiated s. aureus or bacterial cell wall fragments. s. sanguis and s. epidermidis, although also binding to ec, did not induce endothelial tfa.  this indicates a species and strain dependency. ec also expressed tfa after exposure to il-1. the enhanced tfa of ec after exposure to s. aureus was not prevented by il-1 receptor antagonist, arguing against an auto- or paracrine contribution of endogenous il-1. when il-1 was applied together with bacteria, this had a synergistic effect on the induction of ec tfa. this was found in particular with s. aureus but also, although to a lesser degree, with s. sanguis  and s. epidermidis. this influence of il-1 on the species- and strain-dependent induction of ec tfa suggests that bacterial factors as well as host factors orchestrate the induction of coagulation in an early stage in the pathogenesis of endovascular disease, such as be.

AB  == thirteen teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis and nine severe periodontal pockets were cultured for presence of beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms. samples were dispersed and plated on two non-selective and one selective growth media and incubated anaerobically and in 10% co2 in air. a total of 59 beta-hemolytic colonies were purified and identified. eight beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates were obtained from three  of the severe marginal periodontitis sites. all were identified as belonging to the streptococcus sanguis group. no beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected in  apical periodontitis samples. twenty obligately anaerobic isolates were detected, all of which were known periodontal and endodontic pathogens. isolates from apical periodontitis sites were identified as propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces naeslundii, actionomyces odontolyticus and peptostreptococcus micros, while severe marginal periodontal sites contained the same species with the addition of actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces meyeri. of 19 staphylococci and  micrococci, staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant isolate in both apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis sites. however, less commonly known organisms such as staphylococcus cohnii and micrococcus sp. were identified in severe marginal periodontitis sites. the isolation of bacillus sp. (12 isolates) in one severe marginal periodontitis and two apical periodontitis subjects was especially interesting, warranting consideration of this organism as a legitimate isolate and potential pathogen in oral disease.

TI  == microbial flora variations in the respiratory tract of mice.
AB  == a stable microbial system in the respiratory tract acts as an important defense mechanism against pathogenic microorganisms. perturbations in this system may allow pathogens to establish. in an ecological environment such as the respiratory tract, there are many diverse factors that play a role in the establishment of the indigenous flora. in the present work we studied the normal  microbial flora of different areas of the respiratory tract of mice and their evolution from the time the mice were born. our interest was to know which were the dominant groups of microorganisms in each area, which were the first capable  of colonizing and which dominated over time to be used as probiotic microorganisms. our results show that gram negative facultatively anaerobic bacilli and strict anaerobic microorganisms were the last ones to appear in the bronchia, while aerobic and gram positive cocci were present in all the areas of  the respiratory tract. the number of facultative aerobes and strict anaerobes were similar in the nasal passage, pharynx instilled and trachea, but lower in bronchia. the dominant species were streptococcus viridans and staphylococcus saprophyticcus, followed by s. epidermidis, lactobacilli and s. cohnii i which were present on every studied days but at different proportions. this paper is the first part of a research topic investigating the protective effect of the indigenous flora against pathogens using the mice as an experimental model.

AB  == this study examined the bacterial pathogens and the presence of possible risk factors for the development of chronic otitis media with effusion (ome) in a group of alaska native children. middle ear aspirates were collected from 128 children < 6 years of age requiring tympanocentesis between 1987 and 1989. bacterial pathogens were cultured from 40% of 209 fluids. predominant isolates, after contamination of the outer ear was controlled for, were haemophilus influenzae (21%; 84% of these were nontypeable), streptococcus pneumoniae (8.1%;  serotypes 6b, 10a, 11a, 14, 18b, 18c, 19a, and 23f), staphylococcus epidermidis (3.8%), and moraxella (brahmanella) catarrhalis (2.9%). pneumococcal-c-polysaccharide (pnc) was detectable in 3 of 135 (2.2%) aspirates that did not grow streptococcus pneumoniae. combining culture and pnc assay results evidence of pneumococcal infection was found in almost 10% of aspirates tested. there was not a significant difference in the number of episodes of acute otitis media after the first year of life based on the age at the first episode (< 6 mo, > or = 6 mo). however, 88% of infants in the study had their first acute otitis media episode before 1 year of age.

TI  == cure of implantable venous port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients without catheter removal.
AB  == the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of port-associated bloodstream infection without device removal has not been systematically studied. we analyzed the outcome of 43 consecutive port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients. etiologies included staphylococcus epidermidis (30) and staphylococcus aureus (6). antibiotics were given through the port for a median of 11 days. four ports were removed within 72 hours. in 36 (92%) of the remaining 39 episodes, there was a response to antibiotic therapy (defervescence  and negative blood culture). in 78% of episodes in which there was a response (excluding two in which the catheters were removed because of mechanical problems), the infections were cured without port removal. two of the four relapses were cured with a second course of antibiotics. the cure rate was 92% for s. epidermidis infections and 67% for s. aureus infections. thus, the majority of port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients can be cured without device removal.

TI  == [bacterial keratitis in patients with and without contact lens anamnesis].
AB  == background: the study shows differences between contact lens wearers and patients without history of contact lenses regarding the spectrum of etiological agents in bacterial keratitis. based on microbiological analysis, there are given recommendations for an optimal initial antibiotic treatment in both groups. material and methods: from 1989 to 1997 smears, scrapings and corneal biopsies were taken from 218 patients with bacterial keratitis. the causing pathogens were isolated on directly inoculated culture media and identified by staining and microscopy. the resistance pattern of a total of 275 germs was analysed for different antibiotics. results: the most frequently isolated germs were staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus spp., propionibacterium acnes and pseudomonas aeruginosa. whereas sensitive gram-positive germs were predominating in contact lens wearers as well as in non-contact lens wearers, multiresistant gram-negative germs could nearly exclusively be isolated from contact lens wearers. frequently administered antibiotics like aminoglycosides and quinolones are effective in infections caused by staphylococcus spp., but increasing resistance could be seen to streptococcus spp. in this case, erythromycin is very sensitive. gram-negative germs like pseudomonas aeruginosa are sensitive to quinolones and some aminoglycosides (e.g. tobramycin). conclusion: in contact lens wearers, more aggressive germs have to be considered than in non-contact lens wearers. in such  cases, frequently administered antibiotics like amino-glycosides are not effective. to cover problematic gram-negative germs we recommend the application  of quinolones alternating with erythromycin. the latter one is more effective than quinolones and aminoglycosides in case of streptococcus spp. co-involvement.

TI  == feglymycin, a novel inhibitor of the replication of the human immunodeficiency virus. fermentation, isolation and structure elucidation.
AB  == the novel peptide feglymycin has been isolated from cultures of streptomyces sp.  dsm 11171 by solid phase extraction, size exclusion chromatography and repeated reversed-phase chromatography. the molecular weight was found to be 1900.90 g/mol and the molecular formula is c95h97nl3o30. feglymycin contains 13 amino acids of  which four are 3-hydroxyphenylglycine and five are 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine residues. the structure of the linear peptide has been determined by 1h and 13c nmr spectroscopy. the sequence was confirmed by the observed mass spectroscopic fragmentation pattern. as well as having weak antibacterial activity, feglymycin  inhibits the replication of the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) in vitro.

AB  == inflammations of the udder influence the amount of somatic cells and lactose as well as electrical conductivity in milk. they are often caused by bacterial agents. similar reactions are to be seen in relation to c-reactive protein (crp). the amount of crp in milk depends on concentration and characteristics of the agents and the phase of inflammation. we found a significant increase of crp in milk samples with streptococcus (sc.) uberis. there was no significant difference in crp concentrations in samples with coagulase positive staphylococcus spp. (cps) and bacteriological negative samples and such with corynebacterium (c.) bovis, micrococcus spp. and staphylococcus (s.) epidermidis. we only found high correlations to the amount of somatic sells and lactose as well as electrical conductivity in samples with sc. uberis. the results of our investigations show that crp may be a parameter for better understanding subclinical inflammations of udder.

TI  == vascular surgical society of great britain and ireland: in situ replacement of infected aortic grafts with rifampicin-bonded prostheses
AB  == background: prosthetic graft infection following abdominal aortic aneurysm (aaa)  surgery is life threatening. treatment options include total graft excision and extra-anatomic bypass or in situ replacement of the graft. the latter option is gaining popularity but the long-term outcome remains uncertain, particularly in light of the increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) infection. a retrospective study was undertaken to assess the outcome after graft excision and in situ replacement with a rifampicin-bonded prosthesis  for the treatment of major aortic graft infection. the prevalence of mrsa and its influence on outcome was also assessed. methods: over 6 years between january 1992 and december 1997, 11 patients (eight men) with major aortic graft infection underwent total graft excision and in situ replacement with a rifampicin-bonded prosthesis. results: the median age was 66 (range 49-78) years. four patients presented with haemorrhage from an aortoenteric fistula, three had retroperitoneal abscess, two had graft occlusion, one had a perigraft collection  on computed tomography and one presented with a ruptured suprarenal false aneurysm. organisms were cultured from ten patients. staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus faecalis were predominant. mrsa was isolated from two patients, both of whom had originally undergone ruptured aaa repair. two patients died and  three suffered non-fatal complications. two patients died during follow-up, one from suspected ongoing mrsa infection and the other from recurrent graft infection. seven patients remain alive and clinically free from infection, although two were lost to follow-up at 12 and 15 months. conclusion: the long-term results following total graft excision and in situ replacement with a rifampicin-bonded prosthesis appear to be favourable. mrsa infection seems to be  associated with a poor prognosis.

TI  == co-occurrence of pneumococcal keratitis and dacryocystitis.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the specific risk factors responsible for the development of pneumococcal keratitis. methods: in a retrospective analysis of 383 patients of culture-proven bacterial keratitis, seen between 1991 and 1995, 139 had monobacterial isolates on culture. we analyzed the various predisposing factors in these patients, with special emphasis on the patency of nasolacrimal drainage  system. results: of the 139 patients with monobacterial keratitis, 48 (group 1) grew streptococcus pneumoniae in culture. in the remaining 91 patients (group 2), pseudomonas (18), coagulase-negative staphylococci (15), staphylococcus epidermidis (23), staphylococcus aureus (16), corynebacterium species (12), and others (seven) were isolated. trauma was found to be a predisposing factor in 12  patients of group 1 and 27 patients of group 2 (p = 0.5601). twelve (25%) patients of group 1 revealed chronic dacryocystitis, and nine of them underwent sac excision. on the contrary, only three patients of group 2 demonstrated dacryocystitis (p = 0.0003). conclusion: these results underscore the importance  of assessing the patency of lacrimal drainage system in patients with infectious  keratitis, especially of pneumococcal origin.

TI  == new patterns of infecting organisms in late bleb-related endophthalmitis: a ten year review.
AB  == purpose: to report the risk factors, causative organisms and visual outcomes in patients with late-onset bleb-related endophthalmitis. methods: medical records of all patients with the clinical diagnosis of late-onset bleb-related endophthalmitis undergoing vitreous aspirates for culture at our institution from january 1987 to july 1996 were reviewed. late-onset bleb-related endophthalmitis  was defined as conjunctival injection, bleb purulence and intraocular inflammation developing at least 1 month following filtering surgery. results: forty-nine cases of bleb-related endophthalmitis developed in 42 patients (23 men, 19 women). mean patient age was 62.1 +/- 19.3 years (range 5-94 years). thirty-nine patients underwent prior filtering surgery (superior trabeculectomy,  24 eyes; inferior trabeculectomy, 10 eyes; combined superior trabeculectomy/cataract extraction, 4 eyes; posterior lip sclerectomy, 1 eye) and 3 had inadvertent blebs following cataract extraction. endophthalmitis developed  an average of 25.4 +/- 23.5 months (range 1-96 months) post-operatively. antifibrosis agents were used in 25 of 39 eyes undergoing filtering surgery (mitomycin c, 13 eyes; 5-fluorouracil, 12 eyes). bleb leaks were documented in a  total of 32 of 49 (65%) cases either before or at the time of endophthalmitis diagnosis. vitreous cultures were positive in 42 of 49 (86%) cases. the most frequently cultured organisms were staphylococcus aureus (13), staphylococcus epidermidis (12), streptococcus species (8) and haemophilus influenzae (2). a final visual acuity of 20/400 or better was achieved in 32 of 49 (65%) cases. conclusions: staphylococcal species were the most frequently cultured organisms in this series and may be associated with better visual outcomes. although a causal relationship cannot be established, these results suggest a strong association between bleb leaks and endophthalmitis.

TI  == adherence of staphylococcus aureus is enhanced by an endogenous secreted protein  with broad binding activity.
AB  == a novel mechanism for enhancement of adherence of staphylococcus aureus to host components is described. a secreted protein, eap (extracellular adherence protein), was purified from the supernatant of s. aureus newman and found to be able to bind to at least seven plasma proteins, e.g., fibronectin, the alpha-chain of fibrinogen, and prothrombin, and to the surface of s. aureus. eap  bound much less to cells of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans, or  escherichia coli. the protein can form oligomeric forms and is able to cause agglutination of s. aureus. binding of s. aureus to fibroblasts and epithelial cells was significantly enhanced by addition of eap, presumably due to its affinity both for plasma proteins on the cells and for the bacteria.

AB  == a cdna encoding achacin, an antimicrobial glycoprotein from the body surface mucus of giant african snail achacina fulica ferussac, was expressed in a methylotrophic yeast, pichia pastoris, and recombinant achacin (rach) was secreted in yeast minimal medium in a polyglycosylated form with 80 kda. carbohydrate analysis revealed that the glycosylated moiety of rach was composed  of 50 mol mannose and 2 mol n-acetylglucosamine residues. antimicrobial activity  using escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus showed that the rach had a behavior similar to its native counterpart. the rach showed so wide an antimicrobial spectrum that 0.1 mg/ml rach inhibited the growth of pseudomonas fluorescens, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus faecalis in addition to e. coli and s. aureus, whereas it did not appreciably affect the growth of proteus mirabilis, bacillus cereus and micrococcus luteus. the rach was also effective in preventing growth of vibrio anguillarum and vibrio parahaemolyticus. the results suggested that the rach had great potential of using as an antimicrobial agent.

TI  == hospitalization in peritoneal dialysis patients.
AB  == hospitalization rates are declining more rapidly for peritoneal dialysis (pd) than for hemodialysis patients. this has been postulated to be caused in part by  lower peritonitis rates. however, the causes of admission have not been reexamined in the setting of declining rates. we prospectively examined our hospitalization rates, causes of admission, and impact of peritonitis on hospitalization in adult pd patients at a single center over a 4-year period. there were 274 admissions in 168 patient-years for a rate of 1.6 admissions and 13.0 hospital days per patient-year. rates were greater for men (1.8 v 1.5; p = 0.013), patients with diabetes (2.2 v 1.4, p < 0.001), and those with a higher peritoneal equilibration test result. creatinine clearance and sex were independent predictors in a multivariate analysis. the most common causes for admission were cardiac disease (14.6%) and peritonitis (13.5%). peritonitis accounted for 0.21 admissions and 2.0 hospital days per patient-year. thirty percent of the incident patients were admitted during the first 90 days of dialysis. admissions for dehydration and glucose abnormalities were more common in the first 90 days. overall admission rates, as well as admission rates for peritonitis, did not change over time, although hospital days per year decreased. those admitted for peritonitis had higher peritonitis rates, more time on pd, and were more likely to be black. eighty-one percent of the admissions for peritonitis were caused by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus spp, or gram-negative/fungal peritonitis. patients with peritonitis caused by staphylococcus epidermidis were less likely to be admitted than patients with peritonitis caused by other organisms. to conclude, peritonitis remains a common  cause of hospitalization, despite low peritonitis rates. to decrease admissions for peritonitis, attention should be focused on preventing peritonitis caused by  organisms other than s epidermidis.

AB  == long-term influence of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (capd) on concentrations of transforming growth factor beta1 (tgf-beta1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bfgf) in the peritoneal effluent, and the effect of peritonitis on these cytokines were investigated. tgf-beta1 and bfgf were assayed in effluent samples from dialysate bags collected during the initial week of treatment with capd and at 5 months. to determine the effect of peritonitis, dialysate bags were collected on admission to the hospital and on days 3 and 10 and also during non-infected steady state. serum was drawn prior to infection and on days 1 and 10. tgf-beta1 increased more than threefold during the longitudinal follow-up period, median concentrations of 35 pg/ml to 106 pg/ml (p<0.05). no change in bfgf was seen during this initial 5 months. tgf-beta1 was increased on  the first day of peritonitis (median concentration 169 pg/ml) and reached its maximum on day 3 of infection, (median concentration 216 pg/ml) (p<0.05 vs non-infected state, median concentration 39 pg/ml). basic fgf reached a maximum on day three of infection (median concentration 7.7 pg/ml; p=0.01 vs non-infected state) and then slowly declined. in conclusion, tgf-beta1 is influenced by capd treatment per se, and together with bfgf is increased during peritonitis, indicating its importance in the peritoneum and its potential involvement in the  development of tissue fibrosis and eventually ultrafiltration failure.

AB  == the mics of quinupristin/dalfopristin against common gram-positive bacteria isolated from various clinical specimens at a university hospital in taiwan were  determined by the agar dilution method. the tested bacteria included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis (msse), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis. with the exception of e. faecalis all bacteria were susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin. the mic50 and mic90 were, respectively, 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml for both mrsa and mssa; 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml for mrse; 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.25 microgram/ml for msse; 0.125 microgram/ml and 0.125 microgram/ml for s.  pyogenes; and < or = 0.03 microgram/ml and 0.25 microgram/ml for s. pneumoniae. eighty-two percent of the tested e. faecalis isolates were intermediately resistant or resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin, with an mic50 of 2 micrograms/ml and an mic90 of 4 micrograms/ml. quinupristin/dalfopristin seems to be a promising antimicrobial agent against common gram-positive bacteria other than e. faecalis in taiwan.

AB  == the results of the bacteriological investigation of the secretion from the trachea, large bronchi and fauces of 36 newborns (including 27 preterms) with severe pneumonia were analyzed. 20 of them were born of women with complicating somatic, obstetric and gynecologic histories: candidiasis, herpes genitalis, chronic endometritis, adnexitis or chronic pyelonephritis that could be the risk  of the fetus intranatal infection. during the acute period of pneumonia in the newborns within the first 4-8 days of life mainly pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated (51.3 per cent), staphylococcus epidermidis, s. haemolyticus and enterococcus faecalis were less frequent (18.9, 8.1 and 5.4 per cent, respectively). klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus anhaemolyticus and other organisms were extremely rare. on the whole the gramnegative microflora predominated. the study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that the majority of the p. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to amikacin and polymyxin b, the isolates susceptible to ceftazidime were less frequent, 20-25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone and imipenem and practically no isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. the s.epidermidis isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and vancomycin and in rare cases to fusidin and amikacin and resistant to oxacillin. when the treatment course was more than 15 days, the isolates proved to be susceptible to 1/3 of the presently  available antibiotics. because of the host low protective forces, peculiarities of the infection pathways and high frequency of the resistant strains it is valid to include netilmicin, imipenem, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone to the complex therapy of the newborns along with the substitution immunotherapy.

TI  == penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humor using different topical application modes.
AB  == background: a prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humor. methods: cataract patients (n = 224) preoperatively received topically applied gyrase inhibitors (0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% norfloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin) in two different application modes. in application mode i, patients received on the day  before operation 3 x 1 eye drop at 2-h intervals, and on the day of operation 3 drops at 1-h intervals. in application mode ii, patients received 9 drops at 15-min intervals on the day of operation only. just before cataract surgery 50-100 ml aqueous humor was aspirated and stored at -80 degrees c. the hplc method was used for measuring the concentration. results: the highest concentrations of all tested antibiotics were measured after the mode of application in which one drop was given every 15 min between 06:00 and 08:00 hours before operation. in this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 379.8 +/- 327.8 mg/l (range 33-1388 mg/l), norfloxacin 182.1 +/- 118.1 mg/l (range 38-480 mg/l) and ofloxacin 563.9 +/- 372.1 mg/l (range 64-1455 mg/l). these mean concentration are all above the mic90 of gram-negative bacteria like proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. in some cases the concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, but never norfloxacin, reached therapeutic values above the mic90 of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. conclusions: the mean concentration value of 0.3% ciprofloxacin and of 0.3% ofloxacin in the aqueous humor reached the mic90 values of the frequently occurring gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humor concentration. considering the higher antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin, both ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin may be useful ophthalmic agents in antibacterial management, but they are not efficient against streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

AB  == background and study aims: prior to endoscopic therapeutic procedures, no antibiotic prophylaxis is administered routinely. because of the reported incidence of infectious complications, which may reach up to 10%, a prospective study was undertaken to investigate the effects of a prophylactic dose of cefuroxime on the incidence of bacteremia and clinical signs of infection, but no significant effects could be demonstrated. in addition to this published work, blood and bile cultures obtained in this trial were also investigated, and the in-vitro susceptibility to several antibiotics was tested in order to recommend the appropriate substances. patients and methods: ninety-nine consecutive patients (51 men, 48 women; mean age 61.4 +/- 17 years) with biliary obstruction  who underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp) or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography with drainage (ptcd) were included. sequential blood cultures were taken before and up to 60 minutes after the endoscopic intervention. bile cultures were obtained in 56 patients with biliary  drainage. aerobic and anaerobic cultures were prepared from all obtained specimens and the isolated organisms were identified. in the case of positive cultures, an in-vitro resistance test for 15 different antibiotics was performed. results: the incidence of bacteremia was 11.1% (n = 11), and 16 bacteria were isolated. twelve different microorganisms were detected, with escherichia coli found in four cases. from 41 positive out of 56 prepared bile cultures (73.2%), 91 isolates were found with 25 different species. a single agent was detected in  eight cases (19.5%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to six species, was found in 33 cases (80.5%). the seven most frequently isolated germs  were e. coli and enterococcus (each n = 19), klebsiella (n = 10), streptococcus viridans (n = 9), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 5), morganella morganii (n = 4), and bacteroides fragilis (n = 3), representing 76% of all agents. examination for fungal infection revealed positive cultures of candida albicans in 16.1% of bile cultures (nine of 56). interestingly, the use of proton-pump inhibitors (ppis), with a consequent rise in the gastric ph value, led to an increase in the rate of bacteremia to 26.2% (five of 19) compared to the other patients not on ppis (n = 80), who developed bacteremia in only six cases (7.5%; p = 0.02). in-vitro testing of different antibiotics was carried out in 73 isolates. imipenem showed the best antimicrobial activity (98.4%), followed by trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (90%), amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (87.3%), vancomycin  (82.4%), and ofloxacin (76.9%). conclusions: escherichia coli was found to be the pathogen most frequently detected in blood and bile following endoscopic interventions in the biliary tract. enterococci, klebsiella and streptococcus viridans were found in bile cultures with an incidence exceeding 10%. in view of  the in-vitro test results, possible side effects, and contraindications, amoxicillin plus beta-lactamase inhibitors or quinolones are considered to be suitable antibiotics for the prophylaxis of biliary infections.

TI  == passive deformability of mature, immature, and active neutrophils in healthy and  septicemic neonates.
AB  == obstruction of narrow vessels by rigid neutrophils may contribute to ischemic organ injury. in septicemia, a substantial portion of the neutrophils may become  activated and the number of circulating immature neutrophils may rise sharply. volume and deformability of mature (pmn) and immature neutrophils in healthy preterm and full-term infants and in septicemic neonates were studied by means of a micropipette system. membrane cytoplasm tongues were aspirated into 2.5-microm  (diameter) pipettes over a period of 60 s. volume and tongue growth of mature resting pmn were similar in healthy preterm and full-term neonates and adults. compared with mature pmn (about 360 fl), the volumes of band cells (415 fl), metamyelocytes (470 fl), and less mature cells (myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and myelocytes; 490 fl) were significantly increased (p < 0.005). final tongue lengths of band cells, metamyelocytes, and less mature cells were decreased by about 50, 60, and 70%, respectively, when compared with passive mature cells. in  septic neonates, the percentage of immature neutrophils was increased, but the deformability and volume of the cell subpopulations were not affected by septicemia. active pmn were characterized by pseudopod formation. more active pmn were found in group b streptococcal (14% of total pmn), gram-negative (12%), and  staphylococcus epidermidis septicemia (8%) than in healthy neonates and adults (4%). the main bodies of active pmn were less deformable than passive pmn, and the pseudopods showed very little membrane deformation. the increased number of rigid active and immature neutrophils may contribute to impaired microcirculation and the high risk for organ injury in septic patients.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antibiotics on 1,116 clinical gram-positive and gram-negative isolates.
AB  == a total of 1,116 clinically isolated strains belonging to staphylococcus aureus (200), staphylococcus epidermidis (200), streptococcus pneumoniae (20), escherchia coli (200), klebsiella spp. (177), serratia marcescens (22), pseudomonas aeruginosa (224), haemophilus influenzae (35) and salmonella (38) from the department of infectious diseases, la sapienza university in rome (italy) were tested against three fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and  levofloxacin) and 10 other antibiotics (augmentin, ampicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefotaxime, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin, minocycline, oxacillin and vancomycin). fluoroquinolones inhibited essentially about 100% of h. influenzae,  salmonella and s. pneumoniae, more than 75% of staphylococcus including methicillin-resistant strains, and about 90% of enterobacteriaceae and 50% of p.  aeruginosa. minimal inhibitory concentration values ranged from < 0.015 to > 32 micrograms/ml for klebsiella, s. aureus and epidermidis, e. coli and p. aeruginosa; from < 0.015 to 2 micrograms/ml for salmonella; from 0.03 to 16 micrograms/ml for serratia; from < 0.015 to 1 microgram/ml for haemophilus; and from 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml for s. pneumoniae. levofloxacin and to a lesser extent ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, generally exhibited a greater activity than the other agents against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. regarding the distribution of resistant strains in italy, we found a peculiar pattern of resistance as far as e. coli and p. aeruginosa were concerned. quality control parameters are also summarized. s. epidermidis resulted as a new emergent pathogen especially in immunocompromised patients and its level of sensitivity has been modified over the last few years. in fact, the percentage of resistant strains to antibiotics or the percentage of methicillin-resistant isolates (in our study 35%), has gradually increased. levofloxacin and ofloxacin showed good activity against staphylococcal strains compared with the majority of other antibiotics. these results suggest that the newer quinolones are promising antimicrobial agents for various infections.

TI  == effect of therapeutic concentrations of nitric oxide on bacterial growth in vitro.
AB  == objectives: besides its vasodilative actions, nitric oxide (no) is also involved  in host defense on a cellular level. we studied the antimicrobial properties of no in concentrations used with inhaled no therapy for the treatment of pulmonary  hypertension in neonates. design: in vitro study of bacterial growth of five species, with and without no exposure. setting: level iv neonatal intensive care  unit at a university children's hospital. subjects: in vitro bacterial cultures.  interventions: we tested ten different strains of five bacterial species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, group b streptococcus [gbs/streptococcus agalactiae], escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa), derived from the tracheal isolates of ventilated premature and term infants. cultures were exposed to three different concentrations of no (40, 80, and 120 parts per million [ppm]) and bacterial growth was compared with the same strains  incubated in ambient air for 24 hrs. after incubation (with or without no), colony-forming units were counted. measurements and main results: bacterial growth of s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa was not reduced with the no concentrations applied. the number of colony-forming units of s. aureus increased at 80 ppm of no. growth of s. epidermidis and gbs was significantly affected at 120 ppm, resulting in decreased numbers of colony-forming units as compared with  controls exposed to ambient air. conclusions: we conclude that no has a selective bacteriostatic effect on some of those bacteria most commonly cultured in tracheal specimens of premature infants and neonates. this effect appears to be dose-dependent and occurs in the upper range of dosages used with inhaled no therapy. however, in the range of dosages applied in ongoing controlled trials of inhaled no in neonates and premature infants (1 to 80 ppm), a bacteriostatic effect of no is not to be expected.

TI  == [gram-positive cocci isolated from blood].
AB  == between 1994 and 1997, the main organisms isolated from the blood of patients examined in our laboratory were staphylococci. namely 216 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, 194 strains of staphylococcus aureus and 81 strains of other coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated from patient blood. regarding s. aureus, mrsa strains were predominant and 140 strains of mrsa were isolated from patient blood. s. epidermidis and mrsa were mainly isolated from patients will indwelling intravenous catheters. in some cases showing positive culture of s. epidermidis, however, the probability of contamination while taking the blood samples could not be excluded. a survey of infective endocarditis between april 1987 and march 1997 revealed that the main causative organism of native valve endocarditis was still streptococci. of 33 cases of native valve endocarditis, 18 cases were due to viridans streptococci.

TI  == study of common aerobic flora of human cerumen.
AB  == cerumen is the product of the secretion of the sebaceous, ceruminous or apocrine  glands together with cells exfoliated from the cornified stratum of the epithelium of the external auditory canal (eac). in the present study we identified and quantified common flora of human cerumen. the mean count obtained  was 10(6) microorganisms per ml of cerumen suspension. in 24 pools of cerumen (33.3 per cent) the isolates were monomicrobial, staphylococcus epidermidis (12), corynebacterium spp (10), staphylococcus aureus (1) and streptococcus saprophyticum (1). in 48 pools (66.6 per cent) we found polymicrobial isolates. the most commonly isolated bacteria in these polymicrobial isolates were s. epidermidis (35) and corynebacterium spp. (43). it is noteworthy that there were  isolates of candida albicans in three cases; in one case of pseudomonas stutzeri, in one case of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and, on seven occasions, of s. aureus. the organisms isolated as common bacterial components of human cerumen in our experience were similar to those found by other authors. however, the mean count  was much higher. this could be related to climatic conditions and to the length of time the cerumen had remained in the external auditory canal.

TI  == bacteraemia in the adult intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in nottingham, uk, 1985-1996.
AB  == bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. in this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms  isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source  of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. the incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. a total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas escherichia coli (6%), enterobacter cloacae (7%), klebsiella  aerogenes (3.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. the two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). the overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of enterobacter cloacae. it is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.

TI  == detection of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia using 16s rrna gene amplification by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == episodes of fever and neutropenia are common complications of treatment for cancer. the use of prophylactic and early empirical antibiotics has reduced mortality but decreases the sensitivity of diagnostic tests based on culture. the aim of this study was to determine the potential of a broad diagnostic approach (eubacterial) based on 16s rrna gene amplification and sequencing to augment cultural methods of diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia in a regional paediatric oncology centre. one hundred eleven patient-episodes of fever and neutropenia were evaluated during the study period, 17 of which were associated with positive blood cultures, as follows: staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 6 episodes), enterococcus faecium (n = 2), streptococcus sanguis (n = 3), streptococcus mitis (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), micrococcus spp. (n = 1), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 1). eubacterial polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detected bacterial dna in nine of 11  blood culture-positive episodes for which a sample was available for pcr; the species identified by sequence analysis were identical to those derived from the  conventional identification of the cultured isolates. bacterial dna was detected  in 20 episodes (21 bacterial sequences) associated with negative blood cultures,  18 of which occurred in patients who were receiving antibiotics at the time of sample collection. the species presumptively identified by partial 16s rrna gene  sequencing were as follows: pseudomonas spp. (n = 6 episodes), acinetobacter spp. (n =5 ); escherichia spp. (n = 3); moraxella spp. (n = 3); staphylococcus spp. (n = 2); neisseria spp. (n = 1); and bacillus spp. (n = 1). the results of this study suggest that molecular techniques can augment cultural methods in the diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients who have been treated with antibiotics.

TI  == direct-exchange arthroplasty for the treatment of infection after total hip replacement. an average ten-year follow-up.
AB  == twenty consecutive patients who had a direct-exchange total hip arthroplasty, performed by one surgeon between october 1979 and july 1990, were prospectively followed and data were collected. the most common infecting organism was staphylococcus epidermidis (nine patients), followed by streptococcus species and staphylococcus aureus (five patients each). three patients (15 per cent) had a draining sinus tract at the time of the operation. the operation and the postoperative management included meticulous debridement, administration of appropriate systemic antibiotic therapy, and use of antibiotic-loaded cement. by  an average of 9.9 years (range, 3.5 to 17.1 years) postoperatively, no patient had had recurrence of the infection. two patients had a revision for aseptic loosening nine and seventeen years after the direct exchange. although the present series is relatively small, our experience has shown that direct exchange, which is associated with less morbidity and is less expensive than delayed exchange, can be successful in carefully selected patients.

TI  == evaluation of in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and comparator antimicrobial agents against worldwide clinical trial and other laboratory isolates.
AB  == this report summarizes the activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin (q/d) and appropriate comparator antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, rifampin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin, against selected gram-positive pathogens, including enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pyogenes. the study pathogens were obtained from 2 sources: (1) clinical isolates taken from patients participating in q/d worldwide phase iii comparative and noncomparative (emergency-use program) clinical trials; and (2) other isolates collected from the laboratories of 45 geographically distinct medical centers around the world. q/d was highly active, with minimum inhibitory  concentrations (mics) < or = 1.0 microg/ml against most isolates, including those known to be resistant to methicillin, vancomycin, or erythromycin. q/d was active (mics < or = 1 microg/ml) against 95% of the vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, for example, whereas ciprofloxacin was active against 6%. q/d was equally active against methicillin-susceptible or -resistant s. aureus strains (mic90=1 microg/ml), as was vancomycin (mic90=2 microg/ml), whereas ciprofloxacin was much less active against methicillin-resistant strains than against methicillin-susceptible strains (mic90=32 vs 1 microg/ml). given its spectrum of  activity, q/d may provide a viable option for the treatment of severe respiratory and skin and skin-structure infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, especially when strains with known or suspected resistance to other commonly used antibiotics are present.

TI  == molecular cloning of a 32-kilodalton lipoprotein component of a novel iron-regulated staphylococcus epidermidis abc transporter.
AB  == our previous studies identified two iron-regulated cytoplasmic membrane proteins  of 32 and 36 kda expressed by both staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus  aureus. in this study we show by triton x-114 phase partitioning and tritiated palmitic acid labelling that these proteins are lipoproteins which are anchored into the cytoplasmic membrane by their lipid-modified n termini. in common with those of some other gram-positive bacteria, these highly immunogenic lipoproteins were released from the bacterial cell into the culture supernatants, with release being promoted by growth of the bacteria under iron-restricted conditions. immunoelectron microscopy with a monospecific rabbit antiserum to the 32-kda s. epidermidis lipoprotein showed that the majority of the antigen was distributed throughout the staphylococcal cell wall. only minor quantities were detected in the cytoplasmic membrane, and exposure of the lipoprotein on the bacterial surface was minimal. a monoclonal antibody raised to the 32-kda lipoprotein of s. aureus was used in immunoblotting studies to investigate the conservation of this antigen among a variety of staphylococci. the monoclonal antibody reacted with polypeptides of 32 kda in s. epidermidis and s. aureus and of 40 kda in staphylococcus hominis. no reactivity was detected with staphylococcus lugdunensis, staphylococcus cohni, or staphylococcus haemolyticus. the gene encoding the 32-kda lipoprotein from s. epidermidis has been isolated from a lambda zap ii genomic dna library and found to be a component of an iron-regulated operon encoding a novel abc-type transporter. the operon contains  three genes, designated sita, -b, and -c, encoding an atpase, a cytoplasmic membrane protein, and the 32-kda lipoprotein, respectively. sitc shows significant homology both with a number of bacterial adhesins, including fima of  streptococcus parasanguis and scaa of streptococcus gordonii, and with lipoproteins of a recently described family of abc transporters with proven or putative metal ion transport functions. although the solute specificity of this novel transporter has not yet been determined, we speculate that it may be involved in either siderophore- or transferrin-mediated iron uptake in s. epidermidis.

TI  == management of animal bite injuries of the face: experience with 94 patients.
AB  == purpose: because of the large number of bacteria in the oral cavity, animal bite  wounds are generally contaminated, and their treatment is difficult because of the risk of infection, especially in extensive injuries. this report describes the management of a large series of patients and recommends treatment guidelines  on the basis of the results. patients and methods: ninety-four animal bite wounds on the face and head were analyzed according to the type of animal, location and  extent of the soft tissue wound, duration and type of surgical treatment, occurrence of infections and their pathogen spectrum, as well as the choice of antibiotic therapy. results: dogs caused 91% of the bite wounds. infections developed in 4 of 53 patients who underwent primary wound closure with minor edge excision and prophylactic administration of oral penicillin. without antibiotic administration, 2 of 15 patients had infections, which were treated on an outpatient basis. of 26 patients with initially delayed treatment, 18 showed clinical inflammatory symptoms with a wide spectrum of pathogens (escherichia coli, streptococcus, enterococcus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and proteus) on presentation. conclusion: extensive animal bite wounds on the face, even with soft tissue defects, should be treated according to the criteria of a esthetic reconstructive facial surgery. in view of the low infection rate, routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not justified.

TI  == mucin gene (muc 2 and muc 5ac) upregulation by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == bacterial infection of the lung is associated with mucin overproduction. in partial explanation of this phenomenon, we recently reported that supernatant from the gram-negative organism pseudomonas (p.) aeruginosa contained an activity that upregulated transcription of the muc 2 mucin gene [j.-d. li, a. dohrman, m.  gallup, s. miyata, j. gum, y. kim, j. nadel, a. prince, c. basbaum, transcriptional activation of mucin by p. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis lung disease, proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a., 94 (1997) 967-972]. the purpose of the present study was to determine whether mucin  genes other than muc 2 are so regulated and whether gram-positive organisms also  contain mucin stimulatory activity. results from in situ hybridization and rnase  protection assays showed that p. aeruginosa upregulates muc 5ac as well as muc 2  in both bronchial explants and cultured airway epithelial cells. the upregulation of both genes by p. aeruginosa can be mimicked by lipopolysaccharide (lps) and can be blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. in addition, both genes are upregulated by a variety of gram-positive as well as gram-negative organisms showing the same rank order of potency. these data indicate the existence of a general mechanism by which epithelial cells respond to the presence of bacteria by increasing mucin synthesis.

TI  == genetic and biochemical analysis of mutacin 1140, a lantibiotic from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == streptococcus mutans jh1000 and its derivatives were previously shown (j. d. hillman, k. p. johnson, and b. i. yaphe, infect. immun. 44:141-144, 1984) to produce a low-molecular-weight, broad-spectrum bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis). the thermosensitive vector ptv1-ok harboring tn917 was used to  isolate a blis-deficient mutant, dm25, and the mutated gene was recovered by shotgun cloning in escherichia coli. sequence analysis of insert dna adjacent to  tn917 led to the identification of four open reading frames including two (lana and lanb) which have substantial homology to the staphylococcus epidermidis structural gene (epia) and a modifying enzyme gene (epib) for biosynthesis of the lantibiotic epidermin, respectively. although the blis activity could not be recovered from broth cultures, high yields were obtained from a solid medium consisting of todd-hewitt broth containing 0.5% agarose that was stab inoculated  with jh1140 (a spontaneous mutant of jh1000 that produces threefold-elevated amounts of activity). agar could not substitute for agarose. chloroform extraction of the spent medium produced a fraction which yielded two major bands  on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the faster-migrating band was absent in chloroform extracts of the mutant, dm25. the  amino acid sequence of this band was determined by edman sequencing and mass spectroscopy. the results showed that it is a lantibiotic, which we have named mutacin 1140, and that the sequence corresponded to that deduced from the lana sequence. we observed a number of similarities of mutacin 1140 to epidermin and an s. mutans lantibiotic, b-ny266, but it appears to have significant differences in the positions of its thioether bridges. it also has other unique features with regard to its leader sequence and posttranslational modification. a proposed structure for mutacin 1140 is presented.

TI  == regulation of chemokine gene expression in human peripheral blood neutrophils phagocytosing microbial pathogens.
AB  == production of chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) by neutrophils is likely to be important in the regulation of inflammation and the control of infection. in this study we show that exposure of human neutrophils to various microbial pathogens leads to the production of both macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (mip-1alpha) and il-8. the bacterial microbes, salmonella typhimurium and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus all strongly induced both il-8  and mip-1alpha secretion, whereas streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, and the opportunistic yeast candida albicans were less potent. saccharomyces cerevisiae and zymosan both induced il-8 secretion but failed to stimulate that of mip-1alpha. coincubation of neutrophils with the proinflammatory cytokine tnf-alpha and the micro-organisms also led to differential expression of mip-1alpha and il-8. significant enhancement of the induction of both mip-1alpha and il-8 by s. typhimurium, p. aeruginosa, and s. pneumoniae as well as by c. albicans was observed. in contrast, while il-8 production in response to s. cerevisiae and zymosan was enhanced in the presence  of tnf-alpha, no mip-1alpha was produced. these combined results indicate that while neutrophils exposed to some micro-organisms alone or in the presence of inflammatory cytokines such as tnf-alpha will produce both mip-1alpha and il-8, resulting in generation of signals for the recruitment of mononuclear leukocytes  and neutrophils, respectively, certain types of microorganisms can skew this response toward synthesis of il-8.

TI  == in-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of cfc-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == cfc-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. the in-vitro and in-vivo activities of cfc-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. against gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, cfc-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to  sparfloxacin. against gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of cfc-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. however, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. in mouse systemic infection caused by s. aureus smith or s. aureus tms 33, cfc-222 demonstrated an activity similar  to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. the compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by streptococcus pyogenes atcc 8668. against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. the activity of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against p. aeruginosa mb4-16 in the same infection model. these results suggest that cfc-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.

TI  == results of 2-stage reimplantation for infected total knee arthroplasty.
AB  == optimum treatment of the infected total knee arthroplasty has not been clearly established. to clarify the efficacy of two-stage reimplantation, experience with 66 infected total knee arthroplasties in 64 patients who had been treated with 2-stage reimplantation total knee arthroplasty between september 1980 and october 1993 was reviewed. of these, 55 knees in 54 patients were available for follow-up examinations at an average of 61.9 months (range, 28-146 months). the initial diagnoses were rheumatoid arthritis (14 knees) and osteoarthritis (41 knees). reimplantation was successful in 80.0% of knees with low-virulence organisms (coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus), 71.4% with polymicrobial organisms, and 66.7% with high-virulence organisms (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus). reimplantation was successful in 82% of patients with osteoarthritis and in 54% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (p = .024). the success rate was 92% if infection occurred after primary arthroplasty but only 41% if after multiple previous knee operations (arthroscopy, osteotomy, or revision total knee arthroplasty) (p < .001).

TI  == [genotyping of isolates of bacteria and candida].
AB  == strain differentiation of staphylococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, and candida species was performed by restriction endonuclease analysis (rea) of genomic dna with hinfi or haeiii followed by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. rea of 19 methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates and 19 methicillin-susceptible s. aureus isolates revealed 8, and 14 patterns, respectively. fifty-three isolates of s. epidermidis were divided into 39 groups on the basis of rea pattern. rea patterns obtained from different strains of the same species were more similar than those  from different staphylococcus species. a total of 67 patterns were noted among 215 s. pneumoniae isolates. there was some correlation between the rea patterns and serotypes. in addition, all 61 isolates showing the pattern 6 (serotype 19) were penicillin-resistant. sixteen isolates of e. coli o157 and 18 isolates of e. coli o25 were analyzed by rea with haeiii. among 14 epidemiologically unrelated e. coli o157:h7 isolates, rea patterns were either identical or differed only by  a few fragment bands. rea patterns of 7 isolates of heat stable enterotoxin producing e. coli o25 from an outbreak were identical. eight distinct rea patterns were noted among 7 toxigenic c. difficile strains, and one to two strains were included in each group. candida strains belonging to different six candida species were analysed by rea. all c. albicans isolates (148 strains) showed one to four bright bands ranging from 4 to 8kb in size, and these strains  were divided into 37 groups according to the rea patterns. each candida strain showed species-specific rea patterns. twenty-one isolates of mycobacterium tuberculosis complex were analyzed by pcr with primer complementary to the inverted repeat of is6110(is6110-pcr). the results of pcr of 19 m. tuberculosis isolates and 2 m. bovis bcg isolates revealed 15 patterns, and 1 pattern, respectively. our results demonstrated that rea of genomic dna with hinfi or haeiii was a useful tool for strain differentiation. by comparing the species-specific rea patterns of reference strains, clinical isolates of candida  and staphylococci could be identified to the species level if they could not be identified by routine biochemical methods. because is6110-pcr is simple and rapid to perform, it seems to be a good screening method to differentiate m. tuberculosis strains.

TI  == occurrence of peptidyl d-amino acids in soluble fractions of several eubacteria,  archaea and eukaryotes.
AB  == the occurrence of peptidyl d-amino acids in the aqueous soluble fractions was investigated in various eubacteria, some archaea and some eukaryotes. the contents of the d-enantiomers of serine, alanine, proline, glutamate (glutamine), aspartate (asparagine) and phenylalanine were determined with cell- and tissue-extracts, by means of acid hydrolysis and high-performance liquid chromatography. the rate of d-enantiomer (%, the ratio in molar concentration of  a d-amino acid to the total of the d-amino acid and the corresponding l-amino acid) of alanine and glutamate were high in some gram-positive eubacteria: 11.7%  in staphylococcus epidermidis and 10.3% in streptococcus pyogenes for alanine, and 22.3% for glutamate in bacillus yn-1. the d-glutamate content was also high (8.0%) in the gram-negative eubacterium, thiobacillus ferrooxidans. d-aspartate was common, as was d-glutamate: the highest d-aspartate content was detected in an archaeum, pyrobaculum islandicum (4.0%). however, the content of d-aspartate was low, 0.2-1.8% in most other bacteria. the presence of d-serine was shown in some organisms, but that of d-proline was scarce. the d-enantiomer of phenylalanine was not detected in any of the organisms examined. these results indicate that of the bacteria examined herein most gram-negative and some gram-positive eubacteria, as well as archaea contain only low levels of d-amino acids in the soluble peptidyl fraction, and the levels were comparable to those in eukaryotes examined. to our knowledge, the general presence of peptidyl d-amino acids in these organisms, especially archaea and eukaryotic cells including those from rat liver tissues, has been shown here for the first time.

TI  == abiotrophia elegans sp. nov., a possible pathogen in patients with culture-negative endocarditis.
AB  == we isolated a hitherto undescribed microorganism from a patient with endocarditis. the microscopic appearance, a negative catalase reaction, and growth as satellite colonies next to staphylococcus epidermidis suggested that this microorganism is a member of the genus abiotrophia, formerly known as nutritionally variant streptococci. however, the clinical isolate described herein differed markedly from the known abiotrophia spp., a. adiacens and a. defectiva, in terms of its (i) biochemical properties, (ii) restricted growth temperature range, (iii) whole-cell lysate polypeptide profile, and (iv) unique nutritional requirements. in contrast to the type strains of a. adiacens and a. defectiva, which used l-cysteine and pyridoxal hydrochloride as growth factors, the growth of the clinical isolate was only supported by l-cysteine hydrochloride and not by pyridoxal hydrochloride when the organism was tested in todd-hewitt or casein-soy peptone broth. comparative 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed that the microorganism was a member of the genus abiotrophia and was most closely related to a. adiacens (96.9% homology). phenotypic and phylogenetic data are consistent with the assumption of a new species within the genus abiotrophia, for which we propose the name abiotrophia elegans sp. nov. the unique nutritional requirements of this strain are of importance for diagnostic laboratories. the media of blood culture systems supplemented only with pyridoxal hydrochloride as  a growth factor may fail to promote the growth of a. elegans sp. nov., and thus,  these systems might not detect this microorganism as a possible cause of endocarditis.

TI  == detection of erythromycin resistant methylase gene by the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) protocol was developed that could specifically  amplify a 520-bp region of the erythromycin resistant methylase (ermc) gene sequence. the identity of the pcr-amplified 520-bp dna was confirmed by hincii endonuclease restriction digestion, which produced the predicted 440-bp and 80-bp dna fragments. a 20-mer (alpha-32p) oligonucleotide probe specifically hybridized with these amplified products confirming the specificity and reliability of this  diagnostic assay. the assay could detect the ermc gene in bacterial suspensions containing as few as 10(3) cells ml-1. the assay was used to detect the presence  of the ermc gene in several gram-positive bacterial strains identified as streptococcus sp., staphylococcus sp., micrococcus sp., lactobacillus sp. and enterococcus sp., isolated from water samples maintained in experimental animal cages and clinical sources. only bacteria identified as staphylococcus sp. were resistant to the antibiotic. although 17 strains of staphylococcus sp. isolated from clinical samples were resistant to erythromycin, only seven of these isolates tested positive for the presence of the ermc gene. of these strains, five were identified as coagulase-positive s. aureus and the rest were identified as coagulase-negative s. epidermidis. the erythromycin resistance in all seven ermc positive isolates was constitutive. the entire diagnostic assay, including template preparation, amplification and electrophoresis can be completed within 6 h.

TI  == role of monocytes and bacteria in staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis.
AB  == the endocardial vegetation which is formed in the course of bacterial endocarditis (be) contains tissue factor (tf)-dependent procoagulant activity. earlier studies showed that monocytes are the main source of tf in the vegetations. the tf activity (tfa) of vegetations isolated from streptococcus sanguis-infected rabbits depended on the numbers of bacteria as well as monocytes in the vegetation. in this study, we investigated whether for staphylococcus epidermidis, a frequent pathogen in be, an effect similar to that found for s. sanguis could be shown. in vitro, s. epidermidis was found to stimulate tfa of fibrin adherent monocytes significantly. this stimulation was maximal at a bacterium-to-monocyte ratio of 7. in vivo, tfa was found to be significantly higher in s. epidermidis-infected than in sterile catheter-induced vegetations. reduction of vegetational bacterial numbers by teicoplanin treatment lead to a small but significant decrease of tfa. reduction of monocyte numbers by etoposide did not affect vegetational tfa. comparison of data for s. epidermidis and s. sanguis revealed that at equivalent bacterial numbers, vegetational tfas were approximately the same for both microorganisms. combining the results of the present study with those of a previous study using s. sanguis, we conclude that the main factor determining monocyte-dependent vegetational tfa is the number of  vegetation-associated bacteria. the lower tfa found for s. epidermidis-infected than for s. sanguis-infected vegetations can be explained by the significantly lower bacterial numbers in the infected vegetations and consequently a lower stimulation of vegetation-associated monocytes.

TI  == bacterial and ureaplasma colonization of the airway: radiologic findings in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == objective: we designed this retrospective study to compare radiologic findings in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) in whom gram-positive cocci (gpc), gram-negative bacilli (gnb), or ureaplasma urealyticum were colonized. another objective was to correlate the radiologic findings of these patients with the clinical severity of bpd. study design: we correlated serial tracheal aspirates with radiographic findings from 183 infants whose birth weight was < or = 1250 gm. bpd severity was assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (36 w pca) and at the time of discharge. two radiologists independently scored films taken at birth and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of life. results: of the study population, 55% were male and 35% were black; 80% received surfactant and 69% received dexamethasone; 91% survived. gpc isolates from throat cultures were mainly staphylococcus [corrected] epidermidis and streptococcus haemolyticus. a superimposed gnb colonization was present in 37% of these infants. most common isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli. sepsis caused by gpc developed in 16% of all patients; 7% had sepsis caused by gnb. infants infected with gnb remained receiving oxygen at 36 w pca and at the time of discharge twice as often as those noninfected. radiologic findings: hyperinflation, interstitial changes, and generalized or localized emphysema were prominent features throughout. mean radiologic scores increased over time in a pattern similar among gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum infected and noninfected infants. high radiologic scores were not predictive at any time of infants who needed supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 w pca. infants infected with u. urealyticum were neither clinically nor radiologically different than noncolonized neonates. conclusion: gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum airway colonization is not associated with particular radiographic changes at any time. gnb-infected infants had the most severe bpd course, and yet they were radiologically indistinguishable from the other patients. u. urealyticum colonization does not result in more clinically severe bpd or demonstrate a unique radiologic course.

TI  == bacterial growth in human vitreous humor.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of human vitreous to support bacterial growth and to show differences in the growth kinetics of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. vitreous gel of 70 keratoplasty donor eyes was sampled under sterile conditions, screened microscopically for cellular  components and tested for sterility and levels of antibiotic drugs by bio-assay.  the samples were inoculated with clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus viridans and streptococcus pyogenes. as control each strain was added both to 0.9% sodium chloride solution and to mueller-hinton broth. in order to determine bacterial growth the number of colony forming units was determined 4, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hr after inoculation by viable count. vitreous gel did not support bacterial growth; the tested strains could not be recovered after 48 hr.  similar results could be obtained with sodium chloride; whereas in mueller hinton broth the strains showed normal pattern of growth. it seems that vitreous humor has inherent antibacterial capacity in vitro, although the responsible factors remain unknown.

AB  == rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. the components of rp 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci. rp 59,500 was active against a wide range of gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant s. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. rp 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus agalactiae and moraxella catarrhalis. rp 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium strains which  are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. no cross-resistance was observed between rp 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. the effect of human serum on the mic of rp 59,500 was studied with strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. faecalis. the presence of 20% (v/v) serum had little or no effect on the mic, although 50% (v/v) serum increased mics by 4-8 folds. laboratory-induced resistance to rp 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. population analysis was performed on rp 59,500 and the reference macrolides against s. aureus atcc 25,923 strain. although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with em, cam, azm and rxm, no rp 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.

AB  == new pyrrolidine derivatives, which bear an alkyloxime substituent in the 4-position and an aminomethyl substituent in the 3-position of the pyrrolidine ring, have been synthesized and coupled with various quinolinecarboxylic acids to produce a series of new fluoroquinolone antibacterials. these fluoroquinolones were found to possess potent antimicrobial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). variations at the c-8 position of the quinolone nucleus included fluorine, chlorine, nitrogen, methoxy, and hydrogen atom substitution. the activity imparted to the substituted quinolone nucleus by the c-8 substituent was in the order f (c5-nh2) > f (c5-h) > naphthyridine > cl = ome = h against gram-positive organisms. in the case of gram-negative strains, activity was in the order f (c5-nh2) > naphthyridine = f (c5-h) > h > cl > ome. the advantages provided by the newly introduced oxime group of the quinolones were clearly demonstrated by their comparison to a desoximino compound 30. in addition, the oxime moiety greatly improved the pharmacokinetic parameters of the novel quinolones. among these compounds, compound 20 (lb20304) showed the best in vivo  efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile in animals, as well as good physical properties. the mics (microgram/ml) of lb20304, compound 30, and ciprofloxacin against several test organisms are as follows: s. aureus 6538p (0.008, 0.031, and 0.13), methicillin resistant s. aureus 241 (4, 16, and 128), streptococcus epidermidis 887e (0.008, 0.016, and 0.13), methicillin resistant s. epidermidis 178 (4, 32, and 128), enterococcus faecalis 29212 (0.063, 0.13, and 1), pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e (0.25, 0.5, and 0.13), escherichia coli 3190y (0.008, 0.016, and 0.008), enterobacter cloacae p99 (0.008, 0.031, and 0.008), actinobacter calcoaceticus 15473 (0.063, 0.13, and 0.25). on the basis of these promising results, lb20304 was selected as a candidate for further evaluation.

AB  == ly333328 is a semisynthetic n-alkyl derivative of ly264826, a naturally occurring structural analog of vancomycin. ly333328 was evaluated for its in vitro inhibitory and bactericidal activities in comparison with those of the two currently available glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin). glycopeptide-susceptible test strains included a total of 311 isolates (most of clinical origin) from the genera staphylococcus, enterococcus, streptococcus, aerococcus, gemella, lactococcus, listeria, corynebacterium, and clostridium. test strains resistant or intermediate to vancomycin and/or teicoplanin included  56 clinical isolates of enterococcus (of the vana, vanb, and vanc phenotypes) and 32 clinical isolates of staphylococcus (s. haemolyticus, s. epidermidis, and s. aureus), 31 strains of gram-positive genera outside the spectrum of activity of vancomycin (leuconostoc, pediococcus, lactobacillus, and erysipelothrix), and laboratory-derived organisms obtained after exposure of susceptible staphylococcus isolates to teicoplanin (6 strains) or laboratory-derived organisms with resistance determinants received from vana enterococci (2 enterococcus and 25 listeria transconjugants). ly333328 was highly active against staphylococci, enterococci, and listeriae (whether they were clinical or laboratory-derived strains) resistant to the currently available glycopeptides. in particular, the mics of ly333328 did not vary substantially between teicoplanin-susceptible and teicoplanin-resistant staphylococci and between vancomycin-susceptible and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. ly333328 demonstrated fairly good inhibitory activity even against most strains of leuconostoc, pediococcus, and erysipelothrix (mic range, 1 to 8 microg/ml), whereas it proved less active (although much more active than vancomycin or teicoplanin) against lactobacillus strains. in minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) and time-kill studies, ly333328 demonstrated excellent bactericidal activity; enterococci, in particular, which were largely tolerant of vancomycin and teicoplanin, were uniformly killed by ly333328, with mbc-to-mic ratios of 4 to 8 for most vancomycin-susceptible and vancomycin-resistant strains. in attempts to select for resistant clones, no survivors stably growing in the presence of 10 microg of ly333328 per ml were obtained from the staphylococcus and enterococcus test strains exposed to the drug.

AB  == model biofilms of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas  fluorescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were made on steel and polypropylene substrata. plaque-resembling biofilms of streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and fusobacterium nucleatum were made on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite.  the activity of enzymes against bacterial cells in biofilm was measured by fluorescence microscopy and an indirect conductance test in which evolution of carbon dioxide was measured. glucose oxidase combined with lactoperoxidase was bactericidal against biofilm bacteria but did not remove the biofilm from the substrata. a complex mixture of polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes was able to remove bacterial biofilm from steel and polypropylene substrata but did not have  a significant bactericidal activity. combining oxidoreductases with polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes resulted in bactericidal activity as well as removal of the biofilm.

TI  == use of the isolator 1.5 microbial tube for culture of synovial fluid from patients with septic arthritis.
AB  == synovial fluid specimens obtained from patients with arthritis were plated onto solid media (conventional cultures) or inoculated into an isolator 1.5 microbial  tube (isolator cultures), and the yield and time to detection of organisms were compared. overall, 144 specimens obtained from 137 patients were processed, and 31 (21.5%) cultures obtained from 29 patients were positive by at least one method. staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 12 patients, streptococcus pneumoniae and kingella kingae were isolated from 4 patients each, group g streptococci were isolated from 3 patients, staphylococcus epidermidis and members of the family enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 2 patients each, and  streptococcus mitis and peptostreptococcus prevotii were isolated from 1 patient  each. overall, the causative organism was detected in 31 of 31 (100.0%) isolator  cultures and 24 of 31 (77.4%) conventional cultures (p < 0.02). twenty-nine of 31 (93.5%) positive isolator cultures and 20 of 24 (83.3%) conventional cultures were positive by the second day of incubation. among the 24 cultures positive by  both methods, higher numbers of cfu per milliliter were detected with the isolator system in 13 cultures and with conventional cultures in 2 cultures (p <  0.002). inoculation of synovial fluid into an isolator 1.5 microbial tube improves the recovery of organisms causing septic arthritis.

TI  == efficacy and safety of vancomycin constant-rate infusion in the treatment of chronic gram-positive bone and joint infections.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vancomycin constant-rate infusion over 24 h in the treatment of gram-positive bone infections, methods: vancomycin (40 mg/kg/day) was administered without a loading dose to 15 patients  (12 male, three female) aged 23--90 years, weighing 46--85 kg, with postoperative chronic bone and joint infections. the 24-h dose was adjusted to maintain plasma  levels between 25 and 35 mg/l. mean duration of therapy was 6.2 months (4--8.5) via a portable infusion pump. sites of infection included hip and femur (10), tibia (three), patella (one) and vertebrae (one). sequestrectomy (two), removal of material (7/8 prosthetic hips, 1/5 metal implants) and debridement (two) were  performed at the beginning of the treatment. involved bacteria included staphylococcus aureus (eight, six methicillin resistant), s. epidermidis (four methicillin-resistant), enterococcus faecalis (one), enterococcus avium (one) and streptococcus bovis (one). results: mic of vancomycin ranged from 1 to 4 mg/l. the mean vancomycin bone concentration when available was 67.7plus minus38.9 microg/l. based on a mean post-treatment follow-up of 14plus minus4 months (6--20.6), cure was achieved in 10 patients (66.6%). failures were related to the inability to remove the infected prosthesis (one) or implants (three) and to the  persistence of a deep wound abcess (one). adverse events included pruritus (four  cases), tinnitus (two), mild transient elevation of creatinine level (three) and  transient neutropenia (two). vancomycin was maintained in all the patients. conclusions: prolonged treatment with vancomycin constant-rate infusion is effective and safe for treatment of gram-positive chronic bone and joint infections, providing that complete surgical debridement and prosthetic material  removal are performed.

TI  == a review of the in vitro activity of meropenem and comparative antimicrobial agents tested against 30,254 aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated world wide.
AB  == the in vitro activity of meropenem (formerly sm-7738), a new carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem and five other broad-spectrum antimicrobials (ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin) against 30,254 clinically significant pathogens isolated in nine countries worldwide. overall, the carbapenems, meropenem and imipenem, were the most active drugs. meropenem was four- to 64-fold more active than imipenem against gram-negative bacteria, including the enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. meropenem was also quite active against ceftazidime-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting 87.5 to 100% at < or = 4 micrograms/ml. in contrast, imipenem was four- to eight-fold more active than meropenem against  gram-positive species, including methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis. among the anaerobes, strains resistant to meropenem or imipenem were encountered very rarely. these extensive data provide additional in vitro support for the clinical use of meropenem as a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent active against key pathogenic species of bacteria.

TI  == cerebrospinal fluid broth culture isolates: their significance for antibiotic treatment.
AB  == enriched broth medium is routinely used as a supplement for agar plate culture of cerebrospinal fluid (csf). to assess the clinical utility of broth cultures, 151  consecutive csf bacterial and fungal isolates obtained from 91 patients were retrospectively reviewed for the effect of results on treatment. treatment decisions associated with individual csf specimens for which isolates were recovered from thioglycollate broth only were compared with the treatment decisions associated with csf specimens for which isolates were recovered by agar plate culture. treatment was defined as initiation of or change in antimicrobial  therapy based on the reporting of csf culture isolates. thirty-six (24%) of the 151 isolates were recovered in broth only. three (8%) of these 36 isolates (from  34 patients) resulted in treatment with antimicrobial agents; however, 2 of the 3 treated isolates (candida tropicalis, proteus mirabilis) were recovered from a second csf specimen in agar plate culture within 24 hours. thus, only a single isolate (3%; staphylococcus epidermidis) was treated based solely on a positive broth culture result. in contrast, 60 (52%) of the 115 isolates recovered in agar plate culture from 23 (40%) of 57 patients were treated (staphylococci, 28; gram-negative bacilli, 14; cryptococcus neoformans, 10; streptococcus pneumoniae, 3; streptococcus sanguis, 1; other, 4). we conclude that treatment with antimicrobial agents based on isolates recovered from csf specimens in broth culture alone is infrequent and infer from the data that the use of csf broth cultures contributes little to treatment decisions.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of roxithromycin against recently obtained clinical isolates].
AB  == the purpose of our investigation was to monitor current trends in the susceptibility patterns of clinical bacterial isolates to roxithromycin (rxm). we measured the mics of macrolide antibiotics, such as rxm, erythromycin (em), clarithromycin (cam), rokitamycin (rkm) and midecamycin (mdm), and other classes  of antibacterial compounds against various clinical isolates at seven institutions between october and december in 1994 and 1995. rxm had excellent antibacterial activities for s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, m. (b.) catarrhalis and  methicillin sensitive s. aureus. against methicillin sensitive s. epidermidis, rxm activity was fairly good but about 20% of the strains had mic > or = 128 micrograms/ml. the activity against s. pneumoniae was not so potent and similar to activities of em, cam, mdm, and clindamycin. the vast majority of methicillin  resistant s. aureus and s. epidermidis were also resistant to macrolide antibiotics and other classes of compounds tested. in conclusion, rxm is an unique macrolide antibiotic by retaining potent activity against s. pyogenes, s.  agalactiae, s. aureus except mrsa, m. (b.) catarrhalis and m. pneumoniae.

AB  == the presence of aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria on the surface of pacifiers used by children with acute otitis media was investigated. the surface  of 40 recently used pacifiers was swabbed after they were allowed to dry for five to six minutes. the swabs were processed quantitatively for the presence of aerobic bacteria. the antibacterial activity of the pacifier material was tested  in vitro. microorganisms were isolated from 21 (52.5 per cent) pacifiers. the number of colonies per pacifier varied between one and 35 (average six). the isolates included eight alpha-haemolytic streptococci, six staphylococcus epidermis, five candida albicans, five alpha-haemolytic streptococci, three neisseria spp. and two staphylococcus aureus. the pacifier material was shown to  be inhibitory against s. aureus. this study illustrated that pacifiers do not contain high numbers of organisms and therefore are not likely to serve as a source of persistence of transfer of organisms.

TI  == contamination of diagnostic ophthalmic solutions in primary eye care settings.
AB  == pharmaceutical agents and irrigating solutions are widely used in both optometric and ophthalmologic practices. contamination of these containers or solutions could possibly pose some risk of infection to a patient. we set out to investigate the possible contamination of a representative sample of these containers in small office practices. representative bottles of two diagnostic pharmaceutical agents and an irrigating solution were obtained from primary care  optometric and ophthalmologic practices in the san francisco-oakland bay area. these bottles were tested to investigate the rate of contamination and to identify the types of microorganisms in the contaminated solutions. sixty total samples (proparacaine, tropicamide, and an irrigating solution) were randomly cultured, and 11.7% of the samples showed contamination. pseudomonas cepacia, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas putida, and streptococcus species were the predominant organisms isolated from the contaminated bottles. in addition, 17 of the original 60 containers were further cultured for investigation of the dried residue particles around the threads of the containers. of these 17 containers, 13 (76.5%) tested positive for staphylococcus and micrococcus species.

TI  == comparison of the indigenous oral microbiota and immunoglobulin responses of athymic (nu/nu) and euthymic (nu/+) mice.
AB  == the role of the immune system in the homeostasis of indigenous oral bacterial populations is poorly understood. in this study, we compared the evolution of the indigenous oral microbiota of specific pathogen-free athymic nude (nu/nu) balb/c  mice with that of their corresponding phenotypically normal (nu/-) littermates. we also evaluated corresponding salivary and serum antibody activities (iga and igg) against the predominant indigenous oral bacteria. the bacterial species recovered from the two mouse strains were lactobacillus murinus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus oralis and staphylococcus epidermidis. from 27 days of age, nu/+ and nu/nu mice had significantly different proportions of oral bacterial populations. when the microbiota stabilized (at 40 days of age), the total cultivable microbiota of nu/+ mice was dominated by l. murinus (65-85%), while that of nu/nu mice was dominated by e. faecalis (40-60%). the precise factors that alter the oral resident microbiota in nu/nu mice are unknown. we found that total salivary iga levels were significantly lower in nu/nu mice, but  no association were observed between the level of salivary iga antibody against indigenous bacteria and the proportion of these indigenous bacteria in the oral microbiota. the change in the microbiota of nude mice may have been caused by other factors such as defects in other immune functions or cold stress.

TI  == blebitis, early endophthalmitis, and late endophthalmitis after glaucoma-filtering surgery.
AB  == purpose: the differentiating characteristics in blebitis and early and late endophthalmitis after glaucoma filtration surgery are reviewed. methods: all admission records and operative reports, as well as available office notes, on patients with blebitis or bleb-associated endophthalmitis admitted to a large referral eye center from 1985 to 1995 were reviewed retrospectively. results: ten cases of blebitis and 33 cases of bleb-associated endophthalmitis were identified. one patient with blebitis progressed to culture-positive endophthalmitis. of the 33 cases of bleb-associated endophthalmitis, there were 6 cases of early endophthalmitis (before postoperative week 6) and 27 cases of late endophthalmitis. in early endophthalmitis, staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated on vitreous culture in 4 (67%) of 6 cases, whereas in late endophthalmitis, this organism was isolated in only 1 (4%) of 27 cases. in the 27 late cases, streptococcus species and gram-negative organisms comprised 48% of isolates; of 33 cases of endophthalmitis, 15 (45%) demonstrated no growth on vitreous culture. patients with endophthalmitis fared more poorly than those with blebitis in terms of visual outcome. conclusions: because blebitis may be prodromal to endophthalmitis, aggressive antimicrobial therapy, perhaps with oral quinolones, is warranted. in addition, patients with blebitis should be observed  closely to identify extension into the vitreous cavity so that intravitreous antibiotics can be administered in a timely fashion. finally, clinicians should not extrapolate the results of the endophthalmitis vitrectomy study to the postfiltration surgery endophthalmitis given the differing pathogenesis and unique spectrum of organisms.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of du-6681a, a parent compound of dz-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. mics at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (mic90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. du-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and mic90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, respectively. mic90s of du-6681a  were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mic50 and mic90 of du-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. du-6681a  activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) cfu), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. the frequency of spontaneous resistance to du-6681a was less  than or equal to those of the reference compounds. time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of du-6681a against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and h. influenzae.

TI  == in-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new water-soluble streptogramin antimicrobial agent comprising quinupristin and dalfopristin in a ratio of 30:70. the in-vitro  spectrum of activity includes most multi-resistant gram-positive aerobes, important gram-negative aerobes, gram-positive anaerobes and intracellular bacteria that are causal agents of respiratory, blood and cutaneous infections. of particular note, quinupristin/dalfopristin is active against multidrug-resistant isolates of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecium, and against penicillin-resistant and/or erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the combination is also active against staphylococci showing both constitutive and inducible erythromycin resistance. bactericidal activity and a prolonged post-antibiotic effect have also been noted for quinupristin/dalfopristin against gram-positive cocci. gram-negative bacteria susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin include moraxella catarrhalis, legionella spp. and mycoplasma spp. overall, the spectrum of antibacterial activity indicates a potential role for this combination in the treatment of difficult-to-treat gram-positive infections, including those caused  by multidrug-resistant organisms. since this activity extends to gram-negative respiratory bacteria, quinupristin/dalfopristin may also find a role in the treatment of atypical, as well as typical, pneumonia.

TI  == antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to rp 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. in studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and rp 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference mic and mbc tests. no significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/rp 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and streptococcus ssp.  enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but e. faecalis, pasteurella multocida, pediococcus ssp., haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (mic90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). the log phase inoculum was preferred for mbc and kill-curve tests with this combination. the 30:70 ratio in  vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to  predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant e. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.

AB  == milk samples were collected from 180 heifers from 20 herds around parturition to  study the prevalence and persistence of intramammary infection (imi). a total of  3382 quarter milk samples was collected each week from 4 wk before parturition to 4 wk after parturition. staphylococcus chromogenes, the most commonly found bacterial species before parturition, was isolated from 15% of all quarters. however, imi with staph. chromogenes decreased shortly after parturition to around 1% of quarters. infectious with staphylococcus simulans and staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in 1 to 3% of quarters both before and after parturition. infections with staph. simulans persisted in the same quarter for several weeks,  but imi with staph. epidermidis were transient. streptococcus dysgalactiae was isolated from 4 to 6% of quarters before and immediately after parturition, but the prevalence of imi with strep. dysgalactiae decreased. a strong association existed between imi with strep. dysgalactiae before parturition and imi with strep. dysgalactiae after parturition, and, using dna typing, the persistence of  9 imi was confirmed. infections with staphylococcus aureus rarely occurred before parturition, but the rate of imi with staph. aureus greatly increased during the  1st wk after parturition. no association was found between bacterial status before parturition and imi with staph. aureus after parturition. overall, the presence of bacterial imi in a quarter before parturition increased the risk of imi for the lactating cow. this study demonstrated that variability in prevalence and duration of imi according to bacterial species occurred around first parturition.

TI  == role of coagulase in a murine model of hematogenous pulmonary infection induced by intravenous injection of staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads.
AB  == we describe a novel mouse model of acute staphylococcal pneumonia induced by intravenous injection of staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads. for comparison, we also used various strains of bacteria, including three strains of  s. aureus, two strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, one strain of streptococcus pyogenes, three strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one strain of klebsiella pneumoniae. all except two strains of s. aureus were cleared rapidly from the lungs. when s. aureus numr1 enmeshed in agar beads was injected intravenously, the organisms concentrated and remained in the lung for a period longer than several weeks. multiple lung abscesses were evident macroscopically, and histological examination of the infected lung showed multiple lung abscesses around the pulmonary arterioles, consisting of bacterial colonies encircled with  fibrin filaments and surrounded by inflammatory cells of neutrophils and macrophages. when 14 strains of clinically isolated s. aureus were injected intravenously, the number of bacteria recovered from the lung tissue 7 days after infection correlated with the titer of staphylocoagulase (p < 0.01) but not with  the titer of clumping factor. injection of coagulase-deficient mutant strain du5843 was associated with a markedly reduced number of viable bacteria isolated  from the lung, compared with its coagulase-positive parental strain du5789. our results suggest that coagulase may play a role in the development of blood-borne  staphylococcal pneumonia in our model. our animal model is simple and reproducible and resembles blood-borne staphylococcal pneumonia in humans, and it could be useful for investigating the pathogenicity or treatment of staphylococcal pulmonary infection, including infections with methicillin-resistant s. aureus.

TI  == the interaction of phospholipid liposomes with bacteria and their use in the delivery of bactericides.
AB  == liposomes have been prepared from dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (dppc) incorporating the cationic lipids stearylamine (sa), dimethyldioctadecylammonium  bromide (ddab) and dimethylaminoethane carbamoyl cholesterol (dcchol) and the anionic lipids dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (dppg) and phosphatidylinositol (pi). their adsorption to biofilms of skin-associated bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis and proteus vulgaris) and oral bacteria (streptococcus mutans and sanguis) has been investigated as a function of mole % cationic and anionic lipid. targeting (adsorption) was most effective for the systems dppc-chol-sa, dppc-dppg and dppc-pi liposomes to s. epidermidis. the effect of extracellular mucopolysaccharide on targeting was investigated for s. epidermidis biofilms. it  was found that targeting increased with the level of extracellular mucopolysaccharide for all liposome compositions studied. the delivery of the oil-soluble bactericide triclosan and the water soluble bactericide chlorhexidine was studied for a number of liposomal compositions. superior delivery of both bactericides relative to the free bactericide occurred for dppc-chol-sa liposomes and for triclosan delivery by dppc-dppg and dppc-pi liposomes targeted to s. epidermidis at low bactericide concentrations. dppc-chol-sa liposomes were also effective for delivery of triclosan to s. sanguis biofilms. double labelling experiments using [14c]-chlorhexidine and [3h]-dppc suggested that there was exchange between adsorbed liposomes which had delivered bactericide to the biofilm and those in the bulk solution implying a diffusion mechanism for bactericide delivery.

TI  == penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humours  of patients by different topical application modes.
AB  == objective: a prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humour. methods: two hundred and twenty-four patients undergoing cataract extraction received 0.3% ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin or ofloxacin eye drops by two different  administration modes with different frequencies and intervals of application. at  the beginning of cataract extraction (0.5-3 h after the last drop), 50-100 microliters aqueous fluid was aspirated from the anterior chamber and immediately stored at -80 degrees c. antibiotic concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: generally, topical ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin yielded aqueous humour levels higher than topical norfloxacin. the  highest concentrations of all tested fluoroquinolones were measured after using an application mode, in which one drop was given every 15 min between 0600 hours  and 0800 hours, prior to operation. when applied by this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 0.380 (+/- 0.328) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.033-1.388 micrograms.ml-1), norfloxacin 0.182 (0.118) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.038-0.480 microgram.ml-1) and ofloxacin 0.564 (0.372) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.064-1.455 micrograms.ml-1). these mean concentrations were above the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90), concentrations required for inhibition of 90% of pathogen strains in vitro of gram-negative bacteria, such as proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. therapeutic values above the mic90 of staphylococcus epidermidis, the pathogen causing eye infections most frequently, were reached by 67.5% of patients after ofloxacin and by 41% after ciprofloxacin, but never after norfloxacin treatment. conclusion: of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humour concentration. this fluoroquinolone may be an useful ophthalmic agent for topical antibacterial  management, but it does not seem to be prophylactically effective against streptococcus pneumoniae or pseudomanas aeruginosa.

TI  == [development of resistance to difuracil (pap-49) in bacteria and its activity in  combination with other antibacterial drugs].
AB  == possible increasing of resistance to difuracil or n-(5-nitrofurfuryliden)-5-nitrofuran-2-(n'-acetyl) carboxamidohydrazon (pap-49) in staphylococcus sp., streptococcus sp. and escherichia coli was studied and the level of the resistance increasing was determined by the method of 30-fold passage of the cultures in subbacteriostatic concentrations of the drug. it was shown in vitro that the increase of the resistance to the new nitrofuran was insignificant. the most intensive adaptation was observed during the first 10 passages. during the following 10-15 passages the susceptibility level remained unchanged (e.coli) or was even somewhat higher (s. aureus and streptococcus sp.). after that a new increase of the resistance was observed. the most marked changes in the susceptibility were detected in streptococcus sp. and the least marked in  staphylococcus sp. and e.coli. combinations of difuracil in subbacteriostatic concentrations with various antibacterial drugs provided both additive and synergistic effects with respect to s.epidermidis, s. pneumonase, e.coli and p.mirabilis. the most active combinations were those of difuracil with aminoglycoside antibiotics, penicillins or chloramphenicol.

TI  == bacteriology of lacrimal duct obstruction in adults.
AB  == aims: to determine the current bacteriology of lacrimal duct obstruction (ldo) and to relate the bacteriological findings to the type of symptoms. methods: 127  samples were obtained from the lacrimal sac in 118 consecutive adult patients with ldo, including nine bilateral cases. results: altogether, 156 isolates were  recovered from the 127 samples cultured. cultures were positive from 84% of the samples. gram positive bacteria were isolated in 79 (62%) samples. the most frequently cultured bacterial species was staphylococcus epidermidis, representing 27% of the isolates. gram negative bacteria were recovered from 26 (20%) samples, and these bacteria were statistically significantly more common in cases with copious discharge than in cases with minor discharge (p = 0.000). cases with simple stenosis of the lacrimal duct (ssld) showed significantly less  streptococcus sp (p = 0.004) and gram negative organisms (p = 0.004) than those with chronic dacryocystitis. conclusion: the bacteriology of ssld resembles that  of normal conjunctival flora. chronic dacryocystitis in adults is associated with an increased proportion of gram negative bacteria which may be a reservoir for postoperative intraocular infection. they should also be taken into account in selecting antimicrobial prophylaxis in lacrimal drainage surgery.

TI  == the treatment of patients with infected implantable cardioverter-defibrillator systems.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the treatment of patients with infected implantable cardioverter-defibrillator systems. methods: retrospective analysis was done of the cases of 21 patients treated for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator infection during an 11-year period. results: of 723 cardioverter-defibrillator implantations (550 primary implants, 173 replacements), nine (1.2%) were complicated by early postoperative device-related infections. late infections developed in two patients 19 and 22 months, respectively, after implantation. ten other patients were transferred to  our institution for treatment of cardioverter-defibrillator infection. the time from implantation to overt infection was 2.2 +/- 1.3 months, excluding the two late infections. the responsible organisms were staphylococcus aureus (9), staphylococcus epidermidis (6), streptococcus hemolyticus (1), gram-negative bacteria (3), candida albicans (1), and corynebacterium (1). all patients were treated with intravenous antibiotic drugs. total system removal was done in 15 patients and partial removal in 2; in 4, the cardioverter-defibrillator system was not explanted. there were no perioperative deaths. a new implantable cardioverter-defibrillator system was reimplanted in 7 patients after 2 to 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy. ten patients were treated without reimplantation (2  arrhythmia operation, 8 antiarrhythmic drugs). four patients (3 patients without  explantation and 1 with partial system removal) were treated with maintenance long-term antibiotic therapy. during a mean follow-up of 21 +/- 2.8 months, no patient had clinical recurrence of infection. one patient treated with antiarrhythmic drugs without system reimplantation died suddenly. conclusions: infections that involve implantable cardioverter-defibrillator systems can be safely managed by removing the entire system with reimplantation after intravenous antibiotic therapy. in selected patients in whom the risk for system  explantation is high and anticipated life expectancy is short, long-term antibiotic therapy to suppress low-virulence infections may represent an acceptable alternative.

TI  == in vitro activity of bay 12-8039, a new 8-methoxyquinolone.
AB  == bay 12-8039 is a new 8-methoxyquinolone with antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria which is significantly better than those of sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.062 and 2 mg/l, respectively. the mic90s for ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant s. aureus were 8 mg/l. against  the staphylococcal strains tested sparfloxacin was 2-fold and ciprofloxacin > or  = 10-fold less active. mic90s for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae were 0.125-0.5 mg/l, irrespective of whether strains with diminished ciprofloxacin susceptibility or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains were tested. against the streptococci sparfloxacin was 2- to 4-fold less active. against gram-negative bacteria bay 12-8039 is almost as active as ciprofloxacin, except for pseudomonas aeruginosa.  against bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides spp. and clostridium spp. bay 12-8039 was as active as metronidazole. the bactericidal activity against s. aureus and s. pneumoniae was in contrast to that of the other quinolones tested, penicillin  g, amoxicillin+/-clavulanate, cefuroxime and clarithromycin, concentration-dependent. as compared to ciprofloxacin, development of resistance  was less pronounced. the spontaneous mutation frequency towards bay 12-8039 resistance was 2.8 x 10(-8) in escherichia coli, 7.06 x 10(-8) in s. aureus and < 1.4 x 10(-9) in s. pneumoniae.

AB  == purpose: to investigate the rate of contamination of conjunctival smears and anterior chamber aspirates at the conclusion of cataract surgery, and the relation between the types of bacterial strain in the conjunctival sac and anterior chamber at the conclusion of surgery and in preoperative samples from the conjunctival sac of the same eye. methods: the bacterial strains in conjunctival smears 1 week preoperatively and in conjunctival smears and anterior chamber aspirates at the conclusion of surgery from 58 consecutive eyes of 48 patients were examined. the patients underwent cataract surgery by phacoemulsification and aspiration followed by intraocular lens (iol) implantation. all surgeries were broadcast simultaneously by closed-circuit television to the patients' families who were in a separate waiting room. results: at the conclusion of surgery, six eyes (10.3%) were contaminated: one anterior chamber aspirate (1.7%) and five conjunctival smears (8.6%). only two (33%) of the six contaminated eyes at the conclusion of surgery had the same bacterial strain as the preoperative conjunctival smears. conclusion: the percentage of culture-positive anterior chamber aspirates at the conclusion of phacoemulsification surgery and intraocular lens implantation was only 1.7%, despite a concurrent televised broadcast accompanied by an intraoperative microphone-transmitted explanation by the surgeon. sixty-seven percent of the bacterial strains at the conclusion of surgery did not match those found preoperatively in the same eye.

TI  == evaluation of swirling, ph, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. this study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular ph, and low plasma glucose levels. study design and methods: day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees c for up to 5 days. in the morning  and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet ph, plasma glucose, and swirling. quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine ph and glucose levels. results: platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus mitis, or staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. the sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. although the sensitivity of the ph test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with e. cloacae had normal ph despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) cfu/ml). conclusion: the sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular ph or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with gram stain (10(5)-10(6) cfu/ml), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) cfu/ml), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal rna (10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml), and automated bacterial culture (1 cfu/sample volume).

TI  == species selectivity of new siderophore-drug conjugates that use specific iron uptake for entry into bacteria.
AB  == siderophores selectively bind ferric iron and are involved in receptor-specific iron transport into bacteria. several types of siderophores were synthesized, and growth-promoting or inhibitory activities when they were conjugated to carbacephalosporin, erythromycylamine, or nalidixic acid were investigated. overall, 11 types of siderophores and 21 drug conjugates were tested against seven different bacterial species: escherichia coli, bordetella bronchiseptica, pasteurella multocida, pasteurella haemolytica, streptococcus suis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. in some species, the inhibitory activities of the drug conjugates were associated with the ability of  the bacteria to use the siderophore portion of the molecules for growth promotion in disc diffusion tests (0.04 mumol of conjugate or siderophore per disc). e. coli used catechol-based siderophore portions as well as hydroxamate-based tri-delta-oh-n-oh-delta-n-acetyl-l-ornithine ferric iron ligands for growth under iron-restricted conditions achieved by supplemental ethylenediamine di (o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) (100 micrograms/ml) and was sensitive to carbacephalosporin conjugated to these siderophore types (up to a 34-mm-diameter  inhibition zone). b. bronchiseptica used desferrioxamine b and an isocyanurate-based or trihydroxamate in addition to catechol-based siderophore portions for promotion but was not inhibited by beta-lactam conjugates partly because of the presence of beta-lactamase. p. multocida and p. haemolytica did not use any of the synthetic siderophores for growth promotion, and the inhibitory activities of some conjugates seemed partly linked to their ability to withhold iron from these bacteria, since individual siderophore portions showed some antibacterial effects. individual siderophores did not promote s. suis growth in restrictive conditions, but the type of ferric iron ligands attached to beta-lactams affected inhibitory activities. the antibacterial activities of the  intracellular-acting agents erythromycylamine and nalidixic acid were reduced or  lost, even against s. aureus and s. epidermidis, when the agents were conjugated  to siderophores. conjugate-resistant e. coli mutants showed the absence of some iron-regulated outer membrane proteins in gel electrophoresis profiles and in specific phage or colicin sensitivity tests, implying that the drugs used outer membrane receptors of ferric complexes to get into cells.

AB  == the mechanism of macrolide resistance was examined in 73 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae. two distinct resistance phenotypes were observed: high-level macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin b (mls) resistance and low-level macrolide resistance with lincosamide susceptibility. high-level mls resistance was associated with the presence of ermam. strains with the low-level resistant phenotype (novel) were negative for erma, ermc, ermam, erea, ereb and msra by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification with gene-specific primers. ribosomes isolated from novel strains bound the same amount of [14c]-erythromycin as ribosomes from sensitive strains. these novel strains also did not inactivate  the macrolide. the novel mechanism was found in 41% of the erythromycin resistant s. pneumoniae examined.

TI  == treatment of endocarditis with teicoplanin: a retrospective analysis of 104 cases.
AB  == infective endocarditis is an uncommon disease but retains a high mortality. glycopeptides are used for patients with resistant pathogens, those allergic to penicillins or for those outside the hospital. the once daily administration of teicoplanin and its low toxicity suggest that it would be suitable for use in the long courses required for endocarditis. however, the dosage and combinations to be used require further study. a retrospective review has been made of 104 episodes of endocarditis treated with teicoplanin in 101 patients seen over 7 years. most patients had been referred to major london hospitals following failure of medical treatment. after three loading doses of 400 mg, teicoplanin was given at a dose of 400 mg/day in combination with other antibiotics such as gentamicin. follow up was for one year. the most common pathogens were streptococcus sanguis (15 cases), staphylococcus aureus (13 cases) and staphylococcus epidermidis (10 cases). of 80 patients febrile at the start of treatment with teicoplanin, 63 (79%) lost their fever within a median of 2 days (1-35 days). cure without surgery was effected in 50 (48%) and 75% of patients survived. other antibiotics, usually gentamicin or rifampicin, were used in 92 (90%) of patients. two strains of streptococcus spp. were said to be resistant but there was no relationship between mic of teicoplanin and outcome. pathogens with a high mbc tended to be more likely to resist treatment. adverse effects resulted in the withdrawal of teicoplanin in 20 cases (19%) but most events were  mild and renal deterioration occurred in only five patients. teicoplanin was effective in the treatment of endocarditis and appeared to be safe given the severity of disease in the patients treated.

AB  == certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic ly264826 with n-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. for enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin  and teicoplanin, the mics of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for ly264826. for e. faecium and e. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the mics were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. the compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. the mics for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. against methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis mics ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. the spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. the compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with mics of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. in in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, or s. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. overall, these new glycopeptides, such as ly307599 and ly333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.

TI  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans on denture surfaces.
AB  == infectious diseases caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, mrsa,  and candida albicans are often serious in compromised hosts. we enumerated mrsa and c. albicans on denture surfaces and in saliva samples from 29 adults. staphylococcus species, mrsa, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, mrse, were detected on 17, 3, and 1 of the 29 denture surfaces, respectively. c. albicans were detected on 22 denture surfaces. all saliva samples from patients whose dentures carried staphylococcus species and c. albicans were also found to contain both microorganisms. adherence of isolated 3h labeled cells of mrsa and c. albicans to resin beads and saliva-coated resin beads was examined. cells of both microorganisms adhered in significantly higher  numbers to saliva-coated resin beads than to resin beads. the hydrophobicity of the mrsa isolated from denture surfaces varied from strain to strain; that of c.  albicans strains was moderately high. the zeta potentials of mrsa isolates and of c. albicans isolates determined in kci buffer were significantly low. the potential of the resin beads decreased after treatment with saliva. two out of 5  mrsa strains were found to be inhibited in growth by oral streptococcus, actinomyces, and gram-negative bacterial strains, suggesting that some oral bacterial species play a role in inhibiting the colonization of staphylococcus species. no isolates of c. albicans were inhibited in their growth by any of the  oral bacteria tested. isolates of mrsa and c. albicans coaggregated with porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum strains. using denture cleaners every night for 2 weeks did not reduce numbers of staphylococcus species or c. albicans organisms in saliva.

AB  == objective: to determine the minimum volume of blood and the absolute number of organisms required for detection of bacteremia and fungemia by an automated colorimetric blood culture system (bact/alert, organon teknika). design: common neonatal pathogens, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus (gbs): one american type culture collection (atcc) strain and one clinical isolate), staphylococcus epidermidis, and candida albicans, were seeded  into blood to produce bacteremia or fungemia with low colony counts (1 to 3 colony-forming units (cfu) per milliliter) and ultra-low colony counts (<1 cfu/ml). for each organism, 96 culture bottles were inoculated with either 0.25,  0.5, 1.0, or 4.0 ml of the two seeded blood concentrations. blood culture bottles were incubated in the bact/alert device for 5 days, and time to positivity was noted when applicable. all bottles were subcultured on plated media. data analysis: the poisson statistic was used to calculate the probability of finding  at least one viable cfu per inoculated culture bottle. the fraction of culture bottles with positive findings per group was divided by the probability of one or more organisms present to give the positivity index. results: plated subculture identified no growth of organisms not detected by the colorimetric detection system. the false-positive rate for the automated device was less than 1%. the positivity index for the gbs clinical isolate was 1.13, for the gbs atcc isolate  0.96, for s. epidermidis 0.94, for c. albicans 0.97, and for e. coli 0.95. there  was a statistically significant difference with time to positivity and inocula volume (p <0.01), but the difference was not clinically important. conclusions: if one or two viable colony-forming units are in the blood inoculated into culture media, the bact/alert system will detect growth rapidly. because there appears to be a sizable subset of neonates who are at risk of sepsis with a colony count less than 4 cfu/ml, then a 0.5 ml inoculum of blood into the culture media is inadequate for sensitive and timely detection of bacteremia. one to two  milliliters of blood should increase microorganism recovery in the face of low-colony-count sepsis.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich peptide derived from a  putative porcine precursor protein of a novel family of antibacterial peptides.
AB  == it has long been speculated that porcine cathelin is an n-terminal fragment of a  longer precursor protein which possesses antimicrobial activity. in an attempt to find such a precursor, a cdna clone was recently isolated and sequenced by screening a cdna library from porcine bone marrow. in order to identify the functional activity of the putative protein encoded by an open reading frame, we  have synthesized various lengths of peptides that correspond to the c-terminal region of the protein and examined them for their antimicrobial activities. we found that a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich region with the sequence of vrrfpwwwpflrr had strong antimicrobial activity with a wide spectrum. it showed potency against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus group d as well  as aspergillus fumigatus. the action of this peptide is bactericidal rather than  bacteriostatic and this activity is completely inhibited by 2 mm mgcl2. our results indicate that the previously identified putative precursor encoded by the isolated cdna indeed possesses a potent antimicrobial activity and that this 13 amino acid synthetic peptide is considered to be a potentially effective drug against various infectious agents.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibility testing of 446 clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria to new quinolones, carbapenems and cephalosporins].
AB  == objective: to assess the in vitro susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria isolated in the sao paulo hospital against five fluoroquinolones, three carbapenems and three cephalosporins. materials and method: susceptibility was tested in 77 isolates of streptococci, 38 enterococci, 25 s. aureus and 91 s. epidermidis. the strains were isolated in the sao paulo hospital in june and july of 1992. the susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution according to the procedure described by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls). the antimicrobial agents tested were: ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin (formerly opc 17116), du-6859, imipenem, meropenem, biapenem, ceftazidime, cefepime and fk-037. results: the best in vitro activity was demonstrated by the new fluoroquinolones, especially du 6859. among the commercially available compounds, the fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin (81% susceptibility) and the carbapenem imipenem (74% susceptible) were the most active compounds. the highest resistance rates were shown by enterococci and oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. conclusions: the results of the present study showed that the in vitro activities of the new carbapenems are similar to that of imipenem and the fourth generation  cephalosporins are more active than ceftazidime against gram-positive bacteria. in addition, the newer fluoroquinolones were four to sixteen-fold more active than that showed by the commercially available compounds of this class, especially against enterococci and oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. these results indicate that these newer fluoroquinolones should be further evaluated in clinical trials.

TI  == experience with the port-a-cath in sickle cell disease.
AB  == peripheral vein access is often a problem in patients with sickle cell disease (scd). totally implantable venous access devices (tivad) have offered other groups of patients safe long-term venous access. we reviewed our own experience with the use of a port-a-cath device in five patients with scd undergoing exchange transfusion programmes. all five lines required removal due to infection associated with sbe, septic arthritis, pulmonary embolus and axillary vein thrombosis. the organisms involved were staphylococcus aureus (3), staphylococcus epidermidis (1) and streptococcus sp. (1). the median working life of the catheters was 240 days (range 61-428). the median length of time from presentation to the diagnosis of a line-associated infection was 29 days (range 1-58). the rate of complications (0.4 per 100 patient days) in this small group of patients contrasts with the lower rates in patients with hiv and malignancy (0-0.1 per 100 patient days). our results suggest that patients with scd suffer an unacceptable incidence of infective complications associated with the port-a-cath. bone infection is more common where there is pre-existing infarcted  tissue. while these systems provide a valuable tool, our experience has led us to discontinue the use of tivads in scd.

AB  == the upjohn oxazolidinones, u-100592 and u-100766, are orally bioavailable synthetic antimicrobial agents with spectra of activity against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens. in several mouse models of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection, u-100592 and u-100766 yielded oral 50% effective doses (ed50) ranging from 1.9 to 8.0 mg/kg of body weight, which compared favorably with vancomycin subcutaneous ed50 values of 1.1 to 4.4 mg/kg. similarly, both compounds were active versus a staphylococcus epidermidis experimental systemic infection. u-100592 and u-100766 effectively cured an enterococcus faecalis systemic infection, with ed50 values of 1.3 and 10.0 mg/kg, and versus a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infection in immunocompromised mice, both drugs effected cures at 12.5 and 24.0 mg/kg. both compounds were exceptionally active in vivo against penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, with ed50 values ranging from 1.2 to 11.7 mg/kg in systemic infection models. in soft tissue infection models with s. aureus and e. faecalis, both compounds exhibited acceptable curative activities in the range of 11.0 to 39.0 mg/kg. u-100766 was also very active versus the bacteroides fragilis soft tissue infection model (ed50 = 46.3 mg/kg).  in combination-therapy studies, both u-100592 and u-100766 were indifferent or additive in vivo against a monomicrobic s. aureus infection in combination with other antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria and combined as readily as vancomycin with gentamicin in the treatment of a polymicrobic s. aureus-escherichia coli infection. u-100592 and u-100766 are potent oxazolidinones active against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens in experimental systemic and soft tissue infections.

TI  == [community-acquired and nosocomial septicemias in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection].
AB  == objectives: study the characteristics of community and nosocomial-acquired bacteremia in hiv-infected patients in order to improve curative, and if possible, preventive therapy. methods: we analyzed retrospectively 47 cases of community-acquired and 31 cases of nosocomial bacteremia identified in 63 of 436  patients hospitalized between january 1992 and december 1993 with hiv infection (53 men, 10 women, mean age 34.3 years, stage a: 1, stage b: 20, stage c: 42). the portal was identified for 68 episodes (40 in the community acquired and 28 in the nosocomial groups). the main portal was pulmonary infection (42.5% vs 17.8%;  p = 0.03) and digestive tract infection due to streptococcus pneumoniae (70%) and salmonella spp (60%). nosocomial bacteremia following intravenous infusions included staphylococcus epidermidis (oxacillin-resistant in 57%) and staphylococcus (oxacillin-sensitive) infections. bacteremia was the immediate cause of death in 18% of the deaths occurring in the 436 patients hospitalized during the study period. conclusion: these findings confirm the gravity of community-acquired and nosocomial bacteremia in advanced stage hiv-infected patients. antibiotics should be adapted on the basis of probability of the infectious agent obtained from epidemiologic data and the effectiveness of prophylaxis measures validated.

TI  == the interference of gingival cell cultures with growth of selected bacteria.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyze the interference of oral tissue cells or cell lines (effector cells) with growth of reference bacteria, and furthermore to investigate whether cells derived from different individuals differ in such activity. the reference bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the effector cells used were gingival fibroblasts (gf) from 21 periodontally involved persons, gingival epithelial cells (e) from 2 such persons, hela cells (hela), and an amnion cell line (amnion). the cells were cultivated and their supernatants tested for antibacterial activity in a bioscreen robot analyzer (labsystems, finland). results suggest that the antibacterial activity of each tested primary cell line  of tissue had its own profile depending on cell type and donor, and that the composition of oral microbiota was influenced by oral cells, which might, in turn, contribute to the variations in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.

TI  == in vitro activities of u-100592 and u-100766, novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agents.
AB  == oxazolidinones make up a relatively new class of antimicrobial agents which possess a unique mechanism of bacterial protein synthesis inhibition. u-100592 (s)-n-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-[4-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-piperazinyl]- phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide and u-100766 (s)-n-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]- 2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide are novel oxazolidinone analogs from a directed chemical modification program. mics were determined for a variety of bacterial clinical isolates; the respective mics of u-100592 and u-100766 at which 90% of isolates are inhibited were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant s. aureus, 4  and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 and 2  micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; enterococcus faecium, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; streptococcus pyogenes, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.50 and 1 microgram/ml; corynebacterium spp., 0.50 and 0.50 micrograms/ml; moraxella catarrhalis, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; listeria monocytogenes, 8 and 2 micrograms/ml; and bacteroides fragilis, 16 and 4 micrograms/ml. most strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis and the gram-positive anaerobes were inhibited in the range of 0.50 to 2 micrograms/ml. enterococcal strains resistant to vancomycin (vana, vanb, and vanc resistance phenotypes), pneumococcal strains resistant to penicillin, and m. tuberculosis strains resistant to common antitubercular agents (isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampin, ethionamide, and ethambutol) were not cross-resistant to the oxazolidinones. the  presence of 10, 20, and 40% pooled human serum did not affect the antibacterial activities of the oxazolidinones. time-kill studies demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect of the analogs against staphylococci and enterococci but a bactericidal effect against streptococci. the spontaneous mutation frequencies of s. aureus atcc 29213 were <3.8 x 10(-10) and <8 x 10(-11) for u-100592 and u-100766, respectively. serial transfer of three staphylococcal and two enterococcal strains on drug gradient plates produced no evidence of rapid resistance development. thus, these new oxazolidinone analogs demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activities against a variety of clinically important human pathogens.

TI  == effects of different surfactant preparations on bacterial growth in vitro.
AB  == several lines of evidence suggest that surfactant and surfactant proteins may have direct effects on inhaled bacteria and are able to interact with lung defence mechanisms in many ways. we examined the effect of three different surfactant preparations (alveofact, survanta and exosurf) approved for treatment  of the infant respiratory distress syndrome on different strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus agalactiae which are important neonatal pathogens and on legionella pneumophila serogroup i as a frequent cause of pneumonia in adults. addition of survanta to saline seemed to delay the reduction of viable bacteria in sterile saline and induced a considerably accelerated growth of all examined e. coli strains. as opposed to this, addition of surfactant did not influence the kinetics of bacterial growth in brain-heart infusion or buffered yeast extract both with the  exception of exosurf which exerted an inhibitory effect on the multiplication of  group b streptococci. though the exact mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be determined, the influence of surfactant therapy on the growth of bacteria within the respiratory tract should be taken into account.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

AB  == purpose: to report the findings concerning three patients with endophthalmitis and one with panophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis radial keratotomy surgery. methods: one man referred with panophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis and three women referred with endophthalmitis were treated. results: after radial keratotomy surgery, during which no microperforation or macroperforation had been reported, a severe pseudomonas panophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis developed in the man. all vision was lost in that eye. staphylococcus epidermidis endophthalmitis developed in one woman, streptococcus pneumoniae endophthalmitis  in the second woman and pseudomonas endophthalmitis in the third woman, after undergoing radial keratotomy procedures during which microperforations occurred.  in the latter patient, bilateral simultaneous surgery was performed, but only one eye became infected. the latter two infections resulted in light perception and hand motion vision respectively. in three cases, an initial keratitis was located in the inferior cornea. conclusions: severe bacterial endophthalmitis can occur after radial keratotomy surgery, even in the absence of microperforation during the procedure. any evidence of postoperative keratitis must be regarded seriously and treated aggressively. despite use of this approach, the effect on final visual acuity can be devastating.

TI  == effect of candida albicans infection and clotrimazole treatment on vaginal microflora in vitro.
AB  == objective: to determine the effect of candida albicans infection and clotrimazole treatment on vaginal microflora. methods: studies were conducted using a model simulating the healthy vaginal ecosystem. the model consisted of a mixed culture  of lactobacillus acidophilus, staphylococcus epidermidis, prevotella bivia, and group d streptococcus sp grown in continuous culture in a chemically defined medium. the status of the model was assessed using a mathematical equation that determines the probability a microflora is normal or abnormal. results: challenge of the model with c albicans was followed within 24 hours by the development of microbial populations representing an abnormal microflora. treatment of the system with clotrimazole (100 micrograms/ml) resulted in a decrease in c albicans counts to 0 within 48 hours. however, treatment also altered other components of  the vaginal microflora, which did not return to normal. addition of clotrimazole  (100 micrograms/ml) to the system in the absence of c albicans also resulted in an abnormal model by 24 hours. conclusions: candida albicans infection of the vaginal ecosystem, as represented by this in vitro model, has a deleterious effect on members of the normal microflora. clotrimazole, although effective against c albicans infection, also has a deleterious effect on components of the  normal vaginal microflora. one of the implications for women using clotrimazole for microbiologically undocumented vaginal yeast infections is an increased risk  of infection or disease through the disruption of the protective microflora barrier.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of s-1090, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == s-1090, a new oral cephalosporin, was active against selected gram-negative bacteria and methicillin-susceptible clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus warneri, against which it had excellent activity. s-1090 was the most active compound against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae among the agents compared. the in vivo efficacy of s-1090 against systemic and urinary and respiratory tract infections  caused by gram-positive and -negative bacteria was superior to that expected from the in vitro and in vivo activities of the agents against which it was compared.

TI  == high sensitivity of mycobacterium species to the bactericidal activity by polylysine.
AB  == bactericidal effects of polylysine on different bacterial species were measured.  marked differences in sensitivity were observed. based on the concentration of polylysine required to reduce cell viability by 50%, mycobacterium smegmatis and  mycobacterium tuberculosis were found to be the most sensitive and escherichia coli the most resistant. in addition, two gram-positive organisms, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus salivarius exhibited significant differences in sensitivity which suggests that the relationship between sensitivity towards polylysine and bacterial cell type is not necessarily a function of the overall cell envelope structure. the high sensitivity of mycobacteria suggests the possible use of polylysine, or a conjugate of polylysine and another agent in anti-mycobacterial drug design.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of cs-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cs-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone drug, was tested against 761 clinical isolates. cs-940 activity against members of the family enterobacteriaceae was most similar to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, with a large range of mics inhibiting 90% of isolates tested (mic90s)  of 0.015 to 16 micrograms/ml (median mic90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). cs-940 had greater activity than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin when they were tested against acinetobacter spp. (mic90s, 0.03 micrograms/ml) and stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia (mic90s, 2 micrograms/ml). cs-940 demonstrated a high degree of potency against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria spp. (mic90s, < or = 0.06 micrograms/ml). cs-940 was two- to eightfold  more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. cs-940 was also very active against streptococcus spp. and enterococci, for which mic90s were < or = 2 micrograms/ml; for enterococcus faecium, however, the mic90 was 4 micrograms/ml. cs-940 was generally less active than a comparison investigational fluoroquinolone, clinafloxacin. this compound appears promising by in vitro test analysis and warrants further in vivo trials.

AB  == four hundred and forty-one and 1048 episodes of bacteraemia were prospectively surveyed over a period of 18 months in two hospitals, a 450 bed community hospital and a 900 bed tertiary care urban university hospital. incidence of bacteraemia was 2.18 per 1000 hospitalization days (10.1 per 1000 admissions) in  the community hospital and 2.64 per 1000 hospitalization days (12.0 per 1000 admissions (p < 0.004)) in the university hospital. sixty six and 62% of episodes of bacteraemia were community acquired. the majority of bacteraemic episodes originated on the internal medicine wards of both hospital--46.7% and 58.7% respectively; the incidence of bacteraemia in the medical divisions of both hospitals was 23.1 and 17.5 per 1000 admissions respectively (p < 0.01). overall  mortality rates were 22% and 26.7% respectively. 39.9% and 44% of all isolates were gram-positive pathogens. escherichia coli was the commonest gram-negative pathogen in both hospitals, particularly the community hospital--47.5% vs 32.8% (p < 0.005) of all gram-negative pathogens, while pseudomonas spp. were significantly more common in the university hospital--18.5% vs 11.8% (p < 0.02).  non-enterococcal streptococci were more common in the community hospital while enterococci were far more common at the university hospital--15.1% vs 1% of all gram-positive pathogens (p < 0.05). staphylococcus epidermidis was more common among the community hospital gram-positive bacteraemias--31.1% vs 18.6% (p < 0.005). for almost all genera and species, antibiotic resistance was higher at the university hospital. twenty nine point four per cent of staphylococcus aureus isolates from the university hospital were methicillin resistant compared to 2.4% at the community hospital (p < 0.005). 29.4% of all streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at the university hospital were penicillin resistant while no resistance was found at the community hospital. a high resistance rate to ofloxacin was found at the university hospital among s. aureus and pseudomonas sp. sources of bacteraemia did not differ significantly between the two hospitals. in conclusion, although outcome did not differ significantly for the two hospitals,  there were significant differences between blood culture isolates in these two different settings. these differences may influence clinical decision-making about antibiotic therapy for patients in these hospitals.

TI  == the impact of bacteraemia on hiv infection. nine years experience in a large italian university hospital.
AB  == the object of this case control study was to evaluate the frequency, the risk factors, the microbiological spectrum and the outcome of 249 cases of bacteraemia observed in 209 hiv-infected patients, most them affected by aids. the rate of bacteraemia in the total yearly hiv-related admissions increased from 4% in 1985  to 13% in 1993. the more common aetiological agents of bacteraemia were: staphylococcus aureus (29.7%), non-typhoidal species of salmonella (14.1%), staphylococcus epidermidis (10.9%), streptococcus pneumoniae (8.4%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.6%). a mixed flora was found in 14% of the episodes. multivariate analysis of predisposing factors indicated that a low cd4+t-cell count (<0.2 x 10(9)/l) (p=0.01), use of central venous catheters (cvc) (p=0.01) and neutropenia (polymorphonuclear neutrophils <1.0 x 10(9)/l) (p=0.04) were independent risk factors for the development of bacteraemia. logistic regression  did not reveal any association of bacteraemia with intravenous drug abuse (on univariate analysis p=0.04). the response (31.8%). recurrences to specific therapy was favourable in 170 episodes (68.2%); death occurred in 79 (31.8%). recurrences arose in 40 patients, 17 (42.5%) of them died. the outcome of bacteraemia was influenced by a low number of cd4+t-cells (p<0.001) but not of polymorphonuclear cells. our findings suggest that bacteraemia is a relatively common event in hiv-infected patients, especially under particular conditions (e.g. intravenous drug abuse, use of cvc, neutropenia and a low cd4-t-cell count). it requires special attention from physicians who must recognise and treat the condition promptly at an early stage.

TI  == gadolinium-based mr contrast media: potential for growth of microbial contaminants when single vials are used for multiple patients.
AB  == objective: to assess potential risk if single-dose vials of gadolinium-based contrast media are used for multiple patients. the use of multidose vials can pose a significant risk if contaminants are accidentally introduced into the vials and proliferate. therefore, we tested the ability of gadolinium-based contrast to support the growth of a variety of microbial pathogens. materials and methods: we collected the unused portions of 15 single-use vials of gadolinium-based contrast media. the residual contrast material was refrigerated  after use and checked for sterility prior to inoculation with a selection of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and yeast. contrast material was incubated at room temperature and at 4 degrees c, and quantitative cultures were  performed at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hr and at 7 days. results: no microbial growth occurred from cultures of the used contrast solutions prior to inoculation. none  of the organisms tested in our study proliferated in the contrast material. all test organisms persisted at least 48 hr after inoculation at both temperatures. at 7 days, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus epidermidis, and corynebacterium  jeikeium were recovered in significant quantities. colony counts of serratia odorifera rapidly decreased at room temperature but persisted beyond 7 days at 4  degrees c. conclusion: the risk of contaminating vials of contrast agents punctured aseptically is small. our study demonstrates a lack of proliferation of organisms in the two gadolinium-based compounds tested, suggesting that these solutions could be used for more than one procedure.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the lantibiotic pep5 biosynthetic gene cluster and functional analysis of pepp and pepc. evidence for a role of pepc in thioether formation.
AB  == the biosynthesis of pep5, a lanthionine-containing antimicrobial peptide, is directed by the 20-kbp plasmid ped503. we identified a 7.9-kbp dna-fragment within this plasmid which covers the information for pep5 synthesis in the homologous host staphylococcus epidermidis 5 which has been cured of ped503. this fragment contained, in addition to the previously described structural gene pepa  and the immunity gene pepi [reis, m., eschbach-bludau, m., iglesias-wind, m. i.,  kupke, t. & sahl, h.-g. (1994) appl. env. microbiol. 60, 2876-2883], a gene pept  coding for a translocator of the abc transporter family, a gene pepp coding for a serine protease and two genes pepb and pepc coding for putative modification enzymes; the gene arrangement is peptiapbc. we analyzed the biosynthetic genes with respect to their function in pep5 biosynthesis. deletion of pept reduced pep5 production to about 10%, indicating that it can be partially replaced by other host-encoded translocators. inactivation of pepp by site-directed mutagenesis of the active-site his residue resulted in production of incorrectly  processed pep5 fragments with strongly reduced antimicrobial activity. deletion of pepb and pepc leads to accumulation of pep5 prepeptide in the cells without excretion of processed peptide. a pepc-deletion clone did not excrete correctly matured pep5 but it did produce fragments from which serine and threonine were absent. only one of these fragments contained a single lanthionine residue out of three expected while the remaining, unmodified cysteine residues could be detected by reaction with ellman's reagent. these results demonstrate that pepc is a thioether-forming protein and strongly suggest that pepb is responsible for  dehydration of serine and threonine.

TI  == bacteria in human mouths involved in the production and utilization of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == earlier studies have demonstrated that pure cultures of oral streptococci produce hydrogen peroxide but none has found any free peroxide in dental plaque or salivary sediment despite streptococci being major components of their mixed bacterial populations. the absence of peroxide in plaque and sediment could be due to the dominance of its destruction over its formation by bacterial constituents. to identify which of the oral bacteria might be involved in such a  possibility, pure cultures of 27 different oral bacteria were surveyed (as well as dental plaque and sediment) for their peroxide-forming and peroxide-removing capabilities. peroxide production was measured for each of the pure cultures by incubation with glucose at low and high substrate concentrations (2.8 and 28.0 mm) for 4 h and with the ph kept at 7.0 by a ph-stat. removal of hydrogen peroxide was assessed in similar experiments where peroxide at 0, 29.4, 147.2 or  294.4 mm [0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1% (w/v)] replaced the glucose. hydrogen peroxide formation was seen with only three of the bacteria tested, streptococcus sanguis  i and ii (sanguis and oralis), and strep. mitior (mitis biotype i); levels of hydrogen peroxide between 2.2 and 9.8 mm were produced when these micro-organisms were grown aerobically and 1.1 and 3.9 mm when grown anaerobically. earlier reports indicate that such levels were usually sufficient to inhibit the growth of many plaque bacteria. the amounts formed were similar at the two glucose levels tested, suggesting that maximum peroxide production is reached at low glucose concentration. none of the three peroxide-producing organisms was able to utilize hydrogen peroxide but five of the other 24 tested, neisseria sicca, haemophilus segnis, h. parainfluenzae, actinomyces viscosus and staphylococcus epidermidis, could readily do so, as could the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment and dental plaque, both of which contain relatively high numbers of these peroxide-utilizing micro-organisms. the ability of the bacteria in plaque and sediment to degrade hydrogen peroxide was considerable and extremely rapid; peroxide removal and usually complete within the first 15 min of the incubation even when its initial level was as high as 294.4 mm. this almost overwhelming ability to remove peroxide was confirmed when peroxide-producing and -using cultures were mixed and when each of eight salivary sediments was incubated with  glucose and with peroxide at concentrations up to 294.4 mm. in the glucose incubations, no hydrogen peroxide was observed, indicating dominance of microbial peroxide removers over hydrogen peroxide producers.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == microbial keratitis in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  == background: posterior segment complications of systemic infection with the human  immunodeficiency virus (hiv) are well recognized. the anterior segment complications often are, however, overlooked. the author treated 20 episodes of nonherpetic infectious keratitis in 17 eyes of 13 patients infected with hiv who  presented between august 1990 and may 1994. methods: review of records. results:  nine patients were women, and four were men. mean age was 35.2 years. the keratitis was bilateral in four patients, polymicrobial in four, and recurrent in two. the most common infecting organism was candida albicans (5 eyes), a rare cause of keratitis in immunocompetent individuals. other organisms included staphylococcus aureus in four eyes, staphylococcus epidermidis in four, bacillus  sp in two, and one each pseudomonas aeruginosa, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, micrococcus sp, and capnocytophaga sp. seven eyes retained 20/30 or better visual acuity after treatment, eight had visual acuity of 20/50 or worse, and two were eviscerated. classic predisposing factors for infectious keratitis were found in  only two patients and included contact lens wear and atopy in one patient each. twelve patients had a history of intravenous drug abuse. conclusion: infectious keratitis should be recognized as a complication of systemic hiv infection, especially in the context of drug abuse. the prognosis for recovery of vision in  these patients often is poor.

TI  == [dirithromycin in the treatment of infections of the lower respiratory tract].
AB  == good results of the treatment of patients with lower respiratory tract infections with dirithromycin (eli lilly, usa), a new semisynthetic macrolide, were recorded. the trial included 15 patients: 6 with acute bronchitis (ab) and 9 with exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (ab) and 9 with exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (ecb). the antibiotic was administered orally in a single dose of 500  mg once a day for 7 days. the treatment efficacy was estimated by the clinical results and laboratory findings. the sputum specimens were investigated bacteriologically with testing the microflora for the drug susceptibility by using the diffusion disks. 50 per cent of the patients with ab isolated streptococcus viridans with low (the diameter of the growth inhibition zones < 16 mm) and intermediate (16-17 mm) susceptibility to the antibiotic, 33.3 per cent of the patients isolated highly susceptible (19 mm) strains of str. pneumonia and 16.7 per cent of the patients isolated resistant (15 mm) strains of staphylococcus epidermidis. highly susceptible (17-19 mm) strains of haemophilus  influenzae and str. viridans were isolated respectively from 55.5 and 45.5 per cent of the patients with ecb. in 4 patients with ecb a clinical improvement of the state was recorded. in the other patients with ab and ecb the recovery was stated. the bacteriological tests revealed a new pathogen in 2 patients with ecb  and the failure of the treatment in another 2 patients with ecb. in all the other patients the pathogen was shown to be eradicated. in the patients isolating the new pathogen the symptomatic recovery was stated in the posttherapeutic period. therefore, diritromycin proved to be efficient in 13 out of the 15 patients with  lower respiratory tract infections. it should be noted that the drug tolerance was excellent. none of the patients showed any adverse reactions.

TI  == bacterial infection and semen characteristics in infertile men.
AB  == semen samples of 190 men attending an andrology clinic were evaluated with bacteriological culture and categorized as negative (group i) and positive (group ii); the effect of bacteriospemia on semen characteristics was also analyzed. semen samples from both groups were simultaneously analyzed for routine parameters such as volume, sperm count, motility, viability and morphology. the semen culture was negative in 34% and positive in 66% of the samples. from 123 samples, 157 aerobes and 8 anaerobes were recovered. the most commonly isolated organism was staphylococchs epidermidis (in 63% of the samples), followed by streptococchs viridans (28%), escherichia coli (9%), staphylococcus aureus (5%),  streptococcus faecalis (5%), beta-hemolytic streptococcus (4%), and enterobacter  agglomerans (4%). other microorganisms, including klebsiella sp, candida sp., and proteus mirabilis, were recovered in fewer than 4% of the specimens. the comparison of semen characteristics between infected and noninfected men showed that motile spermatozoa and viability were lower when the microorganisms were present in the semen. it would appear that the bacteria can have a direct effect  on semen quality with negative consequences in fertility.

TI  == bactericidal activity of the new 4-quinolones du-6859a and dv-7751a.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of two new 4-quinolones, du-6859a and dv-7751a, was investigated against strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. du-6859a and dv-7751a were more bactericidal than any 4-quinolone tested previously. furthermore, du-6859a was unique among 4-quinolones in being able to kill ent. faecalis after incubation for only 3 h in nutrient broth. the bactericidal mechanisms of dv-7551a were similar to those of other 4-quinolones, but, uniquely, du-6859a possessed additional bactericidal mechanisms against both str. pneumoniae and ent. faecalis. this may explain the unusually potent bactericidal  activity of this agent against these species. these results show that du-6859a is a unique extended-spectrum 4-quinolone, which should prove to be superior to established 4-quinolones.

TI  == factors associated with positive bacteriological cultures of chronic middle ear effusions.
AB  == pathogenic bacteria have been isolated from middle ear effusions in a number of studies. our aim was to identify factors which predispose to patients having positive cultures. over a 1-year period, prospective data were collected on patients admitted for myringotomy. middle ear effusions were collected at the time of surgery using specially designed traps, and underwent microscopy and culture. data on local weather parameters were obtained from the meteorological office in edinburgh, uk and compared with the patterns of positive cultures. a higher proportion of cultures were positive in october, november and december and in february and may than in the other months of the years. we were not able to relate these variations to any of the meteorological data, with the possible exception of relative humidity, or to any other variable.

TI  == clinical evaluation of catheter-related fungemia and bacteremia.
AB  == forty-four patients with catheter-related infection admitted to hokusho central hospital between 1985 and 1991 were studied retrospectively. the rate of catheter-related fungemia or bacteremia to all corresponding cases of fungemia and bacteremia increased from 7.7% in 1985 to 28.8% in 1991. the isolated pathogens were candida parapsilosis (8 strains), candida tropicalis (6 strains),  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (6 strains), methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa) (5 strains) and streptococcus epidermidis  (3 strains). bacteremia occurred after catheterization of the femoral vein for a  mean duration of 37 days. the period was significantly shorter than that after catheterization of the subclavian vein (56 days). the major isolates from the subclavian vein were candida spp. (14/17, 82.4%), followed by mrsa (1/17, 5.9%) and mssa (1/17, 5.9%), while isolates from the femoral vein were candida spp. (6/16, 37.5%), mrsa (5/16, 31.3%) and mssa (3/16, 20.8%). catheter removal alone  did not improve the clinical condition, particularly in mrsa bacteremia; the combination of antimicrobial therapy and removal of the catheter was necessary for a better prognosis.

TI  == bacterial agents causing chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  == ear swabs from 350 patients with chronic otitis media attending different orthorhinolaryngological clinics at different hospitals and health centres in benin city and ekpoma in edo state were screened for the presence of bacterial agents of chronic otitis media. results revealed the presence of 19 different species indicating polymicrobial infections. species isolated comprised staphylococcus aureus (33.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3%), proteus mirabilis  (17%), alcaligenes faecalis (6.2%) and klebsiella aerogenes (4.3%). others included escherichia coli (3.3%), proteus rettgeri (2.8%), and staphylococcus epidermidis (2.2%), klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter spp, proteus morgani, haemophilus influenzae, providencia spp, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, non-haemolytic streptococci and diphotheroids, each accounted for less than 2% of isolates. the study also showed a higher prevalence of chronic otitis media among males (55.7%) than females (44.3%). cases of chronic otitis media were highest among the age groups (0-5 years) with a prevalence rate of 50% and least among the 6-10 year age group with a prevalence rate of 14.9%. antibiogram of isolates revealed marked sensitivities (over 90% of the isolates) to ciproxin, tarivid, rocephin and fortum whereas over 70% were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. results have indicated that staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis are leading bacterial agents of otitis media and highlights the high risk involved in the use of penicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cloxacillin and septrin in the management of chronic otitis media in our locality.

TI  == postmortem drug metabolism by bacteria.
AB  == studies were undertaken to determine the possible role of enteric bacteria in the postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam. flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam were completely metabolized in blood in the presence of eight species of enteric bacteria to their respective 7-amino-metabolites. the rates of metabolism, at 37 degrees c, ranged from 0.1 ng/ml/min for streptococcus faecalis to 8.8 ng/ml/min for clostridium perfringens. the rate of conversion was reduced to 87% by a combination of 0.7% (w/v) sodium fluoride and potassium oxalate, and almost completely inhibited (96%) by 1% (w/v) sodium fluoride. ph had variable effects on the rate of metabolic bioconversion of nitrobenzodiazepines, while increasing  temperatures were found to generally increase the rate of nitrobenzodiazepine bioconversion. these data support the proposal that bacteria may mediate postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines.

TI  == the high risk heart donor: potential pitfalls.
AB  == background: the use of potentially infected donor hearts has been advocated to extend the supply of available hearts for transplantation. methods: to determine  whether bacterial transmission from donor to recipient can occur with heart transplantation, we reviewed our experience with the 347 patients who received 360 heart transplants in the utah transplant affiliated hospitals from 1988 to 1993. results: during this time, nineteen donors had positive blood cultures before harvest. sixteen donors had gram-positive bacteremia: staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 9), staphylococcus aureus (n = 5), streptococcus (n = 2). two donors had gram-negative bacteremia: serratia (n = 1) and acinetobacter (n = 1).  one donor had blood cultures positive for both escherichia coli and streptococcus. infectious complications occurred in two of three recipients who received a heart from a donor with gram-negative bacteremia: escherichia coli endocarditis, mediastinitis, sepsis and death in one, and serratia sepsis and mediastinitis in another. in each case the organisms and sensitivities were identical between donor and recipient. no infectious complications related to the donor heart occurred among the 16 recipients who received hearts from donors with gram-positive bacteremia. conclusions: (1) bacterial transmission from donor heart to recipient can occur, (2) bacterial transmission appears to be more common with gram-negative organisms, and (3) infection of the recipient with a gram-negative organism from the donor heart is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

TI  == the effect of ethanol ingestion on killing of streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis by rat neutrophils.
AB  == the precise effects of chronic ethanol ingestion on the role of neutrophil function in pneumococcal pneumonia have not been fully delineated. in this study, the bactericidal capacity of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (pmnl) from rats pair-fed an ethanol-containing liquid diet or a liquid control diet was compared  both in vitro and in vivo. the pmnl were allowed to phagocytose several bacterial species in vitro, and intracellular killing after 1h was determined by plate counts. there was no significant difference in killing of streptococcus pneumoniae types 6b or 37, staphylococcus aureus or staphylococcus epidermidis by pmnl from ethanol-fed and pair-fed rats (e-pmnl and p-pmnl, respectively). however, e-pmnl killed significantly less of streptococcus pneumoniae types 10a,  14 and 19f. to corroborate these results in vivo, rats were infected transtracheally, and quantitative lung counts were performed 1 week post infection. streptococcus pneumoniae types 6b and 37, as well as staphylococcus aureus, were effectively cleared from the lungs of both groups of rats. streptococcus pneumoniae types 10a, 14 and 19f, however, were cleared well from the lungs of pair-fed but not ethanol-fed animals. these data suggest that chronic ethanol ingestion induces a strain-specific deficit in neutrophil bactericidal activity against certain s. pneumoniae which does not extend to commonly encountered staphylococci.

TI  == synergistic interaction between ofloxacin and cefotaxime against common clinical  pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial synergy resulting from combined antibiotic therapy is often important in the treatment of serious bacterial infections. to investigate the interactions between cefotaxime (ctx), desacetylcefotaxime (des), and ofloxacin (ofl), 247 recent clinical isolates were tested for in vitro susceptibility to each antibiotic alone by an agar dilution technique and retested with the various antibiotic combinations using a checkerboard protocol. fractional inhibitory concentrations were calculated for all organisms with all drug combinations. time kill kinetic studies were performed on selected isolates to examine the bactericidal activity of the various antimicrobial combinations. of the 110 gram-negative organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy between ctx, des and ofl was demonstrable for 89 (81%). included in the study were 70 members of the enterobacteriaceae family, 20 isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 strains of acinetobacter baumannii, and 10 isolates of xanthomonas maltophilia. additive activity was observed against an additional 13 (11%) isolates. findings were similar for the 89 gram-positive isolates examined. organisms tested included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (9), methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis (10), enterococcus faecalis (10), and streptococcus pneumoniae (20). synergy or partial synergy was observed against 81 (91%). less synergistic activity was detected, however, with members of the bacteroides fragilis group. of the 48 organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy was noted for only 27 (57%). isolates representative of each major group  of organisms included in the study were tested to determine whether synergistic bactericidal activity was also demonstrable with the three drugs. time kill studies supported the checkerboard results.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bacterial leakage of mineral trioxide aggregate as a root-end filling material.
AB  == previous dye leakage studies have shown that mineral trioxide aggregate leaks significantly less than other commonly used root-end filling materials. this study determined the time needed for staphylococcus epidermidis to penetrate a 3-mm thickness of amalgam, super-eba, intermediate restorative material (irm), or mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) as root-end filling materials. fifty-six single-rooted extracted human teeth were cleaned and shaped using a step-back technique. following root-end resection, 48 root-end cavities were filled with amalgam, super-eba, irm, or mta. four root-end cavities were filled with thermoplasticized gutta-percha without a root canal sealer (+ control), and another four were filled with sticky wax covered with two layers of nail polish (- control). after attaching the teeth to plastic caps of 12-ml plastic vials and placing the root ends into phenol red broth, the set-ups were sterilized overnight with ethylene dioxide gas. a tenth of a microliter of broth containing  s. epidermidis was placed into the root canal of 46 teeth (40 experimental, 3 positive, and 3 negative control groups). in addition, the root canals of two teeth with test root-end filling materials and one tooth from the positive and negative control groups were filled with sterile saline. the number of days required for the test bacteria to penetrate various root-end filling materials was determined. most samples whose apical 3 mm were filled with amalgam, super-eba, or irm began leaking at 6 to 57 days.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == a prospective study of microorganisms in urine and bladder biopsies from interstitial cystitis patients and controls.
AB  == objectives: interstitial cystitis (ic) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the bladder of unknown etiology. we tested the hypothesis that a microorganism would  be found at higher prevalence in urine or bladder tissue from women with ic than  from control women. methods: urine and bladder tissue were obtained at cystoscopy from 11 ic patients and 7 control subjects. these specimens were cultured for a variety of fastidious and nonfastidious bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and viruses. in addition, special staining techniques were used to examine biopsy specimens and cytospun urine, and tissue sections and outgrowths of explanted bladder cells were examined by electron microscopy. results: cultures of urine from 6 of 11 ic patients grew five different bacteria (corynebacterium sp. klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacillus sp, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus morbillorum), human cytomegalovirus, or torulopsis glabrata; one of these organisms (lactobacillus sp) was found in urine from 2 patients. although contamination by urethral organisms is possible, the prevalence of microorganisms in urine of ic patients (6 of 11) was significantly greater than in urine of control subjects (0 of 7) (p < 0.05). acridine orange staining revealed rods with appropriate morphology in urine from 4 of the 5 ic patients who had positive bacterial cultures and yeastlike organisms in urine and bladder tissue specimens  that grew torulopsis. additionally, rodlike organisms were seen in urine from 2 ic patients with negative bacterial cultures and cocci were seen in the urine of  1 control patient. biopsy specimens from 2 ic patients grew torulopsis sp or lactobacillus sp, in agreement with the results of acridine orange staining and culture of urine from these patients; in contrast, specimens from 3 control subjects grew small numbers of pseudomonas sp or staphylococcus epidermidis, but  no organisms were cultured from urine or seen in acridine orange-stained tissue smears. all other cultures and stains were negative. conclusions: these data do not provide evidence that ic is associated with infection or colonization by a single microorganism. however, they do generate the hypothesis that the prevalence of microorganisms, especially bacteria at low concentrations, is greater in the urine of ic patients than of control subjects. if these results are confirmed by other controlled studies, the question of whether the presence of these organisms is a cause or a result of ic should be addressed.

TI  == phagocytosis of streptococcus pneumoniae measured in vitro and in vivo in a rat model of carbon tetrachloride-induced liver cirrhosis.
AB  == both humans and rats with liver cirrhosis have increased morbidity and mortality  from pneumococcal pneumonia. by use of a rat model of carbon tetrachloride-induced liver cirrhosis, uptake of fluorochrome-labeled streptococcus pneumoniae by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnl) and alveolar macrophages (am) was examined by flow cytometry. peripheral blood pmnl from cirrhotic rats showed no defect in phagocytic or bactericidal capacity for type 10a s. pneumoniae in vitro. however, in vivo, fewer type 3 s. pneumoniae were engulfed by pmnl in the lungs of cirrhotic rats with a concomitant increase in the number of organisms taken up by their am in comparison with controls. these studies indicate the importance of using more relevant in vivo methodologies for  assessing bacterial phagocytosis. in addition, the reduction in uptake of type 3  pneumococci by pmnl within the microenvironment of the cirrhotic rat lung could help to explain the increased susceptibility of cirrhotic rats to pneumococcal pneumonia.

AB  == an 83 year old caucasian woman with necrotizing fasciitis (nf) of the right hand  is described. staphylococcus epidermidis was the only organism cultured. serology failed to demonstrate streptococcus pyogenes, the common pathogen of nf. despite  antibiotic therapy, gangrene supervened, necessitating digital amputation. staphylococcus epidermidis is usually non-pathogenic, but review of the literature indicates that it is relatively commonly found with other pathogens in nf. accordingly, studies of immune status were undertaken. apart from reduced myeloperoxidase production (30-50% of normal levels), all humoral, cell-mediated  and neutrophil function tests were normal. this is the first report of staphylococcus epidermidis as the sole isolate in nf and also the only study of immune status of nf patients. it is concluded that a non-virulent organism (e.g.  staphylococcus epidermidis) may be pathogenic in the face of advanced age alone.  elevated fibrin degradation productions were also demonstrated in the patient, consistent with lysis of localized intravascular thrombus. the role of anticoagulation in nf is discussed.

AB  == mechanisms of resistance of strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, neisseria meningitidis and mycobacterium tuberculosis to antibiotics are presented and discussed. the resistance to methicillin-oxacillin in s. aureus and s. epidermidis is chromosomally-mediated by sequence of dna, namely by gene meca. this gene codes altered pbp-2a protein. strains of s.pneumoniae contain pbp-1a, pbp-2b and pbp-2x proteins. they cause resistance to many beta-lactam antibiotics. resistance to vankomycin, respectively to teikoplanin in strains of  e. faecalis and e. faecium is coded by transferable vana and vanb genes. strains  of n. meningitidis produce mostly the altered pbp-2 protein. the increase of resistance in strains of m. tuberculosis is also significant.

AB  == the effect on the microbial ulcer flora of wet gauze dressings soaked in antiseptic solutions used for desloughing leg ulcers is not known. quantitative cultures were therefore performed in 45 venous leg ulcers, before application and after 15 minutes' treatment with gauze dressings with four different antiseptic solutions: aluminium acetotartrate (alsol) 1%, potassium permanganate 0.015%, acetic acid 0.25% and chloramine 0.25%. the percentage of ulcers with each type of microorganism did not differ before and after application of the antiseptic solutions. staphylococcus aureus was found in 79% of the ulcers, gram-negative rods in 39%, s. epidermidis in 21%, proteus spp in 21%, pseudomonas spp in 14% and fungi in none. potassium permanganate reduced the mean number of bacteria per ulcer from 4.4 x 10(6) to 0.9 x 10(6) (ns), chloramine from 2.7 x 10(6) to 2.2 x  10(6) (ns), alsol from 1.2 x 10(7) to 3.5 x 10(6) (ns) and acetic acid from 6.3 x 10(6) to 2.6 x 10(5) (p = 0.007). s. aureus was reduced by acetic acid (p = 0.002), gram-negative rods by both chloramine (p = 0.03) and acetic acid (p = 0.03). the number of pseudomonas, proteus, s. epidermidis and streptococcus haemolyticus group g was not reduced significantly (p > 0.05) by any of the solutions.

TI  == efficacy and safety of gentamicin and streptomycin in optisol-gs, a preservation  medium for donor corneas.
AB  == increasing reports of gentamicin-resistant bacteria contaminating donor corneas and causing endophthalmitis have indicated that preservation of corneal storage media with 100 micrograms/ml of gentamicin alone needs reevaluation. we investigated the stability and possible cytotoxicity of streptomycin as a supplement to gentamicin in optisol corneal storage medium. the combination of gentamicin and streptomycin in optisol solution was stable at room temperature for at least 4 weeks and inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, alpha hemolytic streptococci, streptococcus group d, propionibacterium acnes, escherichia coli, and diphtheroids, but not pseudomonas  aeruginosa. the addition of vancomycin did not significantly improve the antibacterial effectiveness of the gentamicin and streptomycin combination when stored at 4 degrees c. the growth of 15 of 20 clinical ocular isolates of ps. aeruginosa was suppressed by the gentamicin-streptomycin combination. streptomycin in concentrations of up to 1,000 micrograms/ml did not decrease the  mitotic activity of corneal endothelial cells as evaluated by the in vitro incorporation of tritiated thymidine or cause cytotoxicity. the addition of 200 micrograms/ml of streptomycin to optisol corneal storage medium containing 100 micrograms/ml of gentamicin may significantly improve activity against gentamicin-sensitive and gentamicin-resistant contaminants.

TI  == [antiseptic and antibiotic resistance of 310 gram-positive strains isolated from  udders after use of post-milking teat germicides].
AB  == the sensitivity of 310 gram-positive strains, isolated from milking cows udders,  to 4 antiseptics (cetrimide, chlorhexidine, hexachlorophene and mercury) and 9 antibiotics (ampicillin, streptomycin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin,  tetracycline, gentamycin, novobiocin and oxacillin) was determined. the statistical analysis of correlation was carried out for the bacterial species studied (staphylococcus, streptococcus and bacillus), the scattering of the minimum inhibitory concentrations of which has proved to be statistically heterogeneous towards antiseptics and antibiotics. this analysis revealed positive links between chlorhexidine and 5 antibiotics for streptococcus and between hexachlorophene and oxacillin for bacillus. the analysis of results at the level of bacterial species, taking into account a loss of sensitivity of 4 times the modal minimum inhibitory concentration of the species reveals the importance of the strains which are resistant to many antibiotics and especially  the enterococcus and the species staphylococcus epidermidis. indeed, these strains are possible reservoirs of plasmids of resistance to antibiotics and antiseptics.

TI  == opsonic activity of commercially available standard intravenous immunoglobulin preparations.
AB  == several standard intravenous immunoglobulin g (ivig) products are available in the united states and have been used with the intent to treat or prevent infections in neonates. we evaluated more than 100 lots of ivig, from 6 products, to determine the amount of opsonic antibody against neonatal pathogens. neutrophil-mediated opsonophagocytosis was used to determine opsonic activity in  these preparations for staphylococcus epidermidis; haemophilus influenzae type b; streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 3, 14 and 19; group b streptococcus serotypes  ia, ib, ia/c, ii and iii; and escherichia coli (k1). pathogen-specific opsonic activity of the lots tested ranged from undetectable to 1:80 and was detectable in < 10% to > 90% of lots tested depending on the organism and manufacturer. within an ivig lot there was variable opsonic activity against different strains  or serotypes of the same organism. opsonic activity was significantly (p < or = 0.05) affected by the manufacturer's donor pool and less so by the manufacturing  method. we conclude that the pathogen-specific opsonic antibody activity of an ivig lot is: (1) highly variable for several common neonatal pathogens; (2) predominantly dependent on the donor pool and not the manufacturing method. clinicians may more appropriately select therapy if the pathogen-specific antibody content of ivig products by lot are known. in the future neonatal ivig research should focus on using preparations with known pathogen-specific antibody activity.

TI  == a rapid method to quantify bacterial contamination on hatching eggs. 1. correlation of optical density with initial bacterial count.
AB  == the use of optical-density (od) readings after a 6-h incubation period, as a suitable method to quantify the bacterial contamination on hatching eggs, was established by the use of pure cultures of five bacterial isolates found to be the most prevalent on the hatching eggs examined. these isolates were identified  as micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus gallinarum, streptococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas cepacei and bacillus cereus. it was established that the od reading was repeatable when the same inoculum was used to inoculate five different cultures, which were incubated for 6 h at 37 degrees c. this repeatability was not affected by bacterial isolate, or bacterial concentration of the inoculum, or when mixed bacterial cultures were used. a direct relationship was established between the od reading (at 540 nm) after 6 h and the log of the bacterial concentration at the start of incubation. the od reading after 6 h of incubation  is a repeatable, rapid and simple method to quantify the bacterial concentration  at the start of the incubation period.

TI  == the targeting of phospholipid liposomes to bacteria.
AB  == phospholipid liposomes have been prepared from phospholipid mixtures including dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol (dppc/pi) and dppc/dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (dppc/dppg) mixtures and targeted to adsorbed biofilms of the skin-associated bacteria staphylococcus epidermidis and  proteus vulgaris and the oral bacterium streptococcus sanguis. the effects of time, liposome concentration and density of bacteria in the biofilm have been studied in detail for staphylococcus epidermidis. the targeting (as assessed by the apparent monolayer coverage of the biofilms by liposomes) to the biofilms was found to be sensitive to the mol% of pi and dppg in the liposomes and optimum levels of pi were found for targeting to each bacterium. the use of pi and dppg-containing liposomes for the delivery of the bactericide, triclosan, to biofilms of staphylococcus epidermidis was studied as a function of the amount of triclosan carried by the liposomes. all the liposome systems tested inhibited the growth of bacteria from the biofilms after brief (2 min) exposure to triclosan-carrying liposomes. at low triclosan levels bacterial growth inhibition by triclosan-carrying liposomes exceeded that by an equivalent level of free triclosan. after short periods (min) of exposure of biofilms to triclosan-carrying liposomes the bactericide was shown to preferentially concentrate in the biofilms relative to its liposomal lipid carrier. the results  suggest that phospholipid liposomes with appropriately chosen lipid composition have potential for the targeting and delivery of bactericide to bacteria.

TI  == evaluation of unstented aortic homografts for the treatment of prosthetic aortic  valve endocarditis.
AB  == background: prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis is a serious complication that carries a high morbidity and mortality. aortic homografts have been used in this  setting, but long-term results are not available. methods and results: over a 23-year period, 48 patients presented with infected aortic valve substitutes: 28  homografts, 15 mechanical, and 5 xenografts. nineteen patients had emergency surgery, and the mean interval between the first and second operation was 5.9 years (range, 1 month to 22 years). in 28 patients, the preoperative new york heart association (nyha) class was iii or iv. active endocarditis was present in  39 patients, and the microorganisms grown were staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 13), staphylococcus aureus (n = 6), streptococcus viridans (n = 6), streptococcus faecalis (n = 4), candida albicans (n = 5), and gram-negative spp (n = 2). aortic root abscesses were found in 28 (58%) patients, and transesophageal echocardiography was 95% accurate in their localization. all patients received homograft aortic valves, 19 as root replacement and 29 using the freehand technique. there were four (8.3%) early deaths; poor left ventricular function and concomitant procedure were identified as risk factors. at a mean follow-up of 4 years (range, 2 months to 19 years) 95% of the patients were in nyha class i or ii without significant aortic regurgitation. the actuarial survival at 5 years was 97% (confidence limit, 84% to 100%), and freedom from endocarditis at 10 years was 97% (confidence limit, 84% to 100%). multivariate analysis did not identify risk factors for these late events. conclusions: homograft aortic valves offer good early and long-term results in patients with infected aortic valve substitutes.

AB  == primers specific to conserved and variable regions in the 16s rrna sequence were  selected from the partially sequenced 16s rrna genes of neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the pcr assay was divided into two dna amplifications. the first resulted in a general bacterial amplicon, and the second resulted in a species-specific amplicon. the high specificity of the pcr assay was documented after testing bacteria of 28 different species (133 strains). a total of 304 clinical cerebrospinal fluid samples, including 125 samples from patients with bacterial meningitis, were assayed to investigate the  diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for bacterial meningitis. the assay showed high sensitivity (0.94) and specificity (0.96) with the clinical samples, although some false results were obtained, the reasons for which are discussed. with agarose gel electrophoresis for detection of the pcr products, the detection limit for meningococci in cerebrospinal fluid was 3 x 10(2) cfu/ml.

TI  == bacterial interference in vitro. comparison between a quantitative kinetic and a  cocultivation blood agar test method.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare two methods for estimation of bacterial growth interference between various bacteria using a bioscreen robot analyzer, allowing kinetic documentation, and a cocultivation test on blood agar  plates. six laboratory strains with different virulence and growth requirements were used: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mitis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the interference activity was correlated with a reference system of streptococcus sanguis (strain alpha 89) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci, gas serotypes t 9 and t 22). the methods used and results obtained were as follows: 1. estimation of synergistic and antagonistic bacterial interferences using a bioscreen robot analyzer. suspensions of viable bacteria were added to microtiter plates with different concentrations of uv light-killed bacteria in liquid media. the bioscreen analyzer monitored bacterial growth every 10 min for 24 h giving kinetic data during the growth period. synergisms as well as antagonisms were demonstrated between the tested bacterial  strains which have not earlier been reported in the literature. however, the antagonistic effect observed between the six strains was less than that induced by the s. sanguis strain on the two strains of s. pyogenes. 2. cocultivation of bacterial strains on blood agar surface with precultivated or simultaneously stamped interfering bacteria indicated no detectable interference between the six tested bacterial strains, while the s. sanguis strain inhibited the growth of s.  pyogenes strains as well as the hemolysis around the colonies. the bioscreen method was found more sensitive for testing bacterial interference compared to the commonly used blood agar test.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of sy5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. sy5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, clostridium spp., and bacteroides fragilis. against providencia spp., proteus spp., and haemophilus influenzae, sy5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. sy5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. enterococcus faecium, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. the bactericidal activities of sy5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the mics for clinical isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. sy5555  was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. however, sy5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by x. maltophilia (l-1) and p. aeruginosa/pms354 beta-lactamases, two bush group 3 beta-lactamases, sy5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from  c. freundii gn7391 and e. cloacae gn7471 strains. these results suggest that sy5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.

AB  == to investigate the conditions that have developed in the treatment of posttraumatic meningitis with the use of new antibiotics, the authors studied cases with this infection retrospectively for a period of 68 months. among 860 patients with moderate to severe head injuries, 12 (1.39%) sustained this complication. of these, nine patients (75%) had a demonstrable basilar skull fracture and seven (58.3%) presented obvious rhinorrhea. of these seven, four (57.1%) were treated conservatively and three (42.8%) finally underwent surgery for dural repair. the infecting agents were gram-positive cocci (staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus warneri, staphylococcus cohnii, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) in five patients and gram-negative bacilli in six patients (escherichia coli in two, klebsiella pneumoniae in two, and acinetobacter anitratus in two). in one patient, the culture results were negative. all gram-negative strains appeared resistant to ampicillin and third-generation cephalosporins, but sensitive to imipenem and to the quinolone ciprofloxacin. gram-positive strains were sensitive to vancomycin. hydrocephalus  finally developed in the two patients who had received intrathecal infusions of amikacin. no other report of the relation of intrathecal infusion of antibiotics  and the development of hydrocephalus was found. all patients survived, indicating that, for the present, posttraumatic meningitis is a nonfatal complication of head injury.

TI  == childhood bacteremia in israel: causes, age relation, predisposing factors and source.
AB  == to delineate the spectrum of childhood bacteremia in a tertiary medical center in israel and to define the historical, clinical and environmental variables that affect it, 339 bacteremic episodes were studied. ten of the episodes (3%) were polymicrobial and 148 (44%) were hospital acquired. staphylococcus epidermidis (17%), staph. aureus (10%), gram-negative bacilli and haemophilus influenzae (7%) were the most frequent etiologic pathogens. some organisms (e.g., h. influenzae,  streptococcus pneumoniae) caused mainly community-acquired bacteremia, while klebsiella sp., enterococcus faecalis, and acinetobacter sp. caused mainly nosocomial bacteremia. underlying conditions were noted in 72% of the bacteremic  children. a source of the bacteremia was identified in 60% of the episodes; the most common was i.v.-line infection. age, underlying condition, source and location in the hospital markedly affected the profile of microorganisms causing  childhood bacteremia. each of these variables defined 3-5 organisms that were most prominent. in each episode of suspected bacteremia, these variables should be considered, thus defining the most likely causative pathogen(s), which should  be covered by appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment.

TI  == group b streptococcus-induced nitric oxide production in murine macrophages is cr3 (cd11b/cd18) dependent.
AB  == nitric oxide (no) is produced by murine macrophages in response to cytokines and/or gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide. no induction by gram-positive  bacteria such as group b streptococci (gbs), the major etiologic agents of neonatal pneumonia and meningitis, has received little study. gbs as well as two  other gram-positive bacterial species, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, were found to stimulate no production in thioglycolate-elicited murine macrophages and in the mouse macrophage cell line j774a.1 in the presence  of gamma interferon. serotype ia and iii gbs were both stimulatory, as were asialo- and type antigen-deficient mutant strains of type iii gbs. no production  was dose dependent, inhibitable by l-arginine analogs, and unaffected by polymyxin b. since phagocytosis by murine and human phagocytes of gbs is dependent on complement receptor type 3 (cr3), the role of cr3 in the no response to gbs was tested in the cr3-deficient myelomonocytic cell line wehi-3. gbs did not induce no, whereas s. aureus or lipopolysaccharide did induce no in wehi-3 cells. s. epidermidis, whose nonopsonic phagocytosis is also cr3 dependent, failed to induce no in wehi-3 cells. monoclonal anti-cr3 (anti-cd11b or anti-cd18) in the presence of interferon also induced no production in thioglycolate-elicited macrophages and in j774a.1 cells but not in wehi-3 cells.  this evidence suggests that ligated cr3 and gamma interferon act synergistically  to induce no production and that cr3 mediates the gbs-induced signal for no production in interferon-treated macrophages.

TI  == handwashing machines, handwashing compliance, and potential for cross-contamination.
AB  == although handwashing is considered an important factor in the prevention of nosocomial infections, the optimal technique has not been determined and compliance is often difficult to obtain. handwashing compliance is particularly important in intensive care areas of the hospital. in an effort to improve hw compliance, the surgical intensive care unit in our hospital purchased three handwashing machines. four months after installation of the handwashing machines, an outbreak of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus occurred in the intensive care unit. as part of evaluating the outbreak, we cultured the handwashing machines, including the portholes and the paper towel dispenser. cultures were positive for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, achromobacter species, and streptococcus viridans. the design of the handwashing  machines made contamination of sleeves and already-washed hands possible. an observational study revealed that handwashing compliance was poor but improved from 22% to 38% when the handwashing machines were in use. nurses preferred handwashing at the sink and physicians preferred the handwashing machine. handwashing machines may increase handwashing compliance because of their novelty, but they may also result in novel problems.

TI  == [method of dna extraction and meca, fema and pbp2' in multi-drug resistant bacterial strains].
AB  == recently, it has become more important to establish rapid and reliable methods for identifying bacterial species and their drug resistances because of the high  incidence of nosocomial infection caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria. at first, several enzymes were tested to evaluate the efficacy of dna extraction. n-acetylmuramidase, lysozyme and achromopeptidase were most effective to extract  dna from e. faecalis, e. faecium and s. aureus, respectively. after achromopeptidase extraction, the meca gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in clinically isolated mrsa (95 strains), mssa (66), mrse (methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, 37), msse (methicillin-sensitive s. epidermidis, 1), s haemolyticus(5), s.hominis(1) and others (enterococcus, pseudomonas, and streptococcus, total 45). pcr products were analyzed by agarose  gel electrophoresis. the positive rates were 95% (mrsa), 1.5% (mssa), and 97% (mrse). the meca gene was also positive in 2/2 of methicillin-resistant s.haemolyticus and 2/3 of methicillin-sensitive s.haemolyticus and 1/1 of methicillin-resistant s.hominis. the meca gene was not detected in 45 non-staphylococcal strains. meca and fema gene by pcr and pbp 2' by irma were further detected in newly isolated mrsa (20 strains), mssa(20), mrse(14), msse(1) and s.simulans(2). complete correlation between mpipc susceptibility and meca were found. the fema gene was positive in 39/40 of s. aureus, and 0/14 of s.epidermidis, 2/3 of s.simulans. pbp2' were positive in 20/20 of mrsa, 0/20 of mssa, 14/14 of mrse, 0/1 of msse, 1/1 of methicillin-resistant s.simulans, and 0/2 of methicillin-sensitive s.simulans. in conclusion, diagnoses of mrsa by simultaneous detection of meca and fema gene as well as pbp2' are similarly useful because of their specificity and rapidity.

AB  == platelet concentrates (pc) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. we evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (pcd) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-mop) and long wavelength uv light (uva) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic pc. twelve phylogenetically distinct  pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into pc to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. contaminated pc were treated with 8-mop (5 micrograms/ml) and 5 j/cm2 of uva, a pcd treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of all 5 gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. the remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) cfu/ml inactivated under these conditions. the inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when pc were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-mop concentration (23.4 micrograms/ml). illumination with 3 j/cm2 of uva in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (salmonella choleraesuis, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) cfu/ml of the most resistant gram-negative organism (pseudomonas aeruginosa). this level of pcd treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. these results demonstrate that pcd using 8-mop (5 to 23.4 micrograms/ml) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in pc with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of krm-1648 and krm-1657, new rifamycin derivatives.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of the new rifamycin derivatives krm-1648 and krm-1657 were compared with those of rifampin. rifabutin, ciprofloxacin, and clarithromycin were also tested for reference. the  respective mics of krm-1648 and krm-1657 for 90% of the strains tested (mic90s) were 0.016 and 0.0078 microgram/ml, respectively, for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 0.016 and 0.0039 microgram/ml, respectively, for methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and 0.0625 and 0.016 microgram/ml, respectively, for methicillin- and quinolone-resistant s. aureus. these mic90s of krm-1657 were equal to or 2- to 64-fold lower than those of rifampin. krm-1648 and krm-1657 with mic90s of between 0.002 and 0.078 microgram/ml were 2- to 128-fold more active than rifampin against staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus species, including streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. the mic90s of krm-1657 for haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were 0.25 and 0.1 microgram/ml, respectively; krm-1657 was almost as active as rifampin and was 8- to 16-fold more active than krm-1648 against these strains. the frequency  of occurrence of spontaneous mutations to resistance to krm-1648 and krm-1657 was equal to that to rifampin. against systemic infection with s. aureus in mice, the efficacies of krm-1648 and krm-1657 were comparable to that of rifampin.

TI  == microorganisms on toothbrushes at day-care centers.
AB  == the microflora on 44 toothbrushes at 4 day-care centers in the city of goteborg have been investigated as a presumptive risk factor for transmission of microorganisms by children. non-supervised toothbrushing without the use of toothpaste was performed at the day-care centers twice a day. streptococci, predominantly s. salivarius, s. sanguis, and s. mitis, were the most frequently recorded group of microorganisms and generally constituted the greatest part of the flora (on average, 50%). beta-hemolytic streptococci were not found in any sample. haemophilus species were noted in 82% of the samples. h. parainfluenzae being the most frequent, and h. influenzae being identified in only one sample. anaerobes constituted on average a third of the microflora. staphylococci were identified in 86% of the samples, s. epidermidis dominating. fungi including molds were found in 50% of the samples, and from one day-care center large numbers of enteric organisms were identified. thus this study shows that unsupervised toothbrushing at day-care centers can be questioned, more from a general hygienic point of view than from the risk of transmitting serious pathogens.

TI  == ceftibuten pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. focus on paediatric use.
AB  == ceftibuten is an extended-spectrum, cephem antimicrobial agent formulated for oral administration. ceftibuten is absorbed by carrier-mediated processes and passive diffusion. the absorption of ceftibuten is described adequately by a first-order process. following oral administration, peak serum ceftibuten concentrations are reached within 2 to 3 hours. although the absolute bioavailability of ceftibuten in humans is not known, its relative bioavailability indicates that there is relatively rapid and complete absorption  of the drug. administration of ceftibuten with food may decrease the rate of absorption and, in the case of high fat meals, may decrease the extent of absorption by approximately 20 to 30%. the results of limited studies indicate that the drug distributes well into various body tissues and fluids, with relatively high concentrations being achieved in organs that receive a significant portion of the cardiac output. in adults with normal renal function or chronic renal failure, the apparent volume of distribution (vd/f) for ceftibuten ranges from 0.2 to 0.4 l/kg and the total plasma clearance (cl/f) ranges from approximately 61 to 75 ml/min (3.7 to 4.5 l/h). studies of ceftibuten elimination in adults have demonstrated positive linear correlation between cl/f  and creatinine clearance. following administration of a single dose of ceftibuten, approximately 67 to 94% of the drug has been recovered in the urine unchanged. the elimination half-life (t1/2 beta) of ceftibuten in adults with normal renal function is approximately 2.5 hours. significant accumulation of ceftibuten does not occur with repeated administration. despite the fact that the mean time taken to achieve maximal serum concentration (tmax) [1.1 to 2 hours] and t1/2 beta (2.1 hours) following administration of a single dose of ceftibuten to infants and children were similar to values previously reported in adults, the vd/f (0.42 l/kg) and cl/f (3.1 ml/h/kg) were considerably greater in children younger than 5 years. additionally, the apparent nonrenal clearance of ceftibuten in paediatric patients (52% of cl/f) was greater than reported for adults (approximately 32% of cl/f) with normal renal function. thus, developmental differences appear to affect the pharmacokinetic profile of ceftibuten. ceftibuten has a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, and is stable to hydrolysis by a large number of beta-lactamases. notable exceptions with regard to the gram-positive spectrum for ceftibuten include relative or documented resistance for most strains of listeria, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, penicillin-resistant  strains of streptococcus pneumonia and s. enterococcus.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == endocarditis with pericardial bioprostheses: clinico-pathologic characteristics,  immediate and long term prognosis.
AB  == between 1977 and 1992, 30 consecutive episodes of infective endocarditis in 28 patients involving pericardial bioprostheses were diagnosed and treated in our hospital. eleven (37%) were early pericardial valve endocarditis occurring in the first 60 days following valve surgery, and 19 (63%) were late endocarditis. in both the early and late groups, more aortic that mitral valves were affected (19/30). the most frequent pathogen in the early cases was staphylococcus, (s. epidermidis in five cases, s. aureus in one). the most frequent pathogen among late cases was streptococcus: (st. viridans in four, st. faecalis in two, st. bovis in one). in four cases (13%) no pathogen was isolated. twelve patients received antibiotic treatment alone, six specific for the pathogen and other six  only arbitrarily chosen regimen. all patients were cured in the former and all patients died in the latter group (four with negative blood cultures and two in whom identification of the pathogen was delayed-proteus mirabillis in one case and brucella mellitensis in the other). valve replacement during the infective endocarditis episode was necessary in 18 cases, either because of failure of the  antibiotic treatment or because of heart failure secondary to prosthetic malfunction. peri-annular abscess was present in five cases. surgical mortality was 22.2% (4/18). in all, 11 patients (39%) died during the active stage of infective endocarditis. the most frequent cause of death was heart failure (45.5%). all four patients with negative blood cultures died. the most advisable  strategy for treating bacterial endocarditis of pericardial bioprostheses is a combination of antibiotic therapy and early surgery, especially in cases of staphylococcus endocarditis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == loofah sponges as reservoirs and vehicles in the transmission of potentially pathogenic bacterial species to human skin.
AB  == loofah sponges are natural products used as exfoliative beauty aids. as a consequence of tracing a case of pseudomonas aeruginosa folliculitis to a contaminated loofah sponge, we assessed the role of loofah sponges in supporting  the growth of a wide variety of bacterial species. our data show growth enhancement of sterile loofah fragments for numerous gram-negative (pseudomonas,  xanthomonas, and klebsiella) and gram-positive (enterococcus and group b streptococcus) species of human and environmental origin. furthermore, hydrated new, unused loofah sponges undergo a shift in bacterial flora from sparse colonies of bacillus spp. and staphylococcus epidermidis to a predominantly gram-negative flora. the growth-promoting potential of loofah sponges (and other  exfoliatives) can be further augmented by desquamated epithelial cells entrapped  in the loofah fibrous matrix. therefore, as loofah sponges (and other exfoliatives) can serve as a reservoir and a vehicle for the transmission of potentially pathogenic species to the human skin, we recommend their decontamination with hypochlorite (10%) bleach at regular intervals.

TI  == growth phase-dependent regulation and membrane localization of spab, a protein involved in biosynthesis of the lantibiotic subtilin.
AB  == the information responsible for biosynthesis of the lantibiotic subtilin is organized in an operon-like structure that starts with the spab gene. the spab gene encodes an open reading frame consisting of 1,030 amino acid residues, and it was calculated that a protein having a theoretical molecular mass of 120.5 kda could be produced from this gene. this is consistent with the apparent molecular  weight for spab of 115,000 which was estimated after sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and identification with spab-specific antibodies. the spab protein is very similar to proteins epib and nisb, which were identified previously as being involved in epidermin and nisin biosynthesis. upstream from spab a characteristic sigma a promoter sequence was identified. an immunoblot analysis revealed that spab expression was strongly regulated. no spab protein was detected in the early logarithmic growth phase, and maximum spab expression was observed in the early stationary growth phase. the expression of spab was strongly correlated with subtilin biosynthesis. deletion mutations in either of two recently identified regulatory genes, spar and spak, which act as a "two-component" regulatory system necessary for growth phase-dependent induction  of subtilin biosynthesis (c. klein, c. kaletta, and k. d. entian, appl. environ.  microbiol. 59:296-303, 1993), also resulted in failure of spab expression. to investigate the intracellular localization of spab, vesicles of bacillus subtilis were prepared. the spab protein cosedimented with the vesicle fraction and was released only after vigorous resuspension of the vesicles. our results suggest that spab is membrane associated and that subtilin biosynthesis occurs at the cytoplasmic membrane of b. subtilis.

TI  == prevalence of beta-lactamase enzyme production in bacteria isolated from women with postpartum endometritis.
AB  == one hundred eighty-four postpartum patients with the diagnosis of endomyometritis underwent intrauterine culturing. beta-lactamase production was tested using nitrocephin-impregnated discs in 278 bacterial isolates from patients with postpartum endometritis. beta-lactamase production was found to be present in 149 of 278 (54%) isolates tested: 0 of 39 streptococcus faecalis (0%), 22 of 41 escherichia coli (54%), 66 of 68 bacteroides bivius (97%), 0 of 13 proteus mirabilis (0%) and 15 of 42 staphylococcus epidermidis (36%). anaerobes, as a group, had the highest rate of beta-lactamase production, 94 of 102 (93%), followed by gram negatives, 34 of 84 (40%), then gram positives, 21 of 91 (23%).  however, it was the beta-lactamase produced by the gram-negative bacteria that was most responsive to the addition of a beta-lactamase inhibitor. the frequent isolation of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria from patients with postpartum endometritis raises concern about the use of antibiotics not resistant to these enzymes. therefore, antibiotics combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor may have potential as single-agent therapy in obstetric and gynecologic infections.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of dv-7751a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == we compared the in vitro antibacterial activity of dv-7751a against gram-positive and -negative bacteria with those of quinolones currently available. mics for 90% of the strains tested (mic90s) against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.20, 0.39, 0.20, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. moreover, mic50s for dv-7751a against ofloxacin-resistant methicillin-resistant s. aureus were 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-fold lower than those for tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. dv-7751a inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and peptostreptococcus spp. at  0.39, 0.39, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, and was 4- to > 16-fold more active against enterococci at the mic90 level than the other quinolones tested. the activity of dv-7751a against pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin at the mic90 level and was two- to fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin. dv-7751a showed activity comparable to  those of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against the other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90s of 0.025, 0.20, and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively). dv-7751a activity  was not affected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions and in human urine, as were the other quinolones tested. time-kill curve studies demonstrated the rapid bactericidal action of dv-7751a against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and p. aeruginosa. the frequency of spontaneous resistance to dv-7751a was less than or  equal to those of the reference drugs. dv-7751a inhibited the supercoiling activity of dna gyrases from s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa at concentrations comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin.

TI  == association of microbiologic flora with clinical, endoscopic, and pulmonary cytologic findings in foals with distal respiratory tract infection.
AB  == undifferentiated distal respiratory tract disease (nasal discharge, cough, pneumonia) in foals (1 to 8 months old) is a burdensome economic problem on breeding farms; yet, the infective agents associated with these episodes have not been well described. possible causes of these episodes of illness were investigated by culturing specimens of proximal and distal airways of clinically  diseased foals (n = 101), prior to any treatment, for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and viruses (rhinoviruses, equine arteritis virus, equine herpesvirus subtype 1 [ehv-1], influenza virus, and adenovirus). pairs of sera (n = 47) were  examined for antibodies to influenza a virus, equine subtypes 1 and 2, ehv-1, and adenovirus antigens, and sera obtained from foals during acute infection were examined for antibodies (by agar gel immunodiffusion [agid]) to equi factor antigens of rhodococcus equi. viruses were not isolated from the proximal (swab)  or distal (bronchial lavage) airway specimens in foals, and only 2 of 47 randomly selected foals seroconverted to ehv-1. serotiters to the other viruses were low and frequently decreasing between samples, which was compatible with maternally derived antibody. streptococcus zooepidemicus was the predominant isolate from bronchial lavage specimens (88/101 cases), accompanied by alpha-hemolytic streptococci (8 cases), bordetella bronchiseptica (13 cases), staphylococcus epidermidis (9 cases), and other organisms in lesser frequency. only str zooepidemicus was recovered significantly (p < 0.05) more often in cases than in  controls. the agid test was found useful to detect foals with presumed exposure to r equi, but positive tests results did not correspond well with bacterial culture results; positive agid results were recorded in 34% of culture-negative foals.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == significance of serial c-reactive protein responses in neonatal infection and other disorders.
AB  == objective: this study was performed to determine prospectively whether, in the presence of proved or presumed bacterial infection, the sensitivity of serum c-reactive protein (crp) response could be enhanced by serial rather than single  determinations. we also sought to assess crp responses to clinically identified noninfectious disorders. design: the crp responses of 491 infants on 691 occasions of suspected infection were assessed. crp levels were measured initially and twice again at 12-hour intervals (rate immunonephelometry). assessments also included a blood culture, complete blood cell count, and chest radiograph and culture of spinal fluid when appropriate. crp responses were correlated with four designated clinical groups: (1) positive blood or cerebrospinal fluid cultures (n = 190); (2) negative blood culture-definite infection (necrotizing enterocolitis stages 2 and 3, pneumonia, subcutaneous abscess) (n = 52); (3) negative blood culture-possible infection (antenatal risk  factors, meconium aspiration, positive urine group b streptococcus antigen, necrotizing enterocolitis stage 1, febrile infants) (n = 287); and (4) negative blood culture-no infection (respiratory distress syndrome, transient tachypnea of the newborn, patent ductus arteriosus, tissue trauma) (n = 160). diagnoses were made before crp results were known. results: in all, 187 (27%) of the blood cultures were positive. a single organism was recovered from 174 of these; two organisms from 13. among the single-organism cultures, 50 (29%) were gram-negative, 120 (69%) were gram-positive, and 4 (2%) were budding yeasts. crp  levels were elevated in various groups as follows: in the positive blood culture  group (by organism), gram-negative rods, 92% (46/50); group b streptococcus, 92%  (12/13); staphylococcus aureus, 89% (8/9); group d streptococcus, 71% (10/14); streptococcus viridans, 60% (6/10); staphylococcus epidermidis, 55% (40/73). in the negative blood culture-definite infection group, crp levels were abnormal in  88%; in the negative culture-possible infection group, crp was elevated in 33%; and in the negative blood culture-no infection group, crp was elevated in 9%. serial determinations of crp resulted in enhanced sensitivity in the positive blood culture group, the negative blood culture-definite infection group, and the negative blood culture-possible infection group. initial determinations by themselves were inadequately sensitive. serial determinations did not enhance sensitivity of the negative blood culture-no infection group. high specificity (91%) is suggested by the low incidence of abnormal crp levels among infants who  were not infected. conclusions: these data suggest that it would be appropriate to conduct a cautious, controlled trial to assess the safety of discontinuing antibiotic therapy if three serial crp measurements are normal and if there are no other clinical factors suggestive of infection. the data also indicate the necessity for serial determinations of crp for optimal sensitivity.

TI  == in vitro activities of bay y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
AB  == bay y3118 was highly active against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant s. aureus), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic for 90% of strains tested [mic90],  0.063 micrograms/ml). for enterococcus faecalis and corynebacterium jeikeium, mic90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. bay y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against bacteroides fragilis (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).

TI  == splenic abscess in the intensive care unit.
AB  == background and methods: from 1980 through 1990, nine patients developed de novo splenic abscess during their stay in our intensive care unit (icu), representing  the first series of such reported cases. results: all nine patients were septic prior to the diagnosis of splenic abscess. the signs and symptoms of splenic abscess commonly described in the literature were of little help in detecting this pathology in icu patients. mean +/- sd platelet count, however, increased significantly, from 274 x 10(9)/l +/- 50 x 10(9)/l at admission to 647 x 10(9)/l  +/- 94 x 10(9)/l at diagnosis. at diagnosis, left pleural effusion was present in all patients. only three patients had detectable left upper quadrant tenderness.  abdominal computed tomographic scans, when used, were diagnostic in all cases. all patients were treated by splenectomy; eight had a solitary abscess. six abscesses were caused by enteric organisms, two by staphylococcus aureus, and one by streptococcus epidermidis. eight patients (89%) had had the offending organism previously isolated from their blood or from another infected site. mortality was 45%. conclusions: splenic abscess, although a rare clinical entity, does occur de novo in icu patients and is associated with significant mortality. unexplained thrombocytosis in a septic icu patient with persistent left pleural effusion is suggestive of splenic abscess. previous culture and sensitivity results are useful in guiding perioperative antibiotic choices.

TI  == the gastrointestinal tract. the "undrained abscess" of multiple organ failure.
AB  == objective: this study determined the association between proximal gastrointestinal (gi) colonization and the development of intensive care unit (icu)-acquired infection and multiple organ failure (mof) in a population of critically ill surgical patients. summary background data: icu-acquired infection in association with progressive organ system dysfunction is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in critical surgical illness. oropharyngeal and gastric colonization with the characteristic infecting species is common, but its association with icu morbidity is poorly defined. methods: a prospective cohort study of 41 surgical icu patients was undertaken. specimens of gastric and upper  small bowel fluid were obtained for quantitative culture; the severity of organ dysfunction was quantitated by a numeric score. results: one or more episodes of  icu-acquired infection developed in 33 patients and involved at least one organism concomitantly cultured from the upper gi tract in all but 3. the most common organisms causing icu-acquired infection--candida, streptococcus faecalis, pseudomonas, and coagulase-negative staphylococci--were also the most common species colonizing the proximal gi tract. gut colonization correlated with the development of invasive infection within 1 week of culture for pseudomonas (90% vs. 13% in noncolonized patients, p < 0.0001) or staphylococcus epidermidis (80%  vs. 6%, p < 0.0001); a weaker association was seen for colonization with candida. infections associated with gi colonization included pneumonia (16 patients), wound infection (12 patients), urinary tract infection (11 patients), recurrent (tertiary) peritonitis (11 patients), and bacteremia (10 patients). icu mortality was greater for patients colonized with pseudomonas (70% vs. 26%, p = 0.03); organ dysfunction was most marked in patients colonized with one or more of the following: candida, pseudomonas, or s. epidermidis. conclusions: the upper gi tract is an important reservoir of the organisms causing icu-acquired infection.  pathologic gi colonization is associated with the development of mof in the critically ill surgical patient.

TI  == skin microflora of atopic eczema in first time hospital attenders.
AB  == the bacterial flora of the skin was assessed quantitatively in 50 children with eczema, aged 6 months to 14 years, referred to the hospital for the first time. twenty nonatopic controls with an unrelated non-infective disorder were also studied. cotton-tipped swabs and contact agar discs were taken from the worst affected area of eczema and from an uninvolved site in patients and from the forearm in controls. swabs were also taken from the nose, axilla and groin in all children. bacterial colonization of the skin was consistently more common and greater in amount from patients compared with controls. staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen isolated from patients only; from the worst affected area of eczema in 74% of patients and from an uninvolved skin site in 30% of patients. quantitative assessment showed that the density of colonization was proportional to the severity of eczema. the most common s. aureus phage group was group ii accounting for 32% of strains. resistance to penicillin was present in 88% of strains and to two or more antibiotics in 38% of strains. no relationship  was noted between the pattern of resistance and phage group.

AB  == we assessed in vitro the antimicrobial activity of four agents (vancomycin, teicoplanin, mupirocin, and imipenem) which are effective against gram-positive cocci causally associated with bacterial keratitis, as well as their corneal epithelial cytotoxicity. minimal inhibitory concentrations inhibiting 90% of strains (mic90s) against 10 strains each of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-susceptible and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci were as follows: vancomycin (mic90s 0.25-2 micrograms/ml), teicoplanin (mic90s 0.25-4 micrograms/ml, mupirocin (mic90s 0.12-4 micrograms/ml), and imipenem (mic90s 0.008-0.25 micrograms/ml, except for methicillin-resistant staphylococci with mic90 of 16 micrograms/ml). cytotoxicity was assayed by uptake of 3h-thymidine by rabbit corneal epithelial cell cultures  at drug concentrations of 12.5-100 mg/ml for vancomycin and teicoplanin, 1-8 mg/ml for mupirocin and 0.125-8 mg/ml for imipenem, with exposure times of 5, 30  and 60 min. cytotoxicity was as follows: imipenem < mupirocin < vancomycin < or = teicoplanin. resistance to methicillin-resistant s. aureus and s. epidermidis for imipenem and resistance to s. epidermidis and cytotoxicity for teicoplanin limit  their consideration for suspected gram-positive keratitis. on the other hand, vancomycin and mupirocin, because of their excellent therapeutic indices, should  be considered for this indication.

TI  == microbiology of cerebral abscess: a four-year study in malaysia.
AB  == a prospective study was carried out to determine the aetiology of cerebral abscess in relation to the primary source of infections. seventy-five patients with cerebral abscess were included in the study in the period january 1985 to december 1988. more than half of the patients studied had single lesions and the  overall most common sites were in the frontal and parietal regions. chronic suppurative otitis media, cyanotic congenital heart diseases and meningitis were  among the important predisposing conditions in these patients. approximately 25%  of the patients with cerebral abscesses had no documented antecedent infections.  pure cultures were found to be predominant (66.7%) and sterile cultures were obtained from 10 (13.3%) patients. streptococci were isolated from 23 (30.7%) patients, the commonest species being streptococcus milleri. proteus sp, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putrifaciens and bacteroides sp were almost exclusively found in cerebral abscesses secondary to chronic suppurative otitis media; these organisms were found in mixed cultures. streptococcus milleri, bacteroides sp and eikenella corrodens were found in pure cultures in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease. in patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts in-situ, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and diphtheroids were common. anaerobes were found in 15 (20.0%) patients, the majority in mixed cultures. culture, as well as gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of volatile fatty acids of cerebral pus, was carried out to enhance the  detection of the anaerobes. based on these findings, an antibiotic regimen consisting of penicillin, chloramphenicol and metronidazole is recommended as an  initial therapy while awaiting culture and sensitivity results.

AB  == in a retrospective study at son dureta hospital (palma de mallorca, mallorca, spain) of the period 1977-1991, 334 cases of culture-proven sepsis and/or meningitis in neonates born at the facility were identified. overall, there was an incidence rate of 4.9 cases per 1,000 live births. the case-fatality rate was  7.5%. infection was more frequent in infants of low birth weight, with the exception of infants with meningitis and infections due to group b streptococcus  and listeria species. the patterns of predominance among bacterial pathogens that were isolated changed during the period studied. from 1977 to 1984, klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent such isolate, but this frequency declined in the following years. group b streptococcus organisms and staphylococcus epidermidis replaced k. pneumoniae as the predominant pathogens in early- and staphylococcus  epidermidis replaced k. pneumoniae as the predominant pathogens in early- and late-onset infections, respectively. the frequency with which other pathogens were isolated did not vary significantly during the study period. invasive infection caused by candida organisms was found in two patients. the incidence of infection due to group b streptococci has increased in the last few years (to 2.4 cases per 1,000 live births in 1991) and has become a significant problem that requires a thorough epidemiological evaluation.

AB  == to produce an experimental model of infective endocarditis without inserting catheters into the heart, we injected a bacterial suspension into rabbits in which mitral complex lesions had been induced by electrical stimulation of the cervical vagus. typical infective vegetations grew on the surface of the mitral valves 1 week later. the formation of vegetations was related to the timing of the inoculation. streptococcus viridans injected just after vagal stimulation produced vegetations in 10 of 17 animals (58.8%), but the same bacteria injected  14 days after vagal stimulation did so in only 2 of 11 animals (18.2%). the incidence of infective endocarditis was significantly higher after early inoculation compared with delayed inoculation (p < 0.01). the susceptibility to infection depended on the species of bacteria injected. both s. viridans and pseudomonas pseudoalkaligenes injected just after vagal stimulation produced vegetations in 10 of 17 (58.8%) and 6 of 13 (46.2%) animals, respectively, but staphylococcus epidermidis injected just after vagal stimulation did not produce  vegetations in any of the 10 animals. s. viridans injected into nine normal animals never produced vegetations. these findings indicate that infective endocarditis develops after intravenous injection of bacterial suspensions alone  in rabbits with mitral complex lesions.

TI  == bacteria reactive to plaque-toxin-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are related  to the severity of gingivitis at the sampled site.
AB  == certain monoclonal antibodies (mabs) neutralize the inhibition of hl60 cell growth by bacterial plaque extracts. the aim of this study was to enumerate and identify the bacteria reactive to these mabs at sites where periodontal disease was measured by gingival index, pocket depth and attachment loss. the bacterial colonies were grown on blood agar and the colonies counted directly and after immunoblotting. sites that bled on probing (n = 15) had a mean of 3.35% mab-positive colonies (sem = 0.52%) and sites that did not bleed (n = 9) had a mean of 1.61% (sem = 0.41%). the percentage of mab-positive colonies also correlated with gingival index but not with the total number of colonies sampled, attachment loss or pocket depth. antigen was expressed by 4 genera: strains of streptococcus sanguis and/or eikenella corrodens (8 sites), staphylococcus epidermidis (4 sites) and corynebacterium minutissimus (1 site). the results suggest that the antigens detected on these bacteria by the mabs may be processed to form toxins and maintain gingivitis by irritating the surrounding cells.

TI  == combination antibiotic supplementation of corneal storage medium.
AB  == gram-positive cocci frequently contaminate donor corneal tissue and represent the most common cause of postkeratoplasty endophthalmitis. although gentamicin is currently added to corneal storage medium in an effort to decrease bacterial contamination of donor tissue, it has poor or variable in vitro activity against  many strains of streptococci and staphylococci. to investigate whether the antibiotic supplementation of corneal storage media could be improved, we surveyed 11 antibiotics for antimicrobial efficacy under simulated storage conditions against gentamicin-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and st. viridans. all antibiotics showed markedly reduced activity at 4 c as compared to their predicted activity at 37 c. bactericidal activity of streptomycin and tobramycin was enhanced by preceding 4  c storage with a three-hour period at room temperature (23 c). under these conditions, streptomycin showed the best antimicrobial activity of the 11 antibiotics tested. addition of gentamicin to streptomycin resulted in further improvement of activity against s. aureus and s. epidermidis, whereas the addition of penicillin g to streptomycin enhanced the activity against st. viridans. optimal antibiotic activity (99% or more killing) against all four isolates of gentamicin-resistant gram-positive cocci was best achieved with the combination of gentamicin, streptomycin, and penicillin g, coupled with a three-hour period at room temperature before 4 c storage.

AB  == between january 1989 and may 1991, 97 patients were treated with interleukin 2 in the oncology department of the avicenne hospital (bobigny, france). il 2 was given over 5 days by continuous infusion through an implantable port. ten patients (4 males, 6 females), mean age 46 years (36-67) with various cancers (breast 3, kidney 1, melanoma 1, colorectal 5), developed infection: 4 local infections around the port, 1 phlebitis, 4 septicemias, 1 bacteremia were observed. in 9 cases blood cultures were positive: staphylococcus aureus 5, staphylococcus epidermidis 3, streptococcus g 1. in 5 cases the same pathogen was isolated from the port and from the blood. the mean leucocyte count was 10,627/mm3 at the time of infection. the delay between the beginning of interleukin 2 treatment and the infection was 3 months. the mean dose of il 2 administered before infection was 456 million iu. in all cases infection was controlled without lethal complication by antibiotics and catheter removal. this  high incidence (8 percent) of staphylococcal infection is partly due to the skin  toxicity of il 2 and to depressed neutrophil chemotactic response. prophylactic antibiotics are warranted during il 2 intravenous therapy.

TI  == detection and estimation of aflatoxins using both chemical and biological techniques.
AB  == production of aflatoxins on both natural (rice and corn) and semisynthetic (yes)  media was conducted using an identified toxin-producing strain ofaspergillus flavus. thea flavus strain was able to produce 4 types of aflatoxins, namely b1,  b2, g1, and g2 on rice, corn, and yes media. quantitative data showed that the concentrations of aflatoxins b1 and g1 produced were 52, 40.3, and 39.6; and 64.7, 45.0, and 58.0jug for 50g of rice, corn, and yes media, respectively. in comparison, the yielded amounts of aflatoxins b2 and g2 were much lower: 11.5, 17.9, and 17.5; and 28.s, 40.3, and 39.5 mug for 50 g of rice, corn, and yes media, respectively.a bioassay was conducted using the following 5 standard bacterial strains:bacillus megaterium. bacillus subtilis, streptococcus faecal is, staphylococcus epidermidis, andparacoccus denitrificans as well as a field strain of candida albicans. all strains exceptp denitrificans showed varied degrees of inhibition when applied with crude aflatoxins at 5 to 40mug/ml. the minimum concentration of crude aflatoxins needed to inhibitp denitrificans was 10mug/ml. moreover,candida albicans was not inhibited at any concentration of aflatoxins applied in this work.both undiluted and diluted (1/10, 1/100, and 1/1000) bacterial broth cultures showed a direct relationship between the diameter of inhibition zones and the concentrations of crude aflatoxins. mean diameters of (7.0-20.5), (5-14), (4.5-13.0), (3.0-12.0), and (1.5-11.0) mm were observed when various concentrations of aflatoxins were applied usingb megaterium, s epidermidis, s faecal is, b subtilis, andp denitrificans, respectively.field trials were applied to testify the validity of our data. a 1/100 dilution was prepared from each strain of 4 different species to estimate aflatoxins in samples of contaminated corn. both chemical and biological assays were carried out at the same time. data revealed that the most sensitive organism inhibited by as low as 7.5mug aflatoxins/ml wasb megaterium giving an inhibition  zone of 10.5 mm, followed bys epidermidis with an inhibition zone of 7.5mm. in relation, the other 2 organisms were less sensitive to crude aflatoxins. similarly, the biological assay was applied to detect aflatoxins in some samples  of wheat, corn, peanut, rice, and poultry rations. of the 14 wheat and 10 corn samples, only 4 wheat and 2 corn samples were found to be positive. the same results were obtained using tlc analysis.

TI  == prosthetic valve endocarditis. experience with porcine bioprostheses.
AB  == prosthetic valve endocarditis remains an infrequent but serious complication of cardiac valvular replacement. prosthetic valve endocarditis was diagnosed in 56 (1.8%) of 3200 patients in whom one or more porcine bioprostheses were implanted  between 1975 and 1988. of the 56 patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis, there were 40 men and 16 women, with a mean age at initial implantation of 57 years (27 to 81 years). of the 56 patients, 6 were initially treated for native valve endocarditis. there were 8 cases of early prosthetic valve endocarditis (defined as occurring less than 60 days after initial surgical intervention) and  48 cases of late prosthetic valve endocarditis (occurring after 60 days). the overall mortality rate of the 56 patients was 32% (18 patients). of the 8 patients with early prosthetic valve endocarditis, 6 (75%) died. of the 48 patients with late prosthetic valve endocarditis, 12 (25%) died. the predominant  organisms were staphylococcus epidermidis (12 cases), streptococcus viridans (8 cases) and staphylococcus aureus (7 cases). the presence of hemodynamic compromise, including congestive heart failure, septic embolism, persistent sepsis, and echocardiographic evidence of vegetations, dictated the mode and timing of the addition of surgical intervention to medical therapy. the survival  rate for medically and surgically treated patients with late prosthetic valve endocarditis was 91% (20 patients); none of the patients with early prosthetic valve endocarditis survived (all had severe hemodynamic compromise). we analyzed  18 factors for the prediction of early and late death. the predictors of death by univariate analysis for both early and late prosthetic valve endocarditis were age, diagnosis time, renal status, sepsis, management mode, fever, dental procedures, and dental prophylaxis. the predictors by multivariate analysis were  age, diagnosis time, renal status, and management mode for early prosthetic valve endocarditis, and only diagnosis time for late prosthetic valve endocarditis. annular abscess formation occurred in 27% of the patients. there were no complex  aortic or mitral reconstructions. there was one reoperation for recurrent and residual endocarditis. there was one late death as a result of recurrent prosthetic valve endocarditis. we advocate early diagnosis and aggressive combined medical and surgical treatment before the development of hemodynamic compromise and other characteristic signs when the culprit organisms are staphylococcus aureus, gram-negative organisms, and candida albicans.

TI  == endocarditis in ethiopia. analysis of 51 cases from addis ababa.
AB  == fifty-one cases of infective endocarditis in 47 ethiopians over several years are analyzed. there were 32 males and 19 females, average age was 20.5, with 34 < or  = 20. only 2 patients had a known source of infection. forty-four cases had underlying rheumatic heart disease, 7 had congenital heart disease of which 5 had patent ductus arteriosus. staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were the most  commonly cultured organisms (10 each), only 1 streptococcus was isolated; 28/47 cultured cases had negative cultures. eight patients (16%) died. in comparison with western studies, this group was much younger and had a higher prevalence of  rheumatic heart disease. mitral valve prolapse and degenerative valvular disease  common in the west were not seen in this population. the rate of negative cultures was much higher than the 5-10% reported in the west, most likely due to  previous use of antibiotics and problems with culture techniques.

TI  == in vitro activity of clarithromycin, cefprozil, and other common oral antimicrobial agents against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens.
AB  == macrolide and beta-lactam antimicrobial agents are frequently used for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections and skin or skin structure infections. to evaluate the relative in vitro activity of these antimicrobial drugs against organisms commonly involved in these infections, we tested clarithromycin, erythromycin, cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline against 174 gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae. manual broth microdilution susceptibility testing was used with a standard inoculum of 5 x 10(4) colony-forming units/well at ph of 7.2. clarithromycin was the most active agent against streptococci. methicillin-susceptible s aureus exhibited resistance to both clarithromycin and  erythromycin, but was susceptible to cefprozil, cefuroxime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline. cefprozil was at least as active as cefuroxime, cefaclor, and cephalexin against all organisms tested, but was fourfold less active than doxycycline against e coli and 16-fold less active than clarithromycin versus s pneumoniae. the gram-negative isolates tested showed resistance to clarithromycin and erythromycin; however, cefprozil was as active as amoxicillin/clavulanate against k pneumoniae and e coli. these results demonstrate that clarithromycin provides superior in vitro activity against common streptococci, while cefprozil, cefuroxime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline provide greater activity against methicillin-susceptible s aureus, k  pneumoniae, and e coli. prospective clinical trials are needed to determine the clinical significance of these findings.

TI  == in vivo antibacterial activity of fk037, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == fk037 has potent therapeutic activity against lethal systemic infections and experimental local infections due to a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice. in murine systemic infections, fk037 was the most effective of the cephalosporins and imipenem tested against highly methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa). it was more effective than ceftazidime against selected strains of s. aureus and enterobacteriaceae, except serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa against which fk037 was as effective as ceftazidime and was as effective as cefpirome against all organisms tested, except mrsa and p. aeruginosa against which fk037 was more  effective than cefpirome. these results correlated well with its in vitro activity. in murine local infections, with few exceptions, fk037 was more effective than ceftazidime and cefpirome against klebsiella pneumonia in ed50 values and against methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa) subcutaneous abscess, pyelonephritis with staphylococcus epidermidis, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, intrauterine infections with s. aureus and e. coli in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the abscess, kidneys and uterus. it is noteworthy that the therapeutic effects of fk037 were more potent than had been anticipated from its  in vitro activity against local infections with staphylococci and p. aeruginosa when compared with ceftazidime or cefpirome. in addition, the therapeutic effects of fk037 were equipotent or superior to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime against pneumonia due to mssa, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs in mice using an in vivo pharmacokinetic model simulating human plasma concentrations after drip infusion of usual clinical doses (0.25 to 1.0 g for mssa, 0.063 to 0.125 g for k. pneumoniae and 1.0 to 2.0 g for p. aeruginosa). fk037 induced an in vivo post-antibiotic effect  (pae) of 3.4 hours against a thigh infection with mssa in neutropenic mice. these results strongly suggest that it has potential for clinical use against various infections due to bacteria which include staphylococci and p. aeruginosa.

AB  == the antiseptic efficacy of had hand wash (83% ethanol containing 0.5% povidone-iodine) was investigated by the glove-juice method in 29 cases amongst staff members of our university. the number of viable bacteria on the hands and fingers was counted three times, and the mean of these counts was used as the baseline value for each subject. the number of viable bacteria on both hands was  the same prior to disinfection. after the hands were disinfected by rubbing with  3 ml of had hand wash until it dried, the subjects put on sterile gloves. the number of viable bacteria was counted on the right hand of all the subjects immediately after disinfection. the number of viable bacteria on the left hand was counted in 8 subjects 30 minutes after disinfection, and in 7 subjects each 1, 2 and 4 hours after disinfection. the bacteria were identified by subculture.  the ratio of bacteria sterilized (bacterial reduction rate) was 75.4% immediately after disinfection, and 69.0%, 71.9%, 35.8% and 27.6% at 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours and 4 hours, respectively. all of the bacteria detected were gram-positive  bacteria that were native to the sebaceous glands, sweat glands or skin surface;  i.e. staphylococcus, micrococcus, bacillus, and streptococcus. the frequency of detection of staphylococcus warneri was the highest before disinfection, followed by staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus hominis, in that order. after disinfection, all these species showed a marked decrease in the number of bacteria. micrococcus remained in half the subjects, while other species remained in less than one third of the subjects.

TI  == correlation between the in vivo and in vitro antimicrobial properties of commercially available mouthwash preparations.
AB  == the effectiveness of six commercially available mouthwashes against common buccal organisms was studied. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) for two of the studied mouthwashes (corsodyl and oraldene) against buccal organisms were determined in todd hewitt medium with or without 5% serum. the concentration of the active substance in these two mouthwashes was in excess of the corresponding  mic. when the medium was supplemented with serum, lower mic values were observed. kill-time determinations, used at half the concentration of the normal preparation, revealed a rapid lethal effect for all tested mouthwashes. the slowest lethal effect was observed with fluocaril mouthwash. when mouthwashes were tested in volunteers, an immediate significant fall in salivary bacterial counts was produced by all except fluocaril. with the latter mouthwash the decrease was significant 2-30 minutes after rinsing. the bacterial levels returned to pre-rinse levels after 30 minutes for listerine, after 90 minutes for both oraldene and mint and after 180 minutes for corsodyl, fluocaril and sansilla mouthwashes. the results indicate that there is a good correlation between in vivo efficacy and in vitro determination of all mouthwash preparations.

TI  == comparison of the effects of galactose and glucose on the ph responses of human dental plaque, salivary sediment and pure cultures of oral bacteria.
AB  == comparisons made in dental plaque in vivo demonstrated that galactose produces a  significantly smaller decrease in ph than does glucose. in vitro studies with plaque, salivary sediment and pure cultures of oral bacteria done in the absence  of intraoral factors such as flowing saliva confirmed this lesser acidogenicity of galactose. pure culture showed that most of the bacteria tested produce a moderate to large decrease with glucose but only a few do so with galactose; most produced a moderate to little or no ph response with this sugar. this suggested that the smaller decreases in ph seen in plaque in vivo with galactose were largely due to bacterial differences, basically that resident micro-organisms individually have less galactolytic than glucolytic capability. variance in capability was attributed to differences in membrane transport processes and metabolic pathways normally available to bacteria for galactose and glucose catabolism. in the in vitro experiments, because plaque and sediment can produce  base as readily as they can produce acid, the nitrogenous substrates identified earlier as major stimulants of base formation, urea and arginine, were concurrently examined for their attenuating effects on the galactose and glucose  ph responses. these showed, consistent with its lesser acidogenicity, that galactose could be countered more readily in its ability to reduce the ph by either of these two base-forming substrates than could glucose. the effects were  different with urea and with arginine, urea attenuation occurred sooner and arginine attenuation later in both plaque and sediment. the corresponding acid-base ph profiles for pure cultures were different.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of am-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  == am-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and mycoplasma pneumoniae. am-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis; its mics for 90% of strains  tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. the activity of am-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. against xanthomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and campylobacter jejuni, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. at a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, am-1155 inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. development of resistance to am-1155 in s. aureus and s. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. in the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, am-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. the efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of am-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. against experimental pneumonia with klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. am-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. these results suggest that am-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.

TI  == mhc-unrestricted recognition of bacteria-infected target cells by human cd8+ cytotoxic t lymphocytes.
AB  == a cd8+ alpha beta tcr+ t cell clone (a35) was isolated from the synovial fluid of a patient with post-enteric reactive arthritis caused by yersinia enterocolitica. this clone efficiently killed autologous and allogeneic target cells that had been preincubated with live but not with heat-killed bacteria. there was no restriction by polymorphic parts of hla-a, -b, or -c molecules and a hla class ii-deficient mutant cell line was lysed as efficiently as its normal counterpart, whereas infected hla class i-deficient cells (daudi cells) were not. the clone showed crossreaction between yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pyogenes, but did not lyse target cells preincubated with staphylococcus epidermidis. mab to cd2, cd3, and cd8 efficiently blocked a35, whereas the addition of mab to hla class ii or to hla class i did not. this clone apparently represents a novel effector mechanism against bacteria-infected or -modified cells that could be involved in the immunopathology of reactive arthritis.

TI  == endophthalmitis following extracapsular cataract surgery: a review of 32 cases.
AB  == thirty two cases of endophthalmitis following extracapsular cataract surgery that had occurred within our department and had undergone intraocular diagnostic tap between may 1982 and may 1991 were reviewed. an infectious agent was identified in 20 cases (62.5%). the commonest organism was staphylococcus epidermidis (11 cases) (55%). proteus was the only gram negative organism identified (four cases) (20%). both of these organisms were associated with a favourable visual outcome.  in the culture positive subgroup 15 eyes (75%) achieved a final acuity of 6/60 or better with 10 eyes (50%) gaining 6/12 or better. thirteen (65%) of the culture positive cases were managed without vitreal intervention. of these 11 (85%) achieved 6/60 or better with eight (62%) gaining 6/12 or better. it appears that  when an endophthalmitis follows uncomplicated extracapsular cataract surgery delivery of antibiotic by the 'conventional' routes (topical, subconjunctival and systemic) is consistent with a favourable visual result in many cases. a modified anterior chamber diagnostic tap technique is described.

AB  == sce-2787, a new cephalosporin having a condensed azolium moiety in the 3 position and an aminothiadiazolyl group in the 7 beta side chain, was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo activities in comparison with those of ceftazidime, flomoxef, cefpirome, and e1040. against methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, sce-2787 was more active than ceftazidime  and e1040 and was as active as flomoxef and cefpirome, with mics for 90% of strains tested (mic90s) being 1.56 micrograms/ml or less. sce-2787 was also active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, for which the mic90 was 6.25 micrograms/ml, which was lower than that of cefpirome and comparable to that of ceftazidime. sce-2787 was marginally active against methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci and enterococcus faecalis, although its mic90s were the lowest among those of the antibiotics tested. the activities of sce-2787 against streptococcus species, most members of the family enterobacteriaceae, and haemophilus influenzae exceeded those of ceftazidime and flomoxef and were comparable to those of cefpirome. furthermore, mic90s of sce-2787 were significantly lower than those of ceftazidime for ceftazidime-resistant isolates  of citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae. sce-2787 was resistant to hydrolysis by various types of beta-lactamases, including the bush group 1 beta-lactamases, and had low affinities for these enzymes, with km or ki values of greater than 100 microm. the in vitro activity of sce-2787 was reflected in its efficacy in mouse protection tests. thus, sce-2787 appears to be a promising  cephalosporin that should be further evaluated in clinical trials.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ro 23-9424 against bacterial isolates from patients with cancer was compared with those of fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone, and ceftazidime. ro 23-9424 inhibited the majority of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae and all aeromonas isolates at a concentration of less than or  equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. it was also active against acinetobacter spp. and haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. the mic for 90% of isolates (mic90) of pseudomonas aeruginosa was 16.0 micrograms/ml. all group a and b streptococci were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, and 90% of group g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae were  inhibited by 1.0 micrograms/ml. all methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus and 60% of methicillin-resistant strains were susceptible to 2.0 micrograms of ro 23-9424 per ml, whereas the mic90 for staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus hominis isolates was 4.0 micrograms/ml. staphylococcus haemolyticus and enterococcus spp. were less susceptible; mic90s for them were 16.0 and 32.0 micrograms/ml. ro 23-9424 has a broad antibacterial spectrum and potential utility for therapy of infections in cancer patients.

TI  == septic ischial bursitis in patients with spinal cord injury.
AB  == septic ischial bursitis is described in 4 patients with spinal cord injury. in these patients a pre-existing ischial bursitis probably became secondarily infected. because these patients lack sensation, diagnosis may be difficult. the  disease process in one patient with a prolonged fever was only recognized after a leucocyte scan detected an abscess extending to the thigh. at surgery it was found that the infection extended from the ischial bursa to the upper lateral thigh. infection in these patients was due to beta hemolytic streptococcus, s. aureus, and s. epidermidis. the patients all responded well to local drainage and excision of the bursa.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of sphingosines.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids was examined by screening in vitro various representative phospholipids and sphingolipids. of mixed galacto-cerebrosides; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidic acid-monomethylester-dioleoyl; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine-beta-oleoyl-gamma-palmitoyl; phosphatidylcholine; d-sphingosine; d,l-sphinganine; 4-d-hydroxysphinganine; oleoyl-sphingosine; n,n-dimethylsphingosine; and stearylamine, only the sphingosines and, to a lesser extent, stearylamine were clearly and profoundly effective against staphylococcus aureus (4-log reduction at 6.25 micrograms/ml [20 microm]; 2-log reduction at 0.78 mu/ml [2.5 microm]). the sphingosines were similarly active against streptococcus pyogenes, micrococcus luteus, propionibacterium acnes, brevibacterium epidermidis, and candida albicans, moderately active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ineffective against escherichia coli and serratia marcescens. both erythro- and threo-isomers were effective. optimal inhibition was at 60 min incubation at 37 degrees c and at ph 6.5. antimicrobial activity, which was ca++ dependent, was confirmed in vivo by topical application and microbial challenge. because free sphingosines are available in the stratum corneum and other epidermal layers, these lipids may contribute to the cutaneous  antimicrobial barrier.

TI  == immunobiological activities of bacteria isolated from the root canals of postendodontic teeth with persistent periapical lesions.
AB  == although intraradicular bacteria are widely considered to be the primary etiological agents of periapical lesions, the immunobiological properties of the  species in question are not adequately known. the aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the pathobiological properties of the 10 most frequently isolated endodontopathic bacterial species. using cellular components of the pathogens obtained by sonic extraction, we have investigated their ability to induce monocyte migration, interleukin 1 production, mitogenic responses of lymphocytes, and the polyclonal activation of b lymphocytes. it was found that all of the tested species enhanced the migration of monocytes and induced mitogenesis in b lymphocytes. the polyclonal activation of b cells and the induction of interleukin 1 by monocytes were found to be stronger in gram-negative anaerobes. furthermore, all of the tested species excluding bacteroides oralis were poor t cell mitogens. these findings show that a wide range of pathobiological properties are attributable to the most frequently isolated endodontic pathogens. it thus seems plausible that a battery of complex  immunological responses induced by such microbes lead to the formation of persistent periapical lesions.

TI  == the relevance of cultures of catheter-drawn blood and heparin-lock fluid to diagnose infection in hematologic patients.
AB  == the results of bacteriologic cultures of blood and heparin-lock fluid, both drawn from the central venous catheters of 54 consecutive oncohematologic patients, have been used to determine their value for the diagnosis of systemic and catheter-associated infection. in 30 patients with clinical signs of infection (bacteremia or septicemia), 74 of 1000 (7.4%) heparin-lock fluid cultures, 114 of 542 (21%) catheter-drawn blood cultures, and 36 of 134 (26%) venipuncture blood cultures became positive, whereas in 24 patients without clinical signs of infection the respective values were 5 of 700 (0.7%), one of 220 (0.4%), and none of ten cultures. comparison of the results of cultures sampled on the same day reveals that the positive and negative predictive values for catheter-drawn blood cultures, with the venipuncture blood cultures taken as the standard for bacteremia, are 82% and 95% respectively. the results of heparin-lock fluid are indicative for clinically relevant colonization of the catheter. three or more positive heparin-lock fluid cultures, sampled on subsequent days, were correlated with the occurrence of bacteremia or septicemia with a positive predictive value  of 100%. the conclusions are supported by the results of scanning electron microscopy.

TI  == comparative efficacy of contact lens disinfection solutions.
AB  == using the d value method of analysis, we evaluated the relative antimicrobial effectiveness of eight contact lens disinfection solutions against a standard population of challenge organisms as defined in the microbiological guidelines proposed by the food and drug administration (fda). six bacteria (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens) and two fungi (aspergillus fumigatus, candida albicans) were investigated. the disinfectants included hydrogen peroxide (aosept, mirasept, oxysept), chlorine-based solutions (aerotab  and softab), soaking solutions containing synthetic, high molecular weight preservatives (renu and opti-free) and a thimerosal preserved soaking solution (hydrocare cleaning and soaking solution). the one-step hydrogen peroxide system  (aosept) was evaluated both with and without the catalytic disk. to facilitate comparison of the disinfecting solutions, we defined a new measure of performance, namely "power" of solution. this has an advantage over the "safety factor" because the solution power is independent of the size of the initial inoculum. because different approaches to analysis may yield a wide range of d values for one set of survival data we call for adoption of a standardized approach. our results suggest that one of the chlorine-based solutions fails to meet the fda recommendations for bacterial challenge. most solutions performed poorly against mycotic challenge. however, when used over longer disinfecting periods, 3% hydrogen peroxide and the hydrocare solution gave adequate performance against fungi.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefodizime.
AB  == cefodizime is a bactericidal cephem with the typical broad spectrum activity of an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria: its mic90 is 0.125 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococci; and 0.05 mg/l for haemophilus spp., neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae and moraxella catarrhalis; while beta-lactamase positive strains of m. catarrhalis require 1 mg/l. less than 1 mg/l is needed for escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus spp. and shigella spp. the mic90 is 4 mg/l for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, morganella morganii, providencia spp. and most strains of serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp. and enterobacter spp. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis and most strains of pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. are considered cefodizime-resistant. cefodizime is unaffected by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but it is hydrolyzed by some chromosomally mediated enzymes, thus resembling other third-generation cephalosporins. cefodizime has high affinity for pbp 3 and pbp ia and ib (escherichia coli); in s. aureus it shows the highest affinity for pbp 1.

AB  == on 24 benign prostatic hyperplasia patients with preoperatively sterile urine, who also had no history of urinary tract infection, the organisms in the prostate obtained through transurethral resection as well as in the anterior urethra were  isolated. in 17 patients out of 24, organisms obtained in the prostate were identical to those in the anterior urethra; therefore, it can be concluded that another 7 patients had organisms in the prostate itself before the operation. these results would suggest that sterile urine did not indicate sterile prostate  and that organisms in the prostate did not always ascend from the urethra. in the patients who preoperatively received transurethral catheterizations, streptococcus faecalis was the most predominantly isolated organism in the prostate, which was highly sensitive to abpc and minocycline and lower to cephems. on the other hand, in the patients with no history of catheterizations,  staphylococcus epidermidis was the most commonly isolated one, which was highly sensitive to abpc and minocycline as well as cephems. so, in the treatment of the cases with infectious symptoms after transurethral resection of the prostate, abpc or minocycline should be selected as first-choice drugs rather than cephems.

AB  == under the aegis of the geep (groupement d'etudes epidemiologiques et prophylactiques) a prospective multicentre study concerning bacterial endophthalmitis was carried out over a period of one year long with the contribution of 64 metropolitan ophthalmologic hospital departments. during this  survey 143 cases of post surgical endophthalmitis were recorded: 111 of them were secondary to elective surgery, 32 developed after a perforating eye injury. twenty-four cases of endophthalmitis developed in the absence of surgery were therefore called "medical" endophthalmitis. the frequency of endophthalmitis after elective surgery was 0.32%, and 2.8% after penetrating eye injury. intraocular samples were obtained in 61.5% of the cases of post surgical endophthalmitis. 53 bacteria were isolated from 50 cases of endophthalmitis. the  bacterial nature of the endophthalmitis was proved in 35% of these cases of post  surgical endophthalmitis. bacteria isolated from these cases of post surgical endophthalmitis were gram positive in 86.7%, and gram negative in 13.3% of cases. 20 bacteria were isolated from pseudophakic eyes: 10 of them were staphylococcus  epidermidis. the visual prognosis of endophthalmitis depends on the strain: visual acuity was more than 1/10 in 68% of cases of staphylococcus endophthalmitis infection, but in only in 7% of cases of streptococcus endophthalmitis infection. intraocular injections of antibiotics both in the anterior chamber and in the vitreous, and vitrectomy increased the quality of the visual result. three months after post surgical endophthalmitis, 35% of those eyes who received systemic and periocular antibiotic therapy, combined with intraocular antibiotics, with or without vitrectomy, recovered a visual acuity of 4/10 or more, instead of only 18% in the group without any intraocular therapy.

AB  == fourteen neonates intubated at birth for 1-16 days had a microbiological follow up. after removal, tubes were examined using electron microscopy. tubes became covered with a slimy accretion from the third day in place, independently of bacterial colonization, which was, in all but one cases, restricted to the rough  areas of the tubes. only candida albicans and the corresponding slimy coat were found on smooth areas of tube. cocci were noticed on 3 tubes. they were associated with the slimy accretion. transmission micrographs elicited a thick material that was lying between cocci and polymer. these results showed that, on  neonates' endotracheal tubes, accretion occurred independently of microbial colonization and that when colonization occurred, cocci adhered preferentially to a biological coat of human origin rather than the medical devices.

TI  == comparative efficacies of soft contact lens disinfectant solutions against microbial films in lens cases.
AB  == biofilms of pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, and candida albicans, established in the wells of a polyethylene contact lens case, retained viability to certain soft contact lens disinfectant solutions after exposure for the manufacturer's minimum recommended disinfection times. the relative order of resistance of bacterial biofilms was as follows: s marcescens was greater than p aeruginosa, which was greater than s epidermidis, which was greater than s pyogenes. air drying of biofilms for 10 hours increased the efficacy of the disinfectant solutions, but drying was not enough to decrease the incidence of recovery to 0% for all solutions. hydrogen peroxide was more effective against biofilms than disinfectant solutions formulated with chlorhexidine gluconate or polyquaternium-1 or polyaminopropyl biguanide. we recommend that determination of efficacy of contact lens disinfectant solutions should include challenges against biofilms.

TI  == antimicrobial treatment of otitis media.
AB  == the major pathogens causing acute otitis media (aom) are streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, with moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus less frequently isolated. the same organisms and staphylococcus epidermidis are found in chronic otitis media with effusion. in chronic suppurative otitis media, pseudomonas aeruginosa and s aureus are most frequently found. antimicrobial agents found to be most effective in treating aom are amoxicillin, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, erythromycin-sulfisoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and cefaclor. cefuroxime axetil and cefixime are alternatives for which there are less data. currently, about 20% of aom cases are caused by beta-lactamase-producing strains (usually h influenzae or m catarrhalis) that are resistant to amoxicillin, thus favoring the use of the other agents listed. concentrations of antibiotics in middle ear infections range from 10% to 76% of peak serum levels for the listed agents and are higher in aom  than in chronic otitis media with effusion, emphasizing the importance of adequate dosing for successful treatment.

TI  == the relationship of tonsil bacterial concentration to surface and core cultures in chronic tonsillar disease in children.
AB  == fifty-five tonsils removed for chronic tonsillar disease (chronic tonsillitis and obstructive tonsillar hyperplasia) underwent surface swab and quantitative core cultures in order to identify the relationship between core bacterial concentration and the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsil surface. the accuracy of a single core culture was further established by quantitative cultures of 9 sections per tonsil in an additional 19 tonsils. the results indicate that many (61.5%) but not all aerobic bacteria which were found in the tonsil core were cultured from the surface of the tonsil. conversely, the tonsil  core bacteria with the highest bacterial concentrations are more likely to be present on the tonsillar surface and the greater the bacterial concentration, the more likely the bacteria are to be found in most if not all areas of the tonsil core. therefore, the core bacterial concentration appears to be related to the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsillar surface. surface bacteria may not,  however, be truly representative of the core bacterial environment. implications  for the management of chronic tonsillar disease will be discussed.

AB  == the growth inhibiting capacity of zinc oxide combined with ordinary rosin (portuguese rosin), abietic acid or dehydroabietic acid was studied using two different methods. to mimic the actual treatment of wounds, circular tapes or sensitivity discs were placed on muller-hinton-agar plates that had been seeded with various facultative aerobic bacteria, and the zones of inhibition were measured. the agar dilution method was used to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). inhibition of growth was restricted to gram-positive facultative aerobic bacteria for the individual substances zinc oxide, portuguese rosin, or resin acids, as well as for combinations of these. in general the combination of zinc oxide and dehydroabietic acid was a more potent antibacterial substance than the corresponding combination of zinc with rosin or abietic acid.  these combinations commonly had synergistic antibacterial effects.

TI  == temafloxacin: in vitro comparison with five other antibacterial agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the new fluorinated quinolone temafloxacin was compared  with the activities of ciprofloxacin, fleroxacin, ofloxacin, ceftazidime and tobramycin. a total of 662 recent clinical isolates were included in the study, representing a variety of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. an agar dilution method was employed for the determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). ciprofloxacin showed the highest potency against the enterobacteriaceae, 90% of the isolates being inhibited by 0.06 mg/l or less. the other quinolones were also highly active (mic90 = 0.25-0.5 mg/l). ciprofloxacin and tobramycin were the most active agents against the pseudomonas isolates (mic90 = 0.25 and 0.5 mg/l, respectively), whereas the activities of temafloxacin, fleroxacin and ofloxacin were more variable. all the quinolones had relatively high and similar activity against staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis, but s. saprophyticus was markedly less susceptible to fleroxacin than to the other quinolones. the activity of temafloxacin against streptococcus  pneumoniae was somewhat higher than those of the other quinolones tested. temafloxacin showed variable activity against bacteroides fragilis isolates but was generally more potent against these isolates than were the other quinolones.  the mics of temafloxacin were slightly lower at ph 7.3 compared with those obtained at phs 5.8 or 8.8.

TI  == intestinal bacteria of newborn ethiopian infants in relation to antibiotic treatment and colonisation by potentially pathogenic gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the aerobic and anaerobic intestinal microflora of 60 newborn infants in addis ababa was studied. as opposed to earlier published studies from stockholm, there  were no consistent changes of the microflora attributable to antibiotic treatment. the reason why antimicrobial agents caused quantitatively smaller changes of the intestinal microflora in newborn infants in addis ababa than in stockholm is not known, but may be due to antimicrobial inactivation, or marked,  continuous ingestion of bacteria. colonisation by potentially pathogenic gram-negative bacteria was coupled to a low isolation rate of bifidobacterium, but not of lactobacillus. this is consistent with the hypothesis that bifidobacterium might convey some kind of resistance to colonisation by and overgrowth of gram-negative bacteria in newborn infants. similar results have previously been obtained in stockholm. in comparison to 45 healthy infants in stockholm, the ethiopian infants had more enterococcus and lactobacillus and less staphylococcus and bacteroides during the first 2 weeks of life. after that time, the only difference was more frequent colonisation by lactobacillus in addis ababa.

AB  == the dermal irritancy of six zinc compounds was examined in three animal models. in open patch tests involving five daily applications, zinc chloride (1% aqueous  solution) was severely irritant in rabbit, guinea-pig and mouse tests, inducing epidermal hyperplasia and ulceration; aqueous zinc acetate (20%) was slightly less irritant. zinc oxide (20% suspension dilute tween 80), zinc sulphate (1% aqueous solution) and zinc pyrithione (20% suspension) were not overtly irritant, but induced a marginal epidermal hyperplasia and increased hair growth. zinc undecylenate (20% suspension) was not irritant. epidermal irritancy in these studies is related to the interaction of zinc ion with epidermal keratin. the compounds studied were not consistently bacteriostatic in the three species tested.

TI  == inactivation of metronidazole by enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == the in-vitro inactivation of metronidazole by different clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis was investigated by means of association experiments in which ent. faecalis strains and bacteroides fragilis group strains were cultured  in the same liquid medium. all of the tested ent. faecalis strains (20 isolates)  were able to protect the b. fragilis group strains against the killing effect of  metronidazole at a concentration four or eight times higher than the normal mic.  different strains of streptococcus (14), staphylococcus aureus (10), staph, epidermidis (10) and escherichia coli (8) failed to exhibit the same effect. when ent. faecalis strains were cultured anaerobically for 24 h in the presence of 4 mg metronidazole/l, either alone or together with different b. fragilis group strains, no metronidazole could be detected subsequently in the culture supernatants by hplc. concomitantly an increase of four or five logs in the viable counts of the co-cultured bacteroides strains was observed compared with bacteroides strains cultured alone. sonicated cell extracts of ent. faecalis cultured either aerobically or anaerobically were found to inactivate metronidazole to the same extent, whereas the culture supernatants had no such effect.

TI  == comparison of antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of glutaraldehyde and formocresol.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial and cytotoxic concentrations of glutaraldehyde and formocresol were determined. minimal antimicrobial concentrations of these two agents against selected microbial flora reported in carious primary teeth were 3.125% for glutaraldehyde and 0.75% for formocresol. at a doubling of these concentrations, most organisms, except candida albicans, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus mutans, were killed by both substances in 30 seconds. cytotoxicity was evaluated on tissue cultures of pulp fibroblasts and hela cells at minimal cidal concentrations and at 10- and 100-fold dilutions. exposure of pulp fibroblasts and hela cells to formocresol and indirect exposure  to vapors caused the cells to become atrophic and to form a less dense tissue pattern. cells directly exposed to glutaraldehyde retained their normal cell shape and tissue pattern, whereas cells indirectly exposed to vapors continued to proliferate. these data showed effective antimicrobial activity at concentrations of 3.125% glutaraldehyde and 0.75% formocresol and suggested that glutaraldehyde  may exert a less cytotoxic effect on the immediate and surrounding tissues when used as a pulpotomy agent.

AB  == macrolide (ml) susceptibilities of clinically isolated bacteria obtained freshly  during 1989 were determined and year to year differences in ml-resistances of the clinical isolates in our laboratory were examined with epidemiological consideration in mind. 1. the distribution of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of mls against isolates of staphylococcus aureus showed 2 peaks, one peak  representing s. aureus isolates susceptible to mls and the other peak representing those resistant to mls. proportions of resistant isolates to various mls were 36% to erythromycin, 24% each to kitasamycin, josamycin, midecamycin and midecamycin acetate. mics of rokitamycin (rkm), however, distributed themselves into 3 peaks of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml (76%), 1.56-3.13 micrograms/ml (12%) and greater than or equal to 100 micrograms/ml (12%). staphylococcus spp. including staphylococcus epidermidis showed different resistance characteristics to 14-membered ring mls and to 16-membered ring mls. further, the proportion of resistant organisms to rkm was the smallest among proportions of resistant organisms to various 16-membered ring mls tested. these  differences in proportions of resistant organisms to different mls may have resulted from differences in resistance induction activities of different mls. the above described ratios of resistant organisms to mls among s. aureus did not  vary since 1975 among clinical isolates tested in our laboratory. 2. four per cent (4%) of streptococcus pyogenes isolates were mls resistant, and 18% of streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were resistant to mls. among the isolates tested in our laboratory since 1985, resistant isolates of s. pyogenes are clearly decreasing and those of s. pneumoniae seem to be increasing.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

AB  == the pattern of neonatal bacterial infection, its management and the types of infection control policy were ascertained in 20 neonatal intensive care units (nicu) in australia by questionnaire survey. group b streptococcus and escherichia coli were the predominant organisms responsible for perinatally acquired infection for which the most common antibiotic combination used was penicillin and gentamicin. staphylococcus epidermidis and aureus (majority methicillin resistant) were the predominant organisms responsible for nosocomial  infection for which the most common antibiotic combination used was vancomycin and cefotaxime. a serratia epidemic was experienced in four nicu. lumbar and suprapubic punctures were frequently done as part of the diagnostic workup in nosocomial infections but not with perinatally acquired infections. haematological indices considered useful as a diagnosis aid varied between nicu and acute phase reactants were rarely relied upon for diagnosis or for monitoring treatment response. granulocyte transfusion and intravenous immunoglobulins were  infrequently used in therapy. no consensus was found on infection control policies. eight nicu required routine gowning on entry, two restricted sibling visiting and four restricted visiting by relatives and friends. although routine  bacteriological surveillance on staff or equipment was uncommon, serial cultures  were carried out in infants from the body surface in six nicu and from the endotracheal aspirate in 17 nicu. antiseptics used with technical procedures included iodine, chlorhexidine and alcohol used singly or in combination. skin and umbilical cord care also varied between nicu. the literature was reviewed to  determine the effectiveness or otherwise of some of the existing policies in the  prevention or management of neonatal infection to encourage consensus towards a more rational approach to neonatal infection in australia.

TI  == management of empyema thoracis.
AB  == over a 5-year period, 65 adult patients with empyema thoracis were treated. the cause of the empyema was postpneumonic in 52%, postresectional in 24%, a complication of minor surgical procedures in 14%, posttraumatic in 5%, and the result of miscellaneous causes in 5%. in the postpneumonic group, infection resulted from a single aerobic organism in 41%, multiple aerobic organisms in 9%, single anaerobic organisms in 12%, and mixed aerobic-anaerobic organisms in 18%.  peptostreptococcus, streptococcus viridans, staphylococcus epidermidis, peptococcus, staphylococcus aureus, and diphtheroids were the most common organisms, accounting for 55% of bacterial isolates. all 34 patients with postpneumonic empyema were initially treated with drainage, which was successful  in two thirds. the remainder, 12 patients, ultimately required thoracotomy. decortication was combined with intrathoracic transposition of extrathoracic skeletal muscles in 9 patients. there was no reoperation or recurrence of infection, and thoracoplasty was avoided; residual spaces were filled by the transposed muscle.

AB  == antimicrobial activities of minocycline (mino) against various clinical isolates, 270 strains obtained in 1988, were determined and the reliability of the mino disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics was studied. clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the disc tests, which is widely used in japan, and that of a 3 category system used in the usa and europe, were also evaluated to determine which system would be more suitable for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. in this study, mics were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. mic80 values of mino against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pneumoniae were all less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml. those against haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris were 0.39, 6.25, 3.13, 25, 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. mic80 values against pseudomonas  aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, enterobacter spp., and citrobacter spp. were 50, 100, 50 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. the inhibition zones obtained with  the disc method were compared with mics. the results of mino disc susceptibility  test either with 200 micrograms disc (showa) or 30 micrograms disc (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with mics, showing the reliability of the disc method in estimating approximate values of mics. in the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in mic values proposed are ( ) mic less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 2-10 micrograms/ml, (+) greater than 10-50 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 50 micrograms/ml. the results obtained with 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs showed false positive in 26.6% and 20.5% of the samples, and false negative in 5.8% and 23.6% of the samples, respectively. the disc results of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. pneumoniae, etc. were relatively well classified, but those of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, proteus spp. were not, showing more false positive results.  changing the lower 2 mic break points in the 4 category system to: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, the false positive results with both 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs were  reduced to 12% and 6.2%, respectively. the false negative results were 5.8% and 23.6%, respectively.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == cervical osteomyelitis due to i.v. heroin use: radiologic findings in 14 patients.
AB  == we reviewed the radiographs of 14 patients who had cervical osteomyelitis and were iv heroin users. eleven were men and three were women. their age range was 33-48 years (mean, 39 years). eleven regularly used the jugular vein access, and  three alternated between the jugular and femoral veins. initial radiographs of the cervical spine in 13 patients showed destruction of two or more vertebral bodies and the adjacent intervertebral disk, as well as a prevertebral soft-tissue mass. in one patient, findings on initial radiographs were normal, but marked destruction at two contiguous intervertebral levels and a large prevertebral abscess were identified 2 weeks later. all the patients had positive results on cultures of joint aspirates or bone biopsy materials (10 patients) or  blood (four patients). ten grew staphylococcus aureus; two, staphylococcus epidermidis; one, streptococcus viridans; and one, pseudomonas aeruginosa. ct in  nine patients showed inflammatory reaction adjacent to the carotid sheath resulting from the repeated jugular injections and delineated the extent of prevertebral abscess and bone destruction. scintigrams were of minimal value in establishing the diagnosis. advanced vertebral body destruction, disk space infection, prevertebral abscess, and anterior cervical inflammatory reaction appear to be typical findings on radiographs in heroin abusers with cervical osteomyelitis.

TI  == effects of room-temperature exposure on bacterial growth in stored red cells.
AB  == experiments were performed to determine the effect of room-temperature (rt) exposure on the growth rates of selected bacteria by deliberate contamination of  as-1 packed red cell (rbc) units contained in pl146 plastic bags. isolates of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, and yersinia enterocolitica were inoculated into 3- to 5-day-old packed rbc units. the units were refrigerated at 4 to 6 degrees c for 14 days. on two occasions during this period, one-half of the units were removed from the refrigerator and held at 25 to 26 degrees c for 2 hours. timed samples taken during the periods at rt revealed stable or decreasing bacterial counts in the majority of exposed units,  and in no instance was a marked increase in bacterial growth observed. samples taken after subsequent prolonged rerefrigeration showed no significant increase in bacterial counts as compared with those in control units that were refrigerated constantly. these results indicate that rt exposure of contaminated  rbc units does not result in accelerated bacterial proliferation over a period of 2 hours and that it may, in fact, have a detrimental effect on bacterial growth.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new 7-dimethylpyridinyl quinolone, win 57273, was assessed by using in vitro and in vivo models. agar inclusion and broth dilution  in vitro tests revealed broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms, with the greatest potency observed against the  staphylococci. the mic for 90% of coagulase-positive strains tested (mic90) was less than or equal to 0.002 micrograms/ml; for the coagulase-negative strains the mic90 was 0.008 micrograms/ml. against enterococci the mic90 was 0.06 micrograms/ml, with comparable activity observed against group a and group b streptococci as well as against the pneumococci. in general, the mic90s for the gram-negative bacteria were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. exceptions were serratia marcescens (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml), citrobacter freundii (mic90,  4 micrograms/ml), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). the greatest potency was observed against haemophilus spp. and neisseria spp., with mic90s of 0.06 and 0.016 micrograms/ml, respectively. broad-spectrum activity was also observed against anaerobes, with mic90s ranging from 0.125 to 0.5 micrograms/ml among the species tested. the in vivo efficacy was determined by using a murine model by calculating the 50% protective doses against a lethal bacterial infection caused by strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the staphylocci were most susceptible, with 50% protective doses for  all strains ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 mg/kg. with the exception of the pseudomonas  infection, which was refractory to treatment, animals that were part of the other infection models responded to less than 10 mg/kg. equivalent activity was seen with the subcutaneous or the oral route of drug administration. win 57273 was significantly more potent than ciprofloxacin in treating gram-positive bacterial  infections (2- to 20-fold) but was significantly less effective at treating gram-negative bacterial infections (30- to 300-fold).

TI  == the antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the blood of patients in st  thomas' hospital, 1969-1988.
AB  == we have monitored the antibiotic sensitivity of bloodstream isolates of common bacteria over a period of 20 years. among the gram-positive bacteria, the proportion of isolates of staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, erythromycin, fusidate, or gentamicin has increased marginally, while that of coagulase-negative staphylococci (mostly staph. epidermidis) has increased markedly. enterococci are becoming serially more resistant to high concentrations of aminoglycosides. the enterobacteriaceae have become considerably less sensitive to ampicillin (and amoxycillin) and trimethoprim but more sensitive to  the aminoglycosides, whilst their susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, imipenem, meropenem and temocillin has remained constant. we have some evidence that in-vitro resistance is clinically relevant since the mortality rate rises if inappropriate antibiotics are used empirically. although  many drug regimens could be used, we are able to recommend initial therapy with a combination of gentamicin and cefuroxime for most of our patients, the exceptions being those known to be infected with resistant organisms before the onset of septicaemia.

AB  == to determine the effect of intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) on the capacity of serum from septic neonates to deposit complement c3 and igg onto the bacteria isolated from their blood, 500 mg/kg of ivig was administered to 18 neonates suspected of being septic. blood was obtained just before the infusion, and again 15 minutes after its completion. group b streptococcus type ii, group b streptococcus type iii, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated from the pre-infusion blood of four neonates. bacteria were incubated with the appropriate serum, washed, and the amount of c3 and igg subsequently bound to the organisms was quantified by radioimmunobinding assay. sera from the four septic neonates and sera from four neonates of similar gestational age but whose blood cultures were negative were compared with pooled  sera from healthy adults. before the administration of ivig, c3 deposition onto the bacteria by sera from five of the seven neonates tested was significantly less than that observed for adult sera. following the infusion, no increase in c3 deposition was observed for any of the seven sera assayed, and in two cases c3 deposition fell significantly. in contrast, in seven of eight cases, ivig enhanced the igg deposition to levels greater than or equal to those observed for adult sera. therefore, following the infusion of ivig into neonates with proven or suspected sepsis, the deposition of c3 onto invasive bacteria by their serum was not enhanced even though igg deposition was increased.

AB  == the adherence of two strains of staphylococcus epidermidis to human fibrin-platelet clots in vitro was investigated. both strains were noncapsulated, nonhemagglutinating, and nonslime producers. binding was not related to surface charge, carbohydrate profile, or hydrophobicity of the bacteria. adherence was reduced four- to sixfold (p less than 0.001) on pretreatment of bacteria with lipase, while neuraminidase, trypsin, phospholipase c, and sodium periodate did not alter their binding. pretreatment of bacteria with substances known to bind lipoteichoic acid (lta), such as human albumin and anti-lta antibodies, also resulted in a fourfold (p less than 0.001) reduction in adherence. prior incubation of clots with free lta, but not with deacylated lta, produced a fourfold (p less than 0.001) decrease in the adherence of homologous and heterologous strains of s. epidermidis. a similar reduction was also observed when ltas derived from staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes were used. these data provide evidence that the lipid moiety of lta has a central role in the adherence of s. epidermidis to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro.

TI  == contact neodynium-yttrium-aluminum garnet laser acts as a sterilizing scalpel.
AB  == as a cold knife cuts through contaminated or infected wounds, bacteria are dragged along with the blade of the knife through the entire wound. herein, the effect of incisions made with a cold knife is compared with that of incisions made by a contact neodynium-yttrium-aluminum garnet (nd:yag) laser. agar plates were inoculated with multiple strains of exogenous, endogenous, hospital-acquired and multiple antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. while the cold knife dragged bacteria to sterile areas, incisions made with the contact laser were always sterile. in addition to not dragging bacteria, the tip of the contact laser sterilized itself and provided a bacteria-free zone on either side of the cut, depending on the power density applied. it appears that the contact nd:yag laser acts as a sterilizing wand while providing much needed tactile feedback, precision and hemostasis during surgical treatment with the laser.

TI  == flow cytometric identification of microorganisms by dual staining with fitc and pi.
AB  == the identification of microorganisms by flow cytometry was evaluated by using a double staining technique with propidium iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate and a two dimensional analysis. a diverse group of 19 different species and strains of microorganisms was tested to determine if they could be differentiated by flow cytometry. the organisms tested displayed characteristic and distinct two dimensional fluorescent patterns which allowed ready grouping and differentiation into subsets of organisms. the slopes and correlation coefficients of the histograms and the ratio of red to green signals expressed these differences quantitatively and allowed organisms to be placed into one of three groups based  on these values. in some instances, as with streptococcus pneumoniae and pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, it was possible to distinguish between species of bacteria from the same genus. the use of dual dye labeling and flow cytometry provided a rapid method of identifying selected microorganisms and may  be broadly applicable for the detection and identification of many bacteria and fungi.

TI  == deficient intracellular killing of bacteria by murine alveolar macrophages.
AB  == microbiologic methods were used to assess the in vitro phagocytosis and intracellular killing of various species of bacteria by freshly isolated murine peritoneal and alveolar macrophages. peritoneal macrophages showed effective phagocytosis of opsonized streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and listeria monocytogenes, and moderate ingestion of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. alveolar macrophages were poor in phagocytosing opsonized s. pyogenes, s. aureus, and e. coli; ingestion of s. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and s. epidermidis was moderate. peritoneal macrophages killed 40 to 80% of these bacteria intracellularly, but alveolar macrophages showed almost no intracellular killing of bacteria. to find  out whether there is a correlation between the poor bactericidal activity of alveolar macrophages and the oxygen-dependent microbicidal mechanisms of these cells, we determined the uptake of oxygen and the release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide by macrophages at rest and after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (pma) or opsonized s. aureus. upon exposure to these stimuli, peritoneal macrophages, but not alveolar macrophages, showed an increased uptake  of oxygen and release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. because alveolar macrophages contain surface active material (sam), we investigated the phagocytosis and intracellular killing of bacteria and the release of hydrogen peroxide by peritoneal macrophages pretreated with sam. the results showed reduced phagocytosis and impaired intracellular killing of s. epidermidis by these macrophages. the release of hydrogen peroxide by sam-pretreated peritoneal  macrophages upon stimulation with pma or opsonized s. aureus was equal to that of the control peritoneal macrophages.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone anti-infective agent, was evaluated against 419 ocular bacterial isolates of 55 species to determine its potential as a topical agent for the treatment of ocular infections. other agents tested in this study, in which a modified tube-dilution procedure was used, include norfloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, and polymyxin b. ofloxacin demonstrated good to excellent activity against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. the minimum inhibitory concentration against 90% of all bacterial strains tested (mic90) of ofloxacin was 0.5 microgram/ml for staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis, 2 micrograms/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, and 4 micrograms/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa. these species were more susceptible to ofloxacin than to any of the nonquinolones tested. the mic90 of ofloxacin was lower than that of norfloxacin, another quinolone, against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and st. pneumoniae and equal to that of norfloxacin against p. aeruginosa. because of its broad spectrum of activity and excellent in vitro activity, we concluded that ofloxacin has the potential for development into a superior topical treatment for ocular infection.

TI  == purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  == extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. by a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. they were named bac-5 and bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. the remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). both bac-5 and bac-7 efficiently kill escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae. they also arrest the growth of enterobacter cloacae (mics, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae (mic, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). finally, bac-7 but not bac-5 has mics of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis. from the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of bac-5 and bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.

TI  == daptomycin (ly146032) for prevention and treatment of experimental aortic valve endocarditis in rabbits.
AB  == the efficacy of daptomycin (ly146032), a vancomycinlike lipopeptide antibiotic, was compared with that of antibiotics commonly in use for prevention and treatment of experimental aortic valve endocarditis in rabbits. strains of staphylococcus aureus. s. epidermidis, streptococcus sanguis, and enterococcus faecalis were used to establish endocarditis. a single 10-mg/kg dose of daptomycin and a single 25-mg/kg dose of vancomycin were both effective in prevention of endocarditis produced by strains of s. aureus and s. sanguis. daptomycin was more effective than vancomycin for prevention of endocarditis caused by the strain of s. epidermidis. a single dose of daptomycin also was more effective in prevention of staphylococcal and enterococcal endocarditis than were single-dose regimens of cefazolin (100 mg/kg) and the combination of ampicillin (30 mg/kg) plus gentamicin (3 mg/kg), respectively. for treatment of endocarditis, daptomycin (10 mg/kg) as a single daily dose was as effective as regimens of either vancomycin or beta-lactam antibiotics for staphylococcal and enterococcal endocarditis. daptomycin, however, was not as effective as a single  daily dose of 600,000 u of procaine penicillin for endocarditis caused by the strain of s. sanguis.

TI  == in vitro adherence of bacteria to sutures in cardiac surgery.
AB  == the adherence of bacteria to sutures used in cardiac surgery was studied by in vitro quantitative determination with [3h]-leucine-labeled staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus sanguis. the adherence per unit area for staphylococci was least for monofilament polypropylene (prolene), 3 times higher (p less than 0.05) for braided polyester (mersiline) and greatest (10 times, p less than 0.005) for braided polyester sutures coated with polybutylate (ethibond). mean values for the adherence of streptococci were low for all the sutures. sutures pretreated with human plasma showed a 12-37% increase in bacterial adherence. the cell surface hydrophobicity, surface charge  and the haemagglutinating property of bacteria did not correlate with their adherence property. in view of these observations, it is suggested that: (a) the  preferential adherence of staphylococci to intra-cardiac sutures may be one of the explanations for its being the commonest cause of early prosthetic valve endocarditis, (b) there is a need for a careful selection of sutures used in cardiac surgery and (c) the described in vitro assay for bacterial adherence may  be used for monitoring the development of better designed sutures and the effect  of incorporation of antibiotics in the sutures.

AB  == active infective endocarditis (aie) involving native and especially prosthetic aortic valve is often complicated by conduction abnormalities. these conduction disturbances are considered to represent extension of infection from the valve to the annulus and surrounding myocardium. the authors report their experience of conduction disorders in 6/8 patients in whom the aortic prosthetic valve infection was complicated by periprosthetic abscess. they underline the importance of conduction abnormalities as early markers of severe complication in patients with aie. in fact, their detection is a useful tool in revealing severe  complications since clinical, laboratory and other noninvasive examinations do not always allow early diagnosis of the extension of infection to the surrounding myocardium.

AB  == infections in the diabetic host have been shown to persist longer than those in the nondiabetic host. to investigate whether intra-abscess milieu might be a contributing factor to this persistence, the in vivo intra-abscess ph was measured in induced soft-tissue abscesses in diabetic and nondiabetic mice. two models (female genetically obese insulin-resistant and male streptozocin-induced  diabetic mice) were used with appropriate controls. the bacteria injected to produce the soft-tissue abscesses were bacteroides fragilis and enterococcus (b + e), staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus (s + e), and s. aureus (sa). intra-abscess ph measured on day 3 was consistently and significantly lower in all diabetic mice compared with their controls. in the diabetic mice, the ph of an abscess induced with b + e, s + e, and sa was 6.28 (n = 17), 6.79 (n = 10), and 6.52 (n = 10), respectively; the ph in the controls was 7.21 (n = 20), 7.30 (n = 10), and 7.17 (n = 10), respectively. differences in all groups between diabetic and nondiabetic mice were significant. the blood glucose values of the diabetic mice averaged 722 mg/dl, and in the nondiabetic mice were 210 mg/dl. no  animals were ketotic. there were no significant differences in total colony counts between any groups. in conclusion, there is a significantly lower ph in the abscess of the diabetic host compared with the nondiabetic host that is not related to the numbers or types of causative bacteria.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == [the effect of aortic valve translocation and a few problems].
AB  == aortic valve endocarditis is frequently associated with an aortic root abscess, so that it is difficult to insert a prosthetic valve. between april, 1983 and june, 1988 we treated four out of seven patients with aortic valve endocarditis by translocation of the aortic valve, closure of the native coronary ostia, and placement of saphenous vein grafts on the coronary arteries. in each case, the operation was undertaken because of rapidly progressing heart failure. infection  was due to alpha-streptococcus in two instances, to staphylococcus epidermidis and fungus in the other cases. in one of the four patients, the prosthetic aortic valve was sutured to the ascending aorta and two saphenous vein grafts were placed on the proximal coronary arteries. in the other three patients, the composite woven dacron graft was used to replace the ascending aorta and two saphenous vein grafts were placed on the distal coronary arteries. one patient died one year postoperatively of los because of rapidly progressing coronary grafts ostial stenosis. the other three patients survived and doing well with satisfactory hemodynamic function and no infection. translocation of the aortic valve for infective aortic valve endocarditis is a useful operative technique when conventional aortic valve replacement technique cannot be utilize.

AB  == the authors report a case of infectious spondylodiscitis revealing a staphylococcal endocarditis in a patient with a carpentier aortic heterograft. this case, along with 60 descriptions from the literature, has enabled them to specify the characteristics of occurrence of endocarditis during a spondylodiscitis. the clinical factors in favor of this association are: a pre-existing cardiopathy, an oral port of entry, occurrence of other rheumatoid manifestations, even more the presence of complications of endocarditis. the laboratory factors in favor of an association are: discovery of an inflammatory anemia, of circulating immune complexes, of a cryoglobulinemia, of a rheumatoid factor, of hematuria. but it is mostly the demonstration of streptococcus in blood cultures and other samples that should be an indication to search for an endocarditis, the course of which dominates the prognosis.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids from normal and essential fatty  acid-deficient mice.
AB  == among the cutaneous effects of an essential fatty acid deficient (efad) diet are  hyperdesquamation, increased transepidermal water loss (tewl), and altered lipid  profiles, characteristics also common to inflammatory dermatoses. because fatty acids are antimicrobial, we examined the indigenous skin flora of normal and efad hairless mice, and compared the antimicrobial efficacy of lipids extracted from their stratum corneum. efad mice supported 100-fold more bacteria than normal mice, and were the only group from which staphylococcus aureus were routinely isolated. despite this greater carriage, in vitro experiments demonstrated that efad lipids are more lethal than normal lipids against streptococcus pyogenes, s. aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus sp., and a coryneform. skin fungi were equally susceptible to both extracts. after thin layer chromatography, the most active fractions were found to be glycosphingolipids and phospholipids. efad extracts had 35% more free fatty acids and 75% more glycosphingolipids; normal extracts had more triglycerides and phospholipids. s. aureus strain 502a survived equally well on efad as on normal mice. normal lipids applied on efad mice had no additional effect, but efad lipids on normal mice brought about a 35% reduction of the inoculated bacteria. if the mice were pretreated with alcohol, carriage of strain 502a was reduced by 71%. if instead the mice were previously washed with acetone to increase tewl, a 97% reduction of the staphylococcus occurred. the application of normal flora to such acetone-washed mice decreased the efficacy to 76%. efad and normal lipids on human subjects were equally ineffective in eliminating strain 502a.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == mechanisms of bacterial opsonization by immune globulin intravenous: correlation  of complement consumption with opsonic activity and protective efficacy.
AB  == to study the mechanism of bacterial opsonization by immune globulin intravenous (igiv) complement consumption and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmnl) membrane receptor (fcrlo, cr1, and cr3)-mediated phagocytosis of staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and groups a and b streptococci were examined. igiv alone did not consume complement and showed no opsonic activity by itself for these organisms. when these bacteria were preopsonized in igiv, significant amounts of complement were consumed (44%-94%) and the uptake and killing of bacteria occurred. the in vitro opsonic activity of igiv for these organisms was significantly correlated with the amount of complement consumed by  the igiv-opsonized bacteria (r = .85, p less than .05). the in vivo protective efficacy of igiv also appeared to be directly associated with its ability to activate and consume complement (r = 1.0, p less than .001). antibodies to fcrlo  (leu 11) markedly inhibited phagocytosis of bacteria opsonized in igiv but not that of bacteria opsonized in specific igm. both cr1 and cr3 receptors on pmnls were involved in uptake, but the contribution of each is different with different organisms.

TI  == in-vitro activity of fce 22101 and synergy studies with other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == fce 22101 is a penem antibiotic with broad in-vitro activity similar to that of imipenem, although less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa. combinations of fce 22101 with ciprofloxacin or gentamicin against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant staph. epidermidis resulted in addition or indifference by the chequerboard method. the combination of fce 22101 and gentamicin against streptococcus faecalis was usually additive. against enterobacter cloacae fce 22101 had mics of 16 mg/l whilst in combination with gentamicin (0.25-0.12 mg/l) the mics were reduced to less than 2 mg/l. ciprofloxacin and fce 22101 showed only addition against enterobacter spp. similar results were obtained with the combinations of fce 22101 and gentamicin or ciprofloxacin tested against citrobacter freundii. with serratia spp. fce 22101 and gentamicin showed synergy, but fce 22101 and ciprofloxacin showed indifference. similar results were obtained with strains of escherichia coli and  klebsiella, proteus, and providencia spp. fce 22101 plus gentamicin, or aztreonam, against ps. aeruginosa usually showed indifference, but with ciprofloxacin addition was the rule. in general the combination of fce 22101 with other agents resulted in an additive rather than a synergistic effect.

TI  == intra-abdominal sepsis after hepatic resection.
AB  == one hundred and thirty hepatic resections performed over an 8-year period were reviewed for evidence of postoperative intra-abdominal sepsis. of 126 patients who survived for more than 24 hours after operation, 36 developed culture positive intra-abdominal collections (28.6%). significant independent variables associated with the development of intra-abdominal sepsis were diagnoses of trauma or cholangiocarcinoma, and the need for reoperation to control hemorrhage  during the postoperative period. before 1984, infected fluid collections were treated predominantly by operative drainage, but this has largely been replaced by percutaneous methods, which have proven effective in most cases. eighteen (50%) of the infections were caused by a mixed bacterial culture, with streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli being the most common isolates. six patients with clinical signs of sepsis had a sterile fluid collection drained with complete relief of symptoms. this review suggests that intra-abdominal sepsis is a frequent complication after hepatic resection, and can often be managed successfully by nonoperative percutaneous drainage.

TI  == nisin, a peptide antibiotic: cloning and sequencing of the nisa gene and posttranslational processing of its peptide product.
AB  == nisin produced by streptococcus lactis is used as a food preservative and is the  most important member of a group of antibiotics containing lanthionine bridges. to understand the genetic basis of these so-called lantibiotics (schnell et al.,  nature 333:276-278, 1988), we characterized the nisin structural gene, nisa, which is located on a plasmid and codes for a 57-amino-acid prepeptide. the prepeptide is processed posttranslationally to the pentacyclic antibiotic. although nisin and the recently elucidated lantibiotic epidermin from staphylococcus epidermidis are produced by different organisms, their gene organization is identical. as with epidermin, the nisin propeptide corresponds to the c-terminus of the prepeptide. the n-terminus of the prepeptide is cleaved at  a characteristic splice site (pro--2 arg--1 ile-+1). remarkably, the n-terminus of prenisin shares 70% similarity with preepidermin, although the propeptide sequences are distinctly different. the structural similarities between these two lantibiotics are consistent with the fact that there is a common mechanism of biosynthesis of these lanthionine-containing antibiotics.

(ii) of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were  gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) of these gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were enterobacteriaceae were enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious gram negative bacilli. (iv) the more common species among the members of enterobacteriaceae were escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). the other common species included enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii and proteus vulgaris. the frequencies of salmonella species and shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. the most common isolate among other glucose fermentative gram negative bacilli was aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). the finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in taiwan. (v) of these glucose nonfermentative gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) pseudomonas species.

TI  == the microbial ecology of soybean soaking for tempe production.
AB  == soybeans soaked in tap water for 24 to 36 h at 20, 30 or 37 degrees c underwent a natural fermentation that was characterized by the growth of microorganisms to 10(8)-10(10) cfu/ml (depending on temperature) and a reduction of ph from 6.5 to  4.5. lactobacillus casei, streptococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus dysgalactiae dominated the fermentation but, significant contributions were also made by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter agglomerans, citrobacter diversus and bacillus brevis, and the yeasts pichia burtonii, candida didensiae and rhodotorula rubra.  fermentation of surface-decontaminated beans in sterile water with pure cultures  of these isolates showed l. casei, strep. faecium and staph. epidermidis to be the main species responsible for the ph reduction. soybeans were the main source  of microorganisms for the fermentation. boiled beans did not undergo an acid fermentation.

TI  == arginolytic and ureolytic activities of pure cultures of human oral bacteria and  their effects on the ph response of salivary sediment and dental plaque in vitro.
AB  == thirty-nine different microorganisms commonly found in supragingival plaque and salivary sediment were screened for their ability to raise the ph by producing base from arginine, lysylarginine and urea. only actinomyces naeslundii and staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant ph-rise activity with all three compounds. eleven bacteria demonstrated such activity with arginine and lysylarginine but not with urea. only one, actinomyces viscosus, produced a ph-rise with urea but not with the two arginine compounds. the remaining 26 bacteria showed little or no base-forming activity with any of the three test substrates. the ability of the different oral bacteria to produce base (especially from urea) was a less universal function than their ability to produce acid from fermentable carbohydrate. substituting pure cultures of arginolytic or non-arginolytic bacteria for portions of the mixed bacterial populations of plaque or sediment in test incubations containing glucose and arginine altered their ability to produce ph-fall-ph-rise responses shaped like those of the stephen curve in vivo. in general, addition of arginolytic bacteria  made these in vitro ph responses less acidic, whereas addition of non-arginolytic bacteria made the responses more acidic. because of the relatively high arginolytic activity of the plaque harvested in this study, the effect of adding  non-arginolytic bacteria was more readily seen than the converse. similar changes in levels of ureolytic microorganisms and incubation with glucose and urea had little effect on sediment or plaque being able to produce a ph-fall-ph-rise type  of response. when increasing proportions of the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment were replaced with the highly cariogenic lactobacillus casei or streptococcus mutans, the ph minimum became slightly more acidic and then slightly more alkaline, whereas the ph-rise became progressively and significantly less. thus arginolytic bacteria have a different and greater effect on shaping the ph response of plaque or sediment than ureolytic bacteria. a large change in the proportions of arginolytic or non-arginolytic microorganisms may be needed to make a plaque microflora potentially non-cariogenic or cariogenic, respectively.

AB  == fifty-three consecutive subclavian or jugular hemodialysis catheters inserted into 41 patients were prospectively studied over a period of 8 months in order to determine the incidence of infection and its mechanisms. the intravascular, intradermal and the y catheter segments as well as both connections were cultured using a quantitative technique for the intraluminal surface. in addition, the intravascular and intradermal portions of the catheter were cultured using a semiquantitative technique for the external surface. skin smears of the catheter  entry site were also cultured, and blood cultures were similarly obtained if fewer developed. twenty-nine of the 53 catheters (55%) were significantly colonized by one (19 cases) or more (10 cases) microorganisms. the source of the  colonizing microorganisms was the skin in 17 cases (58%), intraluminal in 5 (17%), both routes in 5 (17%) and others in 2 (6.8%). staphylococcus epidermidis  (22 cases) and staphylococcus aureus (4 cases) were the bacteria most frequently  isolated. nine of the 53 catheterizations (17%) were complicated by catheter-related septicemia due to s. aureus in 4 cases, s. epidermidis in 3 cases, streptococcus faecalis in 1 and proteus vulgaris in 1. catheter-related bacteremia contributed to a patient's death in 1 case. suppurative local infections of the catheter entry site developed in 3 cases, 2 of them with septicemia. we conclude that the rate of infection due to subclavian or jugular hemodialysis catheters is very high and that the skin is the most frequent origin of the microorganisms.

TI  == the etiology of bacterial cellulitis as determined by fine-needle aspiration.
AB  == bacterial cellulitis is a common problem, etiologic diagnosis often unrewarding and opinions differ on empiric therapy. the purpose of this study was to determine the major microbiologic causes of bacterial cellulitis in a walk-in emergency room setting. 94 cases in 89 patients with clinical signs of cellulitis were studied. the infection was closed in 74 cases and associated with an open skin lesion in 22. the infection site was aspirated with a suction air-buffer technique employing a cameco handle for easier handling and stabilization of the  aspiration needle. after exclusion of contaminated samples, positive cultures were obtained from 30 cases (31.9%). cultures were positive in 30.6% of open lesions and in 36.4% of closed ones. staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism, present in 11 cases, s. epidermidis in 8 and group a beta-hemolytic streptococci in 5. all s. aureus strains were methicillin-sensitive and only 1 was sensitive to penicillin. the most common site of infection was the lower extremity (59%). according to these data the optimal initial therapy for bacterial cellulitis in adults should be with drugs active against both staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == bacterial corneal ulcers among arabs in kuwait.
AB  == a retrospective clinicomicrobiological study of 228 patients with bacterial corneal ulcers was performed. positive cultures of corneal ulcer samples were obtained from 68% of all patients. a high incidence of staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated from patients' ulcers, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus were the next most frequent pathogens. of some help in identifying the causative organism were the locations  of the ulcer, the presence or absence of hypopyon and the frequency of perforation of the ulcer. cephaloridine, gentamicin and polymyxin were found to be the most effective therapy. gram strains of ulcer samples were positive for organisms in only 13% of patients and accordingly were not considered useful in determining initial therapy of ulcers. since corneal and conjunctival cultures in the majority of the control group were negative, one can presume that most of the s. epidermidis isolated from patients' ulcers was exogenous in nature.

TI  == therapy of serious gram-positive infections with teicoplanin.
AB  == teicoplanin was used as monotherapy in 17 seriously ill patients (mean age 51 years, range 18-71) with infection due to gram-positive organisms. the dose used  was 200 mg teicoplanin intravenously once daily after an initial intravenous dose of 400 mg. most of the patients (15 out of 17) were septicaemic (confirmed by blood culture), the other two had deep abscesses. the pathogens isolated were staphylococcus epidermidis [15], streptococcus faecium [1] and jk coryneform [1]. the 15 patients with staph. epidermidis infections had all been treated previously with a beta-lactam (usually flucloxacillin)/aminoglycoside combination to which staph. epidermidis was resistant. all patients were still pyrexial after 48 h of therapy and were then changed to teicoplanin as monotherapy. patients were treated with teicoplanin for 5 to 7 days. one was withdrawn because of vomiting associated with the teicoplanin infusion, and another was withdrawn because she was given amikacin for a separate gram-negative infection, but all the other 15 patients responded well to therapy, usually becoming apyrexial within 48 h. all 15 septicaemic patients had central lines in situ: 10 responded  to therapy with the line left in situ but in 5 the lines were removed, either before or during teicoplanin therapy. teicoplanin levels were determined in all patients, usually on day 2, with no evidence of toxicity from these levels. teicoplanin was found to be effective as monotherapy for septicaemia mainly due to staph. epidermidis in patients with severe underlying disease.

TI  == survival of streptococcus viridans in gentamicin-supplemented mccarey-kaufman medium.
AB  == our experience with three cases of streptococcus viridans endophthalmitis, following penetrating keratoplasty, prompted us to investigate the ability of gentamicin-supplemented mccarey-kaufman (m-k) medium to kill s. viridans contaminants. after inoculation of 20 cc of gentamicin-supplemented m-k with s. viridans, the m-k was exposed to temperature conditions similar to those that would be encountered by a donor cornea during storage (4 degrees c) and preoperative warming prior to keratoplasty (23 degrees c). colony counts were performed at regular intervals. after 1 h of warming, no reduction in the initial inoculum had occurred. this is in contrast to results from similar experiments with staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in which more than 1 log unit of killing occurred after 1 h. while previously reported clinical experience has demonstrated an overall low incidence of postkeratoplasty endophthalmitis using gentamicin-supplemented m-k, our own recent clinical and laboratory data suggest that additional or alternate antibiotic coverage for s. viridans may be prudent.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

AB  == this study was performed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and the safety of sultamicillin (sbtpc) fine granules in the treatment of patients with meibomianitis. a dose of 375 mg sbtpc granules was orally given to 10 patients with meibomianitis after each meal, three times a day. the results obtained are summarized as follows. efficacies were rated as good in 7 cases, fair in 2 and poor in 1 with an efficacy ratio of 70.0%. no side effects were observed throughout the study. the organisms isolated were gram-positive bacteria such as  staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, coagulase negative staphylococcus and streptococcus sanguis, and gram-negative bacteria such as alcaligenes denitrificans subsp. denitrificans, alcaligenes denitrificans subsp.  xylosoxidans, xanthomonas maltophilia and acinetobacter lwoffii. a bacteriological study showed lower mics of sbtpc than those of ampicillin (abpc), suggesting that sbtpc has more potent antibacterial activity than abpc. such bacteriological activity of sbtpc was well reflected in its clinical efficacy; the drug was effective in patients with infections caused by organisms moderately or highly resistant to abpc or cefaclor.

TI  == staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus in otitis media with effusion.
AB  == bacteriologic investigation of middle ear effusion (mee), external ear canal, and the nasopharynx was carried out on 458 patients with otitis media with effusion.  staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common bacteria in mee, even after excluding the contaminants from the external ear canal, which had the same value  of minimal inhibitory concentration as the paired mee. the bacterial agreement of s epidermidis between mee and the nasopharynx was extremely rare in contrast with haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and branhamella catarrhalis, although the organism was also frequently isolated from the nasopharynx. staphylococcus aureus, having the same minimal inhibitory concentration as that in the nasopharynx, was more frequently found in mee than s epidermidis. the results suggest that s epidermidis found in mee is not a pathogen, but rather a contaminant in many instances. staphylococcus aureus seems to be a causative agent in otitis media with effusion.

AB  == a bacteriological study of the middle-ear effusions and the ear canals in children with chronic serous otitis media (s.o.m.) was performed. sixty-eight children (127 ears) were investigated. from this study it appeared that cleansing of the ear canal with 0.5% chlorhexidine in 70% ethanol for 30 s is partially effective; micro-organisms (diptheroids, staphylococcus epidermidis) could still  be isolated in 29%. cleansing of the ear canal decreases the incidence of middle-ear fluid contamination by non-pathogenic ear canal organisms (diptheroids, staphylococcus epidermidis, aerococcus), but after cleansing, 'non-pathogenic' micro-organisms could still be isolated in 33% of the effusions  (diptheroids, staphylococcus epidermidis). from 12% of the middle-ear effusions pathogenic micro-organisms (hemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus pneumoniae) were isolated; cleansing of the ear canal did not influence this percentage. anaerobics were not isolated from the middle-ear effusions.

TI  == bacterial keratitis after penetrating keratoplasty.
AB  == bacterial keratitis continues to be a serious problem in developing countries. the authors studied 881 patients who had undergone penetrating keratoplasty (total of 947 procedures) from january 1983 to march 1986 at the king khaled eye  specialist hospital, riyadh, saudia arabia. all patients were followed for at least 6 months. clinical evidence of bacterial keratitis developed in 113 (11.9%) eyes with penetrating keratoplasties in 108 patients. the causative organisms among those patients included: streptococcus pneumoniae, 29 (26%); staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 (21%); pseudomonas aeruginosa, 13 (12%); staphylococcus aureus, 5 (4%); hemophilus influenzae, 5 (4%); moraxella spp, 5 (4%); alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, 5 (4%); and other bacteria, 27 (25%). in addition, postoperative epithelial defects that required hospital admission for treatment developed in 21 (2.2%) patients. herpetic keratitis developed in three (0.3%) patients and fungal keratitis developed in 1 (0.1%). statistically significant predisposing risk factors included: trichiasis (p less than 0.0001), epithelial defects (p less than 0.0001), soft contact lens wear (p less than 0.0001), and eroding sutures (p less than 0.0001). the authors believe that the incidence of postoperative bacterial keratitis can be minimized or avoided by appropriate selection of patients for penetrating keratoplasties as well as good preoperative and postoperative management of associated ocular conditions.

TI  == streptococcus faecalis susceptibility to amiloride depends on medium ph.
AB  == amiloride is one of the major molecular probes in basic and applied investigations on the physiology of cation transport in animal cells. in these cells the drug also exerts growth inhibitory activity. recently, we discovered that amiloride causes growth inhibition also on bacterial cells. in this paper we report that medium ph influences amiloride activity on streptococcus faecalis. the lowering of external ph causes a drop in the susceptibility of this bacterium to amiloride up to an almost complete resistance. this finding, constitutes a novel aspect of the in vitro experimental pharmacology of this diuretic potentially useful also in clinical pharmacology and in animal cell investigations.

TI  == ciprofloxacin activity in cyst fluid from polycystic kidneys.
AB  == renal cyst infection in patients with polycystic kidney disease (pkd) is often unresponsive to standard antimicrobial therapy, in part because of the failure of most antibiotics to adequately penetrate cyst fluid. ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antibiotic, possesses in vitro activity against most pathogens likely to be encountered in renal cyst infection. to study the potential usefulness of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of cyst infection, fluid from 70 cysts was obtained from seven patients with polycystic kidney disease who were receiving the drug. cysts were categorized as nongradient or gradient by the sodium concentration in the fluid. the ciprofloxacin concentration within cysts was measured, and the cyst fluid bactericidal activity against likely cyst fluid pathogens was determined. the mean (+/- standard error) ciprofloxacin concentration was 12.7 +/- 2.9 micrograms/ml. preferential accumulation of ciprofloxacin occurred in gradient cysts; these levels exceeded levels in serum by more than fourfold. cyst fluid bactericidal activity titers were uniformly high against escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis, while less activity was observed against streptococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis.

TI  == thromboxane-associated pulmonary hypertension during three types of gram-positive bacteremia in piglets.
AB  == thromboxane-associated pulmonary hypertension occurs in animals during intravenous infusion of group b streptococcus (gbs), a gram-positive neonatal pathogen. we postulated that other gram-positive neonatal pathogens, such as streptococcus fecalis (ent) and staphylococcus epidermidis (s. epi) would also induce increased thromboxane synthesis and pulmonary hypertension when infused into piglets. we observed similar hemodynamic and gas exchange abnormalities during stepwise increases in the dose of gbs, ent, and s. epi (n = 3, 4, and 4 piglets receiving each bacteria, respectively). pulmonary vascular resistance increased significantly in the absence of acidosis or reduced arterial or mixed venous po2 at a dose of 2.5 x 10(8) cfu/kg/h for ent and s. epi. in 14 additional piglets, pulmonary vascular resistance increased markedly after 60 min of intravenous infusion of 4 +/- 1 x 10(8) cfu/kg/h for each organism (p less than 0.05, gbs: 11.7 +/- 1.8 to 75.6 +/- 18.4 mm hg/liter/min, ent: 12.7 +/- 1.7 to 64.9 +/- 10.6 mm hg/liter/min, s. epi: 10.5 +/- 0.8 to 56.9 +/- 6.0 mm hg/liter/min), and blood thromboxane b2 levels increased (p less than 0.05, gbs:  30 +/- 10 to 1830 +/- 330 pg/ml, ent: 20 +/- 7 to 1110 +/- 300 pg/ml, s. epi: 31  +/- 9 to 1260 +/- 350 pg/ml). this dose of each bacteria caused a similar degree  of mild arterial hypoxemia (57-66 mm hg). the thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, dazmegrel, completely reversed pulmonary hypertension, reduced txb2 levels to near baseline values, and partially reversed arterial hypoxemia despite ongoing bacterial infusion. we conclude that thromboxane-associated pulmonary hypertension occurs in piglets during infusion of different gram-positive neonatal pathogens.

TI  == origin of organisms infecting ventricular shunts.
AB  == results of skin cultures obtained before 413 of 505 operations for cerebrospinal  fluid-diverting ventricular shunt placement or revision in a pediatric population from april 1980 to may 1983 are analyzed and compared to results of cultures from 20 subsequent shunt infections. sensitivities to 11 different antibiotics were determined for each isolate cultured. the total operative infection rate was 20 of 505 (4%). gram-negative bacilli alone accounted for 3 of 20 (15%) shunt infections. one gram-negative bacillus/staphylococcus aureus infection occurred.  factors predisposing for gram-negative bacillus shunt infection were found in all 4 cases. the majority of shunt infections were caused by typical resident skin organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis alone, 9/20 (45%); staphylococcus aureus alone, 4/20 (20%); corynebacterium sp., 1/20 (5%); alpha-streptococcus with s. epidermidis, 1/20 (5%); and micrococcus with s. epidermidis, 1/20 (5%). only 4 (20%) of the 20 shunt infections were due to organisms identical to those originally grown from the skin. another 4 (20%) seemed to be infected with a strain of organism different from that initially recovered from the skin. the remaining skin organism shunt infections may or may not have come from the patient's skin. the data suggest that not all skin organism shunt infections arise from contamination by resident skin bacteria at the incision sites at the time of operation. alternate sources for the infecting organisms are discussed. the antibiotic sensitivity data on skin isolates and shunt isolates suggest that  vancomycin is the antibiotic best suited for prophylaxis against shunt infection  at our institution.

TI  == [treatment of peritonitis in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis with intraperitoneal ceftriaxone].
AB  == in 16 patients under capd, 29 cases of bacterial peritonitis were observed, with  clinical manifestations in 23. the mean cell count in peritoneal dialysis fluid was 5608/mm3 with 4991/mm3 polymorphonuclear, leukocytes causative pathogens were staphylococcus in 14 cases, streptococcus in 6, bacillus in one, enterobacteria in 5, pseudomonas aeruginosa in 1 and moraxella in 1. three cultures were negative. first choice treatment was a daily intraperitoneal injection of 1 g of  ceftriaxone. 79.3% of patients recovered within 5 days. failure were due to a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis in one case, a streptococcus faecalis in two cases, and a staphylococcus aureus in three observations, which two were responsible of abscess round catheter peritoneal. mean ceftriaxone concentrations 24 hours after the intraperitoneal injection were 50.6 mg/l (range: 3.3-141 mg/l) in serum and 58.1 mg/l (range: 4.3-180 mg/l) in dialysate.  these concentrations are greater than most of ceftriaxone's mics for susceptible  bacteria, a finding that confirm the value of treatment with a single daily intraperitoneal injection of ceftriaxone.

TI  == [efficacy of teicoplanin in 25 cases of severe infections caused by gram-positive cocci].
AB  == teicoplanin was evaluated in 25 severe infections caused by gram-positive bacteria alone [13], in combination [9], alone then in combination [3], in an open study. of 22 infections that could be evaluated, there were 18 cures and improvements (81.8%), 2 recurrence and 2 failures. serum concentrations are unpredictable and steady after 5 days i.v. teicoplanin. trough and peak concentrations are respectively less than 5 mg/l and less than 20 mg/l in 13 infections and higher in 9, unrelated with success or failure. a trough concentration greater than cmi and kind of infection seem deciding. the choice of the antibiotic combined with teicoplanin warrant more data.

AB  == staphylococcus aureus, which has exceptional ability to cause disease in man, has responded to the introductions of antimicrobial agents by the selection and emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. there have been cyclical changes in the prevalence of these strains in nosocomial infections. other gram-positive species that give rise to concern, for related reasons, are staph. epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus faecalis and the jk group of corynebacteria. these problems are discussed to provide a background for the contributions that follow.

TI  == effect of ofloxacin on oral and gastrointestinal microflora in patients undergoing gastric surgery.
AB  == the effect of ofloxacin on the microflora in saliva, gastric juice, and feces was evaluated in 24 patients undergoing gastric surgery. a single peroral dose of 400 mg ofloxacin was given to each patient 2-4 h before surgery. the concentrations of ofloxacin in serum, saliva, gastric juice, and gastric mucosa tissue were assayed. only branhamella cocci were affected in the saliva. in the gastric juice, both the aerobic and anaerobic flora were suppressed on the day of surgery, but increased in number afterwards. there was a significant correlation  between gastric ph and the number of microorganisms isolated in the gastric juice on day 0. in faeces, the aerobic and part of the anaerobic flora were suppressed  by the administration of ofloxacin. ofloxacin was well tolerated by the patients. four of 24 patients developed postoperative complications. microorganisms isolated from wound sepsis and intraabdominal sepsis (three patients) were staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, hemolytic streptococci group a, streptococcus sp. and escherichia coli. all related infections occurred in patients with very low ofloxacin serum concentrations, probably due to impaired absorption. oral antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended in patients in whom impaired gastric emptying can be expected.

TI  == [preventive antibiotic administration in complicated rhinosurgical interventions--a double-blind study].
AB  == revision rhinoplasty was performed in 100 patients. in most cases a complete rhinoplasty with septal reconstruction, osteotomies, wedge resection and free transplants had to be done. intranasal swabs for bacterial culture were taken pre- and postoperatively. 48 patients received three mega units of propicillin transorally for 12 days, 52 patients received a placebo. white blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and temperature were taken to indicate inflammation of the nasal region. turbid nasal secretion, reddening and swelling  of the nasal linings, and bleeding of the noninjured nasal mucosa were taken as clinical signs of infection. preoperatively staphylococcus epidermidis was cultured in 69% from the nasal cavities, staphylococcus aureus in 42%, streptococci in 24%, diphtheroids in 22% etc. (see table 1). serious infections developed in six patients (five of them without antibiotics), more localized infections in twelve patients (nine of them without antibiotics). some of the infections developed after removal of the nasal packing. in five patients with serious infections either streptococcus viridans or streptococcus pneumoniae could be cultured preoperatively. in three of five cases the streptococci were propicillin-sensitive. clinical signs and laboratory parameters were not helpful  in identifying patients with infections. we conclude that patients undergoing revision rhinosurgery should be followed carefully for at least two weeks. postoperative administration of propicillin appears to be able to prevent serious nasal infections especially if free transplants are used.

TI  == the effects of sinus bacteria on human ciliated nasal epithelium in vitro.
AB  == the mechanisms by which bacteria colonize and damage ciliated epithelium are important in understanding the pathophysiology of rhinitis, sinusitis, and otitis. bacteria that have the ability to impair mucociliary clearance would be at an advantage in establishing infection of ciliated surfaces. this study investigates the effect of hemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, and staphylococcus epidermidis on the ciliary activity of normal ciliated nasal epithelium in human beings. ciliary activity of the nasal epithelium in the presence of each pathogen was assessed for more than 240  minutes with a photometric method of ciliary beat frequency (cbf) measurement. h. influenzae exerted significant effects on ciliary activity, with a 46% decrease in the cbf by 4 hours (with bacteria-containing broth) and a 32% decrease with bacteria-free filtrate. s. epidermidis decreased cbf by 44% with the bacterial broth. a sterile cell-free filtrate had no significant effect. s. pneumoniae and  b. catarrhalis had no significant effect on cbf within a 240-minute period. h. influenzae and s. epidermidis disrupted normal synchronous ciliary motion, causing adjacent cilia to beat at different rates.

TI  == efficacy of teicoplanin as antimicrobial treatment of severe nosocomial infections caused by gram-positive bacteria: a preliminary study.
AB  == we used single daily intravenous teicoplanin as therapy for 12 severe nosocomial  infections caused by gram-positive bacteria. a daily dosage of 3-6 mg/kg was usually adopted; however, in selected cases the dosage was increased to 8-9.5 mg/day on the basis of serum bactericidal monitoring. most of these infections were life-threatening and included ventriculitis/meningitis (3 cases), sepsis (3  cases), mediastinitis (1 case) and extensive burn wound infection (1 case). staphylococcus aureus was by far the most frequent pathogen and methicillin-resistant strains were isolated in 7 out of 9 infections caused by this organism. the remaining isolates were staphylococcus epidermidis, jk corynebacterium, streptococcus agalactiae and propionilbacterium acnes. additional antibiotics were used in 5 cases for concomitant gram-negative bacillus etiology (2 cases), granulocytopenia (2 cases), superinfection (1 case). overall a clinical success and microbial eradication were documented in 100% and  91% of 12 cases, respectively. except one case of fever, no other major adverse effect was observed and no patient required trial therapy discontinuation. in conclusion, our preliminary data seem to suggest a satisfactory activity of teicoplanin against nosocomial gram-positive infections.

TI  == clinical laboratory challenges in the recognition of leuconostoc spp.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant streptococcus salivarius-like bacteria were isolated from the blood and gastrostomy tube of a 6-month-old child during vancomycin therapy for staphylococcus epidermidis central venous catheter-associated bacteremia. the isolates produced d-(-)-lactate and ethanol from glucose, hydrolyzed esculin, and produced no ammonia from arginine, thus fulfilling the major criteria as leuconostoc spp. the enzymatic profile of the bacteria suggested that they were not lactobacilli or streptococci. resistance to vancomycin and penicillin tolerance were noted. the formula fed through the gastrostomy tube was suspected  as the vehicle that transmitted the organism to the patient. penicillin and tobramycin therapy was used successfully.

TI  == outcome of infected total hip arthroplasty. an inclusive, consecutive series.
AB  == twenty-one infected total hip arthroplasties in 19 patients performed between 1971 and 1982 were prospectively followed, using a computerized standard orthopaedic arthritis record. these cases represent an inclusive and unselected,  consecutive series. the mean follow-up period from time of infection was 4.8 years (range, 1.2-11.7 years). infection was diagnosed by positive bacteriologic  culture. ten hips grew a staphylococcal species, 5 a single gram-negative organism, 1 a streptococcus, and 5 multiple organisms. at final follow-up evaluation, only three hips (14%) had the previously infected prosthesis still in situ, and these had no evidence of ongoing deep infection. five additional hips (24%) were successfully salvaged after one- or two-stage prosthetic exchange. two hips (10%) have an infected prosthesis in situ. eleven hips (52%) had resection arthroplasty, three after attempts at prosthetic reinsertion. therefore, at final follow-up evaluation, only 8 of the 21 hips (38%) have an apparently infection-free salvaged or reinserted prosthesis in place. good prognostic factors for prosthetic salvage/successful reinsertion include staphylococcus epidermidis infection and a traumatic etiology necessitating later hip arthroplasty. poor prognostic factors include infection with staphylococcus aureus or multiple organisms and a preoperative diagnosis of avascular necrosis.

TI  == a survey of aerobic bacteria and fungi in the feces of healthy psittacine birds.
AB  == fecal samples from 61 clinically healthy psittacine birds of a wide variety of species were cultured for bacteria and fungi. the most common bacterial isolates  were gram-positive bacilli, which were recovered from 60 of the 61 birds. these organisms included lactobacillus, bacillus, corynebacterium, and streptomyces. gram-positive cocci, cultured from the feces of 21 of the birds, included staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus spp., aerococcus spp., and micrococcus  spp. only 6 of the 61 psittaciformes yielded gram-negative bacteria, with escherichia coli being the most frequent isolate. gram-negative bacilli were recovered from 4 of the 31 privately owned birds and 2 of the 30 petshop birds sampled. in addition to the bacteria, candida albicans, cryptococcus laurentii, and aspergillus sp. were isolated from 13 fecal cultures. candida albicans was isolated exclusively from 5 petshop birds. the number of birds yielding corynebacterium and gram-negative bacteria increased with age, whereas the number of birds yielding lactobacilli and yeasts decreased with age. the organisms isolated and their significance as potential pathogens in psittacine birds are discussed.

TI  == chorioamnionitis: a study of organisms isolated in perinatal autopsies.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the validity of postmortem cultures in perinatal autopsies; in particular, those cases where there is gross or histologic evidence of chorioamnionitis. lung, liver, blood, and placental cultures were obtained from 159 neonatal autopsies with histologic evidence of chorioamnionitis at magee-women's hospital between january 1980 and july 1985. the criterion for chorioamnionitis was a polymorphonuclear leukocytic infiltrate  in the placental membranes. the neonates studied were 63 percent white and 36 percent black; the male to female ratio was 83 to 76. intrauterine fetal death occurred in 43 percent of the cases. the mean gestational age was 24 weeks. premature labor occurred in 64 percent of the cases, and 70 percent of the cases  presented with premature rupture of fetal membranes. congenital pneumonia (defined by the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the alveolar spaces)  was present in 45 percent of cases. the lung was the most frequent site cultured; the four most frequently isolated organisms were: staphylococcus epidermidis--18  percent; beta streptococcus group b--13 percent; e. coli--nine percent; ureaplasma urealyticum--nine percent. negative cultures from multiple sites occurred in seven percent of cases. the results of this investigation indicate that multi-organ cultures help in defining the role of a particular bacteria as a pathogen, and that staphylococcus epidermidis may be a true fetal pathogen under  certain conditions. it is recommended that cultures for chlamydia trachomatis not be done on fetal tissues.

TI  == management of catheter-related infections in pediatric patients.
AB  == broviac catheters are commonly used to provide parenteral nutrition and access for infusion of blood products and drugs to pediatric patients. sepsis is the most common serious complication of continued catheter use. although removal of the catheter is generally recommended when it becomes contaminated, it may not be feasible to do so without compromising patient care. we evaluated the management  of catheter-related infections in pediatric patients with and without removal of  catheter. seventy-seven episodes of catheter sepsis were evaluated in 61 pediatric patients; 24 were neonates and 37 were older children. the catheters were used for multiple purposes in 75% of cases. the most common microorganisms isolated were staphylococcus epidermidis in 26%, klebsiella pneumoniae in 9%, and streptococcus viridans in 8% of cases; other pathogens included group d enterococcus, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in four older children. thirty-five patients were treated with antibiotics without catheter removal. thirty patients received appropriate antibiotic therapy based on the susceptibility data. twenty-six of these 30 patients responded within 5 days of therapy whereas the others required 15-39 days of treatment. lack of response was mainly associated with the presence of abscess, immunocompromised status, and organisms p. aeruginosa and candida albicans. based on the sensitivity and minimum inhibitory concentration data, a combined regimen of gentamicin and vancomycin would be an effective initial therapy. these findings suggest that (1) catheter sepsis can be managed with appropriate antibiotics, and (2) when continued use of broviac catheter is desired, a trial of antibiotic therapy should be attempted before catheter removal.

TI  == the bacteria responsible for ureolysis in artificial dental plaque.
AB  == the origin of ureolytic activity in artificial-mouth plaques was established by assessing the contribution to plaque ureolytic activity of the isolated bacteria. to overcome losses of ureolytic activity caused by the unstable presence of urease in oral bacteria, ureolytic bacteria were isolated from an exceptionally active plaque (1 mumol nh3/min per mg protein) in which 63 per cent of the flora  was ureolytic. after their ability to metabolize urea was stabilized, 13 ureolytic bacteria remained: seven strains of streptococcus salivarius, one streptococcus bovis, two staphylococcus epidermidis and three staphylococcus haemolyticus. their urease activity, measured after growth into stationary phase, was reproducible and strain specific with a 20-fold range within each genus. the  mean ureolytic activity of each species, when weighted by its calculated incidence in the original plaque, accounted for 40 per cent of the total plaque ureolytic activity. however, these values for urease levels were only a small fraction of the bacterial ureolytic potential. urease per mg cell protein measured during the growth cycle of a selected strep. salivarius, and staph. epidermidis, varied 10-fold, and reached much higher activities (i.e. 6-8 mumol nh3/min per mg of cell protein) than under the growth conditions that were used to assess the contribution of these species to total plaque ureolysis. thus urea  metabolism in artificial plaque was due mainly to strep. salivarius, with a small contribution from staph. epidermidis. the presence of further unidentified species of ureolytic oral bacteria need not be invoked.

AB  == teicoplanin, a recently introduced glycopeptide antibiotic, has been used, in combination with other antibiotics, to treat 31 episodes of septicaemia caused by gram-positive organisms. teicoplanin has double the activity of vancomycin against many gram-positive bacteria, but allergic reactions and toxicity appear to be infrequent. a single daily dose is sufficient to maintain therapeutic levels, which is an advantage in conditions requiring long-term treatment. of the 31 episodes treated, 16 were associated with infective endocarditis, 11 with hickman catheter infection, two with bone and joint infection, and two with infection of other indwelling prosthetic devices. staphylococcus epidermidis was  isolated in 18 infections, of which seven treatment courses were unsuccessful. one death occurred from an uncontrolled infection, three deaths from underlying disease (one of which had relapsed twice), and one after withdrawal of treatment  following febrile reaction. eleven episodes were cured. six episodes of staphylococcus aureus septicaemia were treated, of which two failed to respond, two relapsed, one improved and one was cured. the remaining seven episodes were caused by streptococci (including streptococcus faecalis), and in all of them cure was achieved despite the lack of consistent serum bactericidal activity in vitro.

AB  == the bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. a two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of  various species were tested. teicoplanin showed rapid killing of staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. hominis. all strains of staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high mic values (4-16 mg/l). the killing effect against staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. a 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. other staphylococci (staph. aureus, staph. saprophyticus) and streptococcus pyogenes, str. bovis and str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. bactericidal activity against other streptococci (str. mutans, str. agalactiae, str. faecalis, str. faecium) was less marked; against str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.

(2), streptococcus faecalis, serratia sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, achromobacter xylosoxidans, aeromonas hydrophila and pseudomonas fluorescens (1 each). wound cultures failed to predict bone culture results in 12 of 16 patients (75%). nho recurred in 8 of 19 patients (42%) despite intravenously administered antibiotics for greater than 28 days and debridement in 7 of 8 patients. the indolent nature of nho complicates diagnosis, especially  in patients with recent compound fractures. only prompt bone culture can confirm  the presence of nho and reliably guide antimicrobial therapy.

AB  == we have investigated relationships between patients' backgrounds and isolates from urinary tract infections in reference to various conditions, such as sexes,  age distribution by sex, species of causative organisms by sex, age distribution  according to species and types of infections, species and infections before and after treatment with antibacterial agents, and species and detected places. as for the relationship between sexes and types of infections, although simple urinary tract infections were consistently found at about 20% in men and at about 80% in women between 1981 and 1983, these infections were seen at 24.4% in men and at 75.6% in women in 1984, and at 26.6% and at 73.4% in 1985, indicating slight decreases in the ratio of women. by contrast, complex urinary tract infections were found in men at about 60-70% from 1981 up to 1985, regardless of  the presence or absence of indwelling catheter. there were no noticeable changes  according to age during this 5-year period in incidences of infections including  simple urinary tract infection and complex urinary tract infection with or without indwelling catheter. thus, backgrounds of patients with urinary tract infections, including sex, age and simple or complex infections, were fairly consistent throughout this period, while there were relatively large changes in species of isolates. enterococcus faecalis was isolated at about 8% of both men and women in 1982 and 1983, but its isolation rates were increased to 22.5% of men and 17.9% of women in 1984. in 1985 this species was isolated in 14.9% of men and 7.6% of women, and in 11.2% of all patients. staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus spp. and enterococcus spp. were detected at rates of 3.2%, 8.1%, 0.7% and 1.0%, respectively, and 24.2% of isolated strains were gram-positive organisms. when species of isolates before treatment with antibacterial agents and their isolation rates were analyzed, it was found that the isolation rate of e. faecalis increased dramatically in 1983,  and that this tendency was still seen in 1984. the isolation rate of gram-positive organisms was 25% in 1984 and 24.3% in 1985. escherichia coli was consistently isolated at about 40%, but, as far as simple urinary tract infections are concerned, its isolation rate decreased by about 10% in 1985, compared to 1982 and 1983. these results suggested that causative organisms for simple urinary tract infections became similar to those for complex urinary tract infections. in other words, isolates obtained from complex urinary tract infections before treatment were similar to those of simple infections.(abstract  truncated at 400 words)

TI  == monoclonal antibodies evoked by the free oligopeptide (gly)5 reacting specifically with peptidoglycan from staphylococci.
AB  == murine monoclonal antibodies reactive with the staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan (pg) epitope (gly)5 were obtained using the synthetic oligopeptide  (gly)5 in its free form as immunogen. the selected monoclonal antibodies were of  the igm kappa isotype and reacted specifically with pg from s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, but gave no reaction with pg from streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus subtilis and micrococcus lysodeikticus. affinity chromatography showed that the antibodies were reactive with the n-terminus of the (gly)5 peptide. these monoclonal antibodies can be used for the detection of  staphylococcal pg in solution.

TI  == in-vitro activity of roxithromycin against respiratory and skin pathogens.
AB  == the activity of roxithromycin was determined by a microdilution method, in comparison with erythromycin, spiramycin and josamycin. roxithromycin and erythromycin showed very similar mics against staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, str. pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae. in most cases, spiramycin and josamycin appeared similarly or more active. the activity of roxithromycin against mycoplasma pneumoniae, legionella spp., chlamydia psittaci and, to some extent, against pasteurella spp. was also assessed, by suitable in-vitro methods. roxithromycin has a promising potential for treating selected skin and respiratory infections.

AB  == bmy-28100 was compared with cephalexin, cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram and found to be more active than the reference cephalosporins against staphylococcus  aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, and clostridium difficile. bmy-28100 was the next most active, after cefteram, against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. against gram-negative bacteria, bmy-28100 showed similar activity to that of cefaclor. the antimicrobial activity of bmy-28100, including bactericidal activity, against staphylococcus aureus was less affected by penicillinase-production than was that of cefaclor. bmy-28100 was more stable than cefaclor against various types of penicillinases, especially against the penicillinase from staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == comparison of techniques for the selection of bacteria-free sperm preparations.
AB  == the authors compared the three most commonly used sperm preparation techniques--swim-up, fall-down, and percoll gradient--for their ability to recover highly motile sperm and minimize bacterial contamination. eleven human semen samples collected by masturbation were used and run in parallel with the three methods. a semiquantitative bacterial analysis was performed in all samples and results expressed in colony-forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml). the percoll gradient technique resulted in an average sperm concentration of 5.81 +/- 4.4 x 10(6) ml, and the average bacterial concentration dropped from 8.66 +/- 12.96 x 10(3) cfu/ml in semen to 0.01 +/- 0.03 x 10(3) cfu/ml. the bacterial count was not significantly different when the raw semen was compared with the swim-up or the fall-down preparations. the authors conclude that the percoll gradient method yields an adequate sperm concentration, with high motility and improved morphology, while eliminating bacterial contamination.

TI  == bactericidal activity and killing rate of serum against gram-positive cocci in volunteers receiving imipenem, oxacillin, vancomycin or ampicillin plus gentamicin.
AB  == the serum bactericidal activity and rate of killing of serum was studied in two groups of ten volunteers receiving imipenem 500 mg, oxacillin 3 g and vancomycin  1 g given iv (group 1) or imipenem 500 mg, vancomycin 1 g, and ampicillin 3 g plus gentamicin 80 mg iv (group 2). serum samples collected 30 min, 1 h and 6 h after the start of a 15 min infusion were tested against staphylococcus aureus susceptible (five strains) or resistant (five strains) to oxacillin, staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible to (five strains) or resistant (five strains) to oxacillin (group 1), and against streptococcus faecalis (four strains), streptococcus spp. (six strains). all strains of streptococci had been  isolated from patients with endocarditis. imipenem produced the highest bactericidal titres against susceptible staphylococci whereas vancomycin produced the highest titres against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. against "non faecalis" streptococci, imipenem was equivalent to ampicillin plus gentamicin, whereas ampicillin plus gentamicin was the most active regimen against str. faecalis. the study of the rate of killing of serum showed that imipenem was able to kill initially 1.5 log cfu/ml of str. faecalis but this was followed by regrowth. a similar regrowth was observed with oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. killing curves in broth were studied with imipenem at two temperatures (30 and 37 degrees c) and two initial inocula (10(5) and 10(6) cfu/ml) for 48 h of incubation against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci; regrowth occurred more rapidly with a high initial inoculum and low temperature of incubation despite a  rapid initial killing. gentamicin was found significantly to increase the rate of killing of imipenem against str. faecalis in killing curves in broth. in conclusion, imipenem showed excellent activity, as assessed by the measure of the bactericidal titres and rate of killing in serum, against the studied strains with the exception of oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and str. faecalis.

TI  == the use of a new glycopeptide antibiotic, teicoplanin, in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis.
AB  == teicoplanin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic, has been used to treat twelve patients with bacterial endocarditis due to gram-positive organisms. teicoplanin  has activity against gram-positive bacteria similar to vancomycin but therapeutic levels are maintained by a single daily dose, given as an intravenous bolus. of six patients with native valve infections, two cases, due to viridans streptococci, were successfully treated with teicoplanin alone and two others, caused by streptococcus faecalis, were cured by combinations including teicoplanin. one of these patients sustained high tone hearing loss during treatment. the remaining two patients were drug addicts with endocarditis due to  staphylococcus aureus which recurred despite repeated multiple therapy. of six prosthetic valve infections, antibiotic combinations including teicoplanin cured  three cases, caused by streptococci. infection persisted or treatment was curtailed in three cases of staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis. in this small open study, teicoplanin appeared as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of endocarditis but had the considerable advantage of ease of administration.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of ly146032 and eight other antibiotics against gram-positive bacteria isolated from children.
AB  == ly146032, a cyclic peptide antibiotic active against many gram-positive bacteria, was compared to methicillin, vancomycin, clindamycin, cefuroxime and gentamicin against methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus and staph. epidermidis. ly146032 was uniformly active against clinical isolates of staphylococci, inhibiting 90% of strains of staph. aureus and staph. epidermidis at a concentration of 0.5 mg/l. vancomycin was slightly less active than ly146032 against staph. aureus and staph. epidermidis,  inhibiting 90% of strains at concentrations of 1.0 and 2.0 mg/l, respectively. all other antibiotics tested were less active than ly146032 or vancomycin against staphylococci. ly146032 was compared to penicillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and chloramphenicol against strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, group b streptococcus, group d streptococcus (enterococcus) and listeria monocytogenes and was found to inhibit 90% of the strains at concentrations of 0.25, 1.0, 32.0  and 16.0 mg/l respectively. the combination of ly146032 and chloramphenicol was antagonistic in vitro for one strain each of staph. aureus and group d streptococcus and showed indifference against other strains of staph. aureus(2),  staph. epidermidis(2), group d streptococcus(1) and l. monocytogenes(2). ly146032 in combination with gentamicin showed indifference against the same bacteria. on  the basis of its in-vitro activity, ly146032 appears to be a promising agent for  the treatment of serious community- and hospital-acquired staphylococcal infections.

TI  == in-vitro susceptibility of gram-positive cocci to ly146032 teicoplanin, sodium fusidate, vancomycin, and rifampicin.
AB  == ly146032, a new antimicrobial agent with activity against gram-positive cocci, was tested against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staph. epidermidis, staph. saprophyticus, and streptococcus faecalis. mic90s in cation-supplemented mueller hinton broth by the microdilution broth method were less than 1.0 mg/l for all organisms tested. increasing or decreasing the inoculum size did not appreciably effect the mic50 or mic90 for any organism group nor did decreasing the incubation temperature. the addition of sodium chloride to the test system did not appreciably effect the susceptibility of methicillin-resistant staph. aureus to ly146032. all organisms were 4 to 32 times more susceptible to ly146032 than to vancomycin. the staph. aureus had ly146032 susceptibility patterns which were similar to those of teicoplanin and sodium fusidate. ly146032 was 4-16 times more active than teicoplanin against staph. saprophyticus and staph. epidermidis while teicoplanin was 8-16 times more active than ly146032 against str. faecalis.

TI  == qualitative and quantitative microbiological analysis of sputa of 102 patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == a microbiological analysis of 102 patients suffering from cystic fibrosis was conducted over a 22 month period. 20 microbial species with the following incidence were identified: pseudomonas aeruginosa: 83.4%; candida albicans: 29.4%; staphylococcus aureus: 24.5%; staphylococcus epidermidis: 11.8%; haemophilus influenzae: 11.8%; streptococcus pneumoniae; 6.9%; pseudomonas maltophilia: 6.8%; aspergillus fumigatus: 5.9%. other species were present in less than 5% of the patients. in the majority of specimens with p. aeruginosa, more than one type (up to six) was detectable. these strains were identical in colony appearance, o-serotype and pyocin-type. quantitative analysis revealed concentrations of colony-forming units of 10(7) to 10(9) for p. aeruginosa, 10(6) to 10(8) for p. maltophilia, 10(4) to 10(7) for s. aureus, 10(4) to 10(6) for s.  epidermidis and 10(4) to 10(7) for c. albicans in the majority of specimens. significant differences were observed in the time periods during which the pathogens persisted in the patients. maximum persistence was observed for p. aeruginosa. p. maltophilia and a. fumigatus had about similar persistence rates,  which were lower than those for p. aeruginosa but above those for s. aureus and h. influenzae. s. epidermidis was eliminated within shorter periods than s. aureus. c. albicans, although the second most frequent microorganism identified,  showed a very low persistence rate. the microbiological analysis confirms results from other research centers (high incidence of p. aeruginosa), but reveals significant regional differences as well (pseudomonas cepacia not detectable, higher incidence of p. maltophilia and c. albicans). this underlines the necessity for detailed qualitative and quantitative microbiological analysis of sputa from cystic fibrosis patients as a prerequisite for rational analysis of etiological, epidemiological and therapeutical aspects of cystic fibrosis.

TI  == serum bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect in serum of patients with urinary tract infection receiving high-dose amikacin.
AB  == ten patients received a 30-min infusion of amikacin (30 mg/kg) on day 1 and 15 mg/kg on day 2. mean serum creatinine was 1.1 +/- 0.3 (standard deviation) mg/dl  before and 1.0 +/- 0.3 mg/dl 3 days after the second infusion. mean serum amikacin concentrations before, at the end of infusion, and 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after 30 and 15 mg/kg were 0, 157, 79, 31, 16, 5, 5, 85, 51, 19, 12, and 5 mg/liter, respectively. five strains each of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible and resistant to oxacillin, streptococcus  (enterococcus) faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain jk, listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium fortuitum (three strains), klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested.  serum bactericidal activities (sbas) were greater than or equal to 1:8 in greater than or equal to 80% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 30 mg/kg and in greater than or  equal to 60% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 15 mg/kg against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible to oxacillin, a. calcoaceticus, and k. pneumoniae. l. monocytogenes, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa had lower sbas. very low or no activity was observed against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and streptococcus faecalis. the study of the killing rate in serum  confirmed these results. postantibiotic effect was studied by incubating a strain from each species in serum samples obtained 1 and 6 h after both regimens for 0.5, 1, or 2 h. the duration of postantibiotic effect depended on the duration of contact and the concentration of amikacin for the following organisms: oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, l. monocytogenes, p. aeruginosa, a. calcoaceticus, k. pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens. m. fortuitum was killed after 30 min of contact. no postantibiotic effect was observed with streptococcus faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain jk, or oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. amikacin at 30 mg/kg provided high levels and sbas against susceptible pathogens. prolonged postantibiotic effects were observed. no signs of nephrotoxicity occurred.

AB  == in a prospective study to determine the incidence and etiology of neonatal septicemia at karolinska hospital, stockholm, all cases of neonatal septicemia in infants born at the hospital from 1981 to 1985 were reviewed. there were 4.0 cases of neonatal septicemia per 1,000 live births during the study period. during the five year period the incidence of septicemia tended to increase, mainly due to the increasing incidence of septicemia in infants with a birth weight below 1,500 grams. the single most common causative organism was group b streptococci with an incidence of 1.4 per 1,000 live births, staphylococcus aureus accounting for 1.1 cases, staphylococcus epidermidis for 0.7 cases, and gram-negative rods for only 0.4 cases per 1,000 live births. in a retrospective study of the incidence of neonatal septicemia in a non-selected patient population, all cases in the stockholm area in 1983 were reviewed. in that year there were 17,586 live births in the area and the incidence of neonatal septicemia was 2.6 per 1,000 live births. group b streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and gram-negative rods were equally common as  causative agents.

TI  == in vitro correlation of platelet aggregation with occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulation and subacute bacterial endocarditis.
AB  == platelet-bacterial interactions were examined in vitro by incubating organisms isolated from patients with septicemia with normal platelet-rich plasma. the potency of various species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to induce  irreversible platelet aggregation was then determined in an aggregometer. the aggregation curves produced by the bacteria resembled the normal platelet response to collagen and were impeded by the presence of aspirin. strains of staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from 25 different patients produced maximum increases in light transmission and irreversible platelet aggregation with relatively rapid mean aggregation times; six of these patients had clinical and laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. in contrast, isolates of alpha streptococcus and staphylococcus epidermidis induced irreversible platelet aggregation much less commonly and were associated with considerably longer mean aggregation times. none of the latter group of patients had evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. isolates of bacteria from a small number of patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis uniformly induced irreversible platelet aggregation. addition of paired bacterial isolates to normal platelet-rich plasma demonstrated a synergistic aggregation response. these data suggest that a relative hierarchy exists in bacterial strain potency to induce irreversible platelet aggregation. the rapidity and degree of aggregation in vitro correlated well with the clinical and laboratory evidence for subacute bacterial endocarditis and disseminated intravascular coagulation in vivo. these observations may provide useful adjunctive laboratory information to help establish the diagnosis of subacute bacterial endocarditis, especially in the clinical setting where the classical findings of endocarditis are not obvious during initial presentation.

AB  == infection is the most important cause of mortality in leucopenic patients. a broad spectrum antibiotic therapy is imperative in febrile and neutropenic patients. in a multicentric study we have used ceftazidime (100 mg/kg/d) and netilmicin (6 mg/kg/d) in 88 children (fever greater than or equal to 38.5 degrees c, neutropenia less than 500/mm3) treated for acute leukemias (59), non hodgkin lymphomas (13) or solid tumors (16). median age was 7 years (2 months-16  years). in patients who continued to remain febrile, vancomycin (40 mg/kg/d) was  added after 48 hours. the effective treatment was continued until a neutrophil count greater than 1,000/mm3. the first combination (ceftazidime + netilmicin) was effective in 64 children (73%) and the second combination (ceftazidime + netilmicin + vancomycin) in 11 patients. bacteria were isolated in 39 children: escherichia coli: 9, staphylococcus epidermidis: 9, staphylococcus aureus: 8, streptococcus: 6, pseudomonas aeruginosa: 3, streptococcus pneumoniae: 1, haemophilus: 1, klebsiella pneumoniae: 1, proteus: 1, serratia: 1, flavobacterium: 1. in these 39 patients, 30 became apyretic with ceftazidime and  netilmicin and 6 after vancomycin. all blood culture were negative after the first combination. the median duration of antibiotic therapy was 14 days (5-9 days: 28, 10-20 days: 43, greater than 20 days: 17). there were no death, no superinfection. tolerance was good without kidney or liver or biological perturbation. we conclude that the combination ceftazidime and netilmicin is effective in neutropenic children.

AB  == immunocytochemical studies using antisera to whole human choriogonadotropin (hcg), to its alpha- and beta-subunits and to the cooh-terminal peptide of hcg beta, and two monoclonal antibodies to hcg beta, demonstrated expression of hcg-like material, its individual subunits and/or fragments in nine bacterial strains. seven of these were isolated from patients with cancer and were definitely identified as streptococcus faecalis (three strains), staphylococcus haemolyticus (two strains) and staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli (single strains). the other two strains were cell-wall-deficient (cwd) variants,  one identified as streptococcus bovis, isolated from the blood of a patient with  a fever of unknown origin and a possible brain abscess. the other was a gram-negative diphtheroid isolated from the urine of a pregnant woman, which during the period of study reverted to a gram-positive corynebacterium identified as a 'c. ulcerans' strain and expressed the hcg-like factor only during its phase as gram-negative diphtheroid. electron microscopy of these nine strains (including negative controls of strains of the same species subjected to the same immunocytochemical analyses and under identical cultural conditions) revealed morphological alterations in the bacterial cell walls and cytoplasmic material and/or bizarre forms of reproduction in six of the nine strains expressing hcg-like material including the two cwd variants. collectively, these results provided evidence that (1) hcg-producing bacteria isolated from patients with overt cancer are not a new and unique species as claimed by others, and (2) there is a close resemblance between the bacterial protein and the human trophoblastic  hormone, based on immunochemical recognition of different parts of the hcg molecule.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam (l-105, czon), a newly semisynthesized cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics and the following results were obtained. antibacterial activities of czon against clinically isolated strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and h. influenzae were compared with those of cefmenoxime (cmx), latamoxef (lmox), cefoperazone (cpz), cefmetazole (cmz), cefotiam (ctm) and cefazolin (cez). czon was nearly as active as cez against s. aureus and s. epidermidis and superior to other antibiotics against other gram-positive cocci. against gram-negative rods, czon was as active as cmx and superior to other 5 antibiotics compared. serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of czon at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 1, 5 and 4 cases, respectively, were determined. mean serum concentrations of czon at these dose levels were 11.0, 43.8 and 111.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 2.4, 10.3 and 30.3 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.17, 0.72 and 1.28 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, with serum half-lives of 1.79, 0.88 and 1.19 hours, respectively. mean cumulative urinary excretion rates  within 6 hours after administration were 47.9, 56.3 and 40.3%, respectively. thirty-four pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (tonsillitis 2,  acute bronchitis 1, pneumonia 14, pyothorax 1, sepsis 1, suppurative lymphadenitis 1, uti 13 and enteritis 1) were treated with czon at a daily dose of 40-94 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d.. the overall clinical efficacy rate was 94.1%. no adverse reactions were observed except 2 cases with mild diarrhea. abnormal laboratory findings were also mild; slight elevation of got and gpt in 2, eosinophilia in 1 and thrombocytosis in 1. these results clearly indicate the usefulness of czon in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.

TI  == effect of minimal amounts of thymidine on activity of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 99 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis was tested on media known to be low in thymidine content, as determined by screening with streptococcus faecalis. eighty-one percent of the isolates were susceptible by agar dilution. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was bactericidal against two strains of s. epidermidis when thymidine phosphorylase was added to the medium, indicating utilization of minimal amounts of thymidine that were undetected by screening. because bacteria vary in their utilization of thymidine and body tissues vary in  thymidine content, in vitro susceptibility tests may not correlate with in vivo bactericidal activity.

TI  == phagocytosis and killing of bacteria by middle ear macrophages.
AB  == because macrophage dysfunction has been suggested as one of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms for otitis media with effusion, we have examined macrophage-bacterial interactions using keyhole limpet hemocyanin-induced middle  ear macrophages from chinchillas. our data indicate that macrophages recruited to the middle ear were functional phagocytes capable of discriminate phagocytosis and intracellular killing of eight species of bacteria associated with otitis media, as determined by a fluorochrome microassay. streptococcus pneumoniae types 14 and 19f, which are associated with the highest relapse frequency in cases of acute otitis media, were the most resistant to phagocytosis. the two organisms most often involved in chronic otitis media (staphylococcus epidermidis and nontypable haemophilus influenzae), however, were among the most readily phagocytized isolates. the relative importance of macrophage function in defense  of the middle ear, therefore, may be dependent on the causative agent.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ly146032, a new peptolide antibiotic, was compared with  those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, imipenem, amoxicillin and erythromycin. ly146032 inhibited 90% of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-resistant isolates at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. its activity was comparable to those of vancomycin and teicoplanin. mic90s for the beta-hemolytic streptococci varied from 0.25 microgram/ml for group b streptococci to 4 micrograms/ml for some group c and f streptococci. mics for streptococcus faecalis were in the range of 0.5 to 8 micrograms/ml, and the mic90 4 micrograms/ml, compared to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 1 microgram/ml for teicoplanin. for some viridans streptococci the mics were 4 micrograms/ml, whereas streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. corynebacterium jk species were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, similar to vancomycin, and listeria monocytogenes by 4 micrograms/ml. neisseria species, haemophilus species and enteric species were not inhibited. most mbcs were within two-fold of the respective mics. after 14 days passage in sub-inhibitory concentrations of ly146032, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus faecalis showed minimal increase in mics. the activity of ly146032  was increased by adding ca2+ and was reduced in an anaerobic environment. overall, ly146032 is an extremely interesting new agent that inhibits gram-positive species.

TI  == clinical evaluation of efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and safety of teicoplanin for  serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == nineteen patients hospitalized for serious gram-positive infections were treated  with teicoplanin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic. a variety of infections were treated, including endocarditis, septic thrombophlebitis, osteomyelitis, pyogenic arthritis, and soft tissue infection. of 13 infections that could be evaluated in 12 patients, there were 8 clinical cures, 2 improvements, 1 recurrence, and 2 failures. of the eight patients with staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, seven were clinically cured or improved with teicoplanin therapy. of the nine patients in whom the bacteriological response to treatment could be fully evaluated, six were cured; there was recurrence of infection in one, and treatment failed in two patients. in vitro testing showed the 13 bacterial isolates (9 s. aureus, 3 s. epidermidis, and 1 group b streptococcus) to be uniformly susceptible to teicoplanin, with mics ranging from 0.12 to 0.5 microgram/ml. every isolate was more susceptible in vitro to teicoplanin than to vancomycin. three of the staphylococcal isolates were resistant to methicillin. pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that after an initial drug-accumulation period, a single daily dose  adequately maintained the teicoplanin concentrations in serum within therapeutic  ranges. teicoplanin also penetrated well into synovial fluid. the drug was well tolerated by either intravenous or intramuscular administration. the most significant adverse reaction was an urticarial rash which required discontinuation of therapy in one patient; a second patient experienced a modest  decrease in high-frequency auditory threshold. asymptomatic eosinophilia and mild elevation of serum transaminases were noted as well. the results of this study suggest that teicoplanin is a safe and effective new agent for treatment of serious infections caused by gram-positive organisms.

TI  == activation of the human complement cascade by bacterial cell walls, peptidoglycans, water-soluble peptidoglycan components, and synthetic muramylpeptides--studies on active components and structural requirements.
AB  == cell walls isolated from 29 strains of 24 gram-positive bacterial species, whose  peptidoglycans belong to the group a type of schleifer and kandler's classification, with one exception (arthrobacter sp.), were shown to activate the complement cascade in pooled fresh human serum mainly through the alternative pathway and partly through the classical one. the complement-activating effect of cell walls (5 species) possessing group b type peptidoglycan, except those of corynebacterium insidiosum, was weaker than that of the walls with group a type peptidoglycan. preparations of peptidoglycan isolated from cell walls of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and lactobacillus plantarum also activated the alternative pathway of the complement cascade, but less effectively than the respective parent cell walls. a water-soluble "polymer" of peptidoglycan subunits (seps), which was prepared from staphylococcus epidermidis peptidoglycans by treatment with a cross-bridge degrading endopeptidase, retained most of the complement-activating ability of the parent cell walls. a peptidoglycan "monomer," seps-m, which was obtained by hydrolysis of the glycan chain of seps with endo-n-acetylmuramidase to disaccharide units did not activate complement. in conformity with this finding, neither synthetic n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine (mdp) nor mdp-l-lys-d-ala activated the complement cascade. among several lipophilic derivatives of mdp, 6-o-(3-hydroxy-3-docosylhexacosanoyl)-mdp-l-lys-d-ala (bh48-mdp-l-lys-d-ala) and  6-o-(2-tetradecylhexadecanoyl)-mdp (b30-mdp) were shown to activate complement through the alternative as well as the classical pathway and exclusively through  the classical pathway, respectively. the finding that a d-isoasparagine analog of b30-mdp caused the same effect as the parent molecule strongly suggests that the  activation of complement by b30-mdp is different from that caused by cell wall peptidoglycans and a water-soluble "polymer" of peptidoglycan subunits.

TI  == silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  == a blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as x-static) was used in these experiments. this fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. at ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. the rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in x-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of  tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. when bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees c as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for pseudomonas, klebsiella, staphylococcus, and streptococcus species. the rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. the rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that x-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.

AB  == in this study, levels of naturally occurring secretory iga (siga) antibodies to bacterial isolates representative of the microflora of the human eye (staphylococcus epidermidis and a corynebacterium species) and the oral cavity (streptococcus mutans serotypes c and d) were assessed in three different human external secretions. tears and parotid saliva samples collected at the same time  from 22 healthy subjects and colostrum from 11 healthy women (1-14 days post partum) were assessed for siga anti-bacterial antibody levels by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. significantly higher levels (p less than 0.001) of iga antibodies to staphylococcus epidermidis and the corynebacterium sp. were found in tears than in parotid saliva. furthermore, higher levels of siga antibodies to streptococcus mutans serotype d occurred in parotid saliva than in tears of these subjects. although levels of salivary siga antibodies to s. mutans serotype c were lower than those seen to serotype d, they were not significantly different from those in tears. however, absolute siga anti-serotype c antibodies per mg iga were higher in saliva than in tears. when siga antibody levels to the four bacterial strains were assessed in colostrum, the proportion of siga antibodies per mg iga were much lower than seen in tears or saliva. these results suggest that natural siga antibodies which occur in human external secretions are induced by antigen ingestion and stimulation of the common mucosal immune system. however, the local presence of antigen at a mucosal site induces greater clonal expression and results in higher levels of siga antibodies than at mucosal sites  not exposed to local antigenic stimulation.

AB  == littermate hamsters were infected orally with cariogenic streptococcus mutans ns-50s and maintained on a high-sucrose diet to induce dental caries. individual  groups of animals were treated by single daily instillation of staphylococcin 1580 (100 micrograms) in the cheek pouches. other groups were treated similarly with bacitracin (60 or 120 u) or saline. after 35 days on the caries test regimen, animals treated with staphylococcin 1580 had 49 or 60% less caries than  the saline controls in two separate trials. hamsters treated with 60 u of bacitracin had 40% less caries, while animals receiving 120 u of bacitracin had 58% less caries. significant reductions in the oral and fecal levels of s. mutans ns-50s were also observed in the treated animals. in contrast to earlier, inconclusive experiments in which these agents were placed directly into the oral cavity, the inhibition of caries in this study is attributed to prolongation of the oral retention of these agents, with increased opportunity to interact with cariogenic microorganisms.

TI  == bacteremia with gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures.
AB  == the authors have reviewed 40 prospective studies of bacteremia with gastrointestinal procedures. endoscopic procedures with a low mean frequency of bacteremia were esophagogastroduodenoscopy (4.2%), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (5.6%), colonoscopy (2.2%), and sigmoidoscopy (4.9%). a  higher mean frequency of bacteremia was encountered with esophageal dilation (45%) and variceal sclerotherapy (31%), although the number of patients studied was small. potentially pathogenic organisms, such as streptococcus viridans, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis have been isolated. recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis are reviewed. less cumbersome regimens encourage compliance and are preferred.

TI  == the value of needle aspiration in the management of cellulitis.
AB  == needle aspirations from 103 young, healthy patients (mean age 22 years) with cellulitis were prospectively analyzed to determine the percentage yield and causative organisms. a standard technique of needle aspiration was performed using a 22-gauge needle, a 10-cc syringe, and 1 cc of sterile water. aspirations  were performed at the leading edge and midpoint of the cellulitis (halfway between the leading edge and the center of the cellulitis). fifteen of the 103 patients (14.5 percent) had positive aspirates. nine of the 103 aspirates were positive at the leading edge (8.7 percent) and 6 of 70 were positive at the midpoint (8.6 percent), giving a total aspiration positivity of 8.7 percent (15/173). the organisms recovered were staphylococcus aureus (53 percent). staphylococcus epidermidis (27 percent), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (13 percent) and streptococcus pyogenes (7 percent). the low-percentage yield and predictable organisms recovered speak against needle aspiration being a necessary procedure in a young, healthy population. similarly, the site of aspiration does  not increase yield. empiric treatment with antibiotics aimed at staphylococcal and streptococcal organisms is appropriate.

TI  == acute bacterial conjunctivitis. bacteriology and clinical implications.
AB  == we report the results of eye culture specimens, obtained from patients under 20 years of age, submitted to the bacteriology department of our institution from january 1 through april 30, 1983. a total of 72 specimens were positive for one or more strains of bacteria. the most commonly isolated bacteria was hemophilus influenzae (34 strains, 42%), followed by staphylococcus epidermidis (11 strains, 13.75%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (9 strains, 11.25%). mean age of patients with h. influenzae (excluding a 20-year-old patient) was 15 months with standard  deviation of 13 months. chloramphenicol and tetracycline showed excellent in vitro activity against bacteria of all age groups. tetracycline may prove to be the drug of choice for the treatment of acute conjunctivitis if comparative clinical data support its in vitro superiority.

TI  == method for flow cytometric detection of listeria monocytogenes in milk.
AB  == this report describes a method for the detection of listeria monocytogenes in raw milk by flow cytometric analysis of fluorescently labeled bacterial populations.  the use of immunofluorescence in combination with measures of dna content by propidium iodide labeling and size by light scattering enabled specific identification of l. monocytogenes from streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus  hyicus. additional specific resolution of l. monocytogenes populations was achieved through selective enrichment of raw milk in listeria enrichment broth. these procedures should permit the rapid screening of milk and other food samples for l. monocytogenes and eliminate many of the short-comings associated with conventional fluorescent-antibody procedures.

TI  == cefoperazone for empiric therapy in patients with impaired renal function.
AB  == thirty-five patients with serious infections and impaired renal function were treated empirically with 2 to 8 g of cefoperazone per day. infections included sepsis in 14, nonbacteremic urinary infections in nine, pneumonia in five, intra-abdominal infection in five, fasciitis in one, and malignant otitis externa in one. the average age of this group was 64.3 years, 25 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases, and their average serum creatinine level was 5.2 mg/dl. infections were caused by enterobacteriaceae in 23 patients, streptococcus faecalis in five, pseudomonas aeruginosa in four, staphylococcus aureus in four,  hemophilus influenzae in three, and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and clostridium sordelli in one each. overall, 32 patients had clinical and microbiologic cures, two had improvement, and one had failure. hypoprothrombinemia occurred in 18 of 28 patients not given vitamin k for prophylaxis and occurred more often in those with serum albumin concentrations below 3.5 g/dl. prothrombin times returned to normal within 36 hours of treatment with vitamin k, although two patients experienced mild hematemesis. in anicteric  patients with liver function abnormalities, 2 g every 12 hours produced peak and  trough serum concentrations that averaged 254 and 125 micrograms/ml, respectively, compared with 179.5 and 19.5 micrograms/ml, respectively, in five with normal liver function test results. in jaundiced patients treated with 1 g every 12 hours, trough concentrations were comparably elevated. serum concentrations did not correlate with hypoprothrombinemia, but high levels throughout the dosing interval may have contributed to the excellent cure rate in this study.

TI  == risk factors for wound infections after genitourinary reconstructive surgery.
AB  == in january through august 1983, eight children developed wound infections after they underwent genitourinary reconstructive surgery at one hospital. cultures of  purulent drainage yielded pseudomonas aeruginosa in two cases, streptococcus faecalis in one case, both s. faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis in one case, and s. faecalis and other gram-negative rods in four cases. a study in which uninfected children who had had genitourinary reconstructive surgery were used as controls revealed that all cases and controls had received cephalosporin  prophylaxis. antibiograms revealed that all organisms were resistant to the cephalosporin antibiotics tested. risk of infection was associated with shaving (p less than 0.001, fisher's exact test) and exposure to one nurse (nurse x) (p = 0.003, fisher's exact test) and one surgeon (surgeon x) (p = 0.007, fisher's exact test). nurse x was the private scrub nurse for surgeon x; she was present only at operations surgeon x performed (p less than 0.001, fisher's exact test) and had no reported or observed practices different from those of other surgical  nurses. however, surgeon x had two practices that were notably different from those of other surgeons: 1) he used quaternary ammonium compounds, acetone/alcohol, and 1 per cent hexachlorophene for preoperative skin preparation; and 2) he prepared the operative site himself. in addition, he was observed to prepare the operative site by beginning centrally, moving peripherally, and returning to the central area with the same sponge. these findings suggested that the shaving of the operative site and the use of certain  agents and/or different preparatory techniques may have contributed to increased  risk of wound infections. these wound infections were caused by organisms resistant to the prophylactic antibiotic(s) used.

TI  == immunocompromised animal models for the study of antibiotic combinations.
AB  == studies of various models of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in neutropenic animals have demonstrated the superiority of the combination of beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics when compared with a single drug alone. a limited number of studies carried out in models of klebsiella pneumoniae infections in neutropenic animals have shown similar results. the efficacy of double beta-lactam combinations for the treatment of gram-negative bacillary infections  has not been studied as extensively; the few available reports did not show any benefit over a single beta-lactam treatment. most studies of combined therapy in  gram-positive infections have been performed in the experimental endocarditis model. experiments in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus viridans, and streptococcus faecalis endocarditis have shown a clear-cut advantage for combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment over single beta-lactam therapy, as predicted by in vitro tests. the enhanced efficacy of combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment in both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections appears to result in most studies in increased and faster killing of the bacteria. with p. aeruginosa infections, however, experiments in neutropenic mice suggest that in addition to increased killing, the beta-lactam arm of the combined treatment prevents the emergence of the small colony variants that lead to treatment failures during therapy with aminoglycoside alone. for both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections, in vitro tests that demonstrated synergism for the combined antibiotics generally predicted enhanced therapeutic efficacy in vivo. conversely, when no synergism was demonstrated in vitro, there was generally no increased efficacy of combined treatment in vivo. animal models add a dimension to our understanding of the efficacy of antibiotics, both singly and in combination, that is not always apparent from the results of in vitro tests alone. these in vivo tests can be of value when planning clinical trials.

AB  == the in vitro activity of coumermycin has been compared with those of ampicillin,  clindamycin, cloxacillin, doxycycline, erythromycin, netilmicin, penicillin g and vancomycin. a total of 251 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci were examined. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by an agar dilution method. clindamycin, coumermycin and erythromycin were the most active drugs against staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis on a weight-for-weight basis. all the staphylococcal isolates were inhibited by coumermycin at a concentration of 0.12 mg/l or less. netilmicin seemed to be somewhat more active  against s. epidermidis than against s. aureus. the mics of vancomycin for the staphylococcal isolates were clustered around 1 mg/l. streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae were highly susceptible to penicillin g and erythromycin; most isolates were inhibited by 0.03 mg/l or less of either drug. coumermycin showed poor activity against s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae and enterococci. most of the s. pneumoniae isolates had also high mics, although a wide range of sensitivities was found.

TI  == performance characteristics of a commercially prepared biphasic blood culture bottle.
AB  == a biphasic blood culture bottle (bipb: gibco laboratories, north andover, mass.)  with an architectural design that physically separates the agar slant from the broth was compared with a conventional vented monophasic bottle (mpb-a) for use in the routine culture of blood. both bottles contained tryptic soy broth. tryptic soy agar was used for the bipb slant. a third unvented bottle (mpb-n) with columbia broth was included as part of the blood culture set. of 3,537 sets  collected, 444 were positive; 57 of these 444 sets were positive by virtue of an  exclusively positive anaerobic bottle. both bipb and mpb-a were positive in 235 of the remaining 387 positive sets. a total of 521 isolates was recovered during  the study. of these isolates, 252 were recovered in both the bipb and the mpb-a from the same set; 105 isolates grew in the bipb but not in mpb-a, 95 isolates grew only in the mpb-a but not in bipb, and 69 grew exclusively in the mpb-n. the bipb allowed more rapid recovery of candida spp., j-k diphtheroids, pseudomonas spp. making bipb subcultures was easy enough to permit both early and daily subculture, which provided isolated colonies sooner than could be done by using the mpb-a. isolated colonies and, therefore, identification and susceptibility results were available at least 1 day earlier for the bipb isolates in approximately 50% of instances when both the bipb and the mpb-a were positive. staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococci were recovered more frequently in the bipb, while gram-positive anaerobes were detected at a significantly (p less than 0.025) more frequent rate in the mpb-a than in the bipb. either bottle, however,  should be used in conjunction with an anaerobic bottle for optimal recovery of anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == bacteremia and fungemia in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
AB  == forty-nine episodes of bacteremia and fungemia occurred in 38 of 336 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome seen at our institution since 1980. there were five types of infections. infections commonly associated with a t-cell immunodeficiency disorder comprised 16 episodes and included those with salmonella species, listeria monocytogenes, cryptococcus neoformans, and histoplasma capsulatum. infections commonly associated with a b-cell immunodeficiency disorder included those with streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. infections occurring with neutropenia were caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus faecalis. other infections occurring in the hospital were caused by candida albicans, staphylococcus epidermidis, enteric gram-negative rods, staphylococcus aureus, and mixed s. aureus and group g streptococcus. other infections occurring out of  the hospital included those with s. aureus, clostridium perfringens, shigella sonnei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and group b streptococcus. because two thirds of  the septicemias were caused by organisms other than t-cell opportunists, these pathogens should be anticipated during diagnostic evaluation and when formulating empiric therapy.

TI  == in-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to other antibiotics.
AB  == pefloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. a comparison was made of the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin and that of nine other antibiotics (ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin and norfloxacin). the mic90 of pefloxacin against 500 strains of enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.25 mg/l (escherichia coli, indole + proteus spp., enterobacter cloacae, salmonella spp. and shigella spp.) to 1 mg/l (klebsiella pneumoniae). pefloxacin inhibited 90% of 52 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2.5 mg/l (range 0.25 mg/l-4 mg/l). the mic90 of pefloxacin against 100 staphylococcus aureus strains (78 oxacillin resistant strains) was 0.4 mg/l (range 0.12-0.5 mg/l). it was markedly less active against streptococcus faecalis and str. pneumoniae (37 strains of each species) the mic90 being 4 mg/l against both species. overall, pefloxacin was at least as active as the third-generation cephalosporins against enterobacteriaceae and was more active than any other antibiotic tested against p. aeruginosa, s. epidermidis, and s. aureus. against e. coli, pefloxacin had a more rapid anti-bacterial activity than piperacillin. a paradoxical effect was observed with pefloxacin. an optimal killing rate was observed at concentrations of pefloxacin compatible with those one can expect in  blood of patients treated with this drug.

TI  == in-vitro activity of newer quinolones against aerobic bacteria.
AB  == nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. the 4-quinolones were regularly active (mic90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. saprophyticus, different enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, agrobacter spp., aeromonas spp., plesiomonas spp., neisseria meningitidis. other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, nocardia asteroides, p. maltophilia, achromobacter xylosoxydans and alcaligenes denitrificans. ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. all the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. the mbc/mic ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with streptococcus agalactiae, str. faecalis and l. monocytogenes. a two- to eight-fold increase of mic was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. susceptible bacterial population of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the mic) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the mic). supplementing the media with mgso4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented  agar, with all quinolone or strains. less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with znso4 or ca(no3)2.

TI  == bacterial colonization of hemasite access devices.
AB  == vascular access ports (hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. all were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. one hemasite from which staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. another hemasite from which  proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting  of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular  products. this direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the  resolution of the associated infection.

TI  == the laboratory diagnosis of peritonitis during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
AB  == in 24 episodes of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis associated peritonitis occurring in 21 patients, all dialysis fluids were cloudy and contained at least 100 cells mm-3, mostly polymorphs. gram-positive cocci were seen in centrifuge deposits from only nine of the fluids, but enrichment of 5 ml  in liquoid and glucose broth yielded bacteria for all episodes, namely staphylococcus epidermidis (seven episodes), staph. aureus (six), streptococcus mitior (one), moraxella spp (four), acinetobacter spp (three), enterobacteria (two) and pseudomonas testosteroni (one). comparison of washed with unwashed centrifuge deposits gave positive cultures in 11 and 10 fluids respectively; pre-treatment with triton x increased this yield to 19 and 21 positives, respectively. storage of specimens for 4-12 h at 4 degrees c did not decrease the 100% positive-culture rate. all isolates were sensitive to either gentamicin or vancomycin. of the 24 dialysis bags from 24 symptomless capd patients, none contained more than 60 cells mm-3 and bacteria were not detected by microscopy, culture of the centrifuge deposits, or by enrichment in liquoid or glucose broths.

TI  == does the hygroscopic property of the laminaria tent imply a risk for ascending infection in legal abortions? a microbiological study.
AB  == in 53 women admitted for first-trimester abortion, the cervical canal was dilated with laminaria tents prior to vacuum aspiration. before insertion of the tents, endocervical specimens were taken for microbiological investigations, including chlamydia trachomatis, and both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. the laminaria tents, widened by their hygroscopic properties, were removed just before the vacuum aspiration and sent for cultivation of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. the gram-positive aerobic cocci, staph. epidermidis, strept. faecalis and strept. agalactiae as well as escherichia coli and klebsiella/enterobacter were the most frequent microorganism among the aerobic isolates from the endocervices as well as from the laminaria tents. these microorganisms were identified on the tents in greater numbers than in the cervices. staph. aureus was isolated from three laminaria tents, but only one of  these 3 women was proved to be primarily colonized endocervically. among the anaerobes, bacteroidaceae followed by peptococci and peptostreptococci were the predominant genera found in the cervix as well as on the removed laminaria tents. these three groups of anaerobic microorganisms were found markedly less frequently on the laminaria tents than in the endocervix. on the other hand, strept. intermedius, another anaerobe of possible enteric origin, was recovered from 9 laminaria tents but not in the cervices. since no cases of clinically verified endometritis/salpingitis were registered in the present study it is concluded that the risk of a pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) due to the laminaria tent is negligible as long as the laminaria treatment does not exceed 24 hours.

TI  == propionibacteria isolates and asymptomatic infections of the peritoneal effluent  in capd patients.
AB  == during the past two years our laboratory has isolated propionibacterium-an anaerobic gram-positive rod-on 40 occasions from the drainage fluid of 25 patients on capd and eight on ipd. most patients had no symptoms and the fluid was sent for culture after treatment of peritonitis, during training period, and  occasionally because it was cloudy. no association was found with patients' age,  length on dialysis, or previous peritonitis episodes. the only statistically significant association (p = 0.033) was with recent (less than 30 days) catheter  insertion. patients with propionibacterium as the only organism in their dialysis fluid had normal leucocyte count in the effluent, minimal or no symptoms, and received no treatment. in order to establish the frequency of positive cultures of asymptomatic patients, we cultured 95 dialysate effluents from 33 asymptomatic capd patients. cultures were observed for 4 weeks. we found seven positive fluids (7.4%) in four patients (12%), aerobic sporeformer (2), staphylococcus epidermidis (2) and streptococcus viridans (1). the mean time to grow was 18.6 days. in conclusion, effluents from asymptomatic capd patients may contain bacteria. the organisms are commensals requiring prolonged incubation to grow. propionibacterium isolated from peritoneal effluent of patients with minimal or no symptoms does not require treatment. these findings suggest that errors in the technique of capd are not rare but when the number of organisms is small and the  organism has low virulence, peritonitis does not occur.

TI  == microbial adhesion to fibronectin in vitro correlates with production of endocarditis in rabbits.
AB  == microbial adhesion to the constituents of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (nbte) is an important early event in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. fibronectin is a ubiquitous mammalian glycoprotein with diverse functions which binds to certain bacteria but not to others. in this study, we determined that fibronectin is present on the surface of nbte (after catheter-induced aortic valve trauma) but not on normal rabbit cardiac valvular endothelium. the adhesion of various bacteria and yeasts to human fibronectin in tissue culture wells was then measured. microorganisms with a high isolation frequency from endocarditis cases (staphylococcus aureus, candida tropicalis, c. albicans, streptococcus faecalis, s. sanguis) bound significantly better (p less than 0.01) to fibronectin in vitro than other organisms (escherichia coli, c. krusei, pseudomonas aeruginosa) rarely implicated in this disease. microbial adhesion to  fibronectin correlated closely with the propensity of each organism to produce endocarditis in rabbits (e.g., id50) with preexistent nbte. a similar distribution was noted after binding of soluble radiolabeled fibronectin to bacteria in suspension. the results suggest that fibronectin, expressed on the surface of nbte, may mediate microbial adhesion of circulating organisms to initiate colonization during the early pathogenesis of infective endocarditis.

AB  == various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (tk; ec 2.7.1.21). taking the specific tk activity of escherichia coli k12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific tk activities. in the gram-positive cocci, staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of strep. pyogenes (29%). neisseria sicca, a gram-negative coccus, lacked tk. gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (bacillus, 13-51%; clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of b. megaterium (2%) and c. difficile (1-3%). among the gram-positive asporogenous rods, listeria monocytogenes and six species of lactobacillus (especially l. brevis, l. buchneri and l. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. lactis and l. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). of the species of pseudomonas studied, most  lacked tk but ps. fluorescens and ps. maltophilia had significant tk activity (15-53%). of the gram-negative facultative anaerobes, vibrio lacked tk, while enterobacteriaceae, including salmonella (148-1120%), escherichia (59-141%), klebsiella (78-299%) and serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'pr. rettgerella' (307%). propionibacterium and bifidobacterium and related organisms other than streptomyces, nocardia, rhodococcus, corynebacterium and mycobacterium lacked tk. the seven species of candida tested, and cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked tk.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == antimicrobial activity of aridicins, novel glycopeptide antibiotics with high and prolonged levels in blood.
AB  == three new glycopeptide antibiotics, aridicins a, b, and c, produced by kibdelosporangium aridum have a spectrum of antimicrobial activity in vitro which is similar to that of vancomycin. the antimicrobial activities of these glycopeptides against clinical bacterial isolates were compared with those of vancomycin and other related glycopeptide antibiotics in vitro by agar dilution and microtiter broth dilution tests and in vivo in mouse protection studies. in vitro they were somewhat less effective than vancomycin against strains of staphylococcus aureus and less active against coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. however, they were more active than vancomycin against strains of streptococcus faecalis and markedly superior to vancomycin and other glycopeptide antibiotics against strains of clostridium difficile. in experimental infections, aridicin a was effective against strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pyogenes, although its 50% effective doses were higher than those of vancomycin when administered after infection. after subcutaneous administration, aridicin a had a higher peak level in serum and a longer half-life than vancomycin or teicoplanin. the aridicins were markedly superior to vancomycin when administered prior to infection in mouse protection tests, indicating long-acting potential.

AB  == isolates were obtained from 169 middle ear aspirates of 148 children with recently treated acute otitis media (rtom) and from 123 aspirates of 84 children  with previously untreated acute otitis media (uom). in rtom streptococcus pneumoniae and group a streptococcus (p less than 0.02) were recovered less frequently whereas staphylococcus aureus (p less than 0.001) and haemophilus influenzae (p less than 0.02) were recovered more frequently than in uom. patients with rtom had more beta-lactamase-producing organisms and multiple isolates. bilateral sterile aspirates were more common in rtom although bilateral otitis media was more common in uom. in rtom most branhamella catarrhalis isolates were co-pathogens whereas staphylococcus epidermidis were always isolated in pure culture. amoxicillin was the antimicrobial most frequently (83.9%) received for the recently treated episode of otitis media. in rtom 62.4%  of isolates were susceptible to previously prescribed antibiotics, suggesting that factors other than antimicrobial susceptibility are also important in the occurrence of rtom.

TI  == effects of corynebacterium bovis infection on susceptibility to major mastitis pathogens.
AB  == experimental challenge procedures were used to study infectivity and virulence of corynebacterium bovis. challenge procedures using staphylococcus aureus (newbould 305) and streptococcus agalactiae (mcdonald 44) were used to study effects of corynebacterium bovis infections on superinfection with major pathogens. rate of  infection under experimental challenge conditions was significantly greater with  corynebacterium bovis than previously observed for staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus agalactiae. principal location of corynebacterium bovis colonization appeared to the teat canal region, although the organism was isolated from 75% of the teat cisterns by puncture technique. quarters with corynebacterium bovis infections were more resistant to infection by staphylococcus aureus than bacteriologically negative quarters. quarters infected with corynebacterium bacterium bovis were approximately 8.5-fold more susceptible to streptococcus agalactiae infection than negative quarters. somatic cell counts were doubled in negative quarters that developed corynebacterium bovis infections; the geometric mean was 2.4 x 10(5).

TI  == role of cephalosporins in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in adults. overview with special emphasis on ceftazidime.
AB  == experience with the use of first-generation cephalosporins in bacterial meningitis has been disappointing; low concentrations were obtained in the cerebrospinal fluid, and therapeutic failures were encountered. of the second-generation cephalosporins cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin, only cefuroxime has proved efficacy in meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or hemophilus influenzae. the third-generation cephalosporins offer new advantages in the treatment of meningitis because they are active at the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtainable. cefotaxime has produced high cure  rates in patients with meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or h. influenzae. several controlled comparative studies indicate that ceftriaxone is as effective as conventional treatment in therapy for neonatal or childhood meningitis caused by streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, or h. influenzae. moxalactam has been found in uncontrolled studies to be effective when the cause was enteric gram-negative bacilli. ceftazidime is a new cephalosporin with a high degree of beta-lactamase stability and a broad antibacterial spectrum, which includes pseudomonas aeruginosa that enters the cerebrospinal fluid. data from 29 patients who received ceftazidime as monotherapy for bacterial meningitis showed an overall cure or improvement rate of 75.9 percent. therapy failed in three patients with meningitis caused by gram-positive organisms (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. agalactiae), and in three with gram-negative organisms. of 14 patients with pseudomonas meningitis, 11 showed a cure, as did six of six patients with meningitis caused by enterobacter, serratia, or acinetobacter. more, preferably controlled, studies of the efficacy of ceftazidime in the treatment of meningitis should be undertaken.

TI  == comparison of arterial and venous blood samples for the diagnosis of bacteremia in critically ill patients.
AB  == we compared the blood culture results obtained either by venipuncture or through  an arterial catheter in 51 critically ill patients with 217 clinically suspected  episodes of bacteremia. during each episode, three blood culture samples, two arterial and one venous, were drawn within 1 h. one or more cultures were positive in 42 (19%) of the episodes, but there were great discrepancies between  the results obtained by the two methods. in only eight cases did both methods give the same microorganism. in eight other episodes, the two arterial cultures were positive while the venous sample was negative, probably indicating a continuous contamination of the catheter system. pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis were the two most common microbes. the frequency of positive arterial catheter blood cultures did not increase with the length of catheter use. we conclude that an arterial catheter is not a reliable sampling site for blood cultures and does not replace the conventional venipuncture method.

TI  == presence of laminin receptors in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == a characteristic feature of infection by staphylococcus aureus is bloodstream invasion and widespread metastatic abscess formation. the ability to extravasate, which entails crossing the vascular basement membrane, appears to be critical for the organism's pathogenicity. extravasation by normal and neoplastic mammalian cells has been correlated with the presence of specific cell surface receptors for the basement membrane glycoprotein laminin. similar laminin receptors were found in staphylococcus aureus but not in staphylococcus epidermidis, a noninvasive pathogen. there were about 100 binding sites per cell, with an apparent binding affinity of 2.9 nanomolar. the molecular weight of the receptor  was 50,000 and pi was 4.2. eukaryotic laminin receptors were visualized by means  of the binding of s. aureus in the presence of laminin. prokaryotic and eukaryotic invasive cells might utilize similar, if not identical, mechanisms for invasion.

TI  == antibacterial activity of imipenem: the first thienamycin antibiotic.
AB  == imipenem (n-formimidoyl thienamycin) is the first representative of a new class of beta-lactam antibiotics--the carbapenems. imipenem has an unusually broad spectrum, high potency, and no cross-resistance with other beta-lactam antibiotics. susceptible gram-negative species include pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia, and enterobacter. activity is high against staphylococcus aureus, most  group d streptococci, and staphylococcus epidermidis but is variable against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. imipenem is more active against bacteroides than are other beta-lactam agents, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, and clindamycin. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for 98% of 30,655 isolates--excluding those of the three resistant species (pseudomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas cepacia, and streptococcus faecium)--were less than 8 micrograms/ml, the susceptibility breakpoint adopted for clinical trials. imipenem is bactericidal (minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs] less than twice the mics). for p. aeruginosa, mbcs of imipenem are less influenced by high  inoculum density rather than are mbcs of antipseudomonal penicillins and cephalosporins. stability of imipenem to diverse classes of plasmid-mediated and  chromosomal beta-lactamases accounts for its lack of cross-resistance with other  beta-lactam antibiotics. imipenem is also active against p. aeruginosa with non-lactamase-mediated resistance to classical beta-lactam agents. efficacy of imipenem was shown in animal models, including septicemia in normal and neutropenic rodents and p. aeruginosa pneumonia. imipenem also has a unique postantibiotic effect against p. aeruginosa in vivo.

TI  == recovery of blood-borne bacteria from human urine.
AB  == recovery from the urine of organisms causing bacteraemia may depend on the bacterial species involved. the survival of the more common species of bacteria which cause bacteraemia was examined in human urine, serum and normal saline. all species survived well or grew in serum. haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis and group a streptococci were killed in all urine samples. the number of colony-forming units of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus and group b streptococci either remained the same or increased in the urine, while the numbers of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae increased rapidly. these data suggest  that the observed differences in recovery from urine of these bacterial species that cause bacteraemia are related to the viability of the species in human urine.

TI  == efficacy of imipenem/cilastatin in endocarditis.
AB  == imipenem, a potent new beta-lactam antibiotic, which is bactericidal against most pathogenic bacteria, and cilastatin, a dehydropeptidase inhibitor combined with imipenem to prevent the metabolism of imipenem in the kidney, were evaluated in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis. seventeen patients, including 14 who used intravenous drugs, were treated with imipenem/cilastatin in a dose of 500 mg each infused over 30 minutes every six hours. the mean duration of treatment was  29 days with a range of 21 to 56 days. causative bacteria were staphylococcus aureus in 10 patients, s. aureus plus group b streptococcus in one, viridans group streptococcus in two, neisseria subflava, eikenella corrodens, and group g  streptococcus in one patient, and staphylococcus epidermidis, hemophilus aphrophilus, and enterobacter aerogenes in one patient each. the minimal bactericidal concentration of imipenem against 16 of 18 isolates tested was 0.04  micrograms/ml, 1 microgram/ml against h. aphrophilus, and 0.4 micrograms/ml against e. aerogenes. the site of infection was the right side of the heart in 11 patients, the left side in five, and both sides in one. the mean number of days to defervescence was 9.7. all patients were cured, and none required cardiac surgery. adverse effects were few and interrupted treatment occurred in only one  patient who had acute dyspnea during an infusion on day 26 of therapy. imipenem/cilastatin appears to be a relatively safe and highly effective treatment of staphylococcal endocarditis in intravenous drug users; too few patients with endocarditis caused by other bacteria were treated to allow a firm  statement about efficacy in non-staphylococcal endocarditis.

TI  == culture of the surfaces of urinary catheters to sample urethral flora and study the effect of antimicrobial therapy.
AB  == at the time indwelling urinary catheters were removed, the urethral flora was sampled by rolling the catheters onto culture plates. cultures were obtained from 398 patients with sterile urine. catheter surfaces were colonized less often in males than in females (16.8 and 67.0%, respectively) and yielded correspondingly  fewer bacterial species per catheter. in both sexes, gram-positive species were isolated more frequently than gram-negative species (428 and 131 isolates, respectively). the bacteria most commonly isolated were staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus faecalis. staphylococcus saprophyticus was not recovered despite the large proportion of young, sexually active women in the study population. gram-negative bacteria, mainly escherichia coli, gradually colonized the catheters over time but at all times were recovered in lower amounts the gram-positive organisms and less often in males than in females. slime production by coagulase-negative staphylococci did not relate to the density of organisms recovered from the catheters or influence the presence of gram-negative bacteria. despite frequent use of antibiotics in this population, the urethral flora remained highly susceptible to these drugs. antibacterial activity was not detected on the catheters despite high concentrations in the urine. this suggests that systemic antibiotics have a very limited effect on resident urethral flora. despite relatively small numbers in the urethra, gram-negative bacteria readily produce urinary tract infections in catheterized patients.

AB  == an analysis was made of 91 cases of infective endocarditis (ie) with regard to causative organisms and their sensitivities to various antibiotics, the clinical  features of the disease, the laboratory test results and other items were important in establishing a diagnosis of ie. the number of cases of ie has shown  a tendency to increase in recent years, particularly in the number of elderly patients, and the ratio of total cases consisting of prosthetic valve endocarditis (pve) has shown a sharp increase. the most common causative organism is still streptococcus viridans, but there has been an increase in the incidence  of ie due to benzyl-penicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis and other fastidious organisms. the percentage of underlying diseases represented by combined valvular diseases has been increasing, while the primary known cause of the infection of ie was dental treatments. a positive value for crp, an accelerated value for esr, leukocytosis, anemia, a decrease in serum fe, a positive value for ra-t, were all parameters which showed a high correlation with ie, and these should be useful in establishing the diagnosis of ie. the use of cardioechography to detect cardiac vegetation is important in relation to establishing the diagnosis and prognosis of ie, and the evaluation of the therapeutic results.

TI  == cefotaxime monotherapy of bacterial meningitis caused by gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == primary meningitis in children is caused by two gram-negative bacterial species,  neisseria meningitidis and haemophilus influenzae, and one gram-positive bacterial species streptococcus pneumoniae. despite optimal penicillin susceptibility, with few exceptions, therapeutic results in pneumococcal meningitis are by far worse than with the other two pathogens. therefore, and because of the detection of penicillin-resistant rods, the study of alternatives  in therapy is justified and was started with cefotaxime. including six of our own patients, there are reports on 87 patients in the literature suffering from s. pneumoniae meningitis who were treated with cefotaxime monotherapy. results of these studies will be analyzed. as none of these patients belonged to a prospective controlled study group, final evaluation in comparison with penicillin therapy remains open. there are also several reports on successful treatment of group b streptococcus meningitis with cefotaxime, although there is  no need to abandon penicillin therapy. staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis meningitis, usually secondary in shunted hydrocephalus, brain tumors, brain injury or other causes, should not be treated with cefotaxime because of its limited activity on these bacteria. listeria monocytogenes and streptococcus  faecalis are primarily cefotaxime-resistant, and neonatal meningitis of unknown origin, therefore, should not be treated with cefotaxime alone as long as these pathogens cannot be excluded.

TI  == an overview of cefotaxime therapy in infections caused by gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefotaxime and other third-generation cephalosporins against gram-positive pathogens is generally considered to be less than that of earlier cephalosporins, such as cefazolin. a review of pooled pre-release data collected by numerous investigators and supplied by hoechst-roussel made it possible to evaluate the clinical and bacteriologic efficacy of cefotaxime in more than 900 infections caused by gram-positive organisms. the most commonly isolated pre-treatment organisms were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and other streptococcal species. the overall clinical efficacy rate was 95% and the bacteriologic eradication rate was 94.5%. side-effects were limited to rash in two, diarrhea in one and fever in one. pain at the administration site was reported by four patients. comparative studies with cefazolin against s. aureus showed no statistically significant differences in efficacy. the highest failure rates were seen in enterococcal urinary tract infections, as predicted by in vitro sensitivity tests. cefotaxime  appears to be a safe, effective antibiotic for the therapy of infections caused by gram-positive pathogens.

AB  == the frequency, etiology and risk factors of superinfections during and/or within  one week after antibiotic therapy with betalactam-aminoglycoside combinations were evaluated in 631 patients with hematologic malignancies admitted to the institute of hematology of rome from january 1982 to december 1984. 356 patients  (56%) developed 402 episodes of proven or presumed infection. of these patients,  78 developed 102 superinfections. overall, superinfections responded less satisfactorily to antibiotic therapy than the primary febrile episodes (63% vs. 85%). the distribution of etiologic agents of superinfections differed from those responsible for primary infections, since fungi and anaerobes (especially clostridium difficile) were mostly isolated after antibiotic therapy had begun. moreover, among aerobic bacteria, frequently antibiotic-resistant species, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis  were the leading etiologic agents of superinfection. the risk of superinfection appeared to increase with the depth and persistence of granulocytopenia. on the other hand, the length of hospitalization, length of previous antibiotic therapy, previous chemoprophylaxis and presence of indwelling venous catheter did not affect the risk of superinfection.

TI  == [current aspects of infectious endocarditis. review of 101 cases].
AB  == one hundred and one cases of infectious endocarditis were reviewed, from 1966 to  1982. the mean age of the patients was 56.3 +/- 15 years. there was a marked predominance of men (70.2 p. 100); the commonest portal of entry was dental (45.9 p. 100); the number of iatrogenic portals of entry and cases of endocarditis on prosthetic valves has been increasing in recent years. blood cultures were positive in 83 p. 100 of cases; the commonest responsible organism was the non-d  streptococcus (31 p. 100 of cases) followed by the d streptococcus (18.8 p. 100), the staphylococcus aureus (17.8 p. 100), and the staphylococcus epidermidis (2.9  p. 100). gram-negative bacilli were isolated in 9.9 p. 100 of cases. rare and slow growing organisms have been isolated since 1977. echocardiography was then introduced and helped the diagnostic in 70 p. 100 of cases. circulating immune complexes were measured in 25 patients and were found to be raised in 14 cases (56 p. 100). the commonest complication was cardiac failure (43 p. 100) which led to valve replacement in the acute phase in 14 p. 100 of cases. the occurrence of  cardiac arrhythmias was a poor prognostic factor. the other complications were neurological (15 p. 100), renal (10 p. 100), embolic (19 p. 100), and pulmonary (9 p. 100). the mortality rate in the acute phase was 30 p. 100 and the probability of a five year survival was 54 p. 100.

TI  == clinical evaluation of temocillin in urinary tract infections.
AB  == a group of 27 female and 2 male urological patients, aged 19 to 80 years (mean 44 years), were treated with intravenous temocillin 500 mg twice daily for 5 to 7 days. the diagnoses were acute pyelonephritis (n = 20), acute cystitis (n = 6), and acute cystitis and pyelonephritis combined (3). the causative organisms were  escherichia coli (n = 20). proteus species (n = 9). klebsiella species (n = 4). streptococcus faecalis (n = 2). staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 1), and providencia stuartii (n = 1). 27 of the 29 patients (93%) were clinically and bacteriologically cured; bacteriuria persisted in 2 patients with prolonged obstructive uropathy. in acute non-obstructive pyelonephritis, the urinary excretion of beta-2-microglobulin rapidly decreased, documenting a prompt renal tubular restitution during therapy. the drug was well tolerated and proved very safe with regard to haematological, hepatic and renal parameters. also, candida haemagglutination titres did not increase significantly during therapy. temocillin therapy should preferably be commenced after the results of the urine  culture are available.

TI  == human serum amyloid p component, a circulating lectin with specificity for the cyclic 4,6-pyruvate acetal of galactose. interactions with various bacteria.
AB  == serum amyloid p component (sap), a normal plasma glycoprotein, has recently been  shown to have ca2+-dependent binding specificity for methyl 4,6-o-(1-carboxyethylidene)-beta-d-galactopyranoside (mo beta dg) [hind, collins, renn, cook, caspi, baltz & pepys (1984) j. exp. med. 159, 1058-1069]. sap was found to bind in vitro to klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, the cell wall of which is  known to contain this particular cyclic pyruvate acetal of galactose. sap also bound in similar amounts (approx. 6000 molecules per organism) to group a streptococcus pyogenes, but very much less was taken up on xanthomonas campestris, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of mannose. no sap bound to escherichia coli, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of glucose, or to streptococcus pneumoniae type 4, which contains the 2,3-cyclic pyruvate acetal of alpha- rather than beta-galactopyranoside, or to other organisms (streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis), the carbohydrate structures of which are less well characterized. binding of sap to those organisms which it did recognize was completely inhibited or reversed by millimolar concentrations of free mo beta dg. sap, a human plasma  protein, thus behaves as a lectin and may be a useful probe for its particular specific ligand in the cell walls of bacteria and other organisms.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of ceftriaxone against clinical bacterial isolates  in nigeria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftriaxone, a cephalosporin derivative, recently introduced in nigeria was compared with the activities of other related beta-lactam antibiotics such as cefotaxime, cefuroxime, cephaloridine, cloxacillin/ampicillin and ampicillin against 530 local clinical isolates of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. the spectra of activity and potency of  ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were generally similar against the enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia spp., streptococcus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, but less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis when compared to cefotaxime. all the other beta-lactam antibiotics tested were less active than ceftriaxone. the action of ceftriaxone was bactericidal and the minimum inhibitory concentration values observed with r-plasmid beta-lactamase mediated resistant escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus spp. and n. gonorrhoeae strains did not exceed the maximum value obtained with the beta-lactamase-negative strains.

TI  == mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. it also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. there is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits  ribonucleic acid synthesis. induction of bacterial l-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. stable l-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to  vancomycin. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant  strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), str. pyogenes, str. agalactiae, str. bovis, str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species and lactobacillus species. there has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against staph. aureus, str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. the combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of staph. epidermidis. it shows indifference against enterococci. vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against staph. aureus.

TI  == the relevance of arterial wall microbiology to the treatment of prosthetic graft  infections: graft infection vs. arterial infection.
AB  == one potential, but poorly studied source for intraoperative contamination of vascular grafts is the native artery to which the prosthetic graft is attached. the purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between arterial wall microbiology and graft infection. between july 1, 1981, and march 31, 1982, arterial specimens were cultured from 88 (30%) of 298 patients undergoing clean,  elective arterial reconstructive procedures. control cultures were obtained from  adjacent adipose or lymph node tissue. positive cultures were obtained from 38 of 88 (43%) of the arterial walls cultured but from none of the control cultures (0  of 20) (p less than 0.001). the most common organism cultured was staphylococcus  epidermidis (27 of 38; 71%). our overall graft infection rate since january 1, 1981, is 0.9% (3 of 335). all three graft infections occurred in patients with positive arterial cultures. arterial and graft cultures were also obtained from 20 patients treated for 22 graft infections over the past 13 years. organisms recovered included staphylococcal species (36%), enteric organisms (46%), and mixtures of the two (18%). these patients with culture-positive graft infections  were divided retrospectively into two groups: those with positive and those with  negative arterial cultures. positive arterial cultures were associated with suture line disruption in 8 of 14 cases (57%), but there were no arterial disruptions in patients with negative cultures (0 of 8) (p less than 0.01). these data document a significant correlation between positive arterial wall cultures and subsequent prosthetic infection and also suggest that infection involving the arterial wall is a major determinant of the morbidity and mortality associated with the treatment of prosthetic graft sepsis.

AB  == slc:ddy mice that received a single intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg/kg streptozotocin (stz) were examined for persistency of diabetes (changes of indigenous bacterial floras, and bacterial translocation. significant diabetes (increase in plasma glucose and decrease in insulin) was recognized 2 weeks after the injection, and persisted for 12 weeks. the numbers of aerobic gram-negative bacilli, staphylococci (including micrococci), and streptococci in caecal and oral floras were significantly increased, but the numbers of anaerobic bacteria in caecal flora were hardly changed. bacterial translocation of indigenous bacteria to the mesenteric lymph node, lung, or kidney was detectable in some mice 2 weeks after the injection. the incidence of bacterial translocation in these stz-treated mice then increased; infection caused by several organisms, e.g., klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococci, or lactobacillus sp., occurred in lung, liver, spleen, kidneys, and mesenteric lymph node. no indigenous bacteria were cultured from these organs of control mice. this endogenous infection may have been due to the over population of several bacterial strains caused by disruption of indigenous floras along with depression of immunological function.

TI  == intradermal injection of propionibacterium acnes: a model of inflammation relevant to acne.
AB  == the intradermal injection of 140 micrograms of propionibacterium acnes (cn 6134)  into the ears of female sprague-dawley rats produced a chronic inflammation with  formation of acneiform lesions. inflammation was characterized by more than a doubling of ear thickness at 24 h and a peak of 3-4 times control levels at day 21. at 42 days post injection ears were still 3 times normal thickness. histologically there was early polymorph accumulation giving way to macrophages and lymphocytes by day 7. pilosebaceous follicles overlying the inflamed area lost their sebaceous glands and became hyperplastic cords of cells that grew down and encapsulated inflammatory loci. by day 9 many of these follicles had become secondary comedones. three isolates of p. acnes from inflammatory acne lesions and 4 of 5 isolates from non-acne patients produced results similar to that of the strain cn 6134. in these cases the number of histologically evident secondary comedones was correlated with ear thickness. in contrast, samples of streptococcus lactis, escherichia coli b, and staphylococcus epidermidis failed to produce this combination of chronic inflammation and high lesion count. benzoyl peroxide, tetracycline, erythromycin, phenidone, naproxen, and cis and trans retinoic acid were inactive as inhibitors of p. acnes cn 6134-induced ear thickening. the corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide produced dramatic suppression of inflammation, but upon cessation of treatment the ears returned to inflamed levels. the specificity for p. acnes, the formation of acneiform lesions, and the recalcitrance of the inflammation suggest our model is indeed relevant to acne.

TI  == antimicrobial agent susceptibility patterns of bacteria in hospitals from 1971 to 1982.
AB  == bacterial susceptibility to 16 commonly used antibiotics was analyzed for a 12-year period (from 1971 to 1982, inclusive). susceptibilities of 5,828,243 strains isolated from a mean of 242 hospitals nationwide and of 194,575 strains isolated at the massachusetts general hospital, boston, mass., and the bronx lebanon hospital center, new york, n.y., were compared. strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed virtually the same susceptibilities to antibiotics throughout the 12-year  period, whereas streptococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant increases in resistance to most antibiotics. the close similarity between antibiotic susceptibilities shown at both the 242 hospitals and the 2 individual hospitals suggests that this analysis accurately reflects trends of bacterial resistance to antibiotics in u.s. hospitals. since most of the species  analyzed produce serious disease and high mortality, their susceptibility to antibiotics is relevant both to physicians treating infectious diseases and to epidemiologists.

TI  == in vitro activity of imipenem--a review.
AB  == a review is given of the microbiological properties of imipenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic with an exceptionally broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. an evaluation of results of numerous in vitro studies reveals that imipenem effectively inhibited growth of 53 of 55 bacterial species, the mean mic90 being  less than 8 mg/l. the mic90 for cocci, with the exception of staphylococcus epidermidis, is in the range of 0.01-3.1 mg/l. the mic90 for all enterobacteriaceae is equal to or less than 8 mg/l. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria are generally susceptible to imipenem, only pseudomonas maltophilia and pseudomonas cepacia showing intrinsic  resistance. imipenem is currently the most active drug available against anaerobic bacteria, the mic usually being below 1 mg/l even for bacteroides fragilis. rare bacteria such as nocardia asteroides, listeria monocytogenes or fast growing mycobacterium spp. which cause difficult-to-treat infections are also susceptible to imipenem. increases in inoculum size have only a minimal effect on activity of the drug. in most species the mbc only slightly exceeded the mic; however in the case of streptococcus faecalis the mbc value was many times the mic value. synergism has been observed in combinations of imipenem with aminoglycosides, and antagonism in combinations with other beta-lactam antibiotics against pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens. imipenem is stable in the presence of the common chromosomal and plasmid-mediated enzymes. induction of inactivating enzymes was observed in staphylococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens.

[3h]thymidine incorporation into bacterial, but not fibroblast, dna was efficiently and promptly inhibited by the antimicrobial polypeptide preparation. this suggests that its main target is a component of the system, which catalyzes and regulates the biosynthesis of bacterial dna.

TI  == evaluation of rapid identification of gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures by use of the automicrobic system gram-positive identification card.
AB  == because rapid identification of gram-positive organisms from blood cultures may provide valuable information for patient care and because the automicrobic system gram-positive identification (ams-gpi) card (vitek systems, inc., hazelwood, mo.) is designed for the identification of these organisms in 4 to 13 h, we designed this study to evaluate the performance of the ams-gpi card in the direct identification of gram-positive organisms upon detection of growth in blood culture bottles. we compared direct identification by the ams-gpi card with the final ams-gpi card identification and with our standard identification methods. we evaluated 51 gram-positive organisms from clinical blood cultures as well as 49 simulated blood cultures. the isolates included streptococcus pneumoniae (17), streptococcus pyogenes (13), group d enterococci (12), streptococcus agalactiae (11), viridans streptococci (10), coagulase-negative staphylococci (21), staphylococcus aureus (15), and listeria monocytogenes (1). the ams-gpi card identified all of the group d enterococci, viridans streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci and all but one each of the streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae isolates. l. monocytogenes was also correctly identified. however, the ams-gpi card identified only 12 of 17 streptococcus pneumoniae and 9 of 15 staphylococcus aureus isolates by direct inoculation. we therefore conclude that the results of direct identification of gram-positive organisms by the ams-gpi card may be used cautiously for rapid direct identification of gram-positive organisms from positive blood cultures.

TI  == experimental anaerobic brain abscess. computerized tomographic and neuropathological correlations.
AB  == the neuropathological progression of brain abscess formation induced by a mixed anaerobic culture of bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus epidermidis was studied experimentally in dogs. histological findings were correlated with computerized tomographic (ct) brain scans. the evolution of brain abscess formation could be divided into three stages based on histological criteria: early cerebritis (days 1 to 3); late cerebritis (days 4 to 9); and capsule formation (day 10 and later). capsule formation could not be divided into early and late stages because encapsulation was delayed compared with a previously reported model of alpha-streptococcus brain abscess. histologically, there was evidence for a very virulent infection. leptomeningitis was significant even in the late stages. early ventricular rupture occurred in 25% of the animals. a pattern of extensive purulent encephalitis was seen in 25% of the animals. in the early cerebritis stage, blood vessels near the necrotic center were engorged and  were surrounded by hemorrhage and/or protein-rich fluid. cerebral edema was extensive. although fibroblasts appeared in late cerebritis, there was marked delay of capsule formation. three-week-old lesions still had areas of incomplete  capsule formation and foci of uncontrolled infection. in the cerebritis stages, ct scans showed an area of ring enhancement which was incomplete on early scans (at 5 minutes after injection of contrast material) but partially filled in and thickened on delayed scans (at 20 to 45 minutes). on even later delayed scans there was no decrease in intensity of ring enhancement. lesions in which capsule  formation occurred also showed ring enhancement, but delayed scans showed a decrease in the intensity of enhancement. the lesions that ruptured into the ventricular system showed atypical ct findings, with either lack of contrast enhancement (histologically there was minimal cerebritis adjacent to the abscess  cavity) or a marked delay in contrast enhancement (cerebritis was more extensive  and corresponded to the width of ring of enhancement). this study suggests that bacteroides fragilis is a virulent organism in the brain. the developing abscesses enlarged quickly, were prone to early ventricular rupture, and showed incomplete and delayed encapsulation.

TI  == relationships between linear type scores, objective type measures, and indicators of mastitis.
AB  == objectives were to examine the usefulness of objective measures of conformation and linear scores for type for predicting indicators of mastitis. approximately 300 cows in five herds were scored in the experimental linear classification program of the holstein-friesian association of america, measured objectively for numerous components of conformation, and evaluated for four indicators of mastitis. indicators of mastitis were average natural logarithm of somatic cell counts during the lactation, percent of samples (taken approximately every 3 mo)  infected during a lactation, percent of samples infected with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella, and percent of samples with signs of mastitic milk. relationships between conformation and mastitis often were inconsistent because of moderate or low correlations between  indicators of mastitis. indicators of mastitis were predicted from results of multiple regression analyses with subjective scores and objective measures of type as independent variables. largest differences of predicted indicators of mastitis from variation in any single type trait were sufficient to be important  economically, but average differences were much smaller. selection to reduce frequencies of cows with deep udders, especially low rear udders, widely placed teats, rear teats too far back, and teats that are short and wide, may augment, modestly, efforts to reduce incidence of mastitis through improved sanitation, antibiotic treatment, and proper milking procedures.

TI  == current mechanisms of resistance to antimicrobial agents in microorganisms causing infection in the patient at risk for infection.
AB  == the mechanisms of resistance encountered in bacteria causing infection in the patient at risk for infection are diverse. most resistance currently seen is the  result of plasmid transfer rather than mutational events. however, extensive use  of antimicrobial agents in the hospital has caused the selection of organisms resistant to many agents by virtue of chromosomally mediated mechanisms. staphylococcus aureus resistant to beta-lactams due to altered penicillin-binding proteins has become a problem in certain patients such as narcotic addicts and chronic care facility patients exposed to many beta-lactam antibiotics. s. epidermidis has also proved to be a problem in patients with indwelling foreign devices, and altered penicillin-binding proteins also make these organisms resistant to available penicillins and cephalosporins. streptococcus fecalis has  become increasingly resistant to aminoglycosides, erythromycin, and tetracyclines due to plasmid-mediated enzymes. hemophilus influenzae resistant to both penicillins and chloramphenicol by virtue of beta-lactamases and chloramphenicol  transacetylase has been encountered. beta-lactamase-mediated resistance of enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae to beta-lactam antibiotics has increased, and resistance of serratia marcescens and pseudomonas  aeruginosa to aminoglycosides and penicillins is a widespread phenomenon. mechanisms to reduce resistance will include not only careful attention to hygienic practices but also more appropriate use of antibiotics selecting the proper agent depending on the type of patient and environment in which the infection develops.

AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of acetic and propionic acid for resident bacteria on normal human skin, such as propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus epidermidis, was 25 mg/ml or more at any ph tested (ph 5.5-6.8). while the mic of these acids for most of the transient bacteria was markedly decreased by lowering the ph of the media and at ph 5.5, the mean ph value of the normal human skin, the mic was 6.25 mg/ml or less. the mic of oleic acid for some strains of gram-positive transient bacteria of streptococcus, micrococcus, or bacillus was 100 micrograms/ml or less at all ph's tested. staphylococcus aureus  was resistant to this acid at ph 6.8, but became as sensitive as streptococcus when the ph was lowered. the growth of p. acnes, the most predominant resident bacterium, was enhanced markedly and reached a maximum level at 6.25 mg/ml of propionic acid, 12.5 mg/ml of acetic acid, and 50-100 micrograms/ml of oleic acid. on the basis of these results, we presumed that acetic, propionic, and oleic acids are factors influencing the predominant residence of some species of  propionibacterium and coagulase-negative staphylococcus on normal human skin.

TI  == [doxycycline in the treatment of non-specific urethritis and/or prostatitis].
AB  == twenty-five men with non-specific urethritis/adnexitis were treated with 200 mg doxycycline monohydrate daily (vibramycin tabs) over a period of 10 days. more than half of the patients suffered from chronic inflammations. microorganisms isolated from urethral secretion and prostate exprimate comprised aerobes, in particular staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus faecalis, as well as mycoplasmae, chlamydiae, and anaerobes, mainly bacteroides species and peptostreptococci. fourty percent of patients additionally had anatomical alterations such as constrictions or strictures of the lower urinary tract. after 10-day therapy with doxycycline 16 out of 24 patients (67%) could be cured and a  further six patients (25%) could be improved. microbiological cure could be achieved in infections with chlamydiae in all cases, in infections with mycoplasmae in 67%, in infections with anaerobes in 80%, and in infections with aerobes in 57% of cases. overall, the therapeutical success in the investigated patient population with chronic infections which are difficult to treat has therefore to be regarded as excellent. therapy had to be discontinued in one patient after 3 days due to diarrhoea and nausea. in the other patients toleration of doxycycline was good.

AB  == the gnotobiotic gerbil was selected as a model with which to study the effects of colonization with a defined microflora on organ morphology, histology, and selected blood biochemical parameters. gerbils were maintained germfree for 13 months but failed to reproduce, presumably because of the enlarged cecum. a colony of gnotobiotic gerbils that was associated with a bacterial flora consisting of lactobacillus brevis, streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacteroides vulgatus, enterobacter aerogenes, and a fusobacterium sp. was established. these gnotobiotic gerbils had smaller ceca than germfree gerbils and proved capable of reproduction. except for the presence of large numbers of bacteroides organisms in the stomach and greater numbers of s. epidermidis in gnotobiotic gerbils, the number and location of gastrointestinal bacteria were similar in conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils. bacteroides sp. was the second most predominant microorganism present in gnotobiotic gerbils, whereas clostridia were reported to be the second most predominant microorganism  in conventional gerbils. microscopic examination of direct-impression smears indicated that fusobacteria were present on mucosal surfaces. intestines of gnotobiotic gerbils weighed twice as much as the intestines of conventional gerbils. intestinal tissue water weight values from conventional and gnotobiotic  gerbils were similar. histological examination of gerbil intestinal tissue revealed no cellular hypertrophy and no evidence of inflammation in gnotobiotic gerbil intestines. spleens of gnotobiotic gerbils showed no germinal center stimulation. statistical differences in total serum glucose, serum protein, and hematocrit levels were found between conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils.

AB  == the viable populations of seven species of bacteria were reduced 17% to 99% by treatment with a 3% suspension of human cerumen of the soft or "wet" type. species tested for susceptibility to cerumen were staphylococcus aureus, staphlylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium spp, escherichia coli, and serratia marcescens. the reduction depended upon the species of bacterium and the age of the culture. pathogenic species appeared to be more susceptible than others, while cultures in logarithmic growth were more susceptible than stationary phase cultures to the bactericidal activity of wet cerumen. there appeared to be little difference in the bactericidal activity between the two lots of cerumen used. the bactericidal  activity of wet cerumen was found to be quite similar to that of dry cerumen as reported earlier in the literature.

TI  == chloralanyl and propargylglycyl dipeptides. suicide substrate containing antibacterials.
AB  == a set of dipeptides containing the amino acid residues beta-chloroalanine and propargylglycine, which are mechanism-based inactivators of purified microbial enzymes (alanine racemase and cystathionine gamma-synthase, respectively), have been synthesized, and their antibacterial properties in vitro have been evaluated. dipeptides containing a single beta-chloro-l-alanyl residue (e.g., 3,  5, 9, and 10) or a single l-propargylglycyl residue (e.g., 12 and 15) are potent  antibacterials. the in vitro antibiotic activity of beta-chloro-l-alanine and of  l-propargylglycine is increased as much as 4000-fold by incorporation of these residues into a dipeptide. compounds that contain only a single enzyme-inactivating amino acid together with a second l-alanyl residue (3, 5, 12, and 15) have a restricted range of activity: of the species tested, only streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis are sensitive. however, peptides that contain two suicide-substrate residues [e.g., beta-cl-lala-beta-cl-lala (8) or lppgly-lppgly (18)] are broad-spectrum antibacterials; as many as 12 different species of the 16 surveyed are sensitive. dipeptides that contain an amino-terminal l-methionyl (9) or an l-norvalyl (10) residue and a carboxy-terminal beta-chloro-l-alanyl unit are also effective against a large number of organisms; the spectra of activity are like those seen  for 8 and 18. a "mixed" dipeptide [beta-cl-lala-lppgly, (21)] gives apparent synergism of antibiotic action of beta-chloro-l-alanine and of l-propargylglycine when these two residues are incorporated into a single structure. peptides of the d,d configuration (4, 6, 13, 16, and 20) and ones of l,d stereochemistry (e.g., 7) are not antibacterials. peptides containing one (11 and 14) and two (17) d,l-propargylglycyl residues are unresolved sets of diastereomers; the mixtures of compounds are between two- and fourfold less active than the correspondingly resolved l,l dipeptides (12, 15, and 18). these findings are consistent with a mechanism of action for these antibiotics involving stereoselective processing of the peptidyl unit in vivo.

AB  == the comparative study of a large assortment of liquid and solid culture media used for the cultivation of streptococci in laboratory practice in the ussr and abroad was carried out with the aim of selecting the optimal media for the laboratory diagnosis of group b. streptococci. liquid media were tested with the  use of 7 streptococcal reference strains, and some of these media, found to yield the best results, were selected for tests on clinical material. the use of liquid accumulation media was shown to permit the isolation of group b. streptococcal strains which could not be detected by the direct inoculation of clinical material into dishes with blood agar. the character of hemolysis induced by group b. streptococci in solid media with 5% of blood added was found to depend on the  composition of the medium and the conditions of cultivation.

TI  == physiology and ecology of the vagina.
AB  == the human vagina is lined by stratified squamous epithelium which has no glands.  major components of the vaginal secretions are transudate through the vaginal walls, desquamating epithelial cells, cervical mucus, fluids from the upper genital tract, and leukocytes. estrogens and sexual stimulation are examples of factors which increase vaginal fluid. major organic constituents of the vaginal fluid are proteins, carbohydrates, and fatty acids. organic acids arise as metabolic byproducts of vaginal bacterial flora, cause the vaginal odor, and show cyclic changes except in oral contraceptive users. qualitative and quantitative studies in humans as well as animal model studies have confirmed that the vaginal flora is a dynamic and closely interrelated system. lactobacilli are most prevalent, but many other facultative and anaerobic organisms are present. an inverse relationship exists between the concentration of lactobacilli and other bacteria such as anaerobes. aerobic bacteria decrease premenstrually whereas anaerobes, in general, remain at constant levels. during menarche, pregnancy, postpartum period, menopause, and postoperative trauma, dramatic changes occur in the microbial flora. the role of an iud in causing changes in the microbial flora is under great scrutiny at the present time. overall, disturbances in the vaginal ecosystem may have a potential impact on many diseases, and thus deserve careful  studies.

(2), and streptococcus pyogenes (1). nonpathogenic bacteria isolated in 14 cases included streptococcus epidermidis, diphtheroids and streptococcus viridans. two aspirates were sterile. a satisfactory clinical response was achieved in 15 of 21 cases (71%) treated with amoxicillin and 14 of  19 cases (74%) treated with cefaclor. we conclude that amoxicillin and cefaclor are comparable in efficacy for the therapy of acute otitis media with effusion in early infancy.

AB  == the in vitro activity of teichomycin has been evaluated against 189 clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and group d streptococci. teichomycin was as active as vancomycin, a chemically related antibiotic, on staphylococci and inhibited the in vitro growth of methicillin-resistant strains at the same concentration necessary to inhibit the  sensitive ones. against group d streptococci teichomycin was about three times more active than vancomycin (mic50 = 0.125 mg/l, mic90 = 0.4 mg/l). mbc:mic ratios of both drugs against staphylococci were comparable, but teichomycin had higher bactericidal activity against group d streptococci, as shown also by killing curves. the activity of teichomycin was not significantly affected by variation of ph, even if the maximum activity was achieved at neutral ph, or by different methods of mic evaluation. the antibiotic seemed more active when tested with a low inoculum (10(3)-10(5)/ml): a two- to threefold increase in mic  was observed at an inoculum of 10(7)/ml. a reduction of the in vitro activity could be shown when penassay broth was used as culture medium.

AB  == we have previously reported the transfer of gentamicin resistance (gmr) plasmids  in a mixed culture inter- and intraspecifically between strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis isolated at michael reese hospital (jaffe et al., antimicrob. agents chemother. 21:773-779, 1982). we have now shown that representatives of these plasmids were transferred between apparently nonlysogenic strains of s. aureus either in mixed culture in broth or by filter-mating on agar medium. the mechanism of transfer appeared to be conjugation. a transferable gmr plasmid (psh8) mobilized or cotransferred a tetracycline r-plasmid and a chloramphenicol r-plasmid that were not independently transferable. the transfer of gmr plasmids was accompanied by a high incidence of deletion mutations with varied loss of plasmid resistance determinants and, with some mutants, loss of the ability to effect self-transfer. restriction endonuclease digestion of psh8 and its deletion mutants made it possible to assign the property of self-transfer to a specific segment of the psh8 genome and provided the basis for a physical and genetic map of that plasmid. similar gmr plasmids from s. aureus strains isolated in locations remote from michael reese hospital had resistance determinants and transfer properties comparable to those of psh8. our observations provide evidence for the conjugal transfer of some staphylococcal plasmids, apparently independent of the presence  of phage. this mechanism may be of significance in the intra- and interspecific dissemination of resistance to aminoglycosides and other antibiotics in staphylococcus spp.

TI  == stimulation of migration of human monocytes by bacterial cell walls and muramyl peptides.
AB  == bacterial cell walls, water-soluble fragments of the wall peptidoglycan, n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine (mdp), and 6-o-acyl derivatives of mdp were examined for migration-stimulating activity on human peripheral blood monocytes by using a multiwell chemotaxis assembly. cell walls isolated from 11 bacterial species caused a definite increase in monocyte migration, but the walls of micrococcus lysodeikticus were scarely active. the migration-enhancing activity of staphylococcus epidermidis cell walls was retained by a monomer as well as a polymer of disaccharide peptides which were prepared by digestion of the peptidoglycan with enzymes. it was finally revealed that the migration of monocytes was enhanced by mdp. 6-o-octadecanoyl-mdp, 6-o-(2-tetradecylhexadecanoyl)-mdp, and 6-o-(3-hydroxy-2-docosylhexacosanoyl)-n-acetylmuramyl-l-seryl-d-isoglutamine were active, but to a lesser extent. a checkerboard assay demonstrated that the increased monocyte migration caused by s. epidermidis cell walls was directed toward a positive stimulus (chemotaxis).

TI  == detection of fungemia obscured by concomitant bacteremia: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  == our recent clinical experience suggested that bacteremia may interfere with the detection of concomitant fungemia when standard blood culture methods are used. to determine the extent to which bacteria may interfere with fungal isolation from blood cultures, an in vitro model simulating blood cultures taken during concomitant fungemia and bacteremia was created. each of six bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was combined with each of three pathogenic yeasts (candida albicans, candida tropicalis, and torulopsis glabrata) in vented blood culture bottles containing enriched brain heart infusion broth and fresh normal human blood. blood culture bottles were analyzed at 1, 2, and 7 days of incubation. gram strains and subcultures onto chocolate and macconkey agars failed to detect fungi in 37.0, 66.7, and 100% of samples, respectively. however, subcultures onto sabouraud dextrose agar failed in only 13% of the samples (occurring only with p. aeruginosa). in a rabbit model of concomitant fungemia with c. albicans and bacteremia with p. aeruginosa, no yeasts were recovered from blood cultures despite 100% detection of p. aeruginosa. therefore, the usual microbiological techniques may be inadequate to  detect fungemia when concomitant bacteremia is present.

TI  == diagnosis and treatment of acute mastitis in a large dairy herd.
AB  == in a 270-cow dairy herd, milk samples from all cows with acute mastitis were cultured during a 12-month period. of 119 isolates (from 166 quarters), 49% were  gram-positive organisms, 39% were gram-negative organisms, and 12% were yeasts. of all samples from cows with acute mastitis, 40% failed to produce colonies on culture media. recovery of the common gram-positive pathogens, staphylococcus aureus (11% of isolations) and streptococcus agalactiae (1% of isolations), was rather low. however, s epidermidis (14% of isolations) and streptococci other than str agalactiae (9% of isolations) were recovered more frequently than expected, particularly in recently calved cows. coliform organisms accounted for  35% of the total isolates and were the single most important cause of acute mastitis. of 42 cows with coliform mastitis, 6 died despite intensive antibiotic  and electrolyte therapy. there was no death loss among cows with mastitis caused  by gram-positive organisms. antimicrobial susceptibilities of 95 isolates to 11 antimicrobials was determined by standardized methods. organisms were most often  susceptible to chloramphenicol, cephalothin, and gentamicin. a treatment regimen  consisting primarily of oxytetracycline and/or sulfonamides systemically in conjunction with intramammary infusions of cephapirin was evaluated. treatment response in 37 quarters was determined by culturing before treatment and at 4 or  more days after treatment. of 23 quarters initially culture-positive, 22 were negative on reculture. treatment response appeared to agree with the results of the susceptibility testing.

AB  == the bacterial flora of the external ear canals and posterior auricular skin surfaces were investigated in a group of 26 divers after 25 dry-suit dives in harbor water and 20 dry-suit dives in clear test tank test. a control group of 16 divers wore rubber hoods 19 times for a similar period (25 to 30 min) but did not dive. the protective effect of 2% acetic acid was tested by instilling it in the  left ear of 14 divers and 8 nondivers. staphylococcus epidermidis, propionibacterium acnes, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and enteric gram-negative  rods were the predominant isolates from skin and ear samples. after the divers dove or after they wore hoods without going in the water, there was a substantial increase in the number of these organisms on the skin (46.9%) or in the external  ears (43.8%) of the divers. however, an increase in the bacterial counts in the external ear canals occurred in only 13.6% of the individuals treated prophylactically with acetic acid drops. although no gram-negative rods were recovered from the skin or external ear canals of divers in clear tank water, 23  strains were isolated after the dives in harbor water. identical gram-negative isolates also were recovered from the harbor water. gram-negative organisms also  were recovered from three newly acquired skin lacerations, where they persisted for at least 24 h. our data show the acquisition of gram-negative rods when dives were made in polluted water. the data also demonstrate the increase in bacterial  counts that occurs when rubber diving rods are worn (in or out of water) and that this increase can be controlled by pretreatment of ears with acetic acid.

TI  == studies on bacterial hypersensitivity in man. interrelationship between skin reactions to bacterial peptidoglycan and serum peptidoglycan antibody titers.
AB  == the nature and extent of bacterially induced allergies are difficult to define. since peptidoglycan, the main component of the cell wall of almost all bacteria,  has been available in a highly purified, chemically and immunologically well-defined form, investigation of the allergological significance of this cell  component is feasible. intracutaneous tests were carried out on 181 test subjects with five different peptidoglycan (pg) preparations from staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pyogenes. the results of the investigation were compared with the result of determination of serum pg antibodies and serum ige concentrations. it was shown that test subjects with dual and later reactions to three different staphylococcal pgs displayed significantly higher pg antibody titers than test subjects with negative reactions. such a relationship could not be found with the cutaneous reactions to streptococcal pg. the total serum ige values were very much higher in test subjects with immediate reactions to staphylococcal pg than in test subjects with a negative reaction. typical arthus reaction or late granulomatous reactions were not observed. humoral antibodies are involved at least in part in the elicitation of dual and late reactions. thus, there are interesting parallels to allergy to fungal spores and organic dusts.

AB  == the growth-inhibiting behaviour of abacterial, liquid pure cultures made up of three water algae (hydrodictyon reticulatum, chlorella vulgaris, aphanothece nidulans) which were made to grow profusely in special culture containers under constant exposure to light and ventilation was examined in ten different species  of microorganisms during a period of contact of 4 days both in the light and in the dark. subjected to the test were the 5 pathogenic species staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium and  candida albicans as well the 5 bacterial contamination indicators e. coli (faecal indicator), streptococcus faecalis (enterococci), enterobacter aerogenes ("coliforms"), staphylococcus epidermidis (dermic germ) and bacillus subtilis ("contamination germ"). it was found that --hydrodictyon reticulatum and aphanothece nidulans exert a strong antibacterial effect, while chlorella vulgaris provides no indication of a bacterial growth-inhibiting effect. --this antibiosis is linked with the assimilative activity of the algal cultures, as in  the dark no antibacterial action is discernible --the "antibiotic principle" must be liable to transitory or rapid disintegration because the algal cultures are ineffective in the dark and also culture filtrates of 5-days old algal cultures exercise no growth-inhibiting effect. with respect to the sanitation of waters it is important to state that a profuse growth of algae produces a certain, but hardly reliable "biological water disinfection" and renders difficult the assessment of the quality of a water-course as a result of the elimination of the usual contamination indicators. therefore, additional microbiological quality parameters must be used for assessment of pollution of swimming pools with strong algal growth.

AB  == to determine the need for blind subculturing of bactec (johnston laboratories, cockeysville, md.) blood culture media, we compared results of radiometric readings, visual inspection, and blind subculturing for nearly 7,500 blood specimens. visual inspection and radiometric testing were performed on day 1 through 7, and blind subcultures were made on day 3. in the first phase of the study, 402 of 3,896 aerobic bottles were positive by radiometric testing (growth  index, greater than 25), visual inspection, or subculturing. only six bottles were radiometrically negative but subculture positive on day 3. the second phase  of the study was designed to determine if aerobic bottles eventually became radiometrically positive in those cases in which they were radiometrically negative but subculture positive on day 3. two bottles were subculture positive but never gave a growth index of greater than or equal to 25 by day 7. one yielded staphylococcus epidermidis, and one yielded viridans, streptococcus sp. a total of 35 anaerobic organisms were isolated from 3,896 blood specimens. all of  these anaerobes were detected by both radiometric testing and subculturing. we examined a total of 14,972 blood culture bottles. twenty-nine bottles considered  negative by visual inspection or radiometric readings were found to be positive by subculturing. fifteen of these were shown, by chart review, to contain contaminants. organisms in the other negative bottles would not have gone undetected because companion bottles from the same patients were radiometrically  or visually positive. we concluded that it is necessary to perform blind subcultures of bactec 7b and 8b blood culture bottles.

TI  == the antibacterial action of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin inhibits the second stage of cell wall synthesis in susceptible bacteria. furthermore, there is evidence that vancomycin also alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. stable l-phase variants are susceptible to vancomycin, but induction of bacterial l-phase variants with vancomycin is very difficult. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive cocci and bacilli, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (including multiply resistant strains). streptococcus  pneumoniae (including multiply resistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus bovis, viridans group streptococcus, enterococcus, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species, and lactobacillus species. antimicrobial activity can be enhanced with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against s. aureus, s. bovis, enterococcus, and viridans streptococcus. the combination of vancomycin and rifampin also has enhanced activity against s. aureus.

TI  == changing blood culture isolates in a referral neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  == an analysis was made of all cases of bacteraemia that had occurred in the referral neonatal intensive care unit at hammersmith hospital during the years 1976--79. one hundred and thirteen infants had positive blood cultures; 27 were born in the hospital, and 86 admitted from elsewhere. this gave a rate of 5.7/1000 live hospital births, and 165/1000 outborn admissions to the unit. the latter infants were predominantly of very low birthweight or were ill. thirty-three of the isolates were cultured in the first 48 hours of life (early)  and the remaining 80 after that time (later). staphylococcus epidermidis was the  organism most often isolated both early and later. these results were different from those recorded in the previous 9 years (1967--75) from the same unit. then,  group b beta-haemolytic streptococcus was the organism most often isolated early, while gram-negative bacteria predominated among later isolates. the changing nature of care may contribute to these findings.

AB  == the activity of e. coli, group b streptococci, strept. faecalis, stap. epidermidis and staph. aureus in human amniotic fluid was studied. in comparison  to standard i broth an inhibited growth of test organisms was observed. the bacteriostatic effect of amniotic fluid was most significant with staph. epidermidis. we further investigated the causes for this bacterial growth inhibition with staph. epidermidis. we showed that it is independent from the initial number of bacteria as well as from zinc and phosphate content, the phosphate-to-zinc ratio and from the protein content in amniotic fluid samples. it could neither be influenced by heating nor by autoclaving, but was immediately lost by adding standard i both to amniotic fluid samples. in the concentrations we investigated the bacteriostatic effect was independent from the influence of steroid hormones.

AB  == necropsy of 13 agalactic and 11 normally lactating sows at 1 to 2 days after parturition revealed that 7 of the agalactic and 4 of the clinically normal sows  had lesions of mastitis. escherichia coli, streptococcus equisimilis, and staphylococcus epidermidis were the predominant organisms isolated. the organisms were isolated as pure and as mixed cultures and all 3 were isolated from normal appearing, as well as mastitic, glands. pure culture isolation of e. coli (44 gland segments) was significantly associated with microscopic lesions of mastitis, regardless of the number of colonies isolated, whereas pure culture isolation of streptococcus equisimilis or s epidermidis in low to moderate numbers was not. isolation of large numbers of beta-hemolytic streptococci (2 gland segments) or of s epidermidis (6 gland segments) was associated with microscopic evidence of mastitis. cultural examination of uterus and cervix revealed 5 isolates of strict anaerobic bacteria, all different species, from 4 of the 24 sows. culture of 2 mammary glands from each sow revealed no strict anaerobes. phase-contrast microscopic examination of specimens from mammary glands, uterus, and cervix of each sow revealed no spirochetes. attempts to isolate mycoplasmas and chlamydiae from mammary gland, uterine tube (fallopian tube), uterus, cervix, and urethra of the 24 sows were negative. the evidence confirms previous reports that coliforms are the most significant bacteria in mastitis of the sow.

TI  == mannitol agar for microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis.
AB  == a medium containing mannitol (mannitol agar) was developed and evaluated as a tool for the microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis. mannitol agar supported  growth of all important bacterial mastitis pathogens (staphylococci, streptococci, coliforms, and pseudomonads) except corynebacterium pyogenes. color change around colonies in the agar permitted the differentiation of pathogenic from nonpathogenic staphylococci. most staphylococcus aureus strains and some staphylococcus epidermidis strains produced yellow zones. these yellow zone-producing strains (mannitol fermenters) of staphylococci were obtained from  quarters with significantly elevated (p less than 0.05) somatic cell counts (scc) in the milk, as compared with uninfected quarters and, therefore, would be considered pathogens. mannitol-negative strains of s epidermidis (those with red  zones) were obtained from quarters with scc similar to those of uninfected quarters. the streptococci could be divided into 2 groups on the basis of color change around the colonies: streptococcus agalactiae, str dysgalactiae, and group g streptococci produced red zones; str uberis, str bovis, and enterococci produced yellow zones. pathogenic streptococci (str agalactiae, str dysgalactiae, str uberis, and group g streptococci) were obtained from quarters with scc significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than those of uninfected quarters. streptococcus bovis and enterococci were obtained from quarters with scc similar  to those of uninfected quarters and were considered nonpathogenic. pathogenic streptococci were found in much higher concentration than nonpathogenic streptococci and could be differentiated on that basis.

TI  == premature labor. ii. bacterial sources of phospholipase.
AB  == human term labor is thought to be initiated by amniotic and chorionic phospholipase a2, an enzyme that liberates arachidonic acid esters from the phospholipids of these membranes, leading to the synthesis of prostaglandins by the placental membranes. the striking association of premature labor with intrauterine infection or contamination, urinary tract infection, and early neonatal sepsis led us to study the microorganisms present in these infections for phospholipase a2 activity. activity was found in bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus, fusobacterium necrophorum, streptococcus viridans, streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus a and b, escherichia coli, klebsiella, staphylococcus epidermidis, pneumococcus, lactobacillus, and mycoplasma hominis.  bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus, fusobacterium, and s viridans had the highest activities. the specific activities of phospholipase a2 from these organisms were several times higher than that of the membrane phospholipase a2 of the amnion and chorion. we postulate that premature labor may be initiated by microorganisms with phospholipase a2 activity from endocervical and/or intrauterine contamination or infection, producing deacylation of arachidonic acid from amniotic phospholipids with increased concentrations of free arachidonic acid and increased prostaglandin synthesis, which triggers labor.

(2) the mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of cpz to three children was 70 minutes. (3) one hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of  cpz to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. in one case,  the csf/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) the average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) eighteen pediatric patients received cpz in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. they were rti in 7, uri in 5, uti in 5, ssss in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. the clinical effectiveness of cpz was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. one patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. the three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis.

AB  == the significance of bacterial isolates of coagulase negative staphylococcus epidermidis and corynebacterium species in middle ear fluids remains controversial. this study was undertaken to evaluate the possible role of these organisms in different effusions. cultures were obtained from the external cartilaginous ear, bony canal, tympanic membrane, middle ear fluids, tonsils and  nasopharynx of 93 patients at the time of myringotomy for otitis media with effusion. isolates of coagulase negative staphylococci from the middle ear, external ear and posterior aural skin were evaluated in regard to antibiotic sensitivity, biochemical tests and phage typing. furthermore, in another series of patients in whom these organisms were isolated, specific antibody activity in  both middle ear washings and corresponding sera were measured, using the technique of indirect immunofluorescence. the results suggest that the isolates from the middle ear and ear canal are not always identical. there is some evidence that specific igm and igg as well as iga responses to these organisms are present in middle ear washings and not in corresponding serum. these results  suggest that coagulase negative staphylococcus and corynebacterium species in middle ear effusions may not be contaminants from the external canal and that a local immune response may be produced by these organisms. whether or not these organisms represent etiologic agents responsible for otitis media with effusion cannot be ascertained from this data. one very interesting point is the presence  of igf coating of organisms in some effusions.

TI  == treatment failures secondary to in vivo development of drug resistance by microorganisms.
AB  == in two patients development of resistance to antibiotics by initially sensitive infecting organisms was associated with relapse or persistence of active infection. the first patient developed staphylococcus epidermidis resistant to chloramphenicol during therapy with this agent for an infection that followed a cerebrospinal fluid shunt, and the second patient developed bacteremia due to ampicillin-resistant salmonella during therapy with ampicillin. treatment failure resulting from in vivo development of resistance to antimicrobial agents has been described for most of the major classes of antiinfective drugs and for numerous microorganisms. although in many of these instances reinfection with a resistant  organism cannot be excluded, there are many examples of apparent mutation or initial infection with both sensitive and resistant bacterial populations that is followed by selective multiplication of the resistant population or acquisition of resistance by an initially sensitive infecting organism. this phenomenon can be a cause of treatment failure and has appeared in patients in whom, by available tests, drug levels were found adequate. isolation days after the institution of antimicrobial therapy of what appears to be the same organism as was initially recovered should prompt repeated sensitivity tests, at least to the agents being administered, if the patient's clinical course has not been one of satisfactory improvement.

TI  == [bacterial antagonism of oral secretions towards staphylococci].
AB  == bacterial antagonism may be one of the mechanism which regulates the bacterial flora of the pharynx. we have investigated the bacterial antagonism exerted in oral secretion by alpha-hemolytic streptococci against s. aureus and s. epidermidis. we cultured viridans streptococci and staphylococci in human saliva  and we noted a bactericidal activity towards staphylococci. such activity, referable to the salivary system (peroxidase-thiocyanate) activated by hydrogen peroxide produced by streptococci, was greater on s. epidermidis. the remarkable  sensitivity of s. epidermidis could explain the rare presence of this species in  pharynx and oral cavity.

TI  == enhancement of generation of monocyte tissue thromboplastin by bacterial phagocytosis: possible pathway for fibrin formation on infected vegetations in bacterial endocarditis.
AB  == the deposition of fibrin on infected vegetations and the presence of mononuclear  phagocytes that have phagocytized bacteria are remarkabe features in experimental bacterial endocarditis. in a study in vitro, we show that phagocytosis of bacteria by human monocytes enhances thromboplastin generation by these cells. maximal enhancement of the generation of thromboplastin by monocytes was about six times compared with that in the control experiment without bacteria, and it was obtained by preincubation of the monocytes with 5 to 10 bacteria per monocyte. no quantitative difference was observed between staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus sanguis as to the enhancement of the monocyte thromboplastin generation. an enhancement of the procoagulant activity generation was also observed after addition of bacteria to human or rabbit whole blood. probably, this generation was also due to synthesis of thromboplastin by monocytes. it is conceivable that fibrin deposition on infected vegetations during bacterial endocarditis is mediated by thromboplastin synthesis by monocytes.

TI  == specific absorption of human serum albumin, immunoglobulin a, and immunoglobulin  g with selected strains of group a and g streptococci.
AB  == five gram-positive bacterial strains were selected for absorption studies of human serum samples. strain ar1 (group a, m-type 1) and g148 (group g), with strong immunoglobulin g (igg) binding capacities, and strain aw43 (group a, m-type 60), binding both iga1 and iga2, were compared with staphylococcus aureus  cowan i and with staphylococcus epidermidis l603. both ar1 and g148 were capable  of completely absorbing out serum igg. in contrast, s. aureus cowan i left a fraction unabsorbed, as expected from its known lack of igg3 binding. strain aw43 absorbed out all serum iga, using a 10-microliter bacterial pellet for 20 microliter of serum. serum igm levels were slightly reduced by s. aureus cowan i  absorption. on the basis of the experiments, a bacterial mixture was designed consisting of s. aureus cowan i and group a streptococcus strains ar1 and aw43, with absorption characteristics suitable for use in discriminating between early  igm and late igg and iga immune responses in routine serological work. a new type of bacteria-mammalian protein binding was discovered. human serum albumin was completely absorbed out by strain g148 and to a lesser extent by strain ar1 and aw43. s. aureus cowan i and s. epidermidis were negative. the binding capacity of g148 for albumin equalled that of cowan i for igg. the binding pattern of albumin to the strains was different from those of igg, iga, igm, fibrinogen, haptoglobin, or aggregated beta 2-microglobulin and therefore seems to represent  another type of bacterial-mammalian interaction with a specific albumin receptor  on the surface of streptococci.

TI  == storage of microtiter plates for antimicrobial susceptibility tests.
AB  == microdilution susceptibility tests are being performed routinely and in increasing numbers in many clinical laboratories. microtiter plates for these assays are usually prepared in large batches and stored frozen until needed. studies were performed to investigate the stability at -20c and at -70c of ampicillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, chloramphenicol, and cephalothin, using enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella as test organisms. the stability at -20c and -70c of clindamycin, vancomycin, cephalothin, cefazolin, oxacillin, methicillin, nafcillin, and penicillin was analyzed using staphylococcus eureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  enterococcus, and alpha streptococcus as the test organisms. no significant deterioration of any of the antibiotics was noted after ten weeks of storage at -70c, as detected by minimum inhibitory concentration determinations. no significant differences were noted at -20c for clindamycin, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, cefazolin, cephalothin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin. by ten  weeks' storage at -20c, significant deterioration of carbenicillin, ticarcillin,  ampicillin, penicillin, methicillin, oxacillin, and nafcillin was observed.

TI  == adjuvant activities in production of reaginic antibody by bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan or synthetic n-acetylmuramyl dipeptides in mice.
AB  == this paper is concerned with the adjuvant activity in stimulatory immunoglobulin  e production against ovalbumin (oa) by bacterial cell walls, cell wall peptidoglycan (pg), and their pg fragments and synthetic n-acetylmuramyl (murnac) dipeptides in a/j mice. a pg isolated from streptococcus pyogenes, pg subunit polymer and dimer obtained from staphylococcus epidermidis, and water-soluble fragments of cell walls or pg prepared from nocardia corynebacteriodes and streptomyces gardneri were found to enhance both the primary and secondary responses of anti-oa immunoglobulin e antibody production. it was suggested that  the pg portion, either intact or highly degraded, was capable of enhancing the immunoglobulin e antibody production, and there was no need for the non-pg moiety or intactness of pg structure for the adjuvant activity. this finding was confirmed and extended by the use of synthetic murnac dipeptides. among eight murnac dipeptides tested, murnac-l-ala-d-isogln, murnac-l-ala-d-gln, murnac-l-ala-d-glu, and murnac-l-ser-d-isogln were found active as an adjuvant in the stimulation of the primary and secondary reaginic anti-oa antibody production in a similar way to the cell wall pg and their fragments. none of the synthetic murnac-l-ala-l-isogln, murnac-l-ala-l-gln, murnac-l-ala-l-glu, and murnac-l-ala-d-isoasn, on the other hand, stimulated the anti-oa immunoglobulin e antibody production in either primary or secondary response, indicating the importance for the adjuvancy in immunoglobulin e production of the configuration  of the glutamic acid residues adjacent to the l-ala (or l-ser) in muramyl dipeptides.

TI  == quantitation of skin bacteria: lethality of the wash solution used to remove bacteria.
AB  == a widely used technique for the quantitative removal of bacteria from the skin uses a detergent, triton x-100 (p, t-octylphenoxynonaethoxyethanol), to remove and suspend the bacteria. we determined the half-life for the survival of five common skin bacteria suspended in the solution. the shortest-lived was streptococcus pyogenes with a half-life of 0.9 hours. all of the others (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, and  klebsiella pneumoniae) had half-lives of 1.5 hours or longer. k. pneumoniae, the  only gram-negative species tested, had a half-life of more than 30 hours. thus, a one hour delay in plating and incubation of samples suspended in this detergent solution inhibits quantitation of most species tested.

AB  == by the use of specific antibody to human chorionic gonadotropin (cg) as well as to its beta-subunit, and the application of the indirect fluorescein-labeled and  peroxidase-labeled antibody techniques, we have demonstrated the presence of a membrane (wall)-associated cg-similar immunoreactive protein in 15 strains of bacteria isolated from tissues of patients bearing malignant neoplasms. these microorganisms were classified as s. epidermidis, (12) e. coli (2), and a single  strain of p. maltophilia (atcc 13637). the absence of the cg-like antigen in other "cancer associated bacteria", streptococcus faecalis (atcc 12818) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (from patient with cancer of colon), demonstrated that not every "cancer associated bacteria" has the capability to synthesize the trophoblastic-like protein. the negative results obtained with a number of "noncancer control" bacteria of known origin, obtained from atcc and from clinical samples, strongly supported the idea that the existance of these cg-like protein producing microorganisms is not a ubiquitous finding. the demonstration of a de novo bacterial biosynthesis of a protein having similar antigenic and biophysical properties to those of the human trophoblastic hormone, has great biological implications, especially if its biosynthesis is proven only in bacterial strains growing in the presence of cancer cells in which we have already demonstrated the presence of a similar antigen. the explanation of the phenomenon is unknown. because of their origin, the potential of "genetic exchange" with subsequent expression of the mammalian gene by the bacterial cells becomes a possibility. it is also possible that the gene coding for the cg-like protein is normally present but inactive or repressed in all bacteria.

TI  == secretion of lipids induced by inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis in streptococci.
AB  == inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis causes an immediate and massive secretion of both newly synthesized and "old" lipids from several species of bacteria, including streptococci, staphylococcus epidermidis, and bacillus subtilis. lipid  secretion occurs in the absence of detectable bacterial lysis. this novel phenomenon was examined in more detail in three strains of streptococci: s. sanguis (group h), s. pyogenes (group a), and s. pneumoniae. the secretion of lipids is specifically induced by inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis; it is not caused by inhibitors of protein, ribonucleic acid, or deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis. the occurrence appears to be reversible since penicillin-induced secretion comes to a halt upon the timely addition of penicillinase, correlating  with resumption of culture growth. all cellular lipids are secreted in essentially the same proportions as those found in the drug treated bacteria. it  is suggested that continued peptidoglycan synthesis may be essential for the integration and retention of lipid material in the plasma membrane.

AB  == we studied the bactericidal capacity of the rat lung during the development of pneumococcal pneumonia. pneumonia was produced in a lower lobe by the intrabronchial instillation of 10(4)streptococcus pneumoniae cells in buffer. lung bacterial counts progressively increased, reaching 10(7) per lung within 48  h, and the increase was associated with localized atelectasis and consolidation.  bacterial multiplication was inhibited with tetracycline at various intervals after infection, and the subsequent clearance of pneumococci was determined. viable pneumococci were rapidly killed by lung defenses if bacterial multiplication was inhibited within 12 h of the onset of infection. no change occurred in the bacterial populationif tetracycline was delayed until 24 h after  infection, indicating that pneumococcal killing by lung defenses had ceased. this effect could be reproduced with the addition of pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide to the inoculum, which produced a dose-related inhibition of pneumococcal clearance. the clearance of s. epidermidis was not impaired in the presence of pneumococcal pneumonia or by administration of exogenous capsular polysaccharide. these data indicate that pneumococcal pneumonia causes a marked impairment in lung antipneumococcal defenses within 24 h of the onset of infection. this acquired defect in antibacterial defenses may be due to the accumulation of pneumococcal capsular material in the lungs of infected animals.

TI  == bacteremia after upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.
AB  == during 24 months, 200 upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed on 193 patients. blood cultures were obtained before and five and 30 minutes after the procedure using thiol (50 ml) and trypticase soy broth (100 ml) media. the mean endoscopic time was 34 minutes. sixteen patients developed bacteremia (8%). twelve groups of microorganisms were detected in positive blood cultures: streptococcus (5 species), lactobacillus sp, veillonella alcalescens, staphylococcus aureus, staph epidermidis, propioni-bacterium acnes, corynebacterium acnes, and bacillus subtilis. seven patients had positive blood cultures at five and 30 minutes, eight at five minutes, and one at 30 minutes only. there was no clear correlation of bacteremia with the age or previous history of the patient, biopsy, active bleeding, endoscopic time, or findings. a  follow-up study of all patients for six months to two years indicated no complications related to endoscopy and/or bacteremia.

TI  == antimicrobial systems of the surgical wound. ii. detection of antimicrobial protein in cell-free wound fluid.
AB  == human wound fluid contains heat-stable proteins with moderate antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli, and different heat-labile proteins with antibacterial activity against e coli. blood serum also contains heat-labile antibacterial substances, but little heat-stable activity against staphylococcus aureus. both blood serum and wound fluid have bacteriostatic activity against s epidermidis, and early growth of streptococcus  fecalis occurs in serum and wound fluids. the concentration or activity of antimicrobial proteins increases during the first week in the fresh wound and then decreases as the wound matures.

TI  == a simplified method using commercial milk powder for hand-rearing of the caesarean-derived infant rabbits (author's transl).
AB  == an efficient and simplified method for hand-rearing of caesarean-derived infant rabbits under gnotobiotic condition was devised. the caesarean-derived infant dutch or japanese-white rabbits and their hybrids (f1; japanese-white female x dutch male) were reared in sterilized vinyl-isolators by hand-feeding with two kinds of milk diets, a and b, consisted mainly ofa commercial milk powder for dogs and cats (esbilac) supplemented with several minor components (table 2) and  administered intragastrically once a day through a nelaton's catheter. bacteriological examinations revealed that feces and urine were sterile for the first three days. on the third day, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus, and bacteroides sp. were given with milk diet and the infant rabbits were reared until 10 to 12 weeks of age. the weaning rate at 5 weeks of age and the raising rate at 3 months of age were approximately 78% and 77%, respectively (table 3), indicating that feeding once-a-day with a milk diet mainly composed of esbilac is suitable for the hand-rearing of infant rabbits. there was, however, no significant difference milk diet a and b on the weaning rate.

TI  == [bacterial endocarditis: clinical and bacteriological aspects and prognostic factors].
AB  == the microbiological, clinical and therapeutic aspects of all (71) cases of bacterial endocarditis admitted to the hopital cantonal, geneva, between august 1970 and october 1974 were reviewed: there was a definite trend towards higher prevalence of acute cases compared to subacute cases. the pathogenic role of s. epidermidis, mostly in cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis, could be demonstrated in several cases. when defined initially by microbiological criteria only, acute endocarditis were characterized by rapid evolution, destruction of the valvular structures (especially aortic valve), and by further evolution under adequate antibiotic therapy: thus, 10/25 patients with acute endocarditis died, whereas the mortality rate in the subacute cases was only 10/46. many cases in our series showed one or more often frequent embolic phenomena: 70% of the cured  cases and 80% of the patients with a fatal outcome. an unfavorable evolution could be correlated with neurologic involvement, cardiac rhythm or conduction disturbances, and/or heart failure; indeed, heart failure due to various mechanisms was the single most frequent cause of death and is presently the main  therapeutic problem. thus, acute infection leading to destruction of the aortic valve and to heart failure still carries a bad prognosis, even if emergency valve replacement is attempted. finally, 22/30 patients who developed a bacterial endocarditis after oral or urological procedures knew about a heart murmur, but did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis. this clearly shows that emphasis should be put on the elaboration and diffusion of adequate prophylactic regimens.

TI  == nonlactating-cow therapy with a formulation of penicillin and novobiocin: therapeutic and prophylactic effects.
AB  == an experimental product incorporating 500,000 iu of procaine penicillin g and 600 mg of sodium novobiocin in 2% aluminum monostearate-peanut oil gel (10-ml dose) was used to treat all quarters of 56 cows which were infected in at least 1 quarter at time of final mild-out at end of lactation. treatment was withheld from 89 cows uninfected in all quarters. quarter infection was determined by bacteriologic culturing of milk samples collected at the last regular milking, at intervals up to final milk-out (7 or 12 days later), at calving, and 1 week later. clearance rates against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococci other than streptococcus agalactiae, and coliform bacteria in treated quarters were 83, 94, 88, and 71%, respectively. subtraction of the spontaneous clearance rate of about 50% in untreated quarters resulted in values  of 35 to 45% for drug efficacy against existing staphylococcal and streptococcal  infections. prophylactic efficacy was examined. in cows entering the true nonlactating period with 1 or more quarters infected, new infection rates across  the period aming quarters uninfected at the beginning were 36.0% among untreated  cows and 6.3% among treated cows (p less than 0.005). the comparable rates for cows entering the nonlactating period uninfected in all quarters were 5.7 and 0%. staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, which comprised 38.5% of new period infections among untreated cows, were completely lacking among treated cows (p less than 0.025). within the treated group of cows, 83.1% of infected quarters were cleared, and new infection rate in the non-lactating period was 50% less than the rate among untreated cows. because the frequency of intramammary infection in this herd was quite low at "drying-off" (10.5% of quarters), the net effect on herd health of selective therapy of cows infected at end of lactation was a reduction in total quarter infection from 19.8 to 13.6%.

AB  == bacterial cell walls from str. bovis, str. lactis, str. mutans, str. thermophilus, str. salivarius, and str. pyogenes were able to produce polyarthritis in rats but str. faecalis cell walls were nonarthritogenic. s. aureus cell walls produced extremely severe disease. it was also shown that cell  walls from s. epidermidis, b. megaterium, and m. lysodeikticus were nonarthritogenic. a close correlation was observed between development of arthritis and the delayed hypersensitivity to bacterial peptidoglycans but not with the ppd hypersensitivity. it was suggested that the adjuvanticity of bacterial cell walls is needed to induce the disease and that arthritogenicity requires a specific antigen in addition to the presence of an adjuvant-inducing agent.

TI  == meatal recolonization in bitches.
AB  == colonization of the urethrovaginal area precedes urinary tract infection in women. among the potential factors limiting colonization by fecal pathogens is bacterial interference, the ability of established commensals to inhibit colonization by pathogenic bacteria. since the microcontour of the canine distal  urethra possesses microvilli like those in the vagina rather than the microplicae found at higher levels and also has similarities in cellular glycogen content the meatal area would be expected to respond to hormonal influences like the vagina.  the normal canine urethrovaginal flora was determined by serial cultures. it consisted principally of staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium and acinetobacter-haemophilus. estrus produced a selective overgrowth of beta-streptococcus and acinetobacter-haemophilus. a normal canine transient, escherichia coli, and a normal resident, corynebacterium, persisted only for a short time (4.5 days) unless inoculated during estrus, when they remained for a mean period of 70 days. in contrast, human escherichia coli and pseudomonas persisted only a short time, whether during anestrus (4.8 days) or during estrus  (8.5 days). the commensals had returned fully by 14 days after sterilization, while those in estrus overresponded. thus, indigenous bacteria inhibit establishment of certain foreign species in the urethra and hormones enhance the  susceptibility to colonization.

TI  == partial characterisation of an inhibitor of streptolysin o produced by bacterial  growth in serum.

TI  == interaction of peptidoglycans with anti-iggs and with complement.
AB  == this report describes the interaction of peptidoglycan (streptococcus group a, staphylococcus epidermidis and micrococcus lysodeikticus) with 2 serum mediator systems, namely with the anti-igg system and with complement. the observation that the majority of rabbits hyperimmunized with a-variant streptococcal vaccine  produced anti-group carbohydrate antisera containing anti-iggs and antibodies directed to peptidoglycan suggested that the production of these 2 latter antibodies was related. this view was supported by the finding of a monoclonal 7s anti-igg with antibody specificity for the pentapeptide of peptidoglycan as evidenced by inhibition of the coprecipitation of 7s anti-igg with antigen-antibody complexes by the pentapeptide. inhibition of the anti-idiotype reaction by the pentapeptide provided further evidence for the antibody specificity of 7s anti-igg for peptidoglycan. when added to normal human sera all peptidoglycan preparations inhibited the hemolytic activity of the sera. consumption of c3 in c2 deficient serum and consumption of c2 in normal serum indicated the activation of both known complement pathways. activation of the classical pathway of complement was more efficient since 50 mug of peptidoglycan  consumed approximately 70% of c2 per ml normal serum whereas more than 2 mg of the same preparations was required to inactivate 17-24% of c3 in c2 deficient sera. each of the different peptidoglycan preparations consumed similar amounts of complement in all 20 sera tested. this finding suggested that activation of the classical complement pathway by peptidoglycan was not mediated by anti-peptidoglycan antibodies present in only 20-40% of normal human sera.

TI  == migration inhibition of peritoneal macrophages by peptidoglycan.
AB  == previous studies have shown that peptidoglycans from group a and b streptococci inhibit the migration of peritoneal exudate cells from non-sensitized rats and guinea pigs. in the present studies peptidoglycans from s. aureus and s. epidermidis were found to inhibit the migration of cells to the same extent as group a streptococcal peptidoglycan. in contrast, hsa-pentapeptide, an immunologically active synthetic analog of the peptide moiety of peptidoglycan which is free of the intrinsic toxicity of naturally occurring peptidoglycans, did not induce migration inhibition of peritoneal exudate cells from non-sensitized guinea pigs. sensitization of animals with 200 mug hsa-pentapeptide emulsified in incomplete freund's adjuvant significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of streptococcal and staphylococcal peptidoglycan; hsa-pentapeptide again showed no activity. however, when hsa-pentapeptide was tested against cells from animals sensitized with 200 mug hsa-pentapeptide incorporated in complete freund's adjuvant, a strong inhibition of migration was  evident. skin tests performed in these animals, in contrast to the dermonecrotic  reaction elicited by streptococcal or staphylococcal peptidoglycan, revealed a characteristic delay hypersensitivity to hsa-pentapeptide.

TI  == endotoxin-like properties of the peptidoglycan.
AB  == peptidoglycan is responsible for the endotoxin-like properties of the streptococcus cell wall. the pyrogenic response of rabbit to group a streptococcus peptidoglycan prepared by hot formamide or tca is dose-dependent and is increased if the material is ultrasonically solubilized. the pyrogenicity  can be eliminated by the antiserum to the peptidoglycan or by the degradation of  the material by lysozyme. peptidoglycans prepared from cell walls of group b and  l streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pneumoniae produce fever effects comparable to the response after group a streptococcus peptidoglycan. spirillum serpens and escherichia coli contain in addition to endotoxin the peptidoglycan which is also pyrogenic. repeated injections of bacterial peptidoglycan to rabbit result in tolerance to the fever effect. cross-tolerance was recorded only exceptionally. rabbits tolerant to endotoxin respond with a lower fever to s. aureus and group a streptococcus peptidoglycans. intravenous administration of peptidoglycan to rabbit causes extensive alterations in the heart characterized by various stages  of the degenerative and necrotic process. local shwartzman reaction can be elicited in rabbit by peptidoglycan used either as a preparative or as a provocative dose in combination with endotoxin, or it can be used for both doses. the results obtained with peptidoglycans prepared from various bacteria are fully comparable. non-specific resistance of mice to infection induced by streptococcus cell walls was found to be dependent on the peptidoglycan activity; cell wall proteins and polysaccharide are inactive. these properties of peptidoglycan resemble those known from endotoxin studies. the data presented suggest the role  of peptidoglycan in pathological reactions resulting from host-parasite interaction.

AB  == the cell walls from all 21 species of gram-positive bacteria examined, except lysozyme-susceptible micrococcus lysodeikticus (nctc 2665) and lysozyme-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (atcc 155), were found to be definitely adjuvant-active in both stimulation of increased serum antibody levels and induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity to ovalbumin when administered to guinea-pigs as water-in-oil emulsions. using various cell wall lytic enzymes, the immunoadjuvant principles were solubilized with full retention of the adjuvant activities from walls of staphylococcus aureus (copenhagen), streptococcus pyogens (group a, type 6; s43/100), streptococcus salivarius (ifo 3350), streptococcus faecalis (ifo 12580), streptococcus mutans (bht), lactobacillus plantarum (atcc 8014), bacillus megaterium (ifo 12068), corynebacterium diphtheriae (park-williams no. 8), mycobacterium smegmatis, and actinomyces viscous (atcc 15987). evidence was obtained that the non-peptidoglycan portion of the cell walls is not essential for manifestation of immunoadjuvancy.

TI  == effect of sodium cyanate upon the function of normal human polymorphonuclaer leukocytes.
AB  == sodium cyanate, a drug that prevents sickling of hemoglobin s by virtue of its irreversible carbamylation of the n-terminal amino group of valine, was studied for its effect upon the function of normal human polymorphonuclear luekocytes. in concentrations of 500 and 100 mug/ml, sodium cyanate was found to inhibit killing by neutrophils of staphylococcus epidermidis and eschierichia coli but not of streptococcus faecalis. viability of cells and phagocytosis were not affected by  cyanate; however, production of [14-c] carbon dioxide from [1-14-c] glucose and the iodination of 125-i during phagocytosis were significantly impaired. cyanate  is thought to inbibit the bacterixidal activity of neutrophils by interfering with the oxidative metabolism of gluxose via the hexose monophosphate shunt (theraby decreasing production of h-2-o-2) and by inbibiting iodination of ingested bacteria (either by competing with iodide as the oxidizable cofactor or  by inhibiting myeloperoxidase). since these effects of cyanate were all reversible by washing the nurtrophils free of the drug, it is unlikely that they  are due to amino carbamylation.

TI  == the survival and growth of microorganisms in mascara during use.
AB  == over 150 mascaras representing eight popular brands were examined for their susceptibility to microbial contamination during their use by study group members. additional mascaras from patients with symptoms and clinical findings of long-term blepharitis also were investigated. early in the study, two brands without preservatives supported reproducing populations of microorganisms, including potential eye pathogens. these products, as currently manufactured, were recalcitrant to microbial attack. microbes associated with the facial skin and fingers of the study group users were typically isolated from mascaras after  use. initial microorganisms isolated from mascaras were usually transients. establishment of reproducing populations within the cosmetics appeared related to the number of uses, personal habits of the user, and the formulation of the product. four patients with staphylococcal blepharitis and cosmetics heavily laden with staphylococcus epidermidis showed marked clinical improvement when they stopped using the contaminated cosmetics. the application of used eye area makeup prior to and following ocular surgery should be avoided.

TI  == intramammary infections in the sow during the peripartum period.
AB  == the incidence and ype of aerobic bacteria causing intramammary infection (imi) in two groups of peripartum sows were determined. the incidence of imi in 24 sows near farrowing was 30.2 percent; the incidence in 16 machine-milked sows was 81.0 percent. numerous mixed imi were detected. the bacterium causing most imi was staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by beta hemolytic streptococci, aslpha hemolytic streptococci, escherichia coli, and diphtheroids. the beta hemolytic streptococci and e. coli cultures were studied in detail. the relationship of bacterial imi to agalactiae toxemia is discussed.

TI  == bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  == human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, eh < -42 mv at ph 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic pmn. anaerobic pmn were able to kill staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus, viridans streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and peptococcus magnus normally. organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic pmn included staphylococcus  aureus (strains wood 46 and 502a), escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and salmonella typhimurium. these findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide  may be important in the killing of some bacteria.

TI  == natural history of impetigo. ii. etiologic agents and bacterial interactions.
AB  == intensive observations on 37 children in a population with endemic skin infections provided an opportunity to study the interrelationships between and the significance of the bacterial genera commonly associated with impetigo. cultures of the respiratory tract, three normal skin sites, and lesions, when present, were taken three times weekly from july to october 1969. impetigo developed in all 37 children. group a streptococci alone were recovered from 21%  of 361 lesions, staphylococcus aureus alone from 8%, staphylococcus epidermidis alone from 5% and mixtures of streptococci and staphylococci from 61%. vesicular  or pustular lesions were more often pure streptococcal than pure staphylococcal.  streptococci alone were more often recovered from early stage lesions rather than from later ones. the pure staphylococcal lesions characteristically occurred early in the season whereas streptococcal or mixed lesions had later peaks.serial observations on 74 lesions revealed longer persistence of streptococci than staphylococci in mixed lesions. in 85% of the instances the same streptococcal serotype was recovered repeatedly from an individual lesion, whereas staphylococcal types changed in 57% of instances. phage type 75 accounted for the majority of staphylococcal isolates from all sites, whereas phage type 54 was recovered only from skin lesions. in contrast to streptococci, the site sequence  of staphylococcal spread was from the nose to normal skin to skin lesions. these  studies reveal important differences in the migration of staphylococci (as compared with streptococci) to various body sites and suggest a subsidiary role for staphylococci in nonbullous impetiginous lesions yielding both organisms.

TI  == serum bacteriostasis of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == serum bacteriostasis of staphylococcus aureus was characterized quantitatively and quantitatively. bacteriostasis was proportional to the concentration of serum. reproducibility was good; freezing and thawing did not materially affect the end point. four of six different strains, including the propagating s. aureus strain for phage 73 which does not produce coagulase, were susceptible to serum bacteriostasis in similar titers; two were not susceptible at all. all six strains were effective inhibitors of bacteriostasis. active and inactive coagulase were also inhibitors. in contrast to sensitive s. aureus, s. epidermidis and streptococcus salivarius were not uniformly susceptible to bacteriostasis by different serums. escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella montevideo, s. zymogenes, and diplococcus pneumoniae were not susceptible. among gram-positive bacteria, only d. pneumoniae inhibited s. aureus bacteriostasis. agglutinins of s. aureus and nonspecific substances such as lysozyme, beta-lysin, c-reactive protein, and transferrin were not responsible for s. aureus serum bacteriostasis. after diethylaminoethyl column fractionation of serum, the bacteriostatic principle was eluted in proximity to blood group antibody; immunoglobulins a, g, and m appeared to be present in bacteriostatic fractions. it is suggested that s. aureus bacteriostasis by serum is due to natural antibody and that inhibitory reactions  with pneumococci and coagulase are due to common antigens.

TI  == agar medium for the selective enumeration of coagulase-positive staphylococcus from the rat alimentary tract.
AB  == a selective agar medium (medium j(1)) is proposed for the quantitative enumeration of egg yolk-positive (eyp) and egg yolk-negative (eyn) staphylococcus pyogenes from the digestive tract and feces of the rat. this medium, buffered at  ph 5.0, is composed of acid casein hydrolysate and yeast extract with 7.5% sodium chloride, 1.6% sodium pyruvate, 0.0008% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (ttc), and 6% egg yolk emulsion. inoculation is by the pour-plate method and incubation is at 38 c in a water-jacketed incubator for 36 hr. colonies of s. pyogenes reduce ttc; eyp strains are surrounded by a halo of opacity; and eyn strains may be surrounded by a red halo, but no opacity. small, white colonies of s. epidermidis may develop, but micrococcus, and all other groups of staphylococcus recognized in the rat intestinal flora, are inhibited. other bacterial genera, notably bacillus, corynebacterium, proteus, and streptococcus,  are also inhibited.

TI  == in vivo and in vitro action of norethindrone on staphylococci.
AB  == norethindrone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. turbidimetric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of norethindrone. the organisms tested included staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus conglomeratus, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus  faecalis, salmonella typhosa, shigella flexnerii, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus vulgaris. bacteriostatic action was shown only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown anaerobically in tryptic soy broth containing 10 to 50 mug of norethindrone per ml. the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation and it was reduced by the presence of oxygen. mestranol at a concentration of 1 to 10 mug/ml failed to exert any significant action on s. aureus. however, incorporation of 5 mug of mestranol per ml in the culture medium enhanced the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone on staphylococci. enhancement of the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone could not be obtained by the addition of a concentration of 5 mug/ml of testosterone, 17alpha-estradiol, and 17beta-estradiol. progesterone and 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one under similar conditions showed an additive bacteriostatic effect when they were incorporated into the culture medium containing norethindrone. in vivo studies indicated that  female, adult new zealand rabbits, injected subcutaneously with two injections of 10 to 20 mug of norethindrone, 24 hr apart, and challenged intradermally with s.  aureus 4 hr after the second injection, had fewer lesions with smaller areas of swelling and erythema as compared to control, nontreated rabbits. the protective  effect of norethindrone on the development of staphylococcal lesion seemed related to hormone concentration. thus, it was demonstrated with doses of 20, 15, and 10 mug, but not with doses of 1 and 5 mug. when the lesions were excised 48 to 92 hr after infection and when viable cell counts were made, rabbits treated with norethindrone showed significantly lower staphylococcal counts than the control rabbits. during the 1st day after infection with s. aureus, leukocytic counts of the norethindrone-treated rabbits remained normal, whereas control animals showed elevated leukocytic counts.
