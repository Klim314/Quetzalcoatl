TI  == [influence of bifidobacteria on antilysozyme activity of microorganisms and their ability to form biofilms].
AB  == aim: to assess influence of bifidobacteria's exometabolites on expression of antilysozyme activity of microflora and its ability to biofilm formation. materials and methods: six strains of bifidobacteria belonging to b. longum, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis as well as 42 strains of opportunistic microorganisms belonging to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, and rhodotorula rubra isolated  by conventional methods during assessment of intestinal microbiocenosis in humans. in order to study the influence of bifidoflora's exometabolites on associative flora, obtained filtrates were mixed with nutrient broth in 1:10 ratio with subsequent introduction of pure culture of opportunistic microorganism. nutritional broth was used instead of filtrates of bifidobacteria  for obtaining the control samples. formation of biofilms was determined on the ability of strains of microorganisms to adhere on the surface of 96-well polystyrene plate, whereas the antilysozyme activity was studied by photometric method. results: performed studies revealed multidirectional but mostly inhibiting effect of bifidobacteria's metabolites on antilysozyme activity of opportunistic microorganisms and their ability to form biofilms. changes of these characteristics was observed both in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria as  well as in yeast fungi and depended from species of bifidobacteria and associative opportunistic microflora. conclusion: obtained data open perspective  for search of control on infectious process on the basis of modification of persistence characteristics of associative pathogens and their ability to form biofilms in host's biotope.

TI  == effect of ph on an in vitro model of gastric microbiota in enteral nutrition patients.
AB  == patients with dysphagia due to oropharyngeal disease or cerebrovascular accident  require long-term nutritional support via enteral feeding, which often results in microbial overgrowth in the upper gastrointestinal (gi) tract. gastric acid is the primary innate defense mechanism in the stomach and has been assumed to provide an effective barrier to microbial colonization at ph values of <4. to evaluate the efficacy of gastric acid as a barrier to overgrowth, the microbiota  of gastric and duodenal aspirates was assessed by culturing methods. additionally, a fermentor-based model incorporating enteral nutrition tubing of the gastric microbiota of enteral nutrition (en) patients was constructed to assess the effect of ph on the microbiota. results showed that gastric acidity had a relatively small effect on the numbers of microorganisms recovered from intestinal aspirates but did influence microbiota composition. similarly, at ph 3 in the fermentor, a complex microbiota developed in the planktonic phase and in biofilms. the effect of ph on microbiota composition was similar in aspirates and in the fermentors. candidas and lactobacilli were aciduric, while recoveries of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae decreased as ph was reduced, although  both were still present in significant numbers at ph 3. only staphylococcus aureus and bifidobacterium adolescentis persisted at higher ph values both in vitro and in vivo. lactate and acetate were the main organic acids detected in both aspirates and fermentors. these data show that the simulator used in this investigation was capable of modeling the effects of environmental influences on  the upper gi microbiota of en patients and that gastric ph of <4 is not sufficient to prevent microbial overgrowth in these individuals.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the bifidobacterium longum mb 219 lacz gene.
AB  == the gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of escherichia coli from bifidobacterium longum mb219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten bifidobacterium strains tested of the species b. longum, b. breve, b. adolescentis, b. indicum, b. animalis and b. cuniculi. the nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to e. coli revealed the presence of a lacz-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site.  a sequence showing 72% identity with the proline trna of bacillus subtilis and a  gene probably encoding the dna-3-methyladenine glycosydase i were located downstream from the lacz gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. by primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacz gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the  -10 region of the putative promoter. the nucleotide sequence of lacz and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes  and enzymes from other microorganisms. high similarity was demonstrated between the b. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, e. coli, clostridium acetobutylicum, leuconostoc lactis, klebsiella pneumoniae and kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the lacz family. the b. longum mb219 lacz gene was cloned in bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. the expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.

TI  == [the effect of phospholipids on the adhesive properties of bacteria].
AB  == the present work shows that choline-containing phospholipids (lysophosphatidylcholine and lyso-1-alkyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine) inhibit the adhesion of some strains: bacterium bifidum 1, b. adolescentis mc-42, b. longum b. 379m, staphylococcus aureus p 209 and klebsiella pneumoniae 52. phosphatidylcholine produces no effect on the adhesiveness of these strains, while platelet activation factor stimulates adhesiveness only in strain s. aureus 209. the stimulating or inhibiting action of phospholipids on the adhesive process of microorganisms depends on the species of bacteria and on the concentration of reagents.

TI  == the role of escherichia coli haemolysin in the pathogenic synergy of colonic bacteria in subcutaneous abscess formation in mice.
AB  == the growth of nine species of colonic bacteria--escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides ovatus, fusobacterium varium, clostridium perfringens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus and bifidobacterium adolescentis--was examined after concomitant injection to form experimental subcutaneous abscesses in mice. injection of a mixture of c. 10(5) cfu of each of the first five strains (e. coli, ent. faecalis, b. ovatis, f. varium and c. perfringens) resulted in abscess formation in all mice tested when  the e. coli strain was haemolytic. e. coli and b. ovatus multiplied and reached a maximum population of c. 10(8) cfu/abscess. when non-haemolytic e. coli was used, injection of greater than or equal to 10(7) cfu was required for abscess formation. the inclusion of partially purified e. coli haemolysin (125 hu50) with c. 10(5) cfu of bacteria including non-haemolytic e. coli resulted in abscess formation in most mice tested. these results indicate that e. coli haemolysin is  one factor that may potentiate pathogenic synergy among colonic bacteria especially between e. coli and b. ovatus, during abscess formation.
