TI  == [epiglottitis with an abscess caused by haemophilus parainfluenzae.]
AB  == a healthy 23-year-old man was admitted under the diagnosis of acute epiglottitis. flexible fiber laryngoscopic examination showed a swollen epiglottis with an abscess. microbiologic swab showed haemophilus parainfluenzae, non-haemolytic streptococcus and non-haemolytic streptococcus salivarius. only in 1984 a case of acute epiglottitis due to h. parainfluenzae has been described in the literature. still, in this case we think that h. parainfluenzae was the most likely pathogen  causing the abscess.

TI  == reduction of periodontal pathogens adhesion by antagonistic strains.
AB  == introduction: periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. in many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. an alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. methods: streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus crista, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces naeslundii, and haemophilus parainfluenzae were  evaluated as potential antagonists against p. gingivalis atcc 33277, p. intermedia atcc 49046, and a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718 as periodontopathogens. adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. results: the largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for p. gingivalis.  all antagonistic strains except s. crista atcc 49999 inhibited the adhesion of p. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for a. naeslundii atcc 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718. intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for p. intermedia, most notably caused by s. mitis bms. conclusion: the adhesion of p. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while s. mitis bms appeared to be the most successful antagonist.

TI  == microorganisms on toothbrushes at day-care centers.
AB  == the microflora on 44 toothbrushes at 4 day-care centers in the city of goteborg have been investigated as a presumptive risk factor for transmission of microorganisms by children. non-supervised toothbrushing without the use of toothpaste was performed at the day-care centers twice a day. streptococci, predominantly s. salivarius, s. sanguis, and s. mitis, were the most frequently recorded group of microorganisms and generally constituted the greatest part of the flora (on average, 50%). beta-hemolytic streptococci were not found in any sample. haemophilus species were noted in 82% of the samples. h. parainfluenzae being the most frequent, and h. influenzae being identified in only one sample. anaerobes constituted on average a third of the microflora. staphylococci were identified in 86% of the samples, s. epidermidis dominating. fungi including molds were found in 50% of the samples, and from one day-care center large numbers of enteric organisms were identified. thus this study shows that unsupervised toothbrushing at day-care centers can be questioned, more from a general hygienic point of view than from the risk of transmitting serious pathogens.
