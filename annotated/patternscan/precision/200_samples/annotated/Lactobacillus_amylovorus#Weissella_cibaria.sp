TI == superior prebiotic and physicochemical properties of novel dextran from weissella cibaria jag8 for potential food applications.
AB == the dextran produced by dextransucrase from weissella cibaria jag8 was subjected  to physicochemical characterization and assessment of its prebiotic potential. dextran displayed a solubility of 24.5% and a water holding capacity of 352%. the emulsion and flocculation activity of dextran were 89% and 92%, respectively. the degradation temperature (td) of dextran was 353 degrees c. dextran exhibited 33- and 12-fold less hydrolysis than inulin, in simulated gastric juice (ph 1.0) and alpha-amylase (ph 7.0), respectively. dextran stimulated the growth of probiotic bacteria such as bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis, bifidobacterium infantis and lactobacillus acidophilus significantly and was comparable to that of commercial inulin. however, the growth of e. coli was not enhanced by dextran or inulin. the dextran used in this study can be used as a potential prebiotic for health benefits.

TI == stress response of some lactic acid bacteria isolated from romanian artisan dairy products.
AB == understanding the mechanisms of stress response and adaptation to stress in the case of lactic acid bacteria (lab), especially in the case of strains with functional properties, is very important when such strains are potential candidates for starter cultures or probiotics. in this context, our study shows the response of some lab [four exopolysaccharide (eps)-producing strains and one strain with potential probiotic effect] to the stresses induced by low and high incubation temperatures, acidity, nacl, and bile salts, often encountered during the technological processes in food or during the passage through the human gastro-intestinal tract. the strains were able to grow at temperatures up to 40 degrees c (the mesophilic strains) and 47 degrees c (the thermophilic strain), in medium with an initial ph of at least 4.0 (lactobacillus acidophilus ibb801), or in the presence of nacl up to 10% (weissella confusa/cibaria 38.2), or bile salts up to 0.2% (l. acidophilus ibb801). the protein and isoenzyme patterns of the strains subjected to various stress conditions presented several differences compared with the control patterns, among which the overexpression of some proteins of about 50-60 kda, differences in the bands intensity in the case of the intracellular enzymes, or the complete loss of some of these bands. the best survival to low ph values and high temperatures was observed for strain l. acidophilus ibb801, the candidate probiotic strain. the eps production of the four tested strains was, in general, directly related to the growth, the highest yields being obtained when strains were incubated at 24 degrees c.

TI == sequence analysis of a cryptic plasmid pkw2124 from weissella cibaria klc140 and  construction of a surface display vector.
AB == plasmid isolation of kimchi-derived weissella cibaria klc140 revealed six different plasmids. the smallest plasmid, pkw2124, was dna sequenced and characterized, showing 2,124 bp with a gc content of 36.39% and five putative open reading frames (orfs). in silico analysis of these orfs showed orf1 encodes a putative replication protein similar to rolling circular replication proteins from other lactic acid bacteria. however, a single-stranded intermediate was not detected when s1 nuclease was treated, suggesting it may follow theta replication. interestingly, the replication initiation site of this plasmid is 100% identical to other plasmids from lactic acid bacteria, suggesting it may function for replication initiation. to construct a surface layer expression vector, ptslgfp, slpa encoding the surface layer protein from lactobacillus acidophilus was pcr amplified and fused with the gfp gene, forming a slgfp fused gene. the plasmid pkw2124 was cloned into the xbai site of puc19, forming an weissella-e. coli shuttle vector pkuw22. nhei-linearized ptslgfp was ligated into pkuwcat containing pkuw22 and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene from pek104, resulting in an 8.6 kb pkwcslgfp surface layer expression vector. after transformation of this vector into w. cibaria klc140, a gfp fluorescence signal was detected on the surface of the transformant, substantiating production of slgfp fused protein and its secretion. this is the first report for construction of a weissella surface layer expression vector, which may be useful for surface layer production of beneficial proteins in weissella.

TI == increased dietary zinc oxide changes the bacterial core and enterobacterial composition in the ileum of piglets.
AB == this study was conducted to investigate the effects of increased dietary zno on the bacterial core and enterobacterial composition in the small intestine of piglets that were fed diets containing a total of 124 or 3,042 mg of zn per kilogram of diet, respectively. zinc was supplemented to the basal diet as zno. bacterial 16s rrna genes of ileal dna extracts were pcr-amplified with 2 bar-coded primer sets and sequenced by 454 pyrosequencing. the bacterial core species were calculated from the relative abundances of reads present in 5 of 6 samples per group and at a minimum of 5 sequences per sample. the reference database silva was used to assign sequence reads at an alignment minimum of 200 bases and 100% identity. lactic acid bacteria dominated the bacterial core, but showed diverse responses to dietary zno. of the dominant lactobacillus spp., lactobacillus reuteri was reduced due to increased dietary zno (44.7 vs. 17.9%; p=0.042), but l. amylovorus was not influenced. however, the changes of relative abundances of other lactic acid bacteria were more noteworthy; weissella cibaria (10.7 vs. 23.0%; p=0.006), w. confusa (10.0 vs. 22.4%; p=0.037), leuconostoc citreum (6.5 vs. 14.8%; p=0.009), streptococcus equinus (0.14 vs. 1.0%; p=0.044), and s. lutetiensis (0.01 vs. 0.11%; p=0.016) increased in relative abundance. nonlactic acid bacteria that were influenced by increased dietary zno included the strict anaerobic species, sarcina ventriculi, which showed a strong numerical decrease in relative abundance (14.6 vs. 5.1%). species of the enterobacteriaceae increased their relative abundance, as well as species diversity, in the high dietary zno experimental group. bacterial diversity indices were increased due to increased dietary zno (p < 0.05), which was traced back to the increase of sequences from subdominant species. increased dietary zno led to an increase of less prominent species and, thus, had a major impact on the bacterial composition and diversity in piglets. this effect may help to stabilize the intestinal microbiota in the sensitive postweaning period.

TI == analysis of vaginal lactic acid producing bacteria in healthy women.
AB == vaginal lactic acid-producing bacteria of 80 pre-menopausal women were studied by isolation on blood and deman-rogosa-sharpe agar, pcr with group-specific primers for lactobacillus-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), and pcr with specific primers for v3 region in 16s rrna-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (ttge). conventional isolation method on media detected only one lactobacillus (lactobacillus brevis) while ttge detected only lactobacillus sp. dgge detected seven lactobacillus species; l. coleohominis, l. crispatus, l. iners, l. reuteri, l. rhamnosus, l. vaginalis, and leuconostoc lactis. l. acidophilus and l. gasseri, which are prevalent in western women, were not detected in korean women. furthermore, l. rhamnosus, leuc. lactis, l. coleohominis, and weissella cibaria, which were not previously reported in the vaginal microbiota of korean women, were detected. the five most prevalent labs in vaginal microbiota in korean women were l. iners, enterococcus faecalis, l. crispatus, leuc. lactis, and w. cibaria.
