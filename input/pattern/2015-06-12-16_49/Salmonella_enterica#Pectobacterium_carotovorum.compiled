TI  - A sequence-based approach for prediction of CsrA/RsmA targets in bacteria with experimental validation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - CsrA/RsmA homologs are an extensive family of ribonucleic acid (RNA)-binding proteins that function as global post-transcriptional regulators controlling important cellular processes such as secondary metabolism, motility, biofilm formation and the production and secretion of virulence factors in diverse bacterial species. While direct messenger RNA binding by CsrA/RsmA has been studied in detail for some genes, it is anticipated that there are numerous additional, as yet undiscovered, direct targets that mediate its global regulation. To assist in the discovery of these targets, we propose a sequence-based approach to predict genes directly regulated by these regulators. In this work, we develop a computer code (CSRA_TARGET) implementing this approach, which leads to predictions for several novel targets in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The predicted targets in other bacteria, specifically Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Pectobacterium carotovorum and Legionella pneumophila, also include global regulators that control virulence in these pathogens, unraveling intricate indirect regulatory roles for CsrA/RsmA. We have experimentally validated four predicted RsmA targets in P. aeruginosa. The sequence-based approach developed in this work can thus lead to several testable predictions for direct targets of CsrA homologs, thereby complementing and accelerating efforts to unravel global regulation by this important family of proteins.
TI  - Effects of pesticides on the reduction of plant and human pathogenic bacteria in  application water.
AB  - Overhead spray applications of in-field tomato treatments dissolved in aqueous solutions have specific pest targets (fungal, bacterial, insect, or other). Any organism present in the solution or on treated plant surfaces that is not a specific target of the application is unlikely inactivated and can instead be spread through the phyllosphere. In this laboratory study, commercially labeled pesticides (including Actigard 50WG, Bravo Weather Stik 6F, Cabrio 20EG, Kasumin, Kocide 3000 46WG, Oxidate 27L, Penncozeb 75DF, ProPhyt 54.5L, Stimplex 100L, Firewall, 22.4WP, and Tanos 50DF) in common use in commercial tomato production fields of the Eastern Shore of Virginia were investigated for activity against in vitro bacterial contamination of pesticide application waters. Pesticides of interest were tank mixed individually with one of the plant pathogens Ralstonia solanacearum, Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, or one of two serovars (Newport and Montevideo) of the human pathogen Salmonella enterica to assess reduction values during the average time between mixing and initial application. Observations suggested that while some treatments had a noticeable effect on population levels, only the oxidizer, peroxyacetic acid, showed significant and consistent levels of suppression against all bacteria investigated, at levels that could have practical implications.
TI  - Salmonella enterica suppresses Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum population and soft rot progression by acidifying the microaerophilic environment.
AB  - Although enteric human pathogens are usually studied in the context of their animal hosts, a significant portion of their life cycle occurs on plants. Plant disease alters the phyllosphere, leading to enhanced growth of human pathogens; however, the impact of human pathogens on phytopathogen biology and plant health is largely unknown. To characterize the interaction between human pathogens and phytobacterial pathogens in the phyllosphere, we examined the interactions between Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and Salmonella enterica or Escherichia coli O157:H7 with regard to bacterial populations, soft rot progression, and changes in local pH. The presence of P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum enhanced the growth of both S. enterica and E. coli O157:H7 on leaves. However, in a microaerophilic environment, S. enterica reduced P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum populations and soft rot progression by moderating local environmental pH. Reduced soft rot was not due to S. enterica proteolytic activity. Limitations on P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum growth, disease progression, and pH elevation were not observed on leaves coinoculated with E. coli O157:H7 or when leaves were coinoculated with S. enterica in an aerobic environment. S. enterica also severely undermined the relationship between the phytobacterial population and disease progression of a P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum budB mutant defective in the 2,3-butanediol pathway for acid neutralization. Our results show that S. enterica and E. coli O157:H7 interact differently with the enteric phytobacterial pathogen P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum. S. enterica inhibition of soft rot progression may conceal a rapidly growing human pathogen population. Whereas soft rotted produce can alert consumers to the possibility of food-borne pathogens, healthy-looking produce may entice consumption of contaminated vegetables. IMPORTANCE: Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli O157:H7 may use plants to move between animal and human hosts. Their populations are higher on plants cocolonized with the common bacterial soft rot pathogen Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, turning edible plants into a risk factor for human disease. We inoculated leaves with P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and S. enterica or E. coli O157:H7 to study the interactions between these bacteria. While P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum enhanced the growth of both S. enterica and E. coli O157:H7, these human pathogens affected P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum fundamentally differently. S. enterica reduced P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum growth and acidified the environment, leading to less soft rot on leaves; E. coli O157:H7 had no such effects. As soft rot signals a food safety risk, the reduction of soft rot symptoms in the presence of S. enterica may lead consumers to eat healthy-looking but S. enterica-contaminated produce.
TI  - Biophysical investigations into the interactions of endotoxins with bile acids.
AB  - The interaction of selected endotoxin preparations (lipid A from Erwinia carotovora and LPS Re and Ra from Salmonella enterica sv. Minnesota strains R595 and R60, respectively) with selected bile acids was investigated biophysically. Endotoxin aggregates were analyzed for their gel-to-liquid crystalline phase behavior, the type of their aggregates, the conformation of particular functional groups, and their Zeta potential in the absence and presence of the bile acids by applying Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, measurements of the electrophoretic mobility, and synchrotron radiation X-ray scattering. In addition, the ability of the endotoxins to induce cytokines in human mononuclear cells was tested in the absence and presence of varying concentrations of bile acids. The data show that the endotoxin:bile acid interaction is not governed by Coulomb forces, rather a hydrophobic interaction takes place. This leads to an enhanced formation of the inherent cubic aggregate structures of the endotoxins, concomitant with a slight disaggregation, as evidenced by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Parallel to this, the addition of bile acids increased the bioactivity of lipid A and, to a lower degree, also that of the tested rough mutant LPS at lower concentrations of the endotoxin preparation, a finding similar as reported for the interaction of other agents such as hemoglobin. These data imply that there are general mechanisms that govern the expression of biological activities of endotoxins.
TI  - CorA, the magnesium/nickel/cobalt transporter, affects virulence and extracellular enzyme production in the soft rot pathogen Pectobacterium carotovorum.
AB  - Pectobacterium carotovorum (formerly Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora) is a phytopathogenic bacterium that causes soft rot disease, characterized by water-soaked soft decay, resulting from the action of cell wall-degrading exoenzymes secreted by the pathogen. Virulence in soft rot bacteria is regulated by environmental factors, host and bacterial chemical signals, and a network of global and gene-specific bacterial regulators. We isolated a mini-Tn5 mutant of P. carotovorum that is reduced in the production of extracellular pectate lyase, protease, polygalacturonase and cellulase. The mutant is also decreased in virulence as it macerates less host tissues than its parent and is severely impaired in multiplication in planta. The inactivated gene responsible for the reduced virulent phenotype was identified as corA. CorA, a magnesium/nickel/cobalt membrane transporter, is the primary magnesium transporter for many bacteria. Compared with the parent, the CorA(-) mutant is cobalt resistant. The mutant phenotype was confirmed in parental strain P. carotovorum by marker exchange inactivation of corA. A functional corA(+) DNA from P. carotovorum restored exoenzyme production and pathogenicity to the mutants. The P. carotovorum corA(+) clone also restored motility and cobalt sensitivity to a CorA(-) mutant of Salmonella enterica. These data indicate that CorA is required for exoenzyme production and virulence in P. carotovorum.
TI  - Salmonella SdiA recognizes N-acyl homoserine lactone signals from Pectobacterium  carotovorum in vitro, but not in a bacterial soft rot.
AB  - Genomes of Salmonella enterica isolates, including those linked to outbreaks of produce-associated gastroenteritis, contain sdiA, which encodes a receptor of N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHL). AHL are the quorum-sensing signals used by bacteria to coordinately regulate gene expression within -their populations. Because S. enterica does not produce its own AHL, SdiA is hypothesized to function in the interspecies cross-talk with AHL-producing bacteria. Under laboratory conditions, S. enterica responded to AHL from phytobacteria by upregulating expression of srgE. AHL-dependent expression of srgE required a functional sdiA. Essentially, no sdiA-dependent resolution of the srgE recombinase-based (RIVET) reporter was observed inside a soft rot formed on a tomato by an AHL-producing strain of Pectobacterium carotovorum. The results of the control experiments suggest that sdiA is not expressed inside tomato, pepper, green onion, or carrot affected by the soft rot, and the lack of sdiA expression in planta prevents Salmonella spp. from responding to AHL. Despite its inability to detect and respond to AHL during colonization of soft rots, S. enterica reached higher final cell numbers inside a tomato soft rot compared with its growth in intact tomato fruit. The synergistic effect was the strongest under the conditions that are typical for the Florida fall/winter production season.
TI  - Control of foodborne pathogens and soft-rot bacteria on bell pepper by three strains of bacterial antagonists.
AB  - Forty-two representative strains of native bacteria associated with fresh peeled  baby carrots were isolated and characterized. Two of these strains, identified as Pseudomonas fluorescens AG3A (Pf AG3A) and Bacillus YD1, were evaluated in conjunction with another known antagonist, P. fluorescens 2-79 (Pf 2-79), for their potential as biocontrol agents of human pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella enterica, and Escherichia coli O157:H7) and soft-rot bacteria (Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, Pseudomonas marginalis, and Pseudomonas viridiflava). When grown on iron-deficient agar media, all three antagonists produced inhibition zones up to 25 mm in diameter against the growth of human pathogens and soft-rot bacteria. However, when grown on iron-rich agar media, only Pf 2-79 and Bacillus YD1 exhibited antimicrobial activity. Treatment of bell pepper disks with Pf 2-79 or Bacillus YD1 reduced the growth of pathogen by 1.4 to 4.1 log units, depending upon the ratio of the number of antagonist cells to pathogen cells (1:1, 10:1, 100:1, or 1,000:1). The greatest reduction was observed when 10- to 100-fold higher number of antagonists than pathogens was applied. Pf AG3A and Bacillus YD1 reduced the growth of pathogens on pepper disks at 20 degrees C but not at 10 degrees C. However, Pf 2-79 reduced the growth of L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica by up to 4 log units at either 20 or 10 degrees C. Treatment of pepper disks with Pf 2-79 also reduced the incidence of soft rot induced by soft-rot bacteria by 40 to 70%. Pf 2-79 is the most effective of the three antagonists tested for control of spoilage bacteria and human pathogens on bell pepper.
TI  - Using aqueous chlorine dioxide to prevent contamination of tomatoes with Salmonella enterica and erwinia carotovora during fruit washing.
AB  - Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) is an antimicrobial agent recognized for its disinfectant properties. In this study, the sanitizing effects of ClO2 solutions against Salmonella enterica and Erwinia carotovora in water, on tomato surfaces, and between loads of tomatoes were evaluated. In water, ClO2 at 5, 10, and 20 ppm caused a > or = 5-log reduction of S. enterica within 6, 4, and 2 s, respectively. Higher lethality was observed with E. carotovora; a 5-log reduction was achieved after only 2 s with 10 ppm ClO2. On fruit surfaces, however, the sanitizing effects were compromised. A full minute of contact with ClO2 at 20 and 10 ppm was required to achieve a 5-log reduction in S. enterica and E. carotovora counts, respectively, on freshly spot-inoculated tomatoes. On inoculated fruit surfaces, populations decreased > 3 log CFU/cm2 during desiccation at 24 +/- 1 degrees C for 24 h. Populations of air-dried Salmonella and Erwinia were not significantly reduced (P > 0.05) by ClO2 at < or = 20 ppm after 1 min. Either wet or dry inoculum of these two pathogens could contaminate immersion water, which in turn can cross-contaminate a subsequent load of clean fruit and water. ClO2 at 5 ppm used for immersion effectively prevented cross-contamination. Pathogen contamination during fruit handling is best prevented with an effective disinfectant. Once a load of fruit is contaminated with pathogens, even a proven disinfectant such as ClO2 cannot completely eliminate such contaminants, particularly when they are in a dehydrated state on fruit.
TI  - Nucleotide sequences and organization of the genes for carotovoricin (Ctv) from Erwinia carotovora indicate that Ctv evolved from the same ancestor as Salmonella typhi prophage.
AB  - Carotovoricin Er (CtvEr), which is produced by a plant soft rot disease causative agent, Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora Er, is a high-molecular-weight bacteriocin showing Myoviridae phage-tail-like morphology with contractile sheath and plural tail fibers. We determined the complete nucleotide sequences of CtvEr genes on the E. carotovora Er chromosome and report that CtvEr genes consist of lysis cassette, major and minor structural protein gene clusters. Four promoters were identified. The lysis gene cassette, which is composed of the genes for lysis enzyme and holin, was also identified and characterized. The nucleotide sequences and organization of the genes for CtvCGE, which is produced by E. carotovora strain CGE234-M403 with the morphology similar to CtvEr, were also determined and compared to that of CtvEr, and it was found that CtvCGE is almost identical to CtvEr except for tail fibers which are involved in the killing spectra of both bacteriocins. We also explain that the gene organization and the deduced amino acid sequences of both carotovoricins are very close to those of prophage, which is lysogenized in the chromosome on Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi CT18. These findings strongly suggest that Ctv evolved as a phage tail-like bacteriocin from a common ancestor with Salmonella typhi prophage.
TI  - Direct visualization of red fluorescent lipoproteins indicates conservation of the membrane sorting rules in the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Chimeras created by fusing the monomeric red fluorescent protein (RFP) to a bacterial lipoprotein signal peptide (lipoRFPs) were visualized in the cell envelope by epifluorescence microscopy. Plasmolysis of the bacteria separated the inner and outer membranes, allowing the specific subcellular localization of lipoRFPs to be determined in situ. When equipped with the canonical inner membrane lipoprotein retention signal CDSR, lipoRFP was located in the inner membrane in Escherichia coli, whereas the outer membrane sorting signal CSSR caused lipoRFP to localize to the outer membrane. CFSR-RFP was also routed to the outer membrane, but CFNSR-RFP was located in the inner membrane, consistent with previous data showing that this sequence functions as an inner membrane retention signal. These four lipoproteins exhibited identical localization patterns in a panel of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, showing that the lipoprotein sorting rules are conserved in these bacteria and validating the use of E. coli as a model system. Although most predicted inner membrane lipoproteins in these bacteria have an aspartate residue after the fatty acylated N-terminal cysteine residue, alternative signals such as CFN can and probably do function in parallel, as indicated by the existence of putative inner membrane lipoproteins with this sequence at their N termini.
TI  - Comparative genomics of the KdgR regulon in Erwinia chrysanthemi 3937 and other gamma-proteobacteria.
AB  - In the plant-pathogenic enterobacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi, almost all known genes involved in pectin catabolism are controlled by the transcriptional regulator KdgR. In this study, the comparative genomics approach was used to analyse the KdgR regulon in completely sequenced genomes of eight enterobacteria, including Erw. chrysanthemi, and two Vibrio species. Application of a signal recognition procedure complemented by operon structure and protein sequence analysis allowed identification of new candidate genes of the KdgR regulon. Most of these genes were found to be controlled by the cAMP-receptor protein, a global regulator of catabolic genes. At the next step, regulation of these genes in Erw. chrysanthemi was experimentally verified using in vivo transcriptional fusions and an attempt was made to clarify the functional role of the predicted genes in pectin catabolism. Interestingly, it was found that the KdgR protein, previously known as a repressor, positively regulates expression of two new members of the regulon, phosphoenolpyruvate synthase gene ppsA and an adjacent gene, ydiA, of unknown function. Other predicted regulon members, namely chmX, dhfX, gntB, pykF, spiX, sotA, tpfX, yeeO and yjgK, were found to be subject to classical negative regulation by KdgR. Possible roles of newly identified members of the Erw. chrysanthemi KdgR regulon, chmX, dhfX, gntDBMNAC, spiX, tpfX, ydiA, yeeO, ygjV and yjgK, in pectin catabolism are discussed. Finally, complete reconstruction of the KdgR regulons in various gamma-proteobacteria yielded a metabolic map reflecting a globally conserved pathway for the catabolism of pectin and its derivatives with variability in transport and enzymic capabilities among species. In particular, possible non-orthologous substitutes of isomerase KduI and a new oligogalacturonide transporter in the Vibrio species were detected.
TI  - A two-component regulatory system, pehR-pehS, controls endopolygalacturonase production and virulence in the plant pathogen Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora.
AB  - Genes coding for the main virulence determinants of the plant pathogen Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, the plant cell wall-degrading enzymes, are under the coordinate control of global regulator systems including both positive and negative factors. In addition to this global control, some virulence determinants are subject to specific regulation. We have previously shown that mutations in the pehR locus result in reduced virulence and impaired production of one of these enzymes, an endopolygalacturonase (PehA). In contrast, these pehR strains produce essentially wild-type levels of other extracellular enzymes including pectate lyases and cellulases. In this work, we characterized the pehR locus and showed that the DNA sequence is composed of two genes, designated pehR and pehS, present in an operon. Mutations in either pehR or pehS caused a Peh-negative phenotype and resulted in reduced virulence on tobacco seedlings. Complementation experiments indicated that both genes are required for transcriptional activation of the endopolygalacturonase gene, pehA, as well as restoration of virulence. Structural characterization of the pehR-pehS operon demonstrated that the corresponding polypeptides are highly similar to the two-component transcriptional regulators PhoP-PhoQ of both Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Functional similarity of PehR-PehS with PhoP-PhoQ of E. coli and S. typhimurium was demonstrated by genetic complementation.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis and comparison of the lexA genes from Salmonella typhimurium, Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of the lexA genes from Salmonella typhimurium,  Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida were determined; the DNA sequences of the lexA genes from these bacteria were 86%, 76%, 61% and 59% similar, respectively, to the Escherichia coli K12 gene. The predicted amino acid sequences of the S. typhimurium, E. carotovora and P. putida LexA proteins are 202 residues long whereas that of P. aeruginosa is 204. Two putative LexA repressor binding sites were localized upstream of each of the heterologous genes, the distance between them being 5 bp in S. typhimurium and E. carotovora, as in the lexA gene of E. coli, and 3 bp in P. putida and P. aeruginosa. The first lexA site present in the lexA operator of all five bacteria is very well conserved. However, the second lexA box is considerably more variable. The Ala-84--Gly-85 bond, at which the LexA repressor of E. coli is cleaved during the induction of the SOS response, is also found in the LexA proteins of S. typhimurium and E. carotovora. Likewise, the amino acids Ser-119 and Lys-156 are present in all of these three LexA repressors. These residues also exist in the LexA proteins of P. putida and P. aeruginosa, but they are displaced by 4 and 6 residues, respectively. Furthermore, the structure and sequence of the DNA-binding domain of the LexA repressor of E. coli are highly conserved in the S. typhimurium, E. carotovora, P. aeruginosa and P. putida LexA proteins.
