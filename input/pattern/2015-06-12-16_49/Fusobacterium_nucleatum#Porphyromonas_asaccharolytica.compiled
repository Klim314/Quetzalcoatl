TI  - Susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, Resilon/RealSeal (RS). To determine if RS is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show RS degradation. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Emulsions of RS were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. Lipase PS served as a positive control. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade RS. The bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for RS degradation for 7 days. RESULTS: Degradation of the emulsified RS manifested in the formation of clear zones around P aeruginosa, P intermedia, P asaccharolytica, S aureus, and S epidermidis. No degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain RS emulsion. CONCLUSION: Endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade RS. These findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with RS may be impaired by a microbial insult.
TI  - Distinct polymicrobial populations in a chronic foot ulcer with implications for  diagnostics and anti-infective therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Polymicrobial infections caused by combinations of different bacteria are being detected with an increasing frequency. The evidence of such complex infections is being revealed through the use of novel molecular and culture-independent methods. Considerable progress has been made in the last decade regarding the diagnostic application of such molecular techniques. In particular, 16S rDNA-based sequencing and even metagenomic analyses have been successfully used to study the microbial diversity in ecosystems and human microbiota. Here, we utilized denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) as a diagnostic tool for identifying different bacterial species in complex clinical samples of a patient with a chronic foot ulcer. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old female suffered from a chronic 5x5cm large plantar ulcer located in the posterior calcaneal area with subcutaneous tissue infection and osteomyelitis. The chronic ulcer developed over a period of 8 years. Culture and DHPLC revealed a distinct and location-dependent polymicrobial infection of the ulcer. The analysis of a superficial biopsy revealed a mixture of Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, whereas the tissue-deep biopsy harbored a mixture of four different bacterial species, namely Gemella morbillorum, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides fragilis, and Arcanobacterium haemolyticum. CONCLUSIONS: This clinical case highlights the difficulties in assessing polymicrobial infections where a mixture of fastidious, rapid and slow growing bacteria as well as anaerobes exists as structured communities within the tissue architecture of chronic wound infections. The diagnosis of this multilayered polymicrobial infection led to a microbe-adapted antibiotic therapy, targeting the polymicrobial nature of this infection in addition to a standard local wound treatment. However, a complete wound closure could not be achieved due to the long-lasting extensive destruction of tissue.
TI  - Development of quantitative real-time PCR primers for detecting 42 oral bacterial species.
AB  - In this study, we introduced species-specific quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) primers designed based on a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase beta-subunit gene (rpoB) for detecting 42 oral bacterial species. The specificity of the qPCR primers was confirmed by conventional PCR with the genomic DNAs of 73-79 strains regarding 73-75 bacterial species including the type strain for the target species. The standard curves revealed the lower detection limits of 42 bacterial species-specific qPCR primers ranged from 4 to 40 fg below a cycle threshold (C T) value of 35, except Atopobium rimae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Neisseria meningitidis, and Porphyromonas asaccharolytica which were 400 fg. These results suggest that 42 bacterial species-specific qPCR primers are suitable for applications in epidemiological studies related to oral infectious diseases such as periodontal diseases, endodontic infection, and dental caries.
TI  - Evaluation of the Rapid ID 32A system for identification of anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, excluding the Bacteroides fragilis group.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the Rapid ID 32A system (bioMerieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) for the identification of anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, excluding the Bacteroides fragilis group. METHODS: Five hundred and twenty-eight identified clinical isolates of non-B. fragilis group anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli were tested in the Rapid ID 32A system, and identifications were compared with those obtained with conventional biochemical tests and gas-liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The Rapid ID 32A system correctly identified 280 (60.9%) of the 460 isolates tested for which taxa were included in the database, without the need for additional testing. A further 97 (21.1%) isolates were correctly identified to species level following the performance of complementary tests recommended by the manufacturer. Fifty-nine (12.8%) isolates were identified at the genus level only, and 21 (4.6%) were misidentified at the species level. Three isolates of Prevotella were not identified by the system. Of the 68 isolates belonging to taxa not included in the database, no identification was obtained for 33 (48.5%), while 35 (51.5%) were misidentified. CONCLUSIONS: The Rapid ID 32A system provided a rapid and reliable method for the identification of non-B. fragilis group, anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli to the genus level, while the success of species-level identification varied with different taxa. There was poor discrimination between Fusobacterium nucleatum and F. necrophorum, between Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and Porphyromonas endodontalis, and between Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella denticola, Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella melaninogenica and Prevotella oralis. The need to perform conventional complementary tests on 149 (32.4%) of the 460 isolates compromised the usefulness of the system for rapid species identification.
TI  - Review of the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic pathogens.
AB  - Published reports on the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805),  a new fluoronaphthyridone, against anaerobic pathogens are reviewed here. The studies used a variety of media, inocula and antimicrobial agents. Using a proposed breakpoint of 0.5 mg/L, these studies showed that gemifloxacin had generally higher potency against Gram-positive anaerobes (Clostridium perfringens, all Peptostreptococcus spp.) and fusobacteria (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium necrophorum) and moderate but variable potency against Gram-negative anaerobes. Bacteroides stercoris, Bacteroides tectum and many Bacteroides fragilis isolates were inhibited by concentrations of < or =0.5 mg/L, while the other species of the B. fragilis group required higher concentrations for inhibition. Species variability was evident: Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Porphyromonas canoris, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas macaccae, Prevotella heparinolytica and Prevotella intermedia were susceptible to 0.5 mg/L of gemifloxacin while most other Porphyromonas and Prevotella spp. were not. These data suggest that gemifloxacin may have a clinical role in the treatment of certain dental, head and neck and pleuropulmonary infections in which Gram-positive anaerobes, fusobacteria and some Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. may predominate.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin (SB 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  - Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) CFU/spot. Comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (DU-6859a), penicillin G, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) (MICs at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for Bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for Bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for Bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for Bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for Bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for Clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for Clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for Clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for Clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for Fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for Fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for Fusobacterium varium (13), 0.5 and 1; for Fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for Peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for Peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for Prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for Prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for Prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for Prevotella melaninogenica (11), 1 and 1. Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were equivalent against clostridia and P. asaccharolytica. Gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (DU 6859a) against peptostreptococci, C. perfringens, and C. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria. Sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.
TI  - Possible lethal enhancement of toxins from putative periodontopathogens by nicotine: implications for periodontal disease.
AB  - AIM: To test the hypothesis that lethal synergy in the chick embryo model may occur between nicotine and bacterial products (cell-free extracellular toxins and cell lysates) of five putative periodontopathogens. METHODS: The lethality of cell-free extracellular toxins and cell lysates of five periodontal species was assessed with or without nicotine in the chick embryo assay system. Ten putative periodontopathogens (five species) were studied: Prevotella intermedia (n = 5), Porphyromonas gingivalis (n = 1), Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (n = 1), Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 2), and Fusobacterium necrophorum (n = 1). RESULTS: Simultaneous testing of cell-free extracellular toxins from isolates W50, PS2, PS3, PS4, and PS5 and nicotine resulted in a percentage kill significantly greater than expected (Fisher's Exact test). Simultaneous testing of cell lysates from isolates W50, PS2, and PS5 and nicotine resulted in a percentage kill significantly greater than expected (Fisher's Exact test). CONCLUSIONS: Lethal synergy in the chick embryo model may occur between nicotine and toxins from putative periodontopathogens (both cell-free extracellular toxins and cell lysates). This may be an important mechanism by which smoking increases the severity of periodontal disease.
TI  - Oligonucleotide probes to the 16S ribosomal RNA: implications of sequence homology and secondary structure with particular reference to the oral species Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens.
AB  - Eight oligonucleotides based upon regions of the small subunit 16S ribosomal RNA  gene sequences were analysed against a background of their position within the molecule and their two-dimensional structure to rationalise their use in recognising Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens. The 41 clinical isolates from both oral and respiratory sites and two reference strains were subjected to DNA-DNA hybridisation and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to confirm their identity. Alignment of oligonucleotide probes designated I Bi-2 to I Bi-6 (for P. intermedia) and 2Bi-2 (for P. nigrescens) with the 16S rRNA suggested that these probes lacked specificity or were constructed from hypervariable regions. A 52-mer oligonucleotide (designated Bi) reliably detected both species. Because of the high degree of concordance between the 16S rRNAs of both species, it was necessary to vary the stringency of hybridisation conditions for detection of both species. Thus probe I Bi-I recognised P. intermedia while I Bi-I detected both P. intermedia and P. nigrescens at low stringency. However, under conditions of high stringency only P. nigrescens was recognised by probe 2Bi-I. These probes were highly specific and did not hybridise with DNA from the closely related P. corporis, nor other periodontal pathogens such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Treponema denticola and several pigmented species such as Prevotella melaninogenica, P. denticola, P. loescheii, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Py. endodontalis, Py. gingivalis, Py. levii, and Py. macacae.
TI  - Degradation of immunoglobulin G by periodontal bacteria.
AB  - Several subgingival microorganisms were tested for their ability to utilize human immunoglobulin G (IgG) as a substrate for growth. This was done using a protein-free chemically defined medium, supplemented with IgG. Stimulation of growth was observed for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella oralis, Lactobacillus catenaforme and Streptococcus intermedius. Immunoelectrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a protein assay demonstrated that P. intermedia and P. endodontalis completely degraded the protein chains of IgG. Partial breakdown of IgG was observed for P. asaccharolytica and C. ochracea, whereas P. oralis cleaved the IgG heavy chain, yielding Fc and Fab fragments. All these bacteria utilized IgG as a substrate for growth. Binding studies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, revealed complete loss of in vitro antigen-antibody binding capacity after incubation of specific IgG with P. endodontalis and partial loss of binding with P. intermedia, P. gingivalis, C. ochracea or Fusobacterium nucleatum. Degradation or inactivation of IgG by oral bacteria is thought to be important in the causation of polymicrobial infections.
TI  - The gingival immune response to periodontal pathogens in juvenile periodontitis.
AB  - A gingival explant culture system was utilized to evaluate the reactivity of local immunoglobulins produced by juvenile periodontitis tissue. Gingival explant culture supernatant fluids were screened, via a standardized dot-immunobinding assay, for antibodies reactive to: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Eubacterium nodatum and Fusobacterium nucleatum and one nonoral microorganism, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica. Of the 75 juvenile periodontitis supernatant fluids tested, the organisms that reacted with the highest numbers of supernatant fluids were E. nodatum (72%) and A. actinomycetemcomitans (49%). More juvenile periodontitis than healthy tissue samples showed supernatant fluid reactivity to P. intermedia, C. ochracea, E. nodatum and P. micros. No significant difference was observed between the juvenile periodontitis group supernatant fluids reactivity and the supernatant fluids of the other periodontal disease groups tested. Cluster analysis revealed the association, as determined by supernatant fluid reactivity, of P. micros and C. ochracea in the juvenile periodontitis group. The data from this investigation are consistent with a hypothesis of multiple possible etiologies of periodontal destruction in juvenile periodontitis and other forms of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis and vaginal microorganisms in idiopathic premature labor and  association with pregnancy outcome.
AB  - The vaginal microflora of 49 women in idiopathic preterm labor was compared with  that of 38 term controls to determine whether the presence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and/or specific microorganisms would influence the rate of preterm delivery. Demographic factors, pregnancy outcome, and reproductive history were also studied. BV, as defined by the presence of clue cells in a vaginal wet mount and characteristic microbial findings in a stained vaginal smear and vaginal culture, was more common in women with preterm labor and delivery than in controls (P < 0.01). The condition, diagnosed in 41% of women who had both preterm labor and delivery (n = 22) and in 11% each of women who had preterm labor but term delivery (n = 27) and controls, was associated with a 2.1-fold risk (95% confidence intervals, 1.2 to 3.7) for preterm birth prior to 37 weeks of gestation. BV was associated with low birth weight. Of 49 women with preterm labor, 67% (8 of 12) of women with BV were delivered of low-birth-weight neonates (< 2,500 g) compared with 22% (8 of 37) of women without the condition (P < 0.0005). The presence of hydrogen peroxide-producing facultative Lactobacillus spp. was strongly negatively associated with both preterm delivery and BV. BV-associated microorganisms, i.e., Mobiluncus, Prevotella, and Peptostreptococcus species, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Mycoplasma hominis, and high numbers of Gardnerella vaginalis were significantly associated with preterm delivery; all species also strongly associated with BV (P = 0.0001 for each comparison). Mobiluncus curtisii and Fusobacterium nucleatum were recovered exclusively from women with preterm delivery. Our study clearly indicates that BV and its associated organisms are correlated with idiopathic premature delivery.
TI  - [Cytotoxicity of anaerobic bacteria isolated from infected root canal].
AB  - Bacteria in the infected root canal play an important role in the progression of  the periapical lesion. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the cytotoxic effects of bacteria isolated from an infected root canal on the periapical lesion. Four obligately anaerobic bacteria were isolated and their sonic extracts (SE) were prepared. The cytotoxic assay of each SE for MC3T3-E1 cell was used with respect to the morphological cell changes and [3H]-thymidine uptake. The following results were obtained: 1. Four obligately anaerobic bacteria were identified as follows: Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (P. a.), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. n.), Eubacterium lentum (E. l.), and Peptostreptococcus micros (P. m.). 2. The protein concentrations which induced the morphological cell changes differed in each SE. The SE from P. m. caused cell abnormalities at 10 micrograms protein/ml, F. n. and E. l., at 30 micrograms protein/ml, and P. a., at 100 micrograms protein/ml. 3. The inhibition of the incorporation of [3H]-thymidine into DNA was concentration-dependent. The SE of P. a. showed less cytotoxicity than the others at lower concentrations; 3, 10, 30 micrograms protein/ml. The SE from F. n. had more cytotoxicity at higher concentrations; 100, 300 micrograms protein/ml. These results suggest that these bacterial sonic extracts have a potential to cause morphological cell changes and inhibit the cell proliferation in different concentrations.
TI  - New findings on the microbial flora associated with adult periodontitis.
AB  - The predominant microbial flora associated with adult periodontitis was investigated in 21 patients aged 20-40 years. Microorganisms from samples of subgingival plaque were cultured on selective and non-selective media under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Ten species or groups out of a total of 31 were found to comprise the predominant cultivable flora: diphtheroids, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, coagulase-negative staphylococci, 'Streptococcus milleri'-group, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Capnocytophaga ochracea, the Prevotella veroralis/buccalis complex, P. intermedia, P. oralis and unidentified Prevotella spp. Two species previously reported at periodontitis sites, namely P. gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, were not isolated, whereas Prevotella species accounted for the majority of isolates in this investigation. The large proportion of non-pigmented Prevotella species, P. asaccharolytica and B. ureolyticus that were found have not generally been reported previously. The role of these microorganisms and also coagulase-negative staphylococci, diphtheroids and the 'Streptococcus milleri'-group requires further investigation in adult periodontitis.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Bacteroides and other genera of Gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  - A numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of Bacteroides, Polyphyromonas, Prevotella [not Prevotella (Labroue, 1976)] and Fusobacterium. Isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. Computation of similarity coefficients was followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. At the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) Bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) Fusobacterium mortiferum, F. necrogenes, F. necrophorum, F. nucleatum and F. varium; (3) B. caccae, B. distasonis, B. eggerthii, B. fragilis, B. merdae, B. ovatus, B stercoris, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformus and B. vulgatus; (4) B. splanchnicus; (5) Porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) B. bivius (Prevotella bivia); (7) B. disiens (P. disiens); (8) B. intermedius (P. intermedia);and (9) B. melaninogenicus (P. melaninogenica). Single isolates of B. ruminicola (P. ruminicola), B. denticola (P. denticola) and B. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - To assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7 gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. For comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. Cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against Prevotella oralis, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella bivia, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides corporis, Bacteroides gracilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium naviforme and Propionibacterium acnes. Prevotella oris, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and Ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and Prevotella denticola, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides pneumosintes, and Peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. Strains of Veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptostreptococcus magnus showed MICs of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. The results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Sialidase (neuraminidase) activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic  bacteria.
AB  - A filter paper spot test with 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid as a substrate was used to study the prevalence of sialidase activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria. A total of 567 isolates representing four genera of obligate anaerobes and four genera of capnophilic organisms was tested. Sialidase activity was detected in 94% of 66 isolates from the Bacteroides fragilis group, 98% of 66 B. bivius isolates, and all isolates of the following species (number of isolates follows species name): B. capillosus, 4; B. levii, 2; B. denticola, 22; B. loescheii, 23; B. melaninogenicus, 32; B. forsythus, 44; and B. buccalis, 2. However, sialidase activity was detected in only 29% of 7 B. buccae isolates, 79% of 14 B. disiens isolates, and 55% of 11 B. oralis isolates. Sialidase activity was not detected among any of 13 isolates of B. gracilis, 12 isolates of B. ureolyticus, 61 isolates of B. intermedius, or 26 isolates of B. corporis. Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) asaccharolytica (20 isolates) and P. endodontalis (8 isolates) did not demonstrate sialidase activity, while 25 isolates of P. gingivalis were sialidase positive. Sialidase activity was found in 10 (100%) of 10 isolates of Capnocytophaga ochracea of C. sputigena but not in any of 4 C. gingivalis isolates. Other gram-negative anaerobic or capnophilic bacteria, including the following, were negative for sialidase activity: Fusobacterium nucleatum, 39 isolates; Wolinella recta, 19 isolates; Eikenella corrodens, 17 isolates; Haemophilus aphrophilus, 10 isolates; and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 10 isolates. These data demonstrate sialidase activity in several species of the genera Bacteroides and Porphyromonas and suggest that this characteristic may be useful for identification.
