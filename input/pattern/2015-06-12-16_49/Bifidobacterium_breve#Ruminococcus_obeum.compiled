TI  - Oligosaccharides in 4 different milk groups, Bifidobacteria, and Ruminococcus obeum.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify a link between the total amount of breast milk oligosaccharides and faecal microbiota composition of newborns at the end of the first month of life, with special attention paid to bifidobacteria, and establish the role, if any, of the different oligosaccharides in determining the gut microbiota composition. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Milk oligosaccharide groups were identified by high-performance anion exchange chromatography analysis. DPCRNA from newborns' faecal samples at 30 days of life was isolated and processed by polymerase chain reaction analyses that allow the identification of 6 species of bifidobacteria (adolescentis, bifidum, breve, catenulatum, longum, infantis) and Ruminococcus spp; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis was also performed. RESULTS: No substantial differences in bifidobacteria species composition within milk groups 1, 2, and 3 were observed; however, infants fed with group 4 milk show a microbiota characterised by a greater frequency of Bifidobacteria adolescentis and the absence of Bifidobacteria catenulatum. For the first time, a high percentage of the Ruminococcus genus in infants fed with all milk groups was found. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that milk groups 1, 2, and 3, containing an amount of oligosaccharides ranging within 10 to 15 g/L, share a substantially identical composition of the intestinal microbiota in breast-fed infants, despite quali-quantitative difference in oligosaccharides content. Newborns taking milk with only 5 g/L of oligosaccharides (group 4) harbour a different intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Mechanism of conjugated linoleic acid and vaccenic acid formation in human faecal suspensions and pure cultures of intestinal bacteria.
AB  - Faecal bacteria from four human donors and six species of human intestinal bacteria known to metabolize linoleic acid (LA) were incubated with LA in deuterium oxide-enriched medium to investigate the mechanisms of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and vaccenic acid (VA) formation. The main CLA products in faecal suspensions, rumenic acid (cis-9,trans-11-CLA; RA) and trans-9,trans-11-CLA, were labelled at C-13, as were other 9,11 geometric isomers. Traces of trans-10,cis-12-CLA formed were labelled to a much lower extent. In pure culture, Bifidobacterium breve NCFB 2258 formed labelled RA and trans-9,trans-11-CLA, while Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 16.4, Roseburia hominis A2-183T, Roseburia inulinivorans A2-192T and Ruminococcus obeum-like strain A2-162 converted LA to VA, labelled in a manner indicating that VA was formed via C-13-labelled RA. Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii DSM 4902T, a possible probiotic, formed mainly RA with smaller amounts of trans-10,cis-12-CLA and trans-9,trans-11-CLA, labelled the same as in the mixed microbiota. Ricinoleic acid (12-OH-cis-9-18 : 1) did not form CLA in the mixed microbiota, in contrast to CLA formation described for Lactobacillus plantarum. These results were similar to those reported for the mixed microbiota of the rumen. Thus, although the bacterial genera and species responsible for biohydrogenation in the rumen and the human intestine differ, and a second route of RA formation via a 10-OH-18 : 1 is present in the intestine, the overall labelling patterns of different CLA isomers formation are common to both gut ecosystems. A hydrogen-abstraction enzymic mechanism is proposed that may explain the role of a 10-OH-18 : 1 intermediate in 9,11-CLA formation in pure and mixed cultures.
