scaling and root planing, systemic metronidazole and professional plaque removal  in the treatment of chronic periodontitis in a brazilian population ii--microbiological results.
objective: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions  of 39 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples after scaling and root planing (srp) alone or in combination with systemic metronidazole and/or professional cleaning in subjects with chronic periodontitis.
methods: forty-four adult subjects (mean age 45+/-6 years) with periodontitis were randomly assigned in four treatment groups, a control (c, n=10) that received srp and placebo and three test groups treated as follows: t1 (n=12): srp and metronidazole (m, 400 mg tid) for 10 days; t2 (n=12): srp, weekly professional supragingival plaque removal for 3 months (pc) and placebo; and t3 (n=10): srp, m and pc. subgingival plaque samples were taken from seven sites per subject at baseline and 90 days post-therapy.
counts of 39 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
significance of differences over time was determined using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and among groups using ancova.
results: the mean counts of the majority of the species were reduced post-therapy in the 4 treatment groups.
counts (x 10(5)+/-sem) of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola were significantly reduced in groups t2 and t3.
levels of beneficial species, such as some actinomyces species, veillonella parvula, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus gordonii were minimally affected in levels when the combined therapy was applied (t3).
mean proportions of red complex species decreased from 18.4% at baseline to 3% at 90 days post-therapy in group t3 (p<0.01), from 25.8% to 2.3% in group t2 (p<0.01), from 17.7% to 5.6% in group t1 (p<0.05) and from 19.4% to 8.8% in group c (ns).
proportions of the suspected periodontal pathogens from the orange complex were also markedly reduced in groups t2 and t3.
conclusions: all treatments reduced counts and proportions of red complex species.
adjunctive therapy appeared to have a greater effect and also affected members of the orange complex.
