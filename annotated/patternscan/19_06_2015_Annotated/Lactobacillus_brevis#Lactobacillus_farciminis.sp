TI  == combination of culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular methods for the determination of lactic microbiota in sucuk.
AB  == in this study, the culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular methods were used for the identification of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in sucuk a turkish fermented dry sausage. on the one hand, the pcr-dgge method targetting the v1 and v3 regions of 16s dna was applied to dna that was directly extracted from sucuk samples. on the other hand, rep-pcr fingerprinting was performed for the primary  differentiation and grouping of the isolates, and the results were confirmed by sequencing of the 16s rdna and 16s-23s rdna intergenic spacer region. as a result of the pcr-dgge analysis of all the samples, total 8 different lactic acid bacteria were identified, and lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus curvatus and weissella viridescens were the dominant microbiota among these bacteria. the culture-dependent approach indicated that the majority of the strains belonged to the lactobacillus genera including lb. sakei, lactobacillus plantarum, lb. curvatus, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus farciminis and lactobacillus alimentarius. however, leuconostoc and weisella were also detected as minor genera. again, lactococcus piscium, weissella halotolerans, staphylococcus succinus and the comigrated staphylococcus piscifermentans/staphylococcus condimenti/staphylococcus carnosus group were detected only with the culture-independent method while lb. plantarum, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc citreum were identified only by using the culture-dependent method. in the results, it was concluded that the combination of culture-dependent and culture-independent methods was necessary for reliable and detailed investigation of lab communities in fermented food products.

TI  == identification of potential probiotic starter cultures for scandinavian-type fermented sausages.
AB  == potential probiotic cultures suitable as starter cultures for the scandinavian-type fermented sausages were identified among strains well-adapted to fermented meats as well as strains originating from a culture collection. from 15 different fermented meat products, 22 strains were isolated as dominant non-starter lactic acid bacteria (nslab). the isolates were identified by rapd, api and sequence analysis of 16s rrna and showed to be five strains of lactobacillus sakei, five strains of lactobacillus farciminis, five strains belonging to the group of lactobacillus plantarum/pentosus, four strains of lactobacillus alimentarius, two strains of lactobacillus brevis and one strain of lactobacillus versmoldensis. heterofermentative strains as well as strains not growing at 37 degrees c and not lowering ph below 5.1 in a meat model were excluded leaving 9 strains for further studies. these strains together with 19 strains from a culture collection were evaluated by in vitro methods including survival upon exposure to ph 2.5 or 0.3% oxgall and adhesion to the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line caco-2 as well as antimicrobial activity against potential pathogens. strains that fulfilled all the probiotic criteria and showed to be fast acid producers in a meat model included three strains belonging to the group of lb. plantarum/pentosus (mf1291, mf1298, mf1300) which originated from the dominant nslab of fermented meat products. mf1291 and mf 1298 were further identified as lb. plantarum and mf1300 as lb. pentosus. the three strains were all successfully applied as starter cultures for the production of fermented sausage. the viable count at the end of the processing period reached high cell numbers (4.7x10(7)-2.9x10(8) cfu/g) and ph of the sausages decreased to ph 4.8-4.9 without any flavour deviation compared to sausage fermented by a commercial meat starter culture.

TI  == characterisation of lab in typical salento pecorino cheese.
AB  == twenty-nine strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the typical pecorino cheese of the salento area of italy, were identified and grouped according to their genetic similarity. a preliminary characterisation of the strains was conducted by means of morphological and biochemical analysis, but molecular approaches were necessary for the clear identification of the species. for the species detection, the amplification and sequencing of the 16s rdna gene was employed in addition, restriction analysis of amplified rdna (ardra) and pcr and  aflp fingerprinting enabled inter- and intra-specific variation to be estimated upgma cluster analysis was used to divide the strains into distinct clusters which corresponded with the species delineation obtained by molecular identification. the data obtained show that the community of lactobacilli responsible for the fermentation and aging of pecorino cheese is composed of a limited number of species. the main identified strains were lactobacillus brevis, l. plantarum, l. casei, l. sakei, l. pentosus, l. farciminis and leuconostoc mesenteroides.

TI  == interaction between lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in sour-dough using a rheofermentometer.
AB  == rheofermentometer assays were used to characterize the leavening of sour-doughs produced using species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts, alone or in combination. saccharomyces cerevisiae 141 produced the most co2 and ethanol whereas s. exiguus m14 and lactobacillus brevis subsp. lindneri cb1 contributed poorly to leavening and gave sour-doughs without porosity. in comparison with that seen in sour-dough produced with yeast alone, yeast fermentation with heterofermentative lab present was faster whereas that with homofermentative lab  (l. plantarum dc400, l. farciminis cf3) present was slower and produced more co2. combining l. brevis subsp. lindneri cb1 with s. cerevisiae 141 decreased bacterial cell numbers and souring activity. however, addition of fructose to the sour-dough overcame these problems as well as activating s. cerevisiae 141.

TI  == characterisation of lactic acid bacteria isolated from naturally fermented greek  dry salami.
AB  == a total of 348 lactic acid bacteria isolated from five batches of naturally fermented dry salami at various stages of ripening were characterised. the majority of the strains were assigned to two main phylogenetic groups of species: (i) the psychrotrophic, formerly called atypical, meat streptobacteria (169 strains) and (ii) a new genus weissella (120), which was recently proposed (collins et al., 1993) to include leuconostoc paramesenteroides and some other closely related species. meat streptobacteria were identified as lactobacillus curvatus (88 strains) and l. sake (76), whereas 5 strains were indistinguishable  and, thus designated l. sake/curvatus. non-psychrotrophic streptobacteria were also isolated and identified as l. plantarum (34 strains), l. farciminis (10), l. coryniformis (1) and l. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (1). the majority of the weissella strains (86) were leuconostoc-like bacteria; four of them were identified as w. viridescens, 11 belonged to the newly described w. hellenica (collins et al., 1993), another 11 resembled w. paramesenteroides, whereas 60 isolates were not classified to any species. the latter group comprised strains that produced d(l)-lactate. the remaining weissella were gas-forming, arginine-positive rods assigned to w. minor (31) and w. halotolerans (3). other species identified were enterococcus faecium (10), leuconostoc mesenteroides (1), l. brevis (1) and pediococcus sp. (1). the main criteria used to distinguish between above species as well as their distribution on the five salami batches in relation to their succession with time and suitability as starters were discussed.

TI  == [the microflora of sour dough. iv. communication: bacterial composition of sourdough starters genus lactobacillus beijerinck (author's transl)].
AB  == the bacterial composition of three so called pure culture sourdough starters of varying origin was investigated. 245 isolates were obtained all belonging to the  genus beijerinck. according to their morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics they were classified into the subgroups: thermobacterium (l. acidophilus), streptobacterium (l. casei, l. plantarum, l. farciminis, l. alimentarius) and betabacterium (l. brevis, l. brevis var. lindneri, l buchneri,  l. fermentum, l. fructi vorans). in the three sourdough starters the identified lactic organisms varied in number and proportion. in starter preparation "a" only the varieties l. fructi vorans and l. fermentum were present. preparation "b" contained a great variety of microorganisms with l. brevis and l. brevis l. lindneri predominating. in starter "c" l. brevis, l. plantarum and l. alimentarius predominated.
