the in vitro antimicrobial activities of metabolites from lactobacillus strains on candida species implicated in candida vaginitis.
background: research from developing countries, such as nigeria, on lactobacillus species in the female urogenital tract and their role as a barrier to vaginal infection is limited. therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the clinical biotherapeutic potential of indigenous lactobacillus species. methods: antimicrobial metabolites production were characterised using simple and easily reproducible qualitative and quantitative methods. the in vitro inhibitory effect of lactobacillus antimicrobials on vulvovaginal candidiasis-associated candida species was investigated using modified agar spot and agar well-diffusion methods. results: the maximum levels of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and diacetyl from 20 vaginal lactobacillus strains from diseased subjects were 1.46 mg/l, 1.36 mmol/l, and 1.72 mg/l respectively. from the 4 healthy subjects, the maximum level of lactic acid was 1.08 mg/l; hydrogen peroxide, 1.36 mmol/l; and diacetyl, 0.86 mg/l. the maximum productions of these substances occurred between 72 and 120 hours of incubation. the in vitro antagonistic activities of vaginal l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. casei, l. delbrueckii, and l. jensenii from diseased subjects inhibited a maximum of 5.71% of the 35 candida species tested, while vaginal l. acidophilus and l. plantarum from healthy subjects inhibited between 57.1% and 68.6% of candida species in vitro. conclusion: antimicrobial-producing lactobacilli can be considered as adjunct biotherapeutic candidates for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis.
antagonistic effect of lactobacillus strains against gas-producing coliforms isolated from colicky infants.
background: infantile colic is a common disturb within the first 3 months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue. intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic. however, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty. the benefit of supplementation with lactobacilli been recently reported but the mechanisms by which they exert their effects have not yet been fully defined. this study was performed to evaluate the interaction between lactobacillus spp. strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants. results: strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of 45 colicky and 42 control breastfed infants in mcconkey agar and identified using pcr with species-specific primers, and the bbl enterotube ii system for enterobacteriaceae. gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source. the average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls: 5.98 (2.00-8.76) log10 vs 3.90 (2.50-7.10) cfu/g of faeces (p = 0.015). the following strains were identified: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and enterococcus faecalis. then, 27 lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii dsm 20074 and l. plantarum mb 456 were able to inhibit all coliforms strains (halo-forming method), also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity. conclusions: this study shows that two out of 27 strains of lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants. our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.
probiotic attributes of lactobacillus strains isolated from food and of human origin.
lactobacilli isolated from various sources were identified on the basis of 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic region amplification and subsequent sequencing of the smaller intergenic region. an in vitro analysis of probiotic properties including binding, ability to tolerate different concentrations of bile, survival in acidic buffer and antimicrobial activity of four different isolates and two standard strains (lactobacillus plantarum american type culture collection (atcc) 8014 and l. rhamnosus gg (lgg)) was carried out. the ability of each isolate to stimulate caco-2 cells, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) and thp-1 cells resulting in immunomodulation of these cells was analysed. isolates l. rhamnosus cs25 and l. delbrueckii m and standard strain atcc 8014 showed broad antimicrobial activity, and isolates cs25 (percentage of survival 6.9 % at ph 2.5, 5.1 % at ph 2.0) and l. plantarum cs23 (5.7 % at ph 2.5, 4.9 % at ph 2.0) have shown good tolerance to acidic ph. isolate cs23 showed a good survival (14 %) after 2 h incubation in de man, rogosa and sharpe (mrs) medium containing 3 % bile salts. isolates cs23, cs25 and l. fermentum ast1 could stimulate caco-2 cells, human pbmc and thp-1 cells for a strong and varied immunomodulatory response in these cells. though lgg showed poor antimicrobial activity as well as bile and acid tolerance, it was found to be the best binding strain tested. child faecal isolate cs23 from the present study showed high binding ability (seventeen bacteria/caco-2), high tolerance to acidic ph and bile salts and significant immunomodulation; therefore it is a good potential probiotic candidate.
control of directionality in bacteriophage mv4 site-specific recombination: functional analysis of the xis factor.
the integrase of the temperate bacteriophage mv4 catalyzes site-specific recombination between the phage attp site and the host attb site during lactobacillus delbrueckii lysogenization. the mv4 prophage is excised during the induction of lytic growth. excisive site-specific recombination between the attr and attl sites is also catalyzed by the phage-encoded recombinase, but the directionality of the recombination is determined by a second phage-encoded protein, the recombination directionality factor (rdf). we have identified and functionally characterized the rdf involved in site-specific excision of the prophage genome. the mv4 rdf, (mv4)xis, is encoded by the second gene of the early lytic operon. it is a basic protein of 56 amino acids. electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that (mv4)xis binds specifically to the attp and attr sites via two dna-binding sites, introducing a bend into the dna. in vitro experiments and in vivo recombination assays with plasmids in escherichia coli and lactobacillus plantarum demonstrated that (mv4)xis is absolutely required for inter- or intramolecular recombination between the attr and attl sites. in contrast to the well-known phage site-specific recombination systems, the integrative recombination between the attp and attb sites seems not to be inhibited by the presence of (mv4)xis.
characterization of paraplantaricin c7, a novel bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus paraplantarum c7 isolated from kimchi.
a lactobacillus paraplantarum strain producing a bacteriocin was isolated from kimchi using the spot-on-the lawn method and named l. paraplantarum c7. the bacteriocin, paraplantaricin c7, was found to inhibit certain lactobacillus strains, including l. plantarum, l. pentosus, and l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis. it also inhibited enterococcus faecalis, yet did not inhibit most of the other lab (lactic acid bacteria) tested. the maximum level of paraplantaricin c7 activity was observed under the culture conditions of 25 degrees c and a constant ph of 4.5. paraplantaricin c7 retained 90% of its activity after 10 min of treatment at 100 degrees c and remained stable within a ph range of 2-8. based on a culture supernatant, paraplantaricin c7 was purified by deae-sephacel column chromatography and c18 reverse-phase hplc. sds-page and activity staining were then conducted using the purified paraplantaricin c7, and its molecular mass determined to be about 3,800 da. the 28 n-terminal amino acids from the purified paraplantaricin c7 were determined, and the structural gene encoding paraplantaricin c7, ppnc7, was cloned by pcr using degenerate primers based on the n-terminal amino acid sequence. the nucleotide sequences for ppnc7 and other neighboring orfs exhibited a limited homology to the previously reported plantaricin operon genes. paraplantaricin c7 is a novel type ii bacteriocin containing a double glycine leader sequence.
identification of the agent from lactobacillus plantarum kfri464 that enhances bacteriocin production by leuconostoc citreum gj7.
aim: to provide evidence that the production of bacteriocin by lactic acid bacteria can be enhanced by the presence of a bacteriocin-sensitive strain and identify the agent that is responsible for enhancing bacteriocin production. methods and results: one bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacterium was isolated from kimchi. the strain gj7 was designated as leuconostoc citreum gj7 based on gram staining, biochemical properties, and 16s rrna gene sequencing. the isolate produced a heat- and ph-stable bacteriocin (kimchicin gj7), which has antagonistic activity against a broad spectrum of micro-organisms. tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified kimchicin gj7 showed a single band of molecular weight c. 3500 da. cultures of leuc. citreum gj7 in the presence of thermally inactivated kimchicin gj7-sensitive strains, lactobacillus plantarum kfri 464, lactobacillus delbrueckii kfri 347, or leuconostoc mesenteroides kctc 1628, increased bacteriocin production. this inducing factor was characterized and purified from lact. plantarum kfri 464, which showed the greatest enhancement of kimchicin gj7 activity. the inducing factor was purified using a deae (diethyl aminoethyl)-sephacel column and high-performance liquid chromatography, and yielded a single band of c. 6500 da. n-terminal sequencing of the inducing factor identified 16 amino acids. the n-terminal sequence of the inducing factor was synthesized and examined for the induction of kimchicin gj7 activity, and was found to induce activity, but at a level about 10% lower than that of the entire molecule. conclusions: the presence of a bacteriocin-sensitive strain, lact. plantarum kfri 464, acts as an environmental stimulus to activate the production of kimchicin gj7 by leuc. citreum gj7. the inducing factor from lact. plantarum kfri 464 is highly homologous to the 30s ribosomal protein s16 from various micro-organisms. the n-terminal sequence of the inducing factor examined in this study is a very important sequence related to the inducing activity. nevertheless, the inducing factor may not be part of the ribosomal protein s16 itself. significance and impact of the study: we believe that the present study is the first to identify an agent that is produced by one micro-organism and influences bacteriocin production in another. the bacteriocin-enhancing system described in this study could be effectively used to control the growth of other micro-organisms (sensitive cells) in food systems. moreover, this enhancement of bacteriocin production can be applied usefully in industrial production of natural food preservatives.
antagonistic activity of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus species from ogi,  an indigenous fermented food.
seven lactobacillus species each with one or more strains were isolated from various fermented cereal gruel's (ogi). they were identified as l. plantarum (3 strains), l. delbrueckii (1 strain), l. brevis (2 strains), l. reuteri (2 strains), l. casei (1 strain), l. fermentum (1 strain) and l. acidophilus (1 strain). bacteriocin production was observed in cell-free supernatants of 8 of these strains with l. fermentum, l. delbrueckii and l. reuteri strains (white maize ogi) being negative. the bacteriocin produced by the eight strains inhibited the growth of various target organisms with the inhibition strongly noticed using enterococcus faecalis as indicator. while catalase treatment, ph changes and heat treatment up to 80 degrees c had no effect on the activity of bacteriocin from these isolates, treatment with trypsin and proteinase k resulted in complete loss of inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins. a reduction in the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins was also found to occur with increasing concentrations of glucose or peptone in the cultivation medium.
[sensitivity of lactobacilli of the subgenus thermobacterium to the action of bacteriocins].
sensitivity of 278 cultures of thermobacterium to 30 types of bacteriocins produced by l. acidophilus, l. salivarius, l. jugurti, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. buchneri was studied with the method of delayed antagonism. it was shown that all cultures of l. salivarius, l. jugurti, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. leichmannii, l. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii and 94.1 per cent of l. acidophilus were sensitive to one or several bacteriocin types. the cultures of l. acidophilus, l. salivarius and l. jugurti, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii were sensitive to 26, 15, 28, 2 and 29 lactocin types respectively.
