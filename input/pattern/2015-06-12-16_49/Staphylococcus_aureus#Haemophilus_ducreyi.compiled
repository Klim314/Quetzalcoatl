TI  - The family of Serratia type pore forming toxins.
AB  - The Serratia marcescens hemolysin represents the prototype of a growing family of pore forming toxins. The available bacterial genome sequences reveal Serratia hemolysin homologues in additional species. However, only S. marcescens hemolysin has been studied in great molecular detail. This family of toxins has nothing in common with the pore forming toxins of E. coli type (RTX toxins), the Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin or the thiol activated toxin of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (Streptolysin O). Studies on erythrocytes, eukaryotic cells and artificial black lipid membranes, have shown that the mechanism of pore formation of ShlA is different form other pore forming toxins. The S. marcescens hemolysin proteins ShlB and ShlA, exhibit protein sequence homologues in Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus ducreyi, Yersinia pestis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Edwardsiella tarda, Photorhabdus luminescens and Xylella fastidiosa . The family of Serratia type pore forming toxins show a unique secretory mechanism which has been described as a two partner secretion system (TPSS) or type V-secretion system. Not only Serratia type pore forming toxins are secreted via TPSS but also adhesins from Bordetella pertussis, Erwinia chrysanthemi and Haemophilus influenzae. The uniqueness of the Serratia family is underlined by the fact that activation of ShlA by ShlB strictly requires phosphatidylethanolamine as a cofactor. And, quite unusual, ShlA undergoes a conformational change during activation.
TI  - Serratia type pore forming toxins.
AB  - The Serratia marcescens hemolysin represents a new type of hemolysin and has been studied in great molecular detail with regard to structure, activation and secretion. It has nothing in common with the pore forming toxins of E. coli type (RTX toxins), the Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin or the thiol activated toxin of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (Streptolysin O). Studies on erythrocytes, eukaryotic cells and artificial black lipid membranes, have shown that the mechanism of pore formation of ShlA is different form other pore forming toxins. The S. marcescens hemolysin proteins ShlB and ShlA exhibit protein sequence homologues in Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus ducreyi, Edwardsiella tarda and Erwinia chrysantemi. Furthermore, sequence motifs present in ShlA and Shlb have been shown to be important for activity and secretion of the S. marcescens hemolysin. Thus, the S. marcescens hemolysin forms the prototype of a new class of hemolysins and of a new secretory mechanism. The uniqueness of this new mechanism is underlined by the fact that activation of ShlA by ShlB strictly requires phosphatidylethanolamine as a cofactor. New data implicate a conformational change in ShlA during activation. In addition, ShlA not only forms pores in erythrocytes but also in fibroblasts and epithelial cells. The cytotoxic action of ShlA is mainly determined by lysis of infected cells in vitro. In sublytic doses, as will normally be the situation in vivo, ShlA exerts additionally effects which are currently under investigation. The knowledge of the structure, activation, secretion and mode of action of S. marcescens hemolysin has implications for proteins, related in sequence or in mode of secretion and activation.
TI  - The activity of p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus ducreyi, and other microorganisms.
AB  - p-Methoxybenzylisothiocyanate was isolated from Lepidium bonariense and found to  be responsible for the plants antimicrobial and STD activity. MIC determinations were conducted for p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate on Haemophilus ducreyi, Neisseria gonorrheae, Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilus, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Psuedomanas aeruginosa. An in vitro cellular toxicity assay showed that at 100 microM (17,9 microg/mL) p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate is not toxic to living cells.
TI  - Ofloxacin. A reappraisal of its use in the management of genitourinary tract infections.
AB  - Ofloxacin is an established fluoroquinolone agent which achieves good concentrations in genitourinary tract tissues and fluids. It has good in vitro activity against most Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis and Haemophilus ducreyi, intermediate activity against Ureaplasma urealyticum and most enterococci, but limited or no in vitro activity against enterococci, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and many anaerobes. However, high concentrations achieved in the urine ensure its activity against most urinary tract pathogens. Ofloxacin demonstrates consistent efficacy in a broad range of urinary tract infections, achieving bacteriological response rates in excess of 80% in uncomplicated and 70% in complicated infections. The efficacy of ofloxacin was similar to that of all comparators tested including other fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). Ofloxacin is also effective as a single-dose regimen in the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhoea, as a 7-day regimen in uncomplicated C. trachomatis infections, and as monotherapy in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Again, ofloxacin demonstrated similar efficacy to alternative treatments in each type of infection. The availability of an intravenous formulation and near-complete oral bioavailability allow ofloxacin to be administered as a sequential regimen without loss of activity. The tolerability and drug interaction profile of ofloxacin is consistent with that of other fluoroquinolones. The most commonly reported adverse events with ofloxacin are gastrointestinal, neurological and dermatological. It was associated with a lower incidence of photosensitivity and tendinitis and higher incidence of some neurological events than some other fluoroquinolones. Ofloxacin seems to have a lower propensity to interact with xanthines than other fluoroquinolones. CONCLUSION: ofloxacin has established efficacy in the treatment of a wide variety of urinary tract infections, although, like other fluoroquinolones, it should be used rationally to preserve its activity. Currently, ofloxacin also holds an important place among fluoroquinolones in the treatment of C. trachomatis infections and uncomplicated PID, although its acceptance as monotherapy in PID is likely to depend on clarification of the causative role of anaerobic pathogens in this infection.
TI  - Rifampin, a useful drug for nonmycobacterial infections.
AB  - Rifampin has clinical efficacy against a wide variety of organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella pneumophila, group A Streptococcus, Brucella sp, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis, as well as in vitro activity against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Haemophilus ducreyi, and many gram-negative rods. Rifampin is a useful drug for several types of bacterial infections because of its broad spectrum of activity, excellent tissue penetration, and low side effect profile. In combination with other antibiotics, it may be effective when conventional therapies are not.
TI  - Detection of Haemophilus ducreyi lipooligosaccharide by means of an immunolimulus assay.
AB  - A murine monoclonal antibody (MAb) directed against a surface-exposed epitope of  the lipooligosaccharide (LOS) of Haemophilus ducreyi strain 35000 was shown to be reactive with all 37 strains of this pathogen tested in a colony blot-radioimmunoassay. The LOS epitope bound by this MAb appeared to be stably expressed by H. ducreyi growing in vitro. The use of this MAb in the immunolimulus system revealed that it could detect purified H. ducreyi LOS at a level of 25 pg/ml. Similarly, this immunolimulus system could detect as few as 1000 colony forming units of in vitro-grown H. ducreyi cells per ml of buffer. When this MAb was utilized in the immunolimulus system together with lesion material from rabbits infected with two different H. ducreyi strains, a positive reaction was obtained with every sample tested, even when no viable organisms were present in the lesion material. In contrast, this MAb yielded consistently negative results when used in the immunolimulus system with lesion material from animals infected with Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Isolation of anaerobes from bubo associated with chancroid.
AB  - Ten men with bubo associated with chancroid were studied for bacterial flora especially anaerobes. Anaerobes were isolated from all 10 buboes and eight out of 10 ulcers of chancroid. Anaerobic cocci, B melaninogenicus and B fragilis were the most common isolates. anaerobes probably play a role in the pathogenesis of bubo in chancroid.
TI  - In-vitro activity of a new penem FCE 22101.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of a new penem FCE 22101 was evaluated in comparison with other antimicrobial agents against 966 aerobic and anaerobic Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. FCE 22101 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, H. ducreyi, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis and group B streptococcus at concentrations of 0.12-4.0 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant with MIC90 of greater than 32 mg/l. Streptococcus faecalis displayed MIC90 of 16 mg/l. Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium spp., Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited at concentrations of 0.25-2.0 mg/l. beta-Lactamase-producing or methicillin resistant bacteria did not have significantly elevated MICs. FCE 22101 was generally less active than imipenem but more active than other beta-lactam antibiotics examined.
TI  - Roxithromycin. A review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and clinical efficacy.
AB  - Roxithromycin is an acid-stable orally administered antibacterial macrolide structurally related to erythromycin. It has an in vitro antibacterial profile similar to that of erythromycin, with activity against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia trachomatis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Haemophilus ducreyi, some anaerobes and other less common pathogens. Roxithromycin has a pharmacokinetic profile that is characterised by excellent enteral absorption achieving high concentrations in most tissues and body fluids. The results of clinical studies with roxithromycin have confirmed the potential for its use in a variety of infections, which was suggested by its antibacterial activity in vitro and pharmacokinetic profile. Clinical efficacy has been confirmed in the treatment of respiratory tract infections, including community-acquired and atypical pneumonias, ear, nose and throat infections, genitourinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections. In a relatively small number of patients roxithromycin has generally been shown to be as effective as erythromycin and other appropriate antibacterial drugs in some of the above indications. Roxithromycin is well tolerated and has less potential than erythromycin to produce clinically significant drug interactions. Thus, roxithromycin is an orally active drug which should prove a useful alternative when selecting antibacterial therapy for indications where macrolides are appropriate.
TI  - Activity of pefloxacin and thirteen other antimicrobial agents in vitro against isolates from hospital and genitourinary infections.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of the quinolone derivative pefloxacin was compared with that of three other quinolones, five beta-lactam antibiotics and three aminoglycosides against 367 isolates from hospital patients and from out-patients with genitourinary infections. MIC90 of pefloxacin and norfloxacin for each strain was the same; that of ciprofloxacin was a little lower. All strains except Escherichia coli were resistant to nalidixic acid. Pefloxacin was highly active against Staphylococcus aureus (39 strains; MIC90 1.0 mg/l) and most strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci (56; 4 mg/l), Esch. coli (50; 0.25 mg/l), other enterobacteria (33; 1.0 mg/l) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 6; 0.25 mg/l). With Bacteroides spp. (total 78; 64 mg/l), the fragilis group (23) and the fusobacteria (19) were resistant, but the melaninogenicus-oralis group (31; range 0.06- greater than 64 mg/l) and B. ureolyticus (22; 0.125- greater than 64 mg/l) gave variable results. Amongst genitourinary isolates, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (15) and Haemophilus ducreyi (34) were sensitive (less than 0.06 mg/l) but Gardnerella vaginalis (25) and Mobiluncus spp. (11) were resistant (32 mg/l). Pefloxacin was more active than ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, latamoxef and piperacillin against S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci and than gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci. No enterobacteria or pseudomonads were resistant to pefloxacin or other quinolones, whereas some were resistant to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides.
TI  - Amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate: an antibiotic combination. Mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, antimicrobial spectrum, clinical efficacy and adverse effects.
AB  - The combination of amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate will soon be marketed in 2:1 and 4:1 fixed ratio dosage forms. In vitro and in vivo evidence suggests that clavulanic acid, a potent inhibitor of many bacterial beta-lactamase enzymes, will increase the spectrum of amoxicillin to include, at achievable serum concentrations, Haemophilus influenzae, H. ducreyi, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus aureus and Branhamella catarralis and, at achievable urine levels, many beta-lactamase-producing strains of E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus and Citrobacter. Both amoxicillin and clavulanic are well absorbed after oral administration, reach peak serum levels in 40-120 min and have similar half-lives of 45 to 90 min. This combination will be suitable for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, otitis media, sinusitis and respiratory tract infections. However, precise recommendations for its use will need to await further clinical trials that compare amoxicillin/clavulanate to alternative therapies.
TI  - Characterisation of an unusual bacterium isolated from genital ulcers.
AB  - The preliminary characterisation of an unusual gram-negative bacillus isolated from genital ulcers in Swaziland is reported. Like Haemophilus ducreyi, it is an oxidase positive, nitrate-reductase-positive gram-negative rod that forms streptobacillary chains in some circumstances; it was therefore called the "ducreyi-like bacterium" (DLB). Distinguishing features of DLB are production of alpha-haemolysis on horse-blood agar, stimulation of growth by a microaerophilic atmosphere and by a factor produced by Staphylococcus aureus, a strongly positive porphyrin test, and a remarkable ability to undergo autolysis. DLB had a guanine + cytosine value of c. 50 mole% but it cannot be classified, even at the genus level, until more taxonomic data are obtained.
