TI  - Characterisation of the microflora of attieke, a fermented cassava product, during traditional small-scale preparation.
AB  - Attieke is a fermented cassava product consumed mainly in Cote d'Ivoire. The aim  of this study was to characterise the attieke fermentation by examining products from 15 small-scale production sites at various stages of its preparation. For the preparation of attieke, fresh cassava is grated to a pulp and inoculated with 10% of a spontaneous traditional inoculum. The inocula contained aerobic mesophiles at mean numbers of 8.2 x 10(7) cfu/g and lactic and acetic acids at mean concentrations of 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. The mean pH was 5.0. Lactic acid bacteria were the dominant microorganisms in cassava pulp throughout fermentation with the mean numbers being 1.2 x 10(9) cfu/g after 15 h. The identification to the species level of microorganisms from one representative attieke production of good quality showed that, at the start of fermentation, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides was present in the highest numbers, accounting for 20% of all lactic acid bacteria. As the fermentation proceeded, this species was replaced by homofermentative lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, present at 20% and 16%, respectively, and obligate heterofermentatives, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus confusus at 12% and 10%, respectively, of total lactic acid bacteria in the flora at the end of fermentation. High numbers of acid-sensitive microorganisms, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus lentus, Enterobacter sakazakii, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, were transferred to the pulp in the inocula, but acidification to a mean pH of 4.4 with mean lactic and acetic acid concentrations of 0.59% and 0.2%, respectively, prevented their growth and reduced their numbers to less than 10(2) cfu/g at the end of fermentation. The mean numbers of Candida tropicalis, the main yeast present, remained relatively constant at about 10(5) cfu/g throughout attieke production. The mean numbers of aerobic mesophiles decreased to below 10(2) cfu/g as a result of the steaming process. The finished attieke had a mean pH of 4.4 and mean lactic and acetic acid concentrations of 0.6% and 0.1%, respectively.
TI  - Microbial populations associated with the retting of melon pods (Colocynthis citrullus L.) during seed recovery.
AB  - The traditional process for the retting of melon pulp and microbiological characteristics in the recovery of melon seeds (Colocynthis citrullus L.) were investigated. Melon pods were sliced open and exposed for seven days. The pulp underwent a natural fermentation that was characterized by the growth of microorganisms to 10(8)-10(10) cfu/g. The pH fluctuated between 4.8 and 5.1 with a lactic acid content of 0.72%. Bacillus subtilis, B. polymyxa, Lactobacillus fermentum, L. brevis and Streptococcusfaecalis were the predominant microorganisms but, significant contributions were made by Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Enterobacter cloacae. Penicillium, Aspergillus and Rhizopus species including the yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida krusei and Deboromyces hansenii were isolated from the fermentation. Growth of microorganisms was completely inhibited in antibiotic-treated samples indicating that the melon pods were the main source of microorganisms for the fermentation.
