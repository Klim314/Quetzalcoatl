TI  == impact of oral typhoid vaccination on the human gut microbiota and correlations with s. typhi-specific immunological responses.
AB  == the resident microbial consortia of the human gastrointestinal tract play an integral role in modulating immune responses both locally and systemically. however, detailed information regarding the effector immune responses after vaccine administration in relation to the gastrointestinal microbiota is absent.  in this study, the licensed oral live-attenuated typhoid vaccine ty21a was administered in a clinical study to investigate whether oral immunization resulted in alterations of the microbiota and to identify whether a given microbiota composition, or subsets of the community, are associated with defined  s. typhi-specific immunological responses. the fecal microbiota composition and temporal dynamics were characterized using bacterial 16s rrna pyrosequencing from individuals who were either immunized with the ty21a typhoid vaccine (n = 13) or  served as unvaccinated controls (n = 4). the analysis revealed considerable inter- and intra-individual variability, yet no discernible perturbations of the  bacterial assemblage related to vaccine administration were observed. s. typhi-specific cell mediated immune (cmi) responses were evaluated by measurement of intracellular cytokine production using multiparametric flow cytometry, and humoral responses were evaluated by measurement of serum anti-lps iga and igg titers. volunteers were categorized according to the kinetics and magnitude of their responses. while differences in microbial composition, diversity, or temporal stability were not observed among individuals able to mount a positive humoral response, individuals displaying multiphasic cmi responses harbored more  diverse, complex communities. in line with this preliminary observation, over two hundred operational taxonomic units (otus) were found to differentiate multiphasic and late cmi responders, the vast majority of which classified within the order clostridiales. these results provide an unprecedented view into the dramatic temporal heterogeneity of both the gut microbiota and host immune responses.

TI  == influence of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis infection on the development of the cecum microbiota in newly hatched chicks.
AB  == terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and quantitative pcr showed that the cecal microbiota of chicks up to the age of 21 days was dominated by representatives of the orders enterobacteriales, clostridiales, and lactobacillales. salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis infection caused the greatest changes in the gut microbiota when 1-day-old chicks were infected, compared with the infection of 4- and 16-day-old chicks.
