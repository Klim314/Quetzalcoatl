isolation and characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ripe mulberries in taiwan.
the objective of this study was to isolate, characterize, and identify lactic acid bacteria (lab) from ripe mulberries collected in taiwan. ripe mulberry samples were collected at five mulberry farms, located in different counties of taiwan. eighty-eight acid-producing cultures were isolated from these samples, and isolates were divided into classes first by phenotype, then into groups by restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis and sequencing of 16s ribosomal dna (rdna). phenotypic and biochemical characteristics led to identification of four bacterial groups (a to d). weissella cibaria was the most abundant type of lab distributed in four mulberry farms, and lactobacillus plantarum was the most abundant lab found in the remaining farm. ten w. cibaria and one lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis isolate produced bacteriocins against the indicator strain lactobacillus sakei jcm 1157(t). these results suggest that various lab are distributed in ripe mulberries and w. cibaria was the most abundant lab found in this study.
