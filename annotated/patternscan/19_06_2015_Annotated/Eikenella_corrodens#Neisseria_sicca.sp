TI  == identification of the conjugative mef gene in clinical acinetobacter junii and neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates.
AB  == the mef gene, originally described for gram-positive organisms and coding for an  efflux pump, has been identified in clinical isolates of acinetobacter junii and  neisseria gonorrhoeae. these strains could transfer the mef gene at frequencies ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-9) into one or more of the following recipients: gram-negative moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria perflava/sicca and neisseria mucosa and gram-positive enterococcus faecalis. three streptococcus pneumoniae strains could transfer the mef gene into eikenella corrodens, haemophilus influenzae, kingella denitrificans, m. catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis, n. perflava/sicca, and n. mucosa at similar frequencies. the mef gene can thus be transferred to and expressed in a variety of gram-negative recipients.

TI  == high-level tetracycline resistance resulting from tetm in strains of neisseria spp., kingella denitrificans, and eikenella corrodens.
AB  == similar to neisseria gonorrhoeae, tetracycline-resistant isolates of n. meningitidis, kingella denitrificans, and eikenella corrodens contained 25.2-megadalton plasmids carrying the tetm determinant. in contrast, tetracycline-resistant n. subflava biovar perflava-n. sicca and n. mucosa isolates carried the tetm determinant in the chromosome.
