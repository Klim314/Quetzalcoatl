TI  == distinct gut microbiota of healthy children from two different geographic regions of thailand.
AB  == in thailand, food consumption by people from each region is different. this can be an important environmental factor which shapes the gut microbiota further affecting their health. this study aimed to use quantitative pcr (qpcr) to investigate the intestinal microbial community in 60 healthy children (aged 8-11  years) living in specific areas, namely central (ct) and northeastern (ne) thailand where each region has its own typical food consumption. the children from ne had significantly higher consumption frequency of meat (chicken and beef), a wide variety of carbohydrate sources (noodle, fermented rice and sweet potato) including vegetables and fruit, while in ct, there was a significant preference for rice, breakfast cereal and cow milk. the qpcr analysis resulted in significantly higher abundance of lactobacilli, clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale, clostridium leptum, prevotella and bacteroides fragilis in children from the ne region. however, no significant difference in the count of bifidobacterium spp., enterobacteriaceae and methanogens was observed. considering the correlation of food sources and microbial groups, the consumption frequency of vegetables showed a moderately positive correlation coefficient of 0.42 and 0.34  to the lactobacillus group (p = 0.001) and the prevotella group (p = 0.008), respectively, while a diet of fish and beef showed a moderately negative correlation coefficient of -0.41 (p = 0.001) and -0.33 (p = 0.09) to bifidobacterium spp., respectively. our results suggested that high frequency consumption of varieties of carbohydrates, protein sources, fruits and vegetables by the ne children promoted a high abundance of bacterial species in the phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes.

TI  == long-term monitoring of the human intestinal microbiota from the 2nd week to 13 years of age.
AB  == microbial contact begins prior to birth and continues rapidly thereafter. few long term follow-up studies have been reported and we therefore characterized the development of intestinal microbiota of ten subjects from the 2nd week of life to 13 years of age. pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis combined with several bacterial group-specific primer sets demonstrated the colonization steps  of defined bacterial groups in the microbiota. bifidobacterium species were seen  throughout the test period in all subjects. bacteroides fragilis group and blautia coccoides-eubacterium rectale group species were not detected in several  subjects during the first 6 months of life but were commonly seen after 12 months of life. streptococcus group appeared during early life but was not seen in several subjects at the age of 13 years. although a few species were linked with  the increasing age, major bacterial species in the groups did not change dramatically. rather considerable changes were found in the relative abundances of each bacterial species. clustering analysis of total bacterial flora indicated that the microbiota changed considerably between 6 months and 12 months of life,  and, at the age of 12 months, the intestinal microbiota was already converted toward a profile characteristic of an adult microbiota. probiotic supplementation in the beginning of life did not have major impacts on later microbiota development.

TI  == dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  == background: a custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  rna probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and crohn's disease (cd) patients. methods: oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "goarray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16s rrna sequences. fecal 16s rdna  from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six cd patients were used as  template to generate fluorescently labeled crna that was hybridized to the microarray. differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific primer sets. results: the microarray analyses showed that eubacterium rectale, bacteroides fragilis group, b. vulgatus, ruminococcus albus, r. callidus, r. bromii, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the cd patients, while enterococcus sp., clostridium difficile, escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, and listeria sp. were more abundant in the cd group. conclusions: the microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. in addition, the microarray showed that enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the cd patients. this microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == fecal microbiota in early rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  == objective: to compare the composition of intestinal microbiota of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (ra) or fibromyalgia (fm), fecal samples were collected from 51 patients with ra and 50 with fm. methods: ra patients fulfilled the ra criteria of the american college of rheumatology, and duration of their disease was < or = 6 months. only nonhospitalized patients from outpatient care were included. patients having extreme diets or previous disease modifying antirheumatic drug or glucocorticoid medication were excluded, as were those taking antibiotics or having gastroenteritis for at least 2 months prior to sampling. fecal bacterial composition was analyzed with a method based on flow cytometry, 16s rrna hybridization, and dna-staining. a set of 8 oligonucleotide probes was used. results: in comparison to patients with fm, the ra patients had  significantly less bifidobacteria and bacteria of the bacteroides-porphyromonas-prevotella group, bacteroides fragilis subgroup, and eubacterium rectale--clostridium coccoides group. results from the 8 probes showed a significant overall difference between the 2 patient groups, indicating  widespread microbial differences. conclusion: these findings support the hypothesis that intestinal microbes participate in the etiopathogenesis of ra.

TI  == molecular studies of fecal anaerobic commensal bacteria in acute diarrhea in children.
AB  == background and objective: the commensal bacterial flora of the colon may undergo  changes during diarrhea, owing to colonization of the intestine by pathogens and  to rapid intestinal transit. this study used molecular methods to determine changes in the composition of selected commensal anaerobic bacteria during and after acute diarrhea in children. materials and methods: fecal samples were obtained from 46 children with acute diarrhea in a rural community during an episode of acute diarrhea, immediately after recovery from diarrhea, and 3 months after recovery. dna was extracted and quantitative polymerase chain reaction using sybr green and genus- and species-specific primers targeting 16s rdna were  undertaken to quantitate the following groups of bacteria: bifidobacterium spp.,  bifidobacterium longum group, bacteroides-prevotella group, bacteroides fragilis, lactobacillus acidophilus group, faecalibacterium prauznitzii, and eubacterium rectale, relative to amplification of universal bacterial domain 16s rdna. results: bacteria belonging to the bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group, e  rectale, l acidophilus, and f prauznitzii groups were low during acute diarrhea compared with their levels after recovery from diarrhea. the pattern was similar  in rotavirus diarrhea and nonrotavirus diarrhea. administration of amylase-resistant maize starch as adjuvant therapy was associated with lower levels of f prauznitzii at the time of recovery but did not lead to other changes in the floral pattern. conclusions: specific classes of fecal bacteria are lower  during episodes of acute diarrhea in children than during periods of normal gastrointestinal health, suggesting specific alterations in the flora during diarrhea.

TI  == molecular monitoring of the fecal microbiota of healthy human subjects during administration of lactulose and saccharomyces boulardii.
AB  == diet is a major factor in maintaining a healthy human gastrointestinal tract, and this has triggered the development of functional foods containing a probiotic and/or prebiotic component intended to improve the host's health via modulation of the intestinal microbiota. in this study, a long-term placebo-controlled crossover feeding study in which each subject received several treatments was performed to monitor the effect of a prebiotic substrate (i.e., lactulose), a probiotic organism (i.e., saccharomyces boulardii), and their synbiotic combination on the fecal microbiota of three groups of 10 healthy human subjects  differing in prebiotic dose and/or intake of placebo versus synbiotic. for this purpose, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis of 16s rrna gene amplicons was used to detect possible changes in the overall bacterial composition using the universal v(3) primer and to detect possible changes at the subpopulation level using group-specific primers targeting the bacteroides fragilis subgroup, the genus bifidobacterium, the clostridium lituseburense group (cluster xi), and the clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale group (cluster xiva). although these populations remained fairly stable based on dgge profiling, one pronounced change was observed in the universal fingerprint profiles after lactulose ingestion. band position analysis and band sequencing revealed that a band appearing or intensifying following lactulose administration could be assigned to the species bifidobacterium adolescentis. subsequent analysis with real-time pcr (rt-pcr) indicated a statistically significant increase (p < 0.05)  in total bifidobacteria in one of the three subject groups after lactulose administration, whereas a similar but nonsignificant trend was observed in the other two groups. combined rt-pcr results from two subject groups indicated a borderline significant increase (p = 0.074) of b. adolescentis following lactulose intake. the probiotic yeast s. boulardii did not display any detectable universal changes in the dgge profiles, nor did it influence the bifidobacterial  levels. this study highlighted the capacity of an integrated approach consisting  of dgge analysis and rt-pcr to monitor and quantify pronounced changes in the fecal microbiota of healthy subjects upon functional food administration.

TI  == spatial organization and composition of the mucosal flora in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == the composition and spatial organization of the mucosal flora in biopsy specimens from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd; either crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis), self-limiting colitis, irritable-bowel syndrome (ibs), and healthy controls were investigated by using a broad range of fluorescent bacterial group-specific rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes. each group included 20 subjects. ten patients who had ibd and who were being treated with antibiotics were also studied. use of nonaqueous carnoy fixative to preserve the  mucus layer was crucial for detection of bacteria adherent to the mucosal surface (mucosal bacteria). no biofilm was detectable in formalin-fixed biopsy specimens. mucosal bacteria were found at concentrations greater than 10(9)/ml in 90 to 95%  of ibd patients, 95% of patients with self-limiting colitis, 65% of ibs patients, and 35% of healthy controls. the mean density of the mucosal biofilm was 2 powers higher in ibd patients than in patients with ibs or controls, and bacteria were mostly adherent. bacteroides fragilis was responsible for >60% of the biofilm mass in patients with ibd but for only 30% of the biofilm mass in patients with self-limiting colitis and <15% of the biofilm mass in patients with ibs. in contrast, bacteria which positively hybridized with the probe specific for eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides accounted for >40% of the biofilm in ibs patients but for <15% of the biofilm in ibd patients. in patients treated with (5-asa) or antibiotics, the biofilm could be detected with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole but did not hybridize with fluorescence in situ hybridization probes. a bacteroides fragilis biofilm is the main feature of ibd.  this was not previously recognized due to a lack of appropriate tissue fixation.  both 5-asa and antibiotics suppress but do not eliminate the adherent biofilm.

TI  == variations of bacterial populations in human feces measured by fluorescent in situ hybridization with group-specific 16s rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes.
AB  == six 16s rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes were designed, validated, and used to quantify predominant groups of anaerobic bacteria in human fecal samples. a set of two probes was specific for species of the bacteroides fragilis group and  the species bacteroides distasonis. two others were designed to detect species of the clostridium histolyticum and the clostridium lituseburense groups. another probe was designed for the genera streptococcus and lactococcus, and the final probe was designed for the species of the clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale group. the temperature of dissociation of each of the probes was determined. the specificities of the probes for a collection of target and reference organisms were tested by dot blot hybridization and fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish). the new probes were used in initial fish experiments to enumerate human fecal bacteria. the combination of the two bacteroides-specific probes detected a mean of 5.4 x 10(10) cells per g (dry weight) of feces; the clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale group-specific probe detected a mean of 7.2 x 10(10) cells per g (dry weight) of feces. the clostridium histolyticum, clostridium lituseburense, and streptococcus-lactococcus group-specific probes detected only numbers of cells ranging from 1 x 10(7) to 7 x 10(8) per g (dry weight) of feces. three of the newly designed probes and three additional probes  were used in further fish experiments to study the fecal flora composition of nine volunteers over a period of 8 months. the combination of probes was able to  detect at least two-thirds of the fecal flora. the normal biological variations within the fecal populations of the volunteers were determined and indicated that these variations should be considered when evaluating the effects of agents modulating the flora.

TI  == [efficacy of tinidazole against anaerobes in comparison with metronidazole, ornidazole, cefoxitin and lamoxactam].
AB  == the in vitro inhibitory activity of tinidazole, metronidazole, ornidazole, cefoxitin and moxalactam was determined against 150 isolates of clinically important anaerobes including bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides bivius and clostridium perfringens by means of agar dilution tests. the members of 18 gramnegative and 14 grampositive species were inhibited by tinidazole at less than or equal to 0,01-8 micrograms/ml thus being without exception susceptible to the drug. a similar in vitro activity was recorded for metronidazole and ornidazole. though cefoxitin and moxalactam generally had a good in vitro activity against most anaerobic species, single strains of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. distasonis, clostridium difficile and eubacterium rectale were resistant to these drugs. with regard to its in vitro activity, tinidazole seems to be a promising substance for the therapy of anaerobic infections.
