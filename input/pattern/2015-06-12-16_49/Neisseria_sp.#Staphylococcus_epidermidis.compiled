TI  - Isolation and identification of microbes associated with mobile phones in Dammam  in eastern Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine microbial contamination of mobile phones in the city of Dammam, in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia, and identify the most important microbial species associated with these phones in order to take the necessary remedial measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis of a total of 202 samples was done to identify fungal and pathogenic bacteria isolates. Sterile swabs were firmly passed on the handset, the buttons and the screens of mobile phones, then inoculated into media of bacteria and fungi. Frequency distribution of isolates were calculated. RESULTS: There were 737 isolated of the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria sicca, Micrococcus luteus, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterobacter aerogenes at the rate of 56.58, 13.57, 8.01, 7.73, 6.51, 3.66, 2.85 and 1.09% respectively. There were fungal isolates as follows: Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium sp., Penicillium spp., Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Rhizopus stolonifer, Aspergillus ochraceus at the rate of 29.07, 26.74, 20.93, 10.47, 6.98, 2.33, 2.33, 1.16%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that all mobile phones under consideration were infected by several microbes, most of which belonged to the natural flora of the human body as well as airborne fungi and soil. This means that it is necessary to sterilize hands after contact with a phone since it is a source of disease transmission.
TI  - [Etiological profile of bacterial meningitis in a small hospital]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the etiologic profile of cases of meningitis treated at a small hospital in Ribeirao Preto, State of Sao Paulo, and to compare it to those reported for other communities.METHODS: a retrospective study was conducted on 103 patients admitted from January 1992 to July 1996 with clinical and laboratory diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. The clinical criteria for diagnosis were based on patient history and physical signs and symptoms, and the laboratory criteria were based on cerebrospinal fluid examination (aspect, cytology, biochemistry, Gram staining, culture and countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis) and blood culture.RESULTS: The etiologic agent was identified in 81.5% of cases: Haemophilus influenzae type b in 32%, Neisseria meningitides in 25.2%, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 8.7%, Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis in 8.7%, and others agents in 6.9%. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that the cases of bacterial meningitis treated at the Santa Lydia Hospital of Ribeirao Preto are caused by the same agents detected in other places, with Haemophilus influenzae type b being the predominant one. The study also suggests that when many people are involved in the collection of material for laboratory tests, recovery of the agent may become difficult.
TI  - Low surface tension calcium hydroxide solution is an effective antiseptic.
AB  - The antimicrobial effects of a saturated calcium hydroxide solution, and in combination with 10% and 20% detergent, were evaluated on Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Neisseria sp., diphtheroid, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus sp., Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans. The saturated calcium hydroxide solution was effective against only four of the 11 microorganisms studied over a 60-min exposure time. The calcium hydroxide solutions containing detergent killed all 11 test organisms over a 30-min exposure time. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.01). No statistically significant difference in antimicrobial action was found between the 10% and 20% detergent calcium hydroxide solutions (P > 0.01). However, the low surface tension (46.5 x 10(-3) Nm-1) and high pH (10.8) of the calcium hydroxide solution with 20% detergent establish it as the more effective solution.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [Clinical experience of chemotherapy with cefmetazole for severe infections accompanying malignant hematological disorders].
AB  - We made an attempt to treat with cefmetazole (CMZ) 25 patients who developed severe infectious diseases while suffering with granulocytopenia associated with the treatment of malignant hematological disorders. 1. Determination of bacteriological efficacy While 20 strains were isolated and identified from 15 patients, no significant bacteria were detected in 9 patients. Isolates obtained were: 5 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 3 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 2 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 strains of Klebsiella oxytoca, 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and 1 strain each of Neisseria sp., Pseudomonas maltophilia, Enterobacter sp., alpha-Streptococcus, beta-Streptococcus and Gram-positive cocci. Causative organisms were eradicated or markedly in 7 of the 15 patients from whom bacteria were isolated. Clinical findings, including fever, revealed that none of the patients, in whom bacteriological efficacy was determined to be poor, exhibited sufficient clinical response. E. faecalis was isolated from 4 of 6 patients bacteriologically determined to have no response. 2. As for 23 patients, who were found to be evaluable among the 25 patients, 8 (34.8%), 4 (17.4%), 4 (17.4%), and 7 (30.4%) demonstrated excellent, good, fair and poor responses, respectively, showing a 69.6% efficacy rate which indicates a sum of percentages of patients with excellent, good and fair responses. 3. While an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained for 3 patients with number of peripheral neutrophils less than 500/mm3 before the beginning of CMZ administration, only an efficacy rate of 66.7% was obtained for 15 patients with neutrophils more than 500/mm3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - In vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. A-56620 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, Staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. A-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. Difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than A-56620. Both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC 0.015 micrograms/ml) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MK less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). Both agents were more active against streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. They inhibited Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. These agents show overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.
TI  - Characterization of a Haemophilus sp. isolated from a rabbit with conjunctivitis.
AB  - A case of conjunctivitis in a rabbit caused by a Haemophilus sp. is described. This was the only organism that was isolated in large numbers from the infected eye. The uninfected eye of the same rabbit contained Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium kutscheri, Proteus mirabilis and a Neisseria sp. Effects of infection with live Haemophilus sp. isolated from the subject rabbit was studied in the eyes of rabbits and mice. Swabbing live organisms in the normal rabbit eye produced blepharitis within 48 hours. Signs of blepharitis started to disappear after 10 days without treatment. No reaction was noted in the control eye (swabbed with sterile saline) of the rabbit. Swabbing live organisms or sterile saline in the normal mouse eye failed to produce visible lesions up to 4 weeks. Evidence suggests that the Haemophilus sp. was pathogenic for rabbits but not for mice.
TI  - Quantitative determination of catalase activity produced by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Neisseria meningitidis and other bacterial strains using the Catalasemeter.
AB  - The conventional catalase test only gives qualitative or semi-quantitative information of the amount of catalase activity produced. Using such a method, we have selected two strong catalase activity producers (Neisseria gonorrhoeae G-10, Staphylococcus epidermidis 66) and a weak producer (Neisseria meningitidis 34702). Quantitative determination of the catalase activity produced by these strains was done by the disk-flotation method using the Catalasemeter. The production of catalase activity in liquid culture by N. gonorrhoeae, S. epidermidis and N. meningitidis occurred mainly during the logarithmic growth phase. The maximum concentration of catalase activity found in these cultures was, for both strong producers, 160 units (U)/ml while it was around 20 U/ml for the weak producer. Some of the other bacteria tested showed high concentrations of catalase activity (130-162 U/ml) and these were: N. gonorrhoeae strain PR 77112 (penicillin resistant), Staphylococcus strain 7 (coagulase negative), Micrococcus sp. strains 2 and 42.
TI  - Isolations of aerobic bacteria from wild desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni and O. c. mexicana) in Arizona.
AB  - Nasal, pharyngeal, cervical and vaginal swab specimens were obtained from 74 desert bighorn sheep for the purpose of investigating the normal aerobic bacterial flora of wild sheep. A total of 281 isolates was obtained and identified by standard microbiologic tests. One hundred seven of these isolates were gram positive and included Bacillus sp. (36%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8%), S. aureus (4%), Corynebacterium sp. (diphtheroids, 4%), and Streptococcus sp. (48%). gram negative isolates totaled 174 and included Neisseria sp. (18%), Citrobacter sp. (3%), Enterobacter sp. (2%), Escherichia coli (2%), Proteus sp. (2%) and non-fermentative bacilli (NFB) (73%). Of the NFB isolates, Pseudomonas sp. (25%), Acinetobacter sp. (18%), Moraxella sp. (15%) were identified.
TI  - An easily prepared and accurate test strip for the detection of beta-lactamase production by both gram negative and positive organisms.
AB  - A simple method is described for the preparation of a paper test strip for the rapid detection of the beta-lactamase enzymes of Haemophilus sp., N. gonorrhoeae, S. aureus and S. epidermidis. The test strips were compared with the chromogenic cephalosporin technique for beta-lactamase detection and found to give 100% agreement. The beta-lactamase detection strips were easily prepared, very inexpensive, required no special equipment and could be stored for up to 6 mth.
TI  - The bacteriology and cytology of chronic otitis media with effusion.
AB  - The bacteriology and cytology of middle ear effusion from 729 children with persistent otitis media with effusion were studied. Thirty-five percent of these chronic effusions were culture-positive. Type b and non-type b Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria sp. and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the predominant isolates. Serous and mucoid effusion cultures yielded bacteria more often in younger than in older children. In addition bacteria were seen in 17% of the Gram-stained smears of the sterile effusions; Gram-positive cocci predominated in these effusions. Disparate effusion culture results were obtained in 32% of bilateral otitis media cases. Effusions which yielded H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae on culture had more polymorphonuclear leukocytes than did effusions which yielded S. epidermidis or Neisseria or were sterile. Phagocytic cells were equally prevalent in sterile effusions with or without bacteria on Gram stain. Phagocytic cells were seen less often in mucoid effusions from antibiotic-treated patients than in mucoid effusions from untreated patients. The results suggest that certain bacteria in chronic middle ear effusion contribute to the pathogenesis of this condition by eliciting a local inflammatory cell response.
TI  - Survival of bacteria after freezing of human semen in liquid nitrogen.
AB  - Thirty-four semen samples from fertile men were subjected to bacteriologic evaluation before and after freezing to -196 degrees C using 10% glycerol as the protective medium. Cultures of the fresh portions from all ejaculates examined showed the presence of aerobic bacteria. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium sp., alpha-streptococci, and nonhemolytic streptococci were found so commonly that they were considered commensals. Enterococci, Escherichia coli, S. aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococci group B, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. maltophilia, and P. fluorescens, were also recovered from a few semen samples of these fertile men. Practically all bacteria isolated from the fresh ejaculate were also recovered from the portions frozen in liquid nitrogen.
TI  - Aerobic bacterial flora of oral and nasal fluids of canines with reference to bacteria associated with bites.
AB  - Oral and nasal fluids of 50 dogs were examined to determine the prevalence of aerobic bacteria frequently associated with animal bite wounds. The most frequently isolated microorganisms included: IIj, EF-4, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, group D streptococci, Corynebacterium sp., Enterobacteria, Neisseria sp., Moraxella sp., and Bacillus sp. Other species and genera were infrequently recovered and may represent transient flora. The high incidence of IIj, EF-4, P. multocida, and S. aureus, all known human pathogens, suggests that they should be considered as probably contaminants in bite wounds.
