TI  == actinomyces odontolyticus: rare etiology for purulent pericarditis.
AB  == purulent pericarditis is one of the most common causes of cardiac tamponade and if left untreated has a mortality of 100%. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumonia have been implicated as the main etiology of purulent pericardial effusion followed by fungi and anaerobic sources. actinomyces odontolyticus pericardial involvement has been reported in the literature only once. to our knowledge, this is the first fatal case of a. odontolyticus purulent pericarditis in the absence of periodontal disease.

TI  == the effects of chlorhexidine gluconate (0.12%) on the antimicrobial properties of tooth-colored proroot mineral trioxide aggregate.
AB  == the purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether the substitution of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for sterile water as a mixing agent would enhance the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored proroot mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) against actinomyces odontolyticus (atcc17982), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc2586), streptococcus sanguis (atcc10556), enterococcus faecalis (er3/2s), escherichia coli (sm10lambdapir), staphylococcus aureus (atcc6538), pseudomonas aeruginosa (ume), and candida albicans (atcc10261). two wells of 5-mm diameter were made in triplicate agar plates inoculated with standardized suspensions of each microorganism. mta (33 mg) mixed with chlorhexidine (12 microl) or sterile water (12 microl) was placed to fill each well. plates were incubated at 37 degrees c as required for microbial growth. a blinded, independent observer measured zones of inhibition. all mta samples inhibited microbial growth regardless of mixing agent. mta/chlorhexidine showed significantly larger zones of inhibition (p < 0.0002, paired t test). in conclusion, substituting 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for water enhanced the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored proroot mta.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of 'mgp' gutta-percha in vitro.
AB  == aim: to determine whether 'mgp' gutta-percha (westport, ct, usa), a commercially  available gutta-percha containing iodoform, inhibits the growth of potential endodontic pathogens. methodology: inocula of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus sanguis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces odontolyticus were spread onto the surface of agar plates. 'mgp' gutta-percha cones presoaked in sterile water were transferred to the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees c aerobically or anaerobically as required for optimal growth. identical studies were performed using iodoform-free gutta-percha and sterile paper disks saturated with 10% povidone-iodine. following incubation, zones of inhibition around the 'mgp' gutta-percha, iodoform-free gutta-percha and disks were evaluated. results: povidone-iodine inhibited all the strains. iodoform-free gutta-percha inhibited s. sanguis and a. odontolyticus. 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited s. aureus, s. sanguis, a. odontolyticus and f. nucleatum. neither iodoform-free gutta-percha nor 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited growth of e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa. conclusions: compared to iodoform-free gutta-percha, iodoform-containing 'mgp' gutta-percha had an inhibitory effect in vitro on s. aureus and f. nucleatum, but not on e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa.

TI  == oral microbiota and implant type membranes.
AB  == candida albicans (ca), staphylococcus aureus (sa), streptococcus sanguis (ss), actinomyces naeslundii (an), actinomyces odontolyticus (ao), porphyromona spp (p  spp), candida glabrata (cg), candida krusei (ck), and rhodotorula spp (r spp) were tested with equal pieces of biodegradable membranes. membranes pretreated with saliva or clorhexidine and nontreated control membranes were tested in three different culture media containing 0.1 ml homologous suspension for each strain under study. incubation was performed at 37 degrees c for 48 hours for aerobiosis and for five days for anaerobiosis. macroscopy and microscopy were carried out. membranes were removed, washed, and resuspended. samples were sonicated, and the  supernatant was disseminated on brain heart infusion broth or blood agar. incubation was repeated, colony-forming unit counts were performed, and statistical analysis was carried out using analysis of variance transforming results to log10 (x + 1), the highest interaction level was used to calculate standard error. orthogonal contrast was used to compare the different microorganisms under study. highest adhesion was found with ca, cg, ck, sa, and ss. a sufficient quantity of actinomyces could not be recovered from the membranes. results with p spp were poor, confirming lower gram-negative adhesion. replicate flasks with ss and ca were cultivated. membranes were removed after washing and subjected to scanning electron microscopy, as were untreated control  pieces. a cavelike surface was observed. streptococcus sanguis adhering to the membranes showed extracellular projections. candida and gram-positive cocci showed great recovery capacity.

TI  == bacteriology of skin and soft-tissue infections: comparison of infections in intravenous drug users and individuals with no history of intravenous drug use.
AB  == the bacteriology of cutaneous or subcutaneous abscesses (86 specimens) among intravenous drug users (ivdus) was compared with the bacteriology of abscesses (74 specimens) in patients with no history of intravenous drug use (non-ivdus). the ivdu abscesses yielded 173 aerobes and 131 anaerobes. staphylococcus aureus was the most common aerobe isolated (50% of specimens yielded this isolate), followed by "streptococcus milleri" (46%). the commonly encountered anaerobes were fusobacterium nucleatum (17%), pigmented prevotella species (22%), peptostreptococcus micros (17%), actinomyces odontolyticus (15%), and veillonella species (13%). the non-ivdu isolates included 116 aerobes and 106 anaerobes. s. aureus was isolated from 53% of these specimens, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (19%), "s. milleri" (19%), and streptococcus pyogenes (16%). the main groups of anaerobes were peptostreptococcus species (35%), bacteroides species (19%), and gram-positive bacilli (31%). overall, 67% of the ivdu isolates were of oral origin, compared with 25% of the non-ivdu isolates. of the specimens from ivdus and non-ivdus, 48% and 67%, respectively, yielded only aerobes, and 2% and 4%, respectively, yielded only anaerobes. sixty-four percent of the patients  had one or more beta-lactamase-producing organisms.

TI  == predominant cultivable microflora of plaque on removable dentures in patients with healthy oral mucosa.
AB  == plaque from the fitting surface of upper full dentures in eight patients with healthy palatal mucosa was studied. to characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 916 isolates (100-128 from each sample) were subcultured from anaerobic roll-tubes. streptococci constituted 0-81 per cent (median, 41 per cent) of the isolates with varying proportions of streptococcus milleri, streptoccus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitior and streptococcus sanguis. staphylococcus aureus made up 0-13 per cent (median, 6 per cent). gram-positive rods constituted 1-74 per cent (median, 33 per cent). among these, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces odontolyticus were the most common species, whereas lactobacilli were isolated only from two samples, constituting 21 and 48 per cent. among gram-negative bacteria, only veillonella parvula was common, constituting 3-20 per cent (median, 10 per cent). gram-negative rods were isolated only from three samples in small proportions making up 0-6 per cent (median, 0 per cent) of the flora. forty-seven isolates (5 per cent) were lost. cultures for yeasts on sabouraud agar were positive for five samples and the yeast counts corresponded to 0-0.45 per cent (median, 0.002 per cent) of the total viable counts. the microflora of denture plaque is highly variable and is to a large extent similar to that of some forms of dental plaque.
