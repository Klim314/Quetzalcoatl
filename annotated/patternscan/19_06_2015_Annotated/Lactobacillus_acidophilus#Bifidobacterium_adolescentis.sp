TI  == cholesterol-lowering potentials of lactic acid bacteria based on bile-salt hydrolase activity and effect of potent strains on cholesterol metabolism in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == this study collected different probiotic isolates from animal and plant sources to evaluate the bile-salt hydrolase activity of probiotics in vitro. the deconjugation potential of bile acid was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. hepg2 cells were cultured with probiotic strains with high bsh activity. the triglyceride (tg) and apolipoprotein b (apo b) secretion by hepg2 cells were evaluated. our results show that the bsh activity and bile-acid deconjugation abilities of pediococcus acidilactici nbhk002, bifidobacterium adolescentis nbhk006, lactobacillus rhamnosus nbhk007, and lactobacillus acidophilus nbhk008 were higher than those of the other probiotic strains. the cholesterol concentration in cholesterol micelles was reduced within 24 h. nbhk007 reduced the tg secretion by 100% after 48 h of incubation. nbhk002, nbhk006, and nbhk007 could reduce apo b secretion by 33%, 38%, and 39%, respectively, after 24 h of incubation. the product probio s-23 produced a greater decrease in the total concentration of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, tg, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance in the serum or livers of hamsters with hypercholesterolemia compared with that of hamsters fed with a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet. these results show that the three probiotic strains of lactic acid bacteria are better candidates for reducing the  risk of cardiovascular disease.

TI  == graphene oxide as an anaerobic membrane scaffold for the enhancement of b. adolescentis proliferation and antagonistic effects against pathogens e. coli and s. aureus.
AB  == the impact of the gut microbiota on human health is widely perceived as the most  exciting advancement in biomedicine. the gut microbiota has been known to play a  crucial role in defining states of human health and diseases, and thus becomes a  potential new territory for drug targeting. herein, graphene oxide (go) interaction with five common human gut bacteria, b. adolescentis, l. acidophilus, e. coli, e. faecalis, and s. aureus, was studied. it was shown that, in bacterial media, go sheets were able to form effective, anaerobic membrane scaffolds that enhanced the antagonistic activity of b. adolescentis against the pathogens e. coli ands. aureus. data obtained using bacterial growth measurements, colony counting and 16s rrna gene sequencing consistently indicated that go sheets promoted proliferation of gut bacteria, particularly for b. adolescentis. scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy images, and membrane potential measurements showed that cell membranes maintained their integrity and  that no observable variations in cell morphology were induced after interaction with go sheets, indicating good biocompatibility of go. these results suggest the possibility of using go sheets as efficient drug carriers in therapeutic applications to treat diseases related to the gut microbiota.

TI  == broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of carbon nanotubes to human gut bacteria.
AB  == carbon nanotubes (cnts) hold promise in manufacturing, environmental, and biomedical applications, as well as food and agricultural industries. previous observations have shown that cnts have antimicrobial activity; however, the impact of cnts to human gut microbes has not been investigated. here, the antibacterial activity of cnts against the microbes commonly encountered in the human digestion system--l. acidophilus, b. adolescentis, e. coli, e. faecalis, and s. aureus--are evaluated. the bacteria studied include pathogenic and non-pathogenic, gram-positive and negative, and both sphere and rod strains. in this study, cnts, including single-walled cnts (swcnts, 1-3 mum), short and long  multi-walled cnts (s-mwcnts: 0.5-2 mum; l-mwcnts: >50 mum), and functionalized multi-walled cnts (hydroxyl- and carboxyl-modification, 0.5-2 mum), all have broad-spectrum antibacterial effects. notably, cnts may selectively lyse the walls and membranes of human gut microbes, depending on not only the length and surface functional groups of cnts, but also the shapes of the bacteria. the mechanism of antibacterial activity is associated with their diameter-dependent piercing and length-dependent wrapping on the lysis of microbial walls and membranes, inducing release of intracellular components dna and rna and allowing  a loss of bacterial membrane potential, demonstrating complete destruction of bacteria. thin and rigid swcnt show more effective wall/membrane piercing on spherical bacteria than mwcnts. long mwcnt may wrap around gut bacteria, increasing the area making contact with the bacterial wall. this work suggests that cnts may be broad-spectrum and efficient antibacterial agents in the gut, and selective application of cnts could reduce the potential hazard to probiotic  bacteria.

TI  == effects of antibiotics on bacterial species composition and metabolic activities  in chemostats containing defined populations of human gut microorganisms.
AB  == the composition and metabolic activities of the human colonic microbiota are modulated by a number of external factors, including diet and antibiotic therapy. changes in the structure and metabolism of the gut microbiota may have long-term  consequences for host health. the large intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem comprising several hundreds of different bacterial species, which complicates investigations on intestinal physiology and ecology. to facilitate such studies, a highly simplified microbiota consisting of 14 anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, clostridium butyricum, c. perfringens, c. bifermentans, c. innocuum, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus) was used in this investigation. ampicillin [9.2 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to two chemostats  operated at different dilution rates (d; 0.10 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1)), and metronidazole [76.9 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to a third vessel (d = 0.21 h(-1)). perturbations in bacterial physiology and metabolism were sampled over a  48-h period. lactobacillus acidophilus and c. bifermentans populations did not establish in the fermentors under the imposed growth conditions. ampicillin resulted in substantial reductions in bacteroides and c. perfringens populations  at both dilution rates. metronidazole strongly affected bacteroides communities but had no effect on bifidobacterial communities. the bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin on bifidobacterial species was growth rate dependent. several metabolic activities were affected by antibiotic addition, including fermentation product formation and enzyme synthesis. the growth of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in the large bowel may enable them to occupy ecological niches left vacant after antibiotic administration, preventing colonization by pathogenic species.

TI  == predominant genera of fecal microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis are not altered by intake of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bi-07.
AB  == the effect of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium lactis bi-07 on the composition of the lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium and the total bacterial population in feces from young children with atopic dermatitis was investigated. the study included 50 children randomized to intake of one of the probiotic strain or placebo. microbial composition was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, quantitative pcr and, in a subset of subjects, by pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna  gene. the core population of the lactobacillus group was identified as lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, leuconostoc mesenteroides, while the bifidobacterial community included bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium catenulatum. the fecal numbers of l. acidophilus and b. lactis increased significantly after intervention, indicating survival of the ingested bacteria. the levels of bifidobacterium correlated positively (p=0.03), while the levels of the lactobacillus group negatively (p=0.01) with improvement of atopic eczema evaluated by the severity scoring of atopic dermatitis index. this correlation was observed across the whole study cohort and not attributed to the probiotic intake. the main conclusion of the study is that administration of l. acidophilus ncfm and b. lactis bi-07 does not affect the composition and diversity of the main bacterial populations in feces.

TI  == detection of blastocystis from stool samples using real-time pcr.
AB  == we developed a real-time lc pcr assay to detect a 152 bp sequence in an uncharacterized region of the blastocystis genome. the described assay detected 11 of 11 atcc strains of blastocystis from subtypes 1, 3, and 4. three of three stool samples from oregon and california military personnel that were negative for blastocystis by an ova and parasite test as well as a conventional pcr assay  were positive for blastocystis using our real-time lc pcr assay. diagnosis of blastocystis infections using this sensitive method, including dna extraction and real-time pcr, only requires 3 h. the lower limit of detection for blastocystis in stool using the real-time lc pcr assay was calculated to be 760 cells of blastocystis per 100 mg of stool, an estimated 760 parasites per reaction. the assay did not cross-react with ruminococcus hansenii, anarococcus hydrogenalis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, fusobacterium prausnitzii, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, or lactobacillus acidophilus. because of the ease of use, sensitivity, specificity, and increase in blastocystis infections in the usa we believe this assay has the potential to be useful as a clinical diagnosis tool of blastocystis infection.

TI  == selective growth-inhibiting effects of compounds identified in tabebuia impetiginosa inner bark on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activity of anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid and lapachol identified in the inner bark of taheebo, tabebuia impetiginosa, toward 10 human intestinal bacteria was evaluated by using a paper disk diffusion bioassay and compared to those of seven lapachol congeners (1,4-naphthoquinone, naphthazarin,  menadione, lawsone, plumbagin, juglone, and dichlone) as well as two commercially available antibiotics, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid exhibited very strong growth inhibition of clostridium paraputrificum at 1 microg/disk while 100 microg/disk of lapachol was needed for moderate growth inhibition of the same organism. these two isolates exhibited weak inhibition of clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli at 100  microg/disk while no adverse effects were observed on the growth of bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium infantis,  lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei at 1000 microg/disk. structure-activity relationships indicate that a methyl group in the c-2 position of 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives might play an important role in antibacterial activity.

TI  == [growth and morphological characteristics of industrial strains of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus cultivated in hydrolysate-milk and hydrolysate-soybean media].
AB  == growth features of industrial strains of bifidobacterium adolescentis mc-42, b. bifidum 1, b. longum b-379, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 8-79 and l. plantarum 8pa3 cultivated in hydrolysate-milk or hydrolysate-soybean media (hmm and hsm respectively) were analysed comparatively. the bacterial cells were investigated morphometrically with atom strength microscopy. it was shown that hsm vs hmm provided a higher growth rate of the strains (shortened growth phases and higher growth rates) that was more evident for the bifidobacteria as compared to the lactobacilli. at the same time, the morphological features of the bacterial cells slightly depended on the medium composition and were mainly defined by the genus.

TI  == growth-inhibiting effects of seco-tanapartholides identified in artemisia princeps var. orientalis whole plant on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == aims: the present work aimed at isolating antibacterial constituents from the whole plant of artemisia princeps var. orientalis active towards nine human intestinal bacteria. methods and results: the growth-inhibiting activities of materials derived from the artemisia whole plant towards test bacteria were examined using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active constituents of the artemisia whole plant were characterized as the sesquiterpene lactones seco-tanapartholides a and b by spectroscopic analysis. in a test using  1 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b produced a clear inhibitory effect against clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus aureus.  these compounds did not affect the growth of test lactic acid-producing bacteria  (bifidobacterium adolescentis, bif. breve, lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. casei) and escherichia coli, whereas weak growth inhibition towards bif. bifidum  was observed. at 0.5 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b exhibited moderate growth inhibition towards cl. perfringens but weak growth inhibition towards bact. fragilis and staph. aureus. conclusions: inhibitory action of seco-tanapartholides a and b towards specific bacteria without any adverse effects on lactic acid-producing bacteria may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of a. princeps var. orientalis whole plant. significance and impact of the study: these naturally occurring artemisia whole plant-derived materials could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria such as clostridia.

TI  == development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == a membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. the 16s rdna sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. digoxigenin (dig)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. hybridization signals were read by nbt/bcip color development. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. fragilis, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, r. bromii, r. callidus, r. albus, bifidobacterium  longum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, eubacterium biforme, e. aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus,escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. the result was also confirmed by  using specific pcr methods for these bacteria.

(bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (lactobacillus casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and s. lactis). both spots of lactic acid and acetic  acid were detected on all the tlc plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. the five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. accordingly, the proposed tlc method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.

AB  == ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (srb) desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). reproducible defined  bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis, bif. pseudolongum, bif. infantis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bact. vulgatus, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, cl. butyricum, cl. innocuum, cl. bifermentans. lactobacillus and cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. inclusion of des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly bif. longum, cl. perfringens and bif. pseudolongum. the two bacteroides species were unaffected by des. desulfuricans, while numbers of cl. butyricum increased. extensive wall growth developed in the srb culture, consisting mainly of des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), bact. thetaiotaomicron and bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, cl. perfringens and bif. longum. wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures.  chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (fame) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (c15) and bifidobacterial (c18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-c15:0, c16:0, i-c17:1) could be identified. the metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the srb chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. high concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were  detected in the srb chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. saccharolytic organisms growing in the srb fermenter  utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the srb culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == culture supernatants of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium adolescentis repress ileal ulcer formation in rats treated with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug by suppressing unbalanced growth of aerobic bacteria and lipid peroxidation.
AB  == a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl) thiophene (bfmet), induced  ileal ulcers in rats after oral administration, while no ulcers were observed after subcutaneous injection. the ileal ulcer formation in bfmet-treated rats was examined to correlate the administration of cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus or bifidobacterium adolescentis with intestinal bacteria in the ileal contents and lipid peroxidation of the small intestinal mucosa. ileal ulcers were observed in more than 85% of the rats treated with bfmet at a dose of 1,000 mg/kg when they were given tap water as drinking water. the incidence of ulcer formation was repressed by giving culture supernatants of l. acidophilus or b. adolescentis as  drinking water, but not by giving the cell suspension as drinking water. gram staining of the ileal contents of normal rats revealed that 97% of the stained bacteria were gram-positive rods and only 1.5% were gram-negative rods. the percentage of gram-negative rods 72 hr after bfmet administration was 49.8% and increased over 30-fold in bfmet-treated rats. however, the percentage of gram-negative rods was 9.7 % or 16%, respectively, in rats taking culture supernatants of l acidophilus or b. adolescentis. in addition, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances in the ileal mucosa increased significantly in the rats  given tap water for 72 hr after bfmet treatment, but not in rats given the culture supernatants of l. acidophilus or b. adolescentis. since bfmet induced an unbalanced intestinal microflora, the effect of antibiotic treatment on ulcer formation in rats was examined. the magnitude of the ulcer formation in the antibiotic-treated rats was, in decreasing order, metronidazole >none > kanamycin > a mixture (bacitracin, neomycin and streptomycin). these results suggest that the intestinal microflora plays an important role in ulcer formation and that a metabolite(s) of l. acidophilus and b. adolescentis inhibits ileal ulcer formation by repressing changes in the intestinal microflora and lipid peroxidation in bfmet-treated rats.

TI  == effect of intestinal bacteria on formation of azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci in the rat colon.
AB  == the effect of intestinal bacteria on formation of azoxymethane (aom)-induced aberrant crypt foci (acf) and dna adducts in the rat colon was investigated. male sprague-dawley rats were administered cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens for five weeks and given injections of aom at 15 mg/kg body weight at the first and second weeks. the number of acf five weeks after the start of the experiment was decreased in the rats treated with the cultures or culture supernatants of l. acidophilus and c. perfringens. the half-life of o6-methylguanine (o6-meg) in the l. acidophilus group was shorter than that in the gam broth group. the half-life of 7-methylguanine did not differ among the groups. these results suggest that the metabolite(s) of l. acidophilus and c. perfringens inhibit(s) the acf formation in rats treated with aom and that the inhibitory effect of l. acidophilus is due to the enhanced removal of o6-meg from the colon mucosal dna.

TI  == pcr detection and quantitation of predominant anaerobic bacteria in human and animal fecal samples.
AB  == pcr procedures based on 16s rrna gene sequences specific for 12 anaerobic bacteria that predominate in the human intestinal tract were developed and used for quantitative detection of these species in human (adult and baby) feces and animal (rat, mouse, cat, dog, monkey, and rabbit) feces. fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, and clostridium clostridiiforme had high pcr titers (the maximum dilutions for positive pcr results ranged from 10(-3) to 10(-8)) in all of the human and animal fecal samples tested. bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, and eubacterium limosum also  showed higher pcr titers (10(-2) to 10(-6)) in adult human feces. the other bacteria tested, including escherichia coli, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, eubacterium biforme, and bacteroides distasonis, were either at low pcr titers (less than 10(-2)) or not detected by pcr. the reported pcr procedure including the fecal sample preparation method is simplified and rapid and eliminates the dna isolation steps.

TI  == role of intestinal bacteria in ileal ulcer formation in rats treated with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug.
AB  == the role of intestinal bacteria in induction and repression of ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with one of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids), 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl) thiophene (bfmet), was examined in this study. bfmet was administered by intragastric gavage once at doses of 500-1,500 mg/kg of body weight to wistar rats treated with and without antibiotics (bacitracin, neomycin, streptomycin), germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats, and 72 hr later their gastrointestinal tracts were examined for ulcer formation. a single oral administration of bfmet induced ileal ulcers in specific pathogen-free rats. however, the rats given antibiotics to reduce the intestinal bacteria had no ulcers. bfmet-treated germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with bifidobacterium adolescentis or lactobacillus acidophilus also had no intestinal ulcers. however, the drug induced ileal ulcers in gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with eubacterium limosum or escherichia coli. an overnight culture of b. adolescentis or l. acidophilus or yogurt containing bifidobacterium breve and streptococcus thermophilus, when given as drinking water, inhibited ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with bfmet. gram staining of the ileal contents of normal rats revealed that 97.4% of the stained  microorganisms were gram-positive rods and only 1.2% were gram-negative rods. in  the group of rats with ulcers induced by bfmet, the gram-positive rods decreased  by 56.4% and the gram-negative rods including escherichia coli, klebsiella, proteus and bacteroides increased by 37.3%. however, in the group of rats administered the bifidobacterium culture, the lactobacillus culture or yogurt, the percentages of the gram-negative rods were decreased. although lactobacillus  was a major bacterium in the ileum of normal rats, the gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods e.coli, klebsiella and proteus were increased in the ulcerated ileum of rats treated with bfmet, suggesting that these bacteria are associated with ulcer formation in rats treated with nsaids, and that lactobacillus and bifidobacterium inhibit it by repressing the growth of ulcer-inducing bacteria.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.

TI  == effect of intestinal bacteria on incidence of liver tumors in gnotobiotic c3h/he  male mice.
AB  == the effect of intestinal microflora on liver tumorigenesis was studied in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice monoassociated, diassociated, or polyassociated with the following strains of intestinal bacteria: escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium infantis, clostridium indolis, c. paraputrificum, c. perfringens, c. innocuum, c. nexile, c. ramosum, c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides multiacidus, bacteroides fragilis, veillonella alcalescens, v. parvula, and lactobacillus acidophilus. the incidence of liver tumors was higher in most of the gnotobiotes (67--100%) and conventionalized mice (82%) derived from the germfree mice than in the germfree mice (39%). the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with e. coli, s. faecalis, and c. paraputrificum was 2.9, which was significantly higher than that in the conventionalized animals (1.6). in contrast, the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with e. coli, s. faecalis, l. acidophilus, c. perfringens, and bacteroides fragilis (0.9) was not significantly different from  that in germfree animals (0.5). the present study demonstrated that the presence  of certain intestinal bacteria is related to liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice.

TI  == [studies on the composition of the fecal flora of healthy dogs with the special references of lactobacillus flora and bifidobacterium flora (author's transl)].
AB  == with the new method the fecal flora of 13 clinically healthy dogs aged 3 to 42 months was analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. it was characterized by that bacteroidaceae constituted the most prodominant flora, catenabacteria, streptococci, peptostreptococci, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were the next most numerous, enterobacteria consisted the accompanying flora. the numbers of clostridium perfringens were remarkably fluctuated and seem to be influenced by the composition of the food ingested by the host. the total cultivable counts averaged log 10.8 +/- 0.2/g. the composition of the lactobacillus flora and bifidobacterium flora in the feces of 34 dogs from 3 different age groups was analysed. in the feces of all age groups l. acidophilus, l. salivarius and l. fermenti with 9 different types were found. within the lactobacilli l. acidophilus type vi c, l. salivarius type vi a and l. fermenti type iv b were most frequently found. l. acidophilus types vi c and xi, l. salivarius types vi a and vi b could not be placed in any established types of each species, and were described as new types. bifidobacteria were regularly found in large numbers in the feces of dogs aged 2 to 24 months. b. adolescentis and b. pseudolongum consisted the main bifidobacterium flora.
