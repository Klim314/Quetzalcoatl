TI  - Acute-phase responses in cattle infected with hydatid cysts and microbial agents.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of hydatid cysts and microbial agents on the acute-phase response in cattle. Twenty-seven cattle with hydatid cysts and eight apparently healthy cattle comprised the study and control groups, respectively. Parasitological, microbiological, histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations of the liver and lungs were undertaken, and 49 of these organs were infected with cysts. In 14 of 31 (45.1%) livers and 10 of 18 (55.5%) lungs microbial growth was observed. The most frequent species occurring in the liver were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium spp. and Campylobacter spp., whereas in the lungs the most common species was Candida spp., followed by Streptococcus spp., Mannheimia haemolytica, Corynebacterium spp., Micrococcus spp. and S. aureus. The concentration of serum interleukin (IL-6) in infected cattle, 455.35 +/- 39.68 pg/ml, was significantly higher than that of 83.02 +/- 17.87 pg/ml in the control group (P0.05). The highest concentrations of IL-6 were detected in serum of the cattle where microbial growth had been detected, followed by cattle infected with bacteria + Trichostrongylus sp. (P< 0.001). Consequently, SAA showed an important increase in the group infected with hydatid cysts, whereas haptoglobin level decreased. It was noticed that IL-6, like SAA, had a significant role in hydatid cyst infection. Therefore IL-6 and SAA appear to be major markers in the detection of infection of cattle with hydatid cysts.
TI  - [The current antimicrobial resistance situation in Swiss veterinary medicine].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility data (n = 1501) and bacterial isolates (n = 258) of  important bacterial pathogens from animals were collected in collaboration with eight Swiss laboratories from May 1999 to February 2000. Using these data, the antimicrobial resistance situation could be assessed for the following bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Haemophilus parasuis, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus intermedius, Streptococci, and enterococci. Differences in the distribution of resistance between animal species could be evidenced in E. coli and salmonella. Some resistance frequency data were compared with those obtained in 1980. A significant increase of resistance frequency was observed for several antibiotics. This includes in particular an increase of ampicillin, gentamicin, and cotrimoxazole resistance in E. coli. A similar increase was observed in salmonella for ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and nalidixic acid. Staphylococci from dogs (S. intermedius and S. aureus) also presented a clear increase of resistance for penicillin, neomycin, sulfonamides, cotrimoxazole, and erythromycin. Finally, a comparison with data from abroad shows that the antibiotic resistance situation in Switzerland is relatively favorable.
