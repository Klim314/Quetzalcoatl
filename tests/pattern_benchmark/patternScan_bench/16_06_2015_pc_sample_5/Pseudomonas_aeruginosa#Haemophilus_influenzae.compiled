TI  - PCR detection and identification of bacterial contaminants in ocular samples from post-operative endophthalmitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial endophthalmitis is a sight-threatening complication of ocular surgery which requires urgent medical consideration including comprehensive diagnosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a sensitive molecular method has been extensively used for detection of microbial species in clinical specimens. AIM: The aim of this study was to identify the causative organisms of endophthalmitis in our patient population using a procedure based on PCR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vitreous samples from 32 patients with post-operative endophthalmitis were collected. Total vitreous DNA was extracted and then assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified from genomic DNA using PCR with a pair of HAD2 universal primers. Library of PCR products from 16S rRNA, cloned into the pTZ57R/T vector. The ligated products were then transformed into E. coli DH5alpha strain and grown in the LB-ampicillin/X-Gal/IPTG plate. RESULTS: From the total of 32 vitreous samples, 18 specimens were positive, illustrating the presence of bacterial infection (56.4 %). Twelve species including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitides, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus were identified using BLAST for known 16S rRNA sequences. CONCLUSION: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) accompanied with cloning and sequencing approved to be sensitive and specific. The rapid molecular technique was useful in detection of 12 major microbial species, in infectious endophthalmitis.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of 6 otorhinolaryngological infectious diseases and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in the isolated pathogens in Japan.
AB  - The Japanese Three Academic Societies Joint Antimicrobial Susceptibility Surveillance Committee has conducted a nationwide surveillance on antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and rates of isolation in 6 otolaryngological diseases. The surveillance program was conducted in the otorhinolaryngological departments of 29 universities, and their 26 affiliated hospitals. Patients suffering from acute otitis media, chronic otitis media, acute nasal sinusitis, chronic nasal sinusitis, acute tonsillitis, and peritonsillar abscess between January 2011 and June 2012 were investigated. The collected swab or incision samples were cultivated for microbial identification, and the drug susceptibility of detected bacteria was measured at the Kitasato University Research Center for Infections and Antimicrobials. The surveillance focused on three gram-positive bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus), three gram-negative bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella Catarrhalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three anaerobic bacteria (Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., and Fusobacterium spp.). Bacterial susceptibility to 39 antimicrobial drugs was investigated. We compared bacterial isolation ratio of each disease in this surveillance from those of past 4 times surveillance which we performed formerly, and we also compared percentage of main drug resistant strains from those of past 4 times surveillance. The age composition between this time and former surveillances was not statistically significant by student-t test. We were unable to completely resolve the rise in resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase non-producing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, beta-lactamase producing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, and beta-lactamase producing amoxicillin clavulanic acid-resistant H. influenzae. We suggest promoting the proper usage of antimicrobial drugs in order to avoid the spread of these bacteria.
TI  - Lack of evidence of increased risk of bacterial transmission during cystic fibrosis educational programmes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Educational and rehabilitation programmes increase the quality-of-life of patients with cystic fibrosis, but patients are discouraged to participate because of the risk of cross-infections. METHODS: Isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae cultured one year before to one year after attendance were investigated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis, multilocus sequence typing and/or spa-typing. RESULTS: We typed 984 bacterial isolates cultured from 46 patients aged 5-18years attending educational programmes at Aarhus University Hospital during 2009-2011. There were no cross-infections with P. aeruginosa. Six cases of S. aureus or H. influenzae strain replacement with a new strain-type shared with a fellow attendee were found. However, the probability of acquiring a shared strain of S. aureus or H. influenzae was not increased for patients attending educational programmes. CONCLUSIONS: Transmission of P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and H. influenzae related to attendance to the investigated educational programmes could not be documented.
TI  - Discrepancy in MALDI-TOF MS identification of uncommon Gram-negative bacteria from lower respiratory secretions in patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Early identification of microbial organisms from respiratory secretions of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is important to guide therapeutic decisions. The objective was to compare the accuracy of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) relative to the conventional phenotypic method in identifying common bacterial isolates, including nonfermenting Gram-negative bacteria, in a cohort of patients with CF. METHODS: A total of 123 isolates from 50 patients with CF representing 14 bacterial species from respiratory specimens were identified using MALDI-TOF MS in parallel with conventional phenotypic methods. Discrepancies were confirmed by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing in five Gram-negative isolates. RESULTS: The MALDI-TOF MS managed to identify 122/123 (99.2%) bacterial isolates to the genus level and 118/123 (95.9%) were identified to the species level. The MALDI-TOF MS results were 100% consistent to the species level with conventional phenotypic identification for isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and other uncommon organisms such as Chryseobacterium gleum and Enterobacter cloacae. The 5/123 (4.6%) isolates misidentified were all Gram-negative bacteria. The isolation of E. cloacae and Haemophilus paraphrohaemolyticus may extend the potentially pathogenic list of organisms isolated from patients with CF. CONCLUSION: Although the technique provides an early identification and antimicrobial therapy approach in patients with CF, limitation in the diagnosis of uncommon Gram-negative bacteria may exist.
TI  - Development of two real-time multiplex PCR assays for the detection and quantification of eight key bacterial pathogens in lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The frequent lack of a positive and timely microbiological diagnosis in patients  with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is an important obstacle to antimicrobial stewardship. Patients are typically prescribed broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics while microbiology results are awaited, but, because these are often slow, negative, or inconclusive, de-escalation to narrow-spectrum agents rarely occurs in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate two multiplex real-time PCR assays for the sensitive detection and accurate quantification of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. We found that all eight bacterial targets could be reliably quantified from sputum specimens down to a concentration of 100 CFUs/reaction (8333 CFUs/mL). Furthermore, all 249 positive control isolates were correctly detected with our assay, demonstrating effectiveness on both reference strains and local clinical isolates. The specificity was 98% on a panel of nearly 100 negative control isolates. Bacterial load was quantified accurately when three bacterial targets were present in mixtures of varying concentrations, mimicking likely clinical scenarios in LRTI. Concordance with culture was 100% for culture-positive sputum specimens, and 90% for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens, and additional culture-negative bacterial infections were detected and quantified. In conclusion, a quantitative molecular test for eight key bacterial causes of LRTI has the potential to provide a more sensitive decision-making tool, closer to the time-point of patient admission than current standard methods. This should facilitate de-escalation from broad-spectrum to narrow-spectrum antibiotics, substantially improving patient management and supporting efforts to curtail inappropriate antibiotic use.

TI  - Endoscopically-derived bacterial cultures in chronic rhinosinusitis: A systematic review.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Culture-directed antibiotic therapy represents an important component in the management paradigm of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature to assess culture yield of the most common aerobic and anaerobic pathogens. METHODS: A total of 43 studies between 1975 and 2010 were included. RESULTS: The composite data comprised 3528 patients with 6005 total culture specimens. The cultures were obtained in operating room in 33 (76.7%) and clinic in 10 (23.3%) of the studies, respectively. The most common site of culture was the maxillary sinus in 18 (41.9%) of the studies. The most common assay techniques reported were swab in 19 (44.2%) and aspirate in 12 (27.9%) studies. The most common gram positive aerobes reported were coagulase negative Staphylococcus and Staphylococcus aureus in 630 (34.7%) and 481 (26.5%) of the cultures, respectively. The most common gram negative aerobes included Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 245 (27.0%) and 198 (21.6%) cultures, respectively. The most common anaerobes reported were Peptostreptococcus species in 156 (19.6%) and Bacteroides species in 153 (19.2%) cultures. CONCLUSION: This study provides a composite snapshot of the literature accrued on the microbiology of CRS. It should serve to apprise clinicians on the most common aerobic and anaerobic organisms in CRS patients when employing culture-directed antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - [Distribution and drug resistance of the pathogenic bacteria from sputum specimens of 1 125 children with tracheo bronchial foreign bodies].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the distribution and drug susceptibility of the pathogenic  bacteria in the airway secretions in children with tracheobronchial foreign bodies so as to assist physicians in clinical prescription. METHODS: Sputum specimens of 1 125 children with tracheobronchial foreign bodies were collected in removal of the foreign bodies by rigid bronchoscope, and the drug susceptibility test was performed. RESULTS: Pathogenic bacteria were detected in 218 (19.4%) of 1 125 sputum specimens. Among the pathogenic bacteria, 126 (57.79%) strains were gram-negative bacilli, consisting of 76 (34.86%) strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 10 (4.59%) strains of Escherichia coli, 7 (3.21%) strains of Sewer enterobacter, 7 (3.21%) strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 6 (2.75%) strains of Klebsiella bacillus; and 92 (42.21%) strains were gram-positive bacilli, consisting of 80 (36.69%) strains of Streptococcus pneumonia and 10 (4.59%) strains of Escherichia coli. Most of detected gram-negative bacilli were highly sensitive to cefepime, ceftazidine, imipenem and amikacin, no strains were resistant to meropenem and ciprofloxacin. None of the detected gram-positive bacilli were resistant to cefepime, vancomycin, levofloxacin and teicoplanin. CONCLUSIONS: The Haemophilus influenzae of gram-negative bacilli and the Streptococcus pneumonia of gram-positive bacilli are the main pathogenic bacteria existing in the airway secretions of children with tracheobronchial foreign bodies. The Haemophilus influenzae were highly sensitive to cephalosporin, imipenem and amikacin, and the Streptococcus pneumonia to cefepime, vancomycin, levofloxacin and teicoplanin.
TI  - Ceftaroline in the management of complicated skin and soft tissue infections and  community acquired pneumonia.
AB  - Ceftaroline is a new parenteral cephalosporin approved by the European Medicines  Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTIs) including those due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Ceftaroline has broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and exerts its bactericidal effects by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), resulting in inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. It binds to PBP 2a of MRSA with high affinity and also binds to all six PBPs in Streptococcus pneumoniae. In in vitro studies, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA and vancomycin-intermediate isolates), Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multidrug resistant isolates), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and many common gram-negative pathogens, excluding extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In Phase II and Phase III clinical trials, ceftaroline was noninferior to its comparator agents and demonstrated high clinical cure rates in the treatment of cSSTIs and CAP. It demonstrated favorable outcomes in patients treated for both regulatory-approved indications and unlicensed indications in a retrospective analysis. Ceftaroline is a safe and effective option for treatment in specific patient populations in which its efficacy and safety have been proven. This article reviews the challenges in the treatment of cSSTI and CAP, ceftaroline and its microbiology, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety data which support its use in treatment of cSSTIs and CAP.
TI  - Adult non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis is characterised by airway luminal Th17  pathway activation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis is characterised by chronic airway infection and neutrophilic inflammation, which we hypothesised would be associated with Th17 pathway activation. METHODS: Th17 pathway cytokines were quantified in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and gene expression of IL-17A, IL-1beta, IL-8 and IL-23 determined from endobronchial biopsies (EBx) in 41 stable bronchiectasis subjects and 20 healthy controls. Relationships between IL-17A levels and infection status, important clinical measures and subsequent Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection were determined. RESULTS: BALF levels of all Th17 cytokines (median (IQR) pg/mL) were significantly higher in bronchiectasis than control subjects, including IL-17A (1.73 (1.19, 3.23) vs. 0.27 (0.24, 0.35), 95% CI 1.05 to 2.21, p<0.0001) and IL-23 (9.48 (4.79, 15.75) vs. 0.70 (0.43, 1.79), 95% CI 4.68 to 11.21, p<0.0001). However, BALF IL-17A levels were not associated with clinical measures or airway microbiology, nor predictive of subsequent P. aeruginosa infection. Furthermore, gene expression of IL-17A in bronchiectasis EBx did not differ from control. In contrast, gene expression (relative to medians of controls) in bronchiectasis EBx was significantly higher than control for IL1beta (4.12 (1.24, 8.05) vs 1 (0.13, 2.95), 95% CI 0.05 to 4.07, p = 0.04) and IL-8 (3.75 (1.64, 11.27) vs 1 (0.54, 3.89), 95% CI 0.32 to 4.87, p = 0.02) and BALF IL-8 and IL-1alpha levels showed significant relationships with clinical measures and airway microbiology. P. aeruginosa infection was associated with increased levels of IL-8 while Haemophilus influenzae was associated with increased IL-1alpha. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Established adult non-CF bronchiectasis is characterised by luminal Th17 pathway activation, however this pathway may be relatively less important than activation of non-antigen-specific innate neutrophilic immunity.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the surveillance committee of Japanese Society of Chemotherapy, the Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases, and the Japanese Society for Clinical Microbiology in 2010: General view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  - The nationwide surveillance on antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial respiratory pathogens from patients in Japan, was conducted by Japanese Society of Chemotherapy, Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases and Japanese Society for Clinical Microbiology in 2010. The isolates were collected from clinical specimens obtained from well-diagnosed adult patients with respiratory tract infections during the period from January and April 2010 by three societies. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institutes using maximum 45 antibacterial agents. Susceptibility testing was evaluable with 954 strains (206 Staphylococcus aureus, 189 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 4 Streptococcus pyogenes, 182 Haemophilus influenzae, 74 Moraxella catarrhalis, 139 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 160 Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Ratio of methicillin-resistant S. aureus was as high as 50.5%, and those of penicillin-intermediate and -resistant S. pneumoniae were 1.1% and 0.0%, respectively. Among H. influenzae, 17.6% of them were found to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediately resistant, 33.5% to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ABPC-resistant and 11.0% to be beta-lactamase-producing ABPC-resistant strains. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae and multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa with metallo beta-lactamase were 2.9% and 0.6%, respectively. Continuous national surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory pathogens is crucial in order to monitor changing patterns of susceptibility and to be able to update treatment recommendations on a regular basis.
TI  - Acute otorrhea in children with tympanostomy tubes: prevalence of bacteria and viruses in the post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccine era.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea is a common sequela in children with tympanostomy tubes. Acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea is generally a symptom of an acute middle ear infection, whereby middle ear fluid drains through the tube. The widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV) has changed the bacterial prevalence in the upper respiratory tract of children, but its impact on bacterial and viral pathogens causing acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea is yet unknown. METHODS: This study was performed in the post-PCV7 era parallel to a randomized clinical trial of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of ototopical and systemic antibiotics and initial observation in 230 children aged 1 to 10 years with untreated, uncomplicated acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea. Otorrhea and nasopharyngeal samples were collected at baseline (before treatment) and at 2 weeks (after treatment). Conventional bacterial culture was performed followed by antimicrobial-resistance assessment. Viruses were identified by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: At baseline, Haemophilus influenzae (41%), Staphylococcus aureus (40%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18%) were the most prevalent bacteria in otorrhea, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (7%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (4%). Most pneumococci were non-PCV7 serotypes. Viruses were detected in 45 otorrhea samples at baseline (21%). Most infections were polymicrobial and overall antimicrobial resistance was low. CONCLUSIONS: H. influenzae, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa are the most common microorganisms in children with untreated uncomplicated acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea. Prevalence of S. pneumoniae has decreased since the introduction of PCV and most pneumococci are nonvaccine serotypes.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against European Gram-negative and Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - Recent clinical isolates of key Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four European countries (France, Germany, Italy and Spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/L avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. Against Enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. MIC90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90% of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii and Morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. A two-fold reduction in the MIC90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/L was noted in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam, whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the MIC values of the test compounds when tested against Acinetobacter baumannii isolates. Avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against Haemophilus influenzae. It had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. This study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa but not against A. baumannii.
TI  - Bacterial Adaptation during Chronic Respiratory Infections.
AB  - Chronic lung infections are associated with increased morbidity and mortality for individuals with underlying respiratory conditions such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The process of chronic colonisation allows pathogens to adapt over time to cope with changing selection pressures, co-infecting species and antimicrobial therapies. These adaptations can occur due to environmental pressures in the lung such as inflammatory responses, hypoxia, nutrient deficiency, osmolarity, low pH and antibiotic therapies. Phenotypic adaptations in bacterial pathogens from acute to chronic infection include, but are not limited to, antibiotic resistance, exopolysaccharide production (mucoidy), loss in motility, formation of small colony variants, increased mutation rate, quorum sensing and altered production of virulence factors associated with chronic infection. The evolution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa during chronic lung infection has been widely studied. More recently, the adaptations that other chronically colonising respiratory pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia cepacia complex and Haemophilus influenzae undergo during chronic infection have also been investigated. This review aims to examine the adaptations utilised by different bacterial pathogens to aid in their evolution from acute to chronic pathogens of the immunocompromised lung including CF and COPD.
TI  - Bacterial-resistance among outpatients of county hospitals in China: significant  geographic distinctions and minor differences between central cities.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to survey antibacterial resistance in outpatients of Chinese county hospitals. A total of 31 county hospitals were selected and samples continuously collected from August 2010 to August 2011. Drug sensitivity testing was conducted in a central laboratory. A total of 2946 unique isolates were collected, including 634 strains of Escherichia coli, 606 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 476 Staphylococcus aureus, 308 Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 160 Haemophilus influenzae. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in E. coli (42.3% strains), K. pneumoniae (31.7%), and Proteus mirabilis (39.0%). Ciprofloxacin-resistance was detected in 51.0% of E. coli strains. Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. were sensitive to most antibacterial agents. Less than 8.0% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were resistant to carbapenem. For S. aureus strains, 15.3% were resistant to methicillin, and some strains of S. pneumoniae showed resistance to penicillin (1.6%), ceftriaxone (13.0%), and erythromycin (96.4%). beta-lactamase was produced by 96.5% of Moraxella catarrhalis strains, and 36.2% of H. influenzae isolates were resistant to ampicillin. Azithromycin-resistant H. influenzae, imipenem-resistant but meropenem-sensitive Proteus, and ceftriaxone- and carbapenem non-sensitive M. catarrhalis were recorded. In conclusion, cephalosporin- and quinolone-resistant strains of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumonia and macrolide-resistant Gram-positive cocci were relatively prominent in county hospitals. The antibacterial resistance profiles of isolates from different geographical locations varied significantly, with proportions in county hospitals lower than those in their tertiary counterparts in the central cities, although the difference is diminishing.
TI  - Matrix metalloproteinases vary with airway microbiota composition and lung function in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.
AB  - RATIONALE: Despite growing evidence for the roles of airway remodeling and bacterial infection in the progression of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, relationships between collagen-degrading proteases and chronic airway infection are poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine which matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are elevated in bronchiectasis, whether these MMP levels vary based on patients' dominant infective microbe, and how these levels correlate with clinical measures of disease severity. METHODS: We determined concentrations of nine MMPs and four tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in induced sputum from 86 patients with bronchiectasis and 8 healthy control subjects by Luminex protein assay. Concentrations were then assessed in relation to lung function, inflammatory markers, and airway microbiota composition, determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Airway microbiota composition was classified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa-dominated, Haemophilus influenzae-dominated, or dominated by another species. MMP-8 and MMP-9 activity levels were also measured in a subset of patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: MMP-1, -3, -7, -8, and -9 and TIMP-2 and -4 levels, as well as MMP-8/TIMP-1 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratios, were significantly higher in patients with bronchiectasis than in healthy control subjects (all: P < 0.001, except MMP-7: P < 0.05). Patients with bronchiectasis with H. influenzae-dominated airway infections demonstrated higher MMP-2 levels (P < 0.01) and MMP-8 activity (P < 0.05) than those with P. aeruginosa-dominated airway infections. Among patients with bronchiectasis, there were significant inverse correlations between FEV1 as a percentage of predicted value, MMP-8 and MMP-1 levels, and MMP-8/TIMP-1 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratios (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Increased MMP levels (particularly MMP-8 and MMP-1) and MMP/TIMP ratios in patients with bronchiectasis compared with healthy control subjects correlated with lower lung function and higher levels of inflammatory markers. Further, MMP profiles differed in patients with bronchiectasis according to the dominant pathogen determined by gene sequencing, raising the possibility of differential airway remodeling according to airway microbiology.
TI  - Rapid microbial sample preparation from blood using a novel concentration device.
AB  - Appropriate care for bacteremic patients is dictated by the amount of time needed for an accurate diagnosis. However, the concentration of microbes in the blood is extremely low in these patients (1-100 CFU/mL), traditionally requiring growth (blood culture) or amplification (e.g., PCR) for detection. Current culture-based methods can take a minimum of two days, while faster methods like PCR require a sample free of inhibitors (i.e., blood components). Though commercial kits exist for the removal of blood from these samples, they typically capture only DNA, thereby necessitating the use of blood culture for antimicrobial testing. Here, we report a novel, scaled-up sample preparation protocol carried out in a new microbial concentration device. The process can efficiently lyse 10 mL of bacteremic blood while maintaining the microorganisms' viability, giving a 30-muL final output volume. A suite of six microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans) at a range of clinically relevant concentrations was tested. All of the microorganisms had recoveries greater than 55% at the highest tested concentration of 100 CFU/mL, with three of them having over 70% recovery. At the lowest tested concentration of 3 CFU/mL, two microorganisms had recoveries of ca. 40-50% while the other four gave recoveries greater than 70%. Using a Taqman assay for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA)to prove the feasibility of downstream analysis, we show that our microbial pellets are clean enough for PCR amplification. PCR testing of 56 spiked-positive and negative samples gave a specificity of 0.97 and a sensitivity of 0.96, showing that our sample preparation protocol holds great promise for the rapid diagnosis of bacteremia directly from a primary sample.
TI  - Global assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility among Gram-negative organisms collected from pediatric patients between 2004 and 2012: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) was designed to monitor  susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial agents among important pathogens. We report here on susceptibility among Gram-negative pathogens collected globally from pediatric patients between 2004 and 2012. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using guidelines published by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Most Enterobacteriaceae showed high rates of susceptibility (>95%) to amikacin, tigecycline, and the carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem); 90.8% of Acinetobacter baumannii isolates were susceptible to minocycline, and susceptibility rates were highest in North America, Europe, and Asia/Pacific Rim. Amikacin was the most active agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (90.4% susceptibility), with susceptibility rates being highest in North America. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were reported for 11.0% of Escherichia coli isolates and 24.2% of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates globally, with rates reaching as high as 25.7% in the Middle East and >43% in Africa and Latin America, respectively. Statistically significant (P<0.01) differences in susceptibility rates were noted between pediatric age groups (1 to 5 years, 6 to 12 years, or 13 to 17 years of age), globally and in some regions, for all pathogens except Haemophilus influenzae. Significant (P<0.01) differences were reported for all pathogens globally and in most regions, considerably more frequently, when pediatric and adult susceptibility results were compared. Amikacin, tigecycline, and the carbapenems were active in vitro against most Gram-negative pathogens collected from pediatric patients; A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa were susceptible to fewer antimicrobial agents. Susceptibility rates among isolates from pediatric patients were frequently different from those among isolates collected from adults.
TI  - Bacterial aetiology of otitis media in children in Pakistan aged 0-59 months; laboratory surveillance data from 2004 to 2013: comparison between before and after the introduction of Hib vaccination.
AB  - Background: Otitis media (OM) is a leading cause of childhood illness. In Pakistan, the estimated incidence of OM-associated hearing impairment is >40/10,000 population and OM-associated mortality is 50-79.9/10x106 population. No OM microbiology data are available from Pakistan since 2004. Objectives: To describe the microbiology of OM in children aged 0-59 months in Pakistan. Methods: Laboratory data on ear pus specimens taken from children seen between 2004 and 2013 were retrieved from the Laboratory Information Systems of the Aga Khan University and entered into Microsoft Excel and SPSS version 16.0. Results: Bacterial culture results from 277 specimens were analysed. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the organisms most commonly isolated, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Polymicrobial cultures significantly increased in the post-Hib vaccination period from 19.5% to 32.7% (P = 0.038). H. influenzae also increased significantly from 16.8% to 24.5% (P = 0.038). Conclusions: An increase in H. influenzae may reflect non-b capsular types (not determined in the study), or even capsular types from areas with low vaccine coverage. Increases in polymicrobial cultures and H. influenzae warrant further study.
TI  - The effect of long-term macrolide treatment on respiratory microbiota composition in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis: an analysis from the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled BLESS trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term macrolide treatment has proven benefit in inflammatory airways diseases, but whether it leads to changes in the composition of respiratory microbiota is unknown. We aimed to assess whether long-term, low-dose erythromycin treatment changes the composition of respiratory microbiota in people with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. METHODS: Microbiota composition was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of sputum samples from participants in the BLESS trial, a 12-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of twice-daily erythromycin ethylsuccinate (400 mg) in adult patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and at least two infective exacerbations in the preceding year. The primary outcome was within-patient change in respiratory microbiota composition (assessed by Bray-Curtis index) between baseline and week 48, comparing erythromycin with placebo. The BLESS trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12608000460303. FINDINGS: The BLESS trial took place between Oct 15, 2008, and Dec 14, 2011. Paired sputum samples were available from 86 randomly assigned patients, 42 in the placebo group and 44 in the erythromycin group. The change in microbiota composition between baseline and week 48 was significantly greater with erythromycin than with placebo (median Bray-Curtis score 0.52 [IQR 0.14-0.78] vs 0.68 [0.46-0.93]; median difference 0.16, 95% CI 0.01-0.33; p=0.03). In patients with baseline airway infection dominated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, erythromycin did not change microbiota composition significantly. In those with infection dominated by organisms other than P. aeruginosa, erythromycin caused a significant change in microbiota composition (p=0.03 [by analysis of similarity]), representing a reduced relative abundance of Haemophilus influenzae (35.3% [5.5-91.6] vs 6.7% [0.8-74.8]; median difference 12.6%, 95% CI 0.4-28.3; p=0.04; interaction p=0.02) and an increased relative abundance of P aeruginosa (0.02% [0.00-0.33] vs 0.13% [0.01-39.58]; median difference 6.6%, 95% CI 0.1-37.1; p=0.002; interaction p=0.45). Compared with placebo, erythromycin reduced the rate of pulmonary exacerbations over the 48 weeks of the study in patients with P. aeruginosa-dominated infection (median 1 [IQR 0-3] vs 3 [2-5]; median difference -2, 95% CI -4 to -1; p=0.01), but not in those without P. aeruginosa-dominated infection (1 [0-2] vs 1 [0-3]; median difference 0, -1 to 0; p=0.41; interaction p=0.04). INTERPRETATION: Long-term erythromycin treatment changes the composition of respiratory microbiota in patients with bronchiectasis. In patients without P. aeruginosa airway infection, erythromycin did not significantly reduce exacerbations and promoted displacement of H. influenzae by more macrolide-tolerant pathogens including P. aeruginosa. These findings argue for a cautious approach to chronic macrolide use in patients without P. aeruginosa airway infection. FUNDING: Mater Adult Respiratory Research Trust Fund.
TI  - A prospective study on bacterial and atypical etiology of acute exacerbation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  - AIM: The bacterial and atypical etiology of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was investigated and the diagnostic techniques used were compared among 92 hospitalized patients. MATERIALS & METHODS: Sputum specimens were investigated using culture and PCR, serological status evaluation was performed and the inflammatory profile was associated with the microbiological results. RESULTS & CONCLUSION: The majority of the patients (65.2%) had very severe airway obstruction. The most common bacteria were Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.9 and 14.1%, respectively). Acinetobacter baumannii- and P. aeruginosa-positive cultures were associated with prolonged hospitalization and severe airway obstruction (p = 0.03 and 0.031, respectively). Chlamydia pneumoniae or Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was diagnosed in four and two patients, respectively. Discrepant results were detected between PCR and serology, especially regarding C. pneumoniae.
TI  - The findings of a clinical surveillance bronchoalveolar lavage programme in pre-school patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests infection is present in the lower airways of young  children with cystic fibrosis (CF), even when clinically stable. Oropharyngeal samples (OPS) are typically used for airway surveillance in these children but have been shown to have low positive predictive values and low sensitivity in detecting lower airway infection when compared with the reference standard, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). METHODS: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of pathogens in lower airway samples detected as part of a pilot clinical BAL surveillance programme, in young children aged from one to six years old, and to ascertain if their detection resulted in a change in treatment. RESULTS: During the study 78 bronchoscopies were performed on 38 patients. The average age at the time of bronchoscopy was 2.7 years (range 0.3-7.0 year). A significant organism was detected in 58 (74.5%) BALs. Haemophilus influenzae was detected in 27 (34.6%) samples, 16 (20.5%) samples had Staphylococcus aureus, and nine (11.5%) had Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Change in treatment occurred after 46 (58.9%) BALs. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that, in young non-expectorating children with CF, routine surveillance bronchoscopy allows the detection of significant lower airway pathogens and provides the opportunity for targeted treatment of sub-clinical infection.
TI  - Eotaxin-3 (CCL26) exerts innate host defense activities that are modulated by mast cell proteases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: During bacterial infections of the airways, a Th1-profiled inflammation promotes the production of several host defense proteins and peptides with antibacterial activities including beta-defensins, ELR-negative CXC chemokines, and the cathelicidin LL-37. These are downregulated by Th2 cytokines of the allergic response. Instead, the eosinophil-recruiting chemokines eotaxin-1/CCL11, eotaxin-2/CCL24, and eotaxin-3/CCL26 are expressed. This study set out to investigate whether these chemokines could serve as innate host defense molecules during allergic inflammation. METHODS: Antibacterial activities of the eotaxins were investigated using viable count assays, electron microscopy, and methods assessing bacterial permeabilization. Fragments generated by mast cell proteases were characterized, and their potential antibacterial, receptor-activating, and lipopolysaccharide-neutralizing activities were investigated. RESULTS: CCL11, CCL24, and CCL26 all showed potent bactericidal activity, mediated through membrane disruption, against the airway pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CCL26 retained bactericidal activity in the presence of salt at physiologic concentrations, and the region holding the highest bactericidal activity was the cationic and amphipathic COOH-terminus. Proteolysis of CCL26 by chymase and tryptase, respectively, released distinct fragments of the COOH- and NH2 -terminal regions. The COOH-terminal fragment retained antibacterial activity while the NH2 -terminal had potent LPS-neutralizing properties in the order of CCL26 full-length protein. An identical fragment to NH2 -terminal fragment generated by tryptase was obtained after incubation with supernatants from activated mast cells. None of the fragments activated the CCR3-receptor. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the findings show that the eotaxins can contribute to host defense against common airway pathogens and that their activities are modulated by mast cell proteases.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of preparation Bioaron C.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of sirupus Bioaron C, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of Aloe arborescens, was tested against different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. The experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus Candida and on 18 reference strains (ATCC). The antimicrobial activity of Bioaron C (MBC and MFC) was determined at undiluted concentration. Bioaron C proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. At the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (MBC, MFC) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Parvimonas micra, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus anginosus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, already after 15 min. The MIC of Bioaron C against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. The great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. Bioaron C may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.
TI  - Evaluation of swabbing methods for estimating the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the upper respiratory tract: a cross sectional study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bacterial carriage in the upper respiratory tract is usually asymptomatic but can lead to respiratory tract infection (RTI), meningitis and septicaemia. We aimed to provide a baseline measure of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis carriage within the community. Self-swabbing and healthcare professional (HCP) swabbing were compared. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Individuals registered at 20 general practitioner practices within the Wessex Primary Care Research Network South West, UK. PARTICIPANTS: 10,448 individuals were invited to participate; 5394 within a self-swabbing group and 5054 within a HCP swabbing group. Self-swabbing invitees included 2405 individuals aged 0-4 years and 3349 individuals aged >/=5 years. HCP swabbing invitees included 1908 individuals aged 0-4 years and 3146 individuals aged >/=5 years. RESULTS: 1574 (15.1%) individuals participated, 1260 (23.4%, 95% CI 22.3% to 24.5%) undertaking self-swabbing and 314 (6.2%, 95% CI 5.5% to 6.9%) undertaking HCP-led swabbing. Participation was lower in young children and more deprived practice locations. Swab positivity rates were 34.8% (95% CI 32.2% to 37.4%) for self-taken nose swabs (NS), 19% (95% CI 16.8% to 21.2%) for self-taken whole mouth swabs (WMS), 25.2% (95% CI 20.4% to 30%) for nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and 33.4% (95% CI 28.2% to 38.6%) for HCP-taken WMS. Carriage rates of S. aureus were highest in NS (21.3%). S. pneumoniae carriage was highest in NS (11%) and NPS (7.4%). M. catarrhalis carriage was highest in HCP-taken WMS (28.8%). H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa carriage were similar between swab types. N. meningitidis was not detected in any swab. Age and recent RTI affected carriage of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Participant costs were lower for self-swabbing ( pound41.21) versus HCP swabbing ( pound69.66). CONCLUSIONS: Higher participation and lower costs of self-swabbing as well as sensitivity of self-swabbing favour this method for use in large population-based respiratory carriage studies.
TI  - Validation of sputum Gram stain for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and healthcare-associated pneumonia: a prospective observational study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The usefulness of sputum Gram stain in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is controversial. There has been no study to evaluate the diagnostic value of this method in patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of sputum Gram stain in etiological diagnosis and pathogen-targeted antibiotic treatment of CAP and HCAP. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study on hospitalized patients with pneumonia admitted to our hospital from August 2010 to July 2012. Before administering antibiotics on admission, Gram stain was performed and examined by trained physicians immediately after sputum samples were obtained. We analyzed the quality of sputum samples and the diagnostic performance of Gram stain. We also compared pathogen-targeted antibiotic treatment guided by sputum Gram stain with empirical treatment. RESULTS: Of 670 patients with pneumonia, 328 were CAP and 342 were HCAP. Sputum samples were obtained from 591 patients, of these 478 samples were good quality. The sensitivity and specificity of sputum Gram stain were 62.5% and 91.5% for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 60.9% and 95.1% for Haemophilus influenzae, 68.2% and 96.1% for Moraxella catarrhalis, 39.5% and 98.2% for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 22.2% and 99.8% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9.1% and 100% for Staphylococcus aureus. The diagnostic yield decreased in patients who had received antibiotics or patients with suspected aspiration pneumonia. Pathogen-targeted treatment provided similar efficacy with a decrease in adverse events compared to empirical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Sputum Gram stain is highly specific for the etiologic diagnosis and useful in guiding pathogen-targeted antibiotic treatment of CAP and HCAP.
TI  - Early respiratory infection is associated with reduced spirometry in children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - RATIONALE: Pulmonary inflammation, infection, and structural lung disease occur early in life in children with cystic fibrosis. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that the presence of these markers of cystic fibrosis lung disease in the first 2 years of life would be associated with reduced lung function in childhood. METHODS: Lung function (forced expiratory volume in the first three-quarters of a second [FEV0.75], FVC) was assessed in individuals with cystic fibrosis diagnosed after newborn screening and healthy subjects during infancy (0-2 yr) and again at early school age (4-8 yr). Individuals with cystic fibrosis underwent annual bronchoalveolar lavage fluid examination, and chest computed tomography. We examined which clinical outcomes (pulmonary inflammation, infection, structural lung disease, respiratory hospitalizations, antibiotic prophylaxis) measured in the first 2 years of life were associated with reduced lung function in infants and young children with cystic fibrosis, using a mixed effects model. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Children with cystic fibrosis (n = 56) had 8.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], -15.9 to -6.6; P = 0.04) lower FEV0.75 compared with healthy subjects (n = 18). Detection of proinflammatory bacterial pathogens (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Aspergillus species, Streptococcus pneumoniae) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was associated with clinically significant reductions in FEV0.75 (ranging between 11.3 and 15.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The onset of lung disease in infancy, specifically the occurrence of lower respiratory tract infection, is associated with low lung function in young children with cystic fibrosis. Deficits in lung function measured in infancy persist into childhood, emphasizing the need for targeted therapeutic interventions in infancy to maximize functional outcomes later in life.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia after cardiac surgery: a meta-analysis and systematic review.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common and serious nosocomial infection that threatens patients who have undergone cardiac surgery. This article summarizes its clinical characteristics and provides theoretical evidence for prevention and treatment. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Knowledge databases and by manual search. Data involving the prevalence, etiology, risk factors, or clinical outcomes were extracted for systematic review and meta-analysis. RESULTS: Eleven studies on VAP after cardiac surgery were included. When the results were merged the VAP rate was 21.27/1000 ventilator-days. The prevalence reached 6.37% of all patients and 35.2% of patients who were on mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. Among the isolated pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa had the highest detection rate, with an average of 23.19%, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (20.15%), Haemophilus influenzae (19.53%), Acinetobacter baumannii (10.68%), Escherichia coli (10.18%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.52%), and Candida albicans (7.20%). Risk factors were also analyzed. We found that New York Heart Association cardiac function class IV, pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease, renal disease, emergency surgery, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, cardiopulmonary bypass time, aortic crossclamp time, mechanical ventilation time, reintervention, and reintubation were closely related to the occurrence of VAP; there was no association with gender and diabetes mellitus. Once patients had VAP, mortality and length of stay in the intensive care unit were significantly increased. CONCLUSIONS: VAP in patients after cardiac surgery is common and has a poor prognosis. It is mainly caused by gram-negative bacteria, and could be affected by a series of factors.
TI  - Non cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis: A longitudinal retrospective observational cohort study of Pseudomonas persistence and resistance.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The hallmark of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis is recurrent bronchial infection, yet there are significant gaps in our understanding of pathogen persistence, resistance and exacerbation frequencies. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a key pathogen thought to be a marker of disease severity and progression, yet little is known if the infection risk is seen in those with milder disease or if there is any potential for eradication. These data are important in determining risk stratification and follow up. METHODS AND PATIENT COHORT: A retrospective review of consecutive adult patients attending a specialist UK bronchiectasis clinic over a two-year recruitment period between July 2007 and June 2009 was performed. Analysis of our primary outcome, longitudinal microbiological status, was recorded based on routine clinical follow-up through to data capture point or date of death. Patients were stratified by lung function and infecting organism. RESULTS: 155 patients (mean (SD) age 62.2 (12.4) years; 60.1% female) were identified from clinic records with microbiological data for a median (IQR) follow up duration of 46 (35-62) months. Baseline mean FEV1% predicted was 60.6% (24.8) with mean exacerbation frequency of 4.42/year; 73.6% reported 3 or more exacerbations/year. Haemophilus influenzae was isolated in 90 (58.1%) patients and P. aeruginosa in 78 (50.3%) patients with persistent infection in 51 (56.7%) H. influenzae and 47 (60.3%) P. aeruginosa, respectively. Of the P. aeruginosa colonised patients, 16 (34%) became culture negative on follow-up with a mean of 5.2 negative sputum cultures/patient. P. aeruginosa was isolated from 5 out of 39 patients (12.8%) with minimal airflow limitation as compared to 18 out of 38 patients (47.4%) with severe airflow limitation. Although hospital admissions were significantly higher in the P. aeruginosa infected group (1.3 vs. 0.7 admissions per annum, p = 0.035), overall exacerbation rates were the same (4.6 vs. 4.3, p = 0.58). Independent predictors of P. aeruginosa colonisation were low FEV1% predicted (OR 2.46; 95% CI 1.27-4.77) and polymicrobial colonisation (OR 4.07; 95% CI 1.56-10.58). 17 (11%) patients were infected with multi-resistant strains; however, none were pan-resistant. CONCLUSIONS: P. aeruginosa is associated with greater persistent infection rates and more hospital admissions than H. influenzae. Exacerbation rates, however, were similar; therefore H. influenzae causes significant out-patient morbidity. P. aeruginosa infection occurs across all strata of lung function impairment but is infrequently multi-resistant in bronchiectasis. Careful microbiology follow up is required even in those with well-preserved lung function.
TI  - Community acquired bacterial pneumonia: aetiology, laboratory detection and antibiotic susceptibility pattern.
AB  - This cross sectional study was conducted to identify the common bacterial causes  of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) from sputum and blood by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and to evaluate the effectiveness of these tests. A total of 105 sputum and blood samples were collected from patients with pneumonia on clinical suspicion. Common causative bacterial agents of pneumonia were detected by Gram staining, cultures, biochemical tests and PCR. Among 55 sputum culture positive cases, a majority (61.82%) of the patients were in the age group between 21-50 years and the ratio between male and female was 2.5:1. Most (61.90%) of the cases were from the lower socio-economic group. Out of 105 samples, 23 (37.12%) were positive by Gram stain, 29 (27.62%) yielded growth in culture media and 37 (35.24%) were positive by PCR for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common aetiological agent (19.05%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.33%), Haemophilus influenzae (8.57%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.71%). Multiplex PCR is a useful technique for rapid diagnosis of bacterial causes of pneumonia directly from sputum and blood. Considering culture as a gold standard, the sensitivity of PCR was 96.55% and specificity was 88.15%. More than 80% of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were found to be sensitive to ampicillin, amoxycillinclavulanate, and ceftriaxone. Susceptibilities to other antimicrobials ranged from 65% for azithromycin to 70% for levofloxacin. On the other hand, the Gram negative organisms were more sensitive to meropenem, ceftriaxone, amoxycillin-clavulanate and amikacin.
TI  - Antimicrobial treatment of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.
AB  - Bronchiectasis unrelated to cystic fibrosis is characterized by chronic wet or productive cough, recurrent exacerbations and irreversible bronchial dilatation. After antibiotics and vaccines became available and living standards in affluent countries improved, its resulting reduced prevalence meant bronchiectasis was considered an 'orphan disease'. This perception has changed recently with increasing use of CT scans to diagnose bronchiectasis, including in those with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or 'difficult to control' asthma, and adds to its already known importance in non-affluent countries and disadvantaged Indigenous communities. Following years of neglect, there is renewed interest in identifying the pathogenetic mechanisms of bronchiectasis, including the role of infection, and conducting clinical trials. This is providing much needed evidence to guide antimicrobial therapy, which has relied previously upon extrapolating treatments used in cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. While many knowledge gaps and management challenges remain, the future is improving for patients with bronchiectasis.
TI  - [Surveillance report of drug-resistant bacteria from 2007 to 2012 in Saga Prefecture, Japan (the second report)].
AB  - Drug-resistant bacteria are a problematic issue in Japan. Surveillance of drug-resistant bacteria is important because the frequency of isolation and kinds of such bacteria vary between hospitals and local areas. This study summarizes the results of detection of drug-resistant bacteria in Saga Prefecture from July 2007 to June 2012. Data presented in this study were collected through questionnaire survey that was conducted in 12 hospitals. Frequency of drug-resistant bacteria are as follows: 62.5% of Staphylococcus aureus was methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA); 62.2% of Streptococcus pneumoniae was penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP) or penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP); 26.4% of Haemophilus influenzae was beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR); 0.5% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) P. aeruginosa; 0.5% of P. aeruginosa was multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa (MDRP); 12.9% and 5.1% of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively, were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing organisms. While the isolation frequencies of MRSA and PISP/PRSP were unchanged, those of BLNAR, ESBL producing E. coli and ESBL producing K. pneumoniae raised from 15.4% to 34.2%, from 5.7% to 18.4% and from 2.6% to 8.2%, respectively, over the past 5 years. The frequencies of isolation of MDRP and two drug resistant P. aeruginosa declined. This study revealed that the overall trend in the long-term changes of isolation frequency of drug-resistant bacteria in Saga Prefecture is similar to the trend in the national data. It also showed that the frequency and kinds of drug-resistant bacteria are variable between hospitals and local areas. Further study, such as examination of the usage and MIC value of antimicrobial drugs, will enable us to gain more detailed information on the drug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa triggers CFTR-mediated airway surface liquid secretion in  swine trachea.
AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding for the anion channel cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Several organs are affected in CF, but most of the morbidity and mortality comes from lung disease. Recent data show that the initial consequence of CFTR mutation is the failure to eradicate bacteria before the development of inflammation and airway remodeling. Bacterial clearance depends on a layer of airway surface liquid (ASL) consisting of both a mucus layer that traps, kills, and inactivates bacteria and a periciliary liquid layer that keeps the mucus at an optimum distance from the underlying epithelia, to maximize ciliary motility and clearance of bacteria. The airways in CF patients and animal models of CF demonstrate abnormal ASL secretion and reduced antimicrobial properties. Thus, it has been proposed that abnormal ASL secretion in response to bacteria may facilitate the development of the infection and inflammation that characterize CF airway disease. Whether the inhalation of bacteria triggers ASL secretion, and the role of CFTR, have never been tested, however. We developed a synchrotron-based imaging technique to visualize the ASL layer and measure the effect of bacteria on ASL secretion. We show that the introduction of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other bacteria into the lumen of intact isolated swine tracheas triggers CFTR-dependent ASL secretion by the submucosal glands. This response requires expression of the bacterial protein flagellin. In patients with CF, the inhalation of bacteria would fail to trigger ASL secretion, leading to infection and inflammation.
TI  - [Colonization properties of opportunistic bacteria isolated from children with pneumonia].
AB  - AIM: Evaluation of phenotypes and pathogenicity factors of 476 opportunistic bacteria isolated from respiratory samples of 973 children with community-acquired pneumonia and 36 children without respiratory infection symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative method of tracheal aspirate and nasopharyngeal swab seeding into certified nutrient media was used, identification was carried out according to standard techniques. RESULTS: Adhesive, "anti-interferon", anti-lysozyme and inherent bactericidal activity of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. were established to ensure in combination with known aggression factors their colonization advantage compared with other pneumopathogens. Adhesion indexes of Gram-negative bacteria lower than 2.5 are shown as markers of invasive strains. Anti-lysozyme activity level lower than 2.14 microg/ml and lack of "anti-interferon" activity characterize non-invasive opportunistic bacteria strains. CONCLUSION: The detected phenotypic features of opportunistic bacteria may be used in clinical practice for evaluatio of etiologic importance of microorganisms isolated from tracheal aspirate in pneumonia patients.
TI  - Predominant pathogen competition and core microbiota divergence in chronic airway infection.
AB  - Chronic bacterial lung infections associated with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis represent a substantial and growing health-care burden. Where Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the numerically dominant species within these infections, prognosis is significantly worse. However, in many individuals, Haemophilus influenzae predominates, a scenario associated with less severe disease. The mechanisms that determine which pathogen is most abundant are not known. We hypothesised that the distribution of H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa would be consistent with strong interspecific competition effects. Further, we hypothesised that where P. aeruginosa is predominant, it is associated with a distinct 'accessory microbiota' that reflects a significant interaction between this pathogen and the wider bacterial community. To test these hypotheses, we analysed 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing data generated previously from 60 adult bronchiectasis patients, whose airway microbiota was dominated by either P. aeruginosa or H. influenzae. The relative abundances of the two dominant species in their respective groups were not significantly different, and when present in the opposite pathogen group the two species were found to be in very low abundance, if at all. These findings are consistent with strong competition effects, moving towards competitive exclusion. Ordination analysis indicated that the distribution of the core microbiota associated with each pathogen, readjusted after removal of the dominant species, was significantly divergent (analysis of similarity (ANOSIM), R=0.07, P=0.019). Taken together, these findings suggest that both interspecific competition and also direct and/or indirect interactions between the predominant species and the wider bacterial community may contribute to the predominance of P. aeruginosa in a subset of bronchiectasis lung infections.
TI  - MALDI-TOF: a useful tool for laboratory identification of uncommon glucose non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria associated with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - The predisposition of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) for recurrent pulmonary  infections can result in poor prognosis of the disease. Although the clinical significance in CF of micro-organisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is well established, the implication of uncommon glucose non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli (UGNF-GNB) in respiratory samples from CF patients is still unclear. Because of limitations of traditional methods used in most clinical laboratories, the accurate identification of these microbes is a challenge. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) is an alternative tool for efficient identification of bacteria. This was a retrospective study to evaluate different identification methods in a collection of UGNF-GNB isolated from children with CF during a period of three years. The performance of MALDI-TOF was compared to that of 16S rDNA gene sequencing and to a conventional and automated phenotypic identification. The discriminatory power of MALDI-TOF (75.0 % agreement) was superior to automated techniques (67.1 % agreement) and to conventional phenotypical identification (50.0 % agreement). MALDI-TOF also demonstrated high accuracy in identifying Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Chryseobacterium indologenes, but had limited utility in identifying Pandoraea spp. and some species of Acinetobacter and Chryseobacterium (other than C. indologenes). Although MALDI-TOF identified only 75 % of the isolates in comparison with 16S rDNA gene sequencing, the prompt identification and high discriminatory power exhibited by MALDI-TOF make it a useful tool for the characterization of micro-organisms that are difficult to identify using routine methods.
TI  - [Nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2012].
AB  - The nationwide surveillance of antibacterial susceptibility to meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates during 2012 in Japan was conducted. A total of 2985 strains including 955 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1782 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 248 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 31 medical institutions were examined. The results were as follows; 1. MEPM was more active than the other carbapenem antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae. MEPM was also active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). 2. Of all species tested, there were no species, which MIC90 of MEPM was more than 4-fold higher than those in our previous studies in 2009 or 2006. Therefore, the tendency to increase in antimicrobial resistance rates was not observed. 3. MEPM resistance against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 17.8% (56/315 strains). Compared to our previous results, it was the lowest than that in 2006 and 2009. 4. Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, and multi-drug-resistant Acinetobacter species, which emerged in worldwide, were not observed. 5. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 6.2% (59/951 strains) in enterobacteriaceae, which increased compared with that of our previous studies in 2009 or before. Whereas, the proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 1.6% (5/315 strains) in P. aeruginosa, which was stable. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem for serious infections treatment at present, 17 years passed after available for commercial use in Japan.
TI  - Bacterial spectrum and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in acquired and connatal lacrimal duct stenosis.
AB  - PURPOSE: (1) To determine the current bacteriological spectrum in connatal and acquired lacrimal duct obstruction (cLDO and aLDO, respectively) and (2) to analyze the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the recovered isolates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, 463 samples (30% bilateral LDO) were obtained from the lacrimal ducts of 132 infants and 192 adult patients with symptomatic LDO between 2007 and 2012 at a tertiary eye-care center. The samples were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, which were subsequently identified using standard microbiological techniques. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for each isolate using the disk diffusion method. Data were analyzed using SPSS and chi-square test for significance testing. RESULTS: (1) Among 463 samples investigated, 333 samples were positive, i.e. at least one bacterial isolate was recovered. A total of 72% were recovered (97% of samples from children and 56% of samples from adults), yielding a total of 654 bacterial isolates. Co-colonization with up to five different bacterial species was observed in a large proportion of the samples from children (87%), but in only 20% of those from adults and with a maximum of three different bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria were identified in 72% of the positive samples in both aLDO and cLDO. The most common Gram-positive species in cLDO was Streptococcus pneumoniae (29%), while that in cLDO was Staphylococcus aureus (60%). The most prevalent Gram-negative species were Moraxella catarrhalis (8%) and Haemophilus influenzae (9%) in cLDO and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in aLDO (12%). (2) Susceptibility testing revealed chloramphenicol to be the most active antibiotic with resistance rates of 3% in cLDO and 6% in aLDO, followed by ciprofloxacin (1% and 6%). Erythromycin and gentamicin were the least active of all, with resistances of 41% and 22%, respectively, in cLDO, and 23% and 11% in aLDO. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial colonization occurs regularly in LDO, with Gram-positive bacteria being found in 97% of cLDO samples and 56% of aLDO samples. A remarkable number of different species were found to co-colonize in cLDO. The most common bacteria in LDO are highly susceptible in vitro to chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Polymicrobial airway bacterial communities in adult bronchiectasis patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic airway infection contributes to the underlying pathogenesis of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFBr). In contrast to other chronic airway infections, associated with COPD and CF bronchiectasis, where polymicrobial communities have been implicated in lung damage due to the vicious circle of recurrent bacterial infections and inflammation, there is sparse information on the composition of bacterial communities in NCFBr. Seventy consecutive patients were recruited from an outpatient adult NCFBr clinic. Bacterial communities in sputum samples were analysed by culture and pyrosequencing approaches. Bacterial sequences were analysed using partial least square discrimination analyses to investigate trends in community composition and identify those taxa that contribute most to community variation. RESULTS: The lower airway in NCFBr is dominated by three bacterial taxa Pasteurellaceae, Streptococcaceae and Pseudomonadaceae. Moreover, the bacterial community is much more diverse than indicated by culture and contains significant numbers of other genera including anaerobic Prevotellaceae, Veillonellaceae and Actinomycetaceae. We found particular taxa are correlated with different clinical states, 27 taxa were associated with acute exacerbations, whereas 11 taxa correlated with stable clinical states. We were unable to demonstrate a significant effect of antibiotic therapy, gender, or lung function on the diversity of the bacterial community. However, presence of clinically significant culturable taxa; particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae correlated with a significant change in the diversity of the bacterial community in the lung. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that acute exacerbations, the frequency of exacerbation and episodes of clinical stability are correlated, in some patients, with a significantly different bacterial community structure, that are associated with a presence of particular taxa in the NCFBr lung. Moreover, there appears to be an inverse relationship between the abundance of P. aeruginosa and that of of H. influenzae within the NCFBr lung bacterial community. This interaction requires further exploration.
TI  - Emerging cystic fibrosis pathogens and the microbiome.
AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF) respiratory infection is characterised by the presence of typical human bacterial pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus. Less typical pathogens such as Burkholderia, Stenotrophomonas, Achromobacter, Pandorea and Ralstonia have emerged as problematic infections which are largely unique to people with CF. Using molecular methods, two groups of anaerobic bacteria Prevotella species and the Streptococcus milleri group have also recently been shown to be highly prevalent in CF sputum. Collectively, the diversity of microorganisms present in respiratory specimens has been designated the CF microbiome. The challenges posed by emerging CF pathogens and a microbiome-based view of CF infection are discussed in terms of their impact on clinical outcome, diagnosis and therapy.
TI  - Ceftobiprole activity against over 60,000 clinical bacterial pathogens isolated in Europe, Turkey, and Israel from 2005 to 2010.
AB  - Ceftobiprole medocaril is a newly approved drug in Europe for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) (excluding patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia but including ventilated HAP patients) and community-acquired pneumonia in adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole against prevalent Gram-positive and -negative pathogens isolated in Europe, Turkey, and Israel during 2005 through 2010. A total of 60,084 consecutive, nonduplicate isolates from a wide variety of infections were collected from 33 medical centers. Species identification was confirmed, and all isolates were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. Ceftobiprole had high activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (100.0% susceptible), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (99.3% susceptible), with MIC90 values of 0.25, 0.12, </= 0.06, and 0.5 mug/ml, respectively. Ceftobiprole was active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (98.3% susceptible) and methicillin-resistant CoNS, having a MIC90 of 2 mug/ml. Ceftobiprole was active against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC50/90, 0.5/4 mug/ml) but not against most Enterococcus faecium isolates. Ceftobiprole was very potent against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae (87.3% susceptible), with >80% inhibited at </= 0.12 mug/ml. The potency of ceftobiprole against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC50/90, 2/>8 mug/ml; 64.6% at MIC values of </= 4 mug/ml) was similar to that of ceftazidime (MIC50/90, 2/>16 mug/ml; 75.4% susceptible), but limited activity was observed against Acinetobacter spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. High activity was also observed against all Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, </= 0.06 mug/ml) and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC50/90, </= 0.06/0.25 mug/ml) isolates. Ceftobiprole demonstrated a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against this very large longitudinal sample of contemporary pathogens.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2006)].
AB  - From October 2006 to September 2007, we collected the specimen from 356 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 14 institutions in Japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. Of 414 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in infection, 407 strains were examined. The isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 64, Streptococcus pneumoniae 96, Haemophilus influenzae 87, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 52, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 11, Klebsiella pneumoniae 20, and Moraxella catarrhalis 44. Of 64 S. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-susceptible S. aureus: MSSA) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) were 27 (42.2%) and 37 (57.8%) strains, respectively. Against MSSA, imipenem had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. Against MRSA, vancomycin and linezolid showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/ml. Carbapenems showed the most potent activities against S. pneumoniae and in particular, panipenem inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. Imipenem and faropenem also had a preferable activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. In contrast, there were high-resistant strains (MIC: over 128 microg/ml) for erythromycin (45.8%) and clindamycin (20.8%). Against H. influenzae, levofloxacin showed the most potent activity and its MIC90 was 0.063 microg/ml or less. Meropenem showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid) and its MIC90 was 0.5 microg/ml. Against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid), tobramycin had the most potent activity and its MIC90 was 2 microg/ml. Against K. pneumoniae, cefozopran was the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. Also, all the antibacterial agents except ampicillin generally showed a potent activity against M. catarrhalis and the MIC90 of them were 2 microg/ml or less. The approximately half the number (50.6%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. Bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for 49.2% and 28.1% of all the respiratory infections, respectively. The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were S. pneumoniae (29.2%), S. aureus (20.8%), and H. influenzae (12.9%). H. influenzae (25.0%) and P. aeruginosa (21.7%) also were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. Before the antibacterial agent administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were S. pneumoniae (27.5%) and H. influenzae (22.5%). The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients treated with macrolides was P. aeruginosa, and its isolation frequently was 39.4%.
TI  - [In vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates in 2012].
AB  - In vitro activity of sitafloxacin (STFX) and various oral antimicrobial agents against bacterial isolates recovered from clinical specimens between January and December 2012, at different healthcare facilities in Japan was evaluated. A total of 1,620 isolates including aerobic and anaerobic organisms were available for the susceptibility testing using the microbroth dilution methods recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The minimum inhibitory concentration of STFX at which 90% of isolates (MIC90) was 0.5 microg/mL for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and was 2 times lower than that of garenoxacin (GRNX), 4 times lower than that of moxifloxacin (MFLX), and 16 times lower than that of levofloxacin (LVFX). STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 microg/mL or less. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.03 microg/mL and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 4 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, the MIC90 of STFX was 0.06 microg/mL and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 8 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 2 microg/mL for Enterococcus faecalis, and was 4 times lower than that of GRNX, 8 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for Escherichia coli was 2 microg/mL, and the MIC90(s) of other 10 species of Enterobacteriaceae which were the lowest values of the quinolones tested ranged from 0.03 to 1 microg/mL. The MIC90 of STFX for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates recovered from urinary infections was 4 microg/mL and was 32 times lower than those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for P. aeruginosa isolates recovered from respiratory infections was 4 microg/mL and was 8 to 16 times lower than those of GRNX, MFLX, and LVFX. STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Haemophilus influenzae at 0.004 microg/mL or less, and was 4 times lower than that of GRNX, 16 times lower than that of MFLX, and 8 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.015 microg/mL for Moraxella catarrhalis, and was equal to that of GRNX, 4 times lower than those of MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90(s) of STFX ranged from 0.03 to 0.25 microg/mL for all the species of anaerobic bacteria and were the lowest values of all the antimicrobial agents tested. In conclusion, the activity of STFX against Gram-positive cocci was comparable or superior to those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. STFX showed the most potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria of all the antimicrobial agents tested in this study.
TI  - The influence of stents on microbial colonization of the airway in children after slide tracheoplasty: a 14-year single-center experience.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study describes the microbial colonization profile of the airway in children after slide tracheoplasty (STP) with and without stents, and compares colonization to children undergoing cardiothoracic surgical procedures without airway related disease. METHODS: A 14-year retrospective single case note review was performed on patients undergoing STP and stent insertion. Nose and throat (NT) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens were analyzed for microbial profile and expressed as cumulative mean microorganisms per patient (MMP). RESULTS: Forty-three patients (median age +/- SD 15.02 +/- 31.76 months) underwent STP and 141 patients underwent cardiothoracic but no airway surgery (median age +/- SD 31.7 +/- 47.2 months). Sixteen patients required a stent after STP. One-hundred seventy-two positive microbial specimens were identified. The predominant 6 microorganisms were (1) Staphylococcus aureus; (2) Pseudomonas aeruginosa; (3) Haemophilus influenzae not type B; (4) Coliforms; (5) Streptococcus pneumoniae; and (6) Candida Albicans, and accounted for 128 (74%) of all positive specimens found. Children with stents had more MMP compared to children without stents after STP [4.06 +/- 2.38 and 2.04 +/- 2.24 MMP (P < 0.001), respectively]. Both groups of children after STP had more MMP compared to the control group (P < 0.001). Children with stents had more microbial colonization of their lower respiratory tract compared to their upper respiratory tract (3.36 +/- 2.02 and 1.36 +/- 0.93 MMP (P < 0.01) respectively). Staphylococcus aureus colonization of the lower respiratory tract was significantly higher in children with stents compared to children without stents after STP [0.5 and 0.15 MMP (P < 0.05) respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates airway surgery and the subsequent use of stents to be a significant risk factor for microbial colonization of the airway in children. More specifically airway stents appear to increase colonization in the distal airway, which appears unrelated to that of the upper respiratory tract.
TI  - Impact of Staphylococcus aureus on pathogenesis in polymicrobial infections.
AB  - Polymicrobial infections involving Staphylococcus aureus exhibit enhanced disease severity and morbidity. We reviewed the nature of polymicrobial interactions between S. aureus and other bacterial, fungal, and viral cocolonizers. Microbes that were frequently recovered from the infection site with S. aureus are Haemophilus influenzae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Corynebacterium sp., Lactobacillus sp., Candida albicans, and influenza virus. Detailed analyses of several in vitro and in vivo observations demonstrate that S. aureus exhibits cooperative relations with C. albicans, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, and influenza virus and competitive relations with P. aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Lactobacillus sp., and Corynebacterium sp. Interactions of both types influence changes in S. aureus that alter its characteristics in terms of colony formation, protein expression, pathogenicity, and antibiotic susceptibility.
TI  - In vitro interaction of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with human middle ear epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Otitis media (OM) is an inflammation of the middle ear which can be acute or chronic. Acute OM is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). CSOM is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the middle ear characterized by infection and discharge. The survivors often suffer from hearing loss and neurological sequelae. However, no information is available regarding the interaction of P. aeruginosa with human middle ear epithelial cells (HMEECs). METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS: In the present investigation, we demonstrate that P. aeruginosa is able to enter and survive inside HMEECs via an uptake mechanism that is dependent on microtubule and actin microfilaments. The actin microfilament disrupting agent as well as microtubule inhibitors exhibited significant decrease in invasion of HMEECs by P. aeruginosa. Confocal microscopy demonstrated F-actin condensation associated with bacterial entry. This recruitment of F-actin was transient and returned to normal distribution after bacterial internalization. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of bacteria on the surface of HMEECs, and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the internalization of P. aeruginosa located in the plasma membrane-bound vacuoles. We observed a significant decrease in cell invasion of OprF mutant compared to the wild-type strain. P. aeruginosa induced cytotoxicity, as demonstrated by the determination of lactate dehydrogenase levels in culture supernatants of infected HMEECs and by a fluorescent dye-based assay. Interestingly, OprF mutant showed little cell damage compared to wild-type P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: This study deciphered the key events in the interaction of P. aeruginosa with HMEECs in vitro and highlighted the role of bacterial outer membrane protein, OprF, in this process. Understanding the molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of CSOM will help in identifying novel targets to design effective therapeutic strategies and to prevent hearing loss.
TI  - A novel microbiota stratification system predicts future exacerbations in bronchiectasis.
AB  - RATIONALE: Although airway microbiota composition correlates with clinical measures in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, these data are unlikely to provide useful prognostic information at the individual patient level. A system enabling microbiota data to be applied clinically would represent a substantial translational advance. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to determine whether stratification of patients according to the predominant microbiota taxon can provide improved clinical insight compared with standard diagnostics. METHODS: The presence of bacterial respiratory pathogens was assessed in induced sputum from 107 adult patients by culture, quantitative PCR, and, in 96 samples, by ribosomal gene pyrosequencing. Prospective analysis was performed on samples from 42 of these patients. Microbiological data were correlated with concurrent clinical measures and subsequent outcomes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Microbiota analysis defined three groups: Pseudomonas aeruginosa dominated (n = 26), Haemophilus influenzae dominated (n = 34), and other taxa dominated (n = 36). Patients with P. aeruginosa- and H. influenzae-dominated communities had significantly worse lung function, higher serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), and higher sputum levels of IL-8 and IL-1beta. Predominance of P. aeruginosa, followed by Veillonella species, was the best predictor of future exacerbation frequency, with H. influenzae-dominated communities having significantly fewer episodes. Detection of P. aeruginosa was associated with poor lung function and exacerbation frequency, irrespective of analytical strategy. Quantitative PCR revealed significant correlations between H. influenzae levels and sputum IL-8, IL-1beta, and serum CRP. Genus richness was negatively correlated with 24-hour sputum weight, age, serum CRP, sputum IL-1beta, and IL-8. CONCLUSIONS: Stratification of patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis on the basis of predominant bacterial taxa is more clinically informative than either conventional culture or quantitative PCR-based analysis. Further investigation is now required to assess the mechanistic basis of these associations.
TI  - The impact of respiratory tract infections on the nutritional state of children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening, autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by intestinal malabsorption, impaired growth and lung disease. Recurrent pulmonary infections in children with CF are often associated with nutritional deficiencies. AIM: To emphasize the effects of recurrent pulmonary infections on nutritional status in children with CF. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 27 patients diagnosed with CF between 1994 and 2011 in the 3rd Pediatric Clinic of the Iasi "Saint Mary" Children's Hospital. The nutritional status was assessed according to ponderal index (PI), body mass index (BMI), Z score for weight and waist. Correlations between the age of onset of symptoms, age at diagnosis, and frequency of infectious episodes, identified bacterial agents and nutritional status were established. RESULTS: Patients aged between 3 months old and 17 years old with an average of 49.48 months +/- 9.83DS; sex ratio was 1.7:1. The patients were diagnosed late, one month to 112 months (average 41.11 months +/- 9.4DS) from the first symptoms until the moment of diagnosis. The clinical forms of CF in the study group were: predominantly respiratory manifestations in 48.14% of cases, and the mixed type, with both respiratory and digestive symptoms, in 18.52% of cases. Delayed weight and/or height gains were identified in 85.19% of cases. The etiologic agents involved in pulmonary infections were Staphylococus aureus (48.14%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (33.33%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (18.51%), Haemophilus influenzae (14.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.10%), Moraxella catarrhalis (7,40%), Streptococcus pneutmoniae (7.40%), Neisseria sica (7.40%). Pulmonary infections caused by Staphylococus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were more often associated with nutritional status abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: In small children with CF pulmonary infections due to various causative agents cause a slow rate of growth (both weight and height). Good nutrition and adequate early treatment of pulmonary infections are beneficial for the general state of affected children and are very important in maintaining their health.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative organisms isolated from patients hospitalized in intensive care units in United States and European hospitals (2009-2011).
AB  - Treatment of infections in the intensive care unit (ICU) represents a great challenge, especially those caused by Gram-negative organisms. Rapid introduction of appropriate antimicrobial therapy is crucial to reduce mortality; resistance rates in the ICU can be elevated due to antimicrobial selection pressure. We evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients hospitalized in ICUs (ICU patients). The isolates were consecutively collected as part of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program from January 2009 to December 2011 and tested for susceptibility to multiple antimicrobial agents at a central laboratory by reference broth microdilution methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility results for 5989 bacterial isolates from ICU patients (3445 from the United States [USA] and 2544 from Europe [EU]) were analyzed and compared to those of 17,244 organisms from non-ICU patients (9271 from USA and 7973 from EU). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequently isolated organisms from ICU patients, followed by Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter spp., and Proteus mirabilis. Susceptibility rates were generally lower among ICU isolates compared to non-ICU organisms. E. coli isolates from ICU patients exhibited elevated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-phenotype rates (13.7% in USA and 16.6% in EU); furthermore, only amikacin (90.5-94.8% susceptibility), colistin (99.8-100.0% inhibited at </=2 mug/mL), imipenem (95.5-96.0%), meropenem (95.4-95.8%), and tigecycline (96.3-98.0%) exhibited good activity against Klebsiella spp. ESBL-phenotype rates have increased among both E. coli and Klebsiella spp. from ICU patients in the USA and in Europe, with the most noticeable increase among Klebsiella spp. from Europe (from 27.5% in 2009 to 41.8% in 2011; P = 0.015 and odds ratio = 0.89 [95% confidence interval, 1.13-3.18]). Meropenem susceptibility among Klebsiella spp. improved slightly in the USA but decreased markedly in Europe from 100.0% in 2009 to 89.7% in 2011. Only colistin (99.4% susceptible) and amikacin (97.3% in USA and 84.9% in EU) exhibited good activity against P. aeruginosa strains from ICU patients. The greatest differences in susceptibility rates between P. aeruginosa strains from ICU and non-ICU patients were observed for the anti-pseudomonal beta-lactams, such as ceftazidime, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam. The results of this study (101 medical centers) highlight major antimicrobial coverage problems and trends in antimicrobial resistance for USA and EU ICU patient isolates.
TI  - Aspiration in head and neck cancer patients: a single centre experience of clinical profile, bacterial isolates and antibiotic sensitivity pattern.
AB  - Most patients with head and neck cancer have dysphagia and are at increased risk  of having aspiration and subsequent pneumonia. It can cause prolonged hospitalization, treatment delay and/or interruption and mortality in cancer patients. The treatment of these infections often relies on empirical antibiotics based on local microbiology and antibiotic sensitivity patterns. The aim of present study is to analyse respiratory tract pathogens isolated by sputum culture in head and neck cancer patients undergoing treatment at a tertiary cancer centre in South India who presented with features of aspiration. The study is carried out to establish empirical antibiotic policy for head and neck cancer patients who present with features of aspiration. This was a retrospective study. The study included sputum samples sent for culture and sensitivity from January 2011 to December 2012. Analysis of microbiologic species isolated in sputum specimen and the antibiotic sensitivity pattern of the bacterial isolates was performed. A detailed study of case files of all patients was done to find out which is the most common site prone for producing aspiration. There were 47 (31.54 %) gram positive isolates and 102 (68.45 %) gram negative isolates. The most common bacterial isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae (25.50 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.77 %) and Haemophilus influenzae (15.43 %). Levofloxacin was the most effective antibiotic with excellent activity against both gram positive and gram negative isolates. Most patients with aspiration had laryngeal cancer (34.89 %). Aspiration pneumonia was present in 14 (9.39 %) patients. Gram negative bacteria are common etiologic agents in head and neck cancer patients presenting with features of aspiration. Levofloxacin should be started as empirical antibiotic in these patients while awaiting sputum culture sensitivity report. As aspiration in head and neck cancer is an underreported event such institutional antibiotic sensitivity studies should be encouraged for prompt initiation of antibiotic that is most likely to be effective against etiologic pathogens.
TI  - Bacterial colonization increases daily symptoms in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  - RATIONALE: Respiratory pathogens are frequently isolated from the airways of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the absence of an exacerbation. This bacterial "colonization" by potential pathogens is associated with host inflammatory and immune responses, which could increase respiratory symptoms. OBJECTIVES: To study whether bacterial colonization impacts daily respiratory symptoms in COPD. METHODS: In a longitudinal prospective observational study of COPD, patients recorded daily symptoms electronically on the Breathlessness, Cough, and Sputum Scale (BCSS). Sputum cultures and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed every 2 weeks. The relationship of BCSS and bacterial colonization was analyzed with generalized linear mixed effects models, after controlling for exacerbations, weather conditions, lung function, and demographic variables. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 41 patients recorded daily symptoms for 12,527 days. The average BCSS score was higher during the periods of colonization, determined by sputum culture with one or more of the following pathogens: nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, compared to periods without colonization (5.28 vs. 4.46; P = 0.008) after controlling for confounding variables. The finding did not change when colonization was defined by quantitative PCR (average BCSS, 4.77 vs. 4.25; P = 0.006). Sputum IL-8 levels were elevated with bacterial colonization. CONCLUSIONS: Even in the absence of clinical exacerbation, colonization by bacterial pathogens in COPD was associated with a clinically significant moderate increase in daily symptoms, likely mediated by increased airway inflammation. Novel therapies that decrease bacterial colonization in COPD could improve daily symptoms and quality of life.
TI  - Azithromycin analogue CSY0073 attenuates lung inflammation induced by LPS challenge.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects. Long-term azithromycin therapy in patients with chronic lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis has been associated with increased antimicrobial resistance, emergence of hypermutable strains, ototoxicity and cardiac toxicity. The aim of this study was to assess the anti-inflammatory effects of the non-antibiotic azithromycin derivative CSY0073. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We compared the effects of CSY0073 with those of azithromycin in experiments on bacterial cultures, Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm, lung cells and mice challenged intranasally with P. aeruginosa LPS. KEY RESULTS: In contrast to azithromycin, CSY0073 did not inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus or Haemophilus influenzae and had no effect on an established P. aeruginosa biofilm. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids and lung homogenates collected after the LPS challenge in mice showed that CSY0073 and azithromycin (200 mg.kg(-1), i.p.) decreased neutrophil counts at 24 h and TNF-alpha, CXCL1 and CXCL2 levels in the BAL fluid after 3 h and IL-6, CXCL2 and IL-1beta levels in the lung after 3 h compared with the vehicle. However, only azithromycin reduced IL-1beta levels in the lung 24 h post LPS challenge. CSY0073 and azithromycin similarly diminished the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages, but not lung epithelial cells, exposed to P. aeruginosa LPS. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Unlike azithromycin, CSY0073 had no antibacterial effects but it did have a similar anti-inflammatory profile to that of azithromycin. Hence, CSY0073 may have potential as a long-term treatment for patients with chronic lung diseases.
TI  - HIRA-TAN: a real-time PCR-based system for the rapid identification of causative  agents in pneumonia.
AB  - Identification of the causative pathogen(s) of pneumonia would allow the selection of effective antibiotics and thus reduce the mortality rate and the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens. To identify such pathogens and to obtain these benefits, it is necessary that a clinical test is rapid, accurate, easily performed, and cost-effective. Here, we devised a PCR-based test, named HIRA-TAN, which is able to discriminate therapeutic targets from commensal organisms (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae) and to detect foreign organisms (e.g. Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Legionella pneumophila) in the sputum. The utility of this system was validated in a prospective study, using sputum samples from patients with pneumonia. 568 patients were enrolled and the HIRA-TAN assay identified the causative pathogens with an accuracy of 96.7% for H. influenzae; 93.2% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 80.6% for Klebsiella pneumoniae; 90.9% for Moraxella catarrhalis; 87.5% for Escherichia coli; 78.1% for MRSA and 91.6% for S. pneumoniae. Overall the HIRA-TAN procedure was able to identify the causative pathogens of pneumonia in 60% of the cases. Additionally, this procedure was able to determine when the pneumonia-causing organism was a commensal organism or a foreign organism in a single assay. The HIRA-TAN approach yielded reproducible results and provided valuable information to plan the course of treatment of pneumonia. Through the rapid identification of the causative pathogens, the HIRA-TAN will promote targeted treatments for pneumonias. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: UMIN000001694.
TI  - Vaccines for children and adults with chronic lung disease: efficacy against acute exacerbations.
AB  - Acute exacerbations of chronic lung disease are usually associated with viral and bacterial pathogens. They contribute to declining lung function, poor quality of life and exert an excess burden on individuals, families, communities and the healthcare sector. Hence, preventing exacerbations is important in clinical management. Several vaccines providing protection against respiratory pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis and influenza) that can trigger exacerbations are available, but evidence to support their effectiveness in preventing exacerbations of chronic lung disease is limited. Candidate vaccines in pre-clinical or clinical development phases include those targeting Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinoviruses. However, it is likely to be several years before vaccines against these pathogens are available for children and adults with chronic lung diseases. For vaccination to play an important role in managing chronic lung disease efforts need to be directed at understanding how various pathogens cause exacerbations and alter long-term lung function.

TI  - Changes in acute mastoiditis in a single pediatric tertiary medical center: our experience during 2008-2009 compared with data for 1983-2007.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess clinical reports and bacteriological changes over a 25-y period in children with acute mastoiditis. METHODS: The medical files of all children with a discharge diagnosis of mastoiditis, hospitalized in a tertiary pediatric medical center over a 2-y period (2008-2009), were reviewed and compared to previously published data from the same center for the y 1983-1985, 1993-1995, and 2003-2007. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-four children (143 episodes) with acute mastoiditis were identified during 2008-2009; 81% had fever, 95% auricular displacement, and 80% post-auricular swelling. Forty-nine children were diagnosed with acute otitis media and had been treated with antibiotics prior to hospitalization. However, 22% showed no clinical symptoms preceding ear protrusion. Cultures grew Streptococcus pneumoniae in 32%, Streptococcus pyogenes in 20%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 13%, and Haemophilus influenzae in 10% of cases. From 1990 to 2005, the incidence of S. pyogenes isolation increased from approximately 5% to 20%. During this period, the number of cases increased from 8-20 to 67 per y. CONCLUSIONS: S. pyogenes has emerged as a significant pathogen. We found that acute mastoiditis may appear without preceding symptoms in approximately 22% of cases.
TI  - Activity of the antiseptic polyhexanide against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The activity of the antiseptic polyhexanide was tested against 250 gram-negative  clinical isolates, that is, 50 isolates each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined by using a serial broth microdilution technique according to DIN 58940. Time-kill studies were performed for reference stains E. coli ATCC 25922, K. pneumoniae ATCC 4352, P. aeruginosa ATCC 15442, M. catarrhalis ATCC 43617, and H. influenzae ATCC 49247. All tested isolates had MICs and MBCs within a range of 1-32 mg/L and were regarded as susceptible to polyhexanide. The highest values were found for P. aeruginosa and H. influenzae with MICs and MBCs of 32 mg/L. Addition of up to 4% albumin to the test medium did not change MICs and MBCs. Time-kill studies of the reference strains showed reduction rates from 3 log10 colony forming units (CFU)/ml to more than 5 log10 CFU/ml for 200 and 400 mg/L polyhexanide within 5-30 min. Testing of polyhexanide in combination with antibiotics showed indifference with amoxicillin, cefotaxime, imipenem, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin; no antagonism was found. As no resistance and no antagonism with antibiotics were detected, polyhexanide is regarded as suitable agent for topical eradication of gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Superior sensitivity and decreased time to detection with the Bactec Peds Plus/F  system compared to the BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN blood culture system.
AB  - Here, we compare the sensitivities and times to detection (TTD) of BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN (PF) and Bactec Peds Plus blood culture bottles. Test bottles were inoculated with 2 ml of banked whole blood, 1-ml aliquots of antibiotic suspension, and organisms diluted to simulate a bacteremia level of 10 to 100 CFU/ml. The control bottles were inoculated with 3 ml of banked blood and organism suspensions only. The organism-drug combinations were Staphylococcus epidermidis and vancomycin, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone, Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin, and cefotaxime, Escherichia coli, cefotaxime, and cefepime, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, and gentamicin, Neisseria meningitidis and ceftriaxone, and Haemophilus influenzae and ceftriaxone. The control and test bottle combinations were tested in duplicate. The bottles were incubated for 5 days; 32 control and 104 test bottles were incubated. Overall, the bacterial recovery rates for the PF and Peds Plus bottles were 37% and 62%, 94% and 100% in the controls, 19% and 50% in the test bottles, and 33% and 92% in the bottles with vancomycin, respectively. No bacteria were recovered from the bottles with S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, E. coli, N. meningitidis, or H. influenzae in combination with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. The Peds Plus system detected P. aeruginosa in bottles with cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam, but the PF system recovered bacteria only in bottles with trough levels of piperacillin-tazobactam. The mean TTD were shorter in the Peds Plus system controls (14.2 versus 18.0 h; P = 0.001) and the test bottles (14.3 versus 17.8 h; P = 0.008) than in the PF bottles. Overall, we demonstrated superior sensitivity, TTD, and antibiotic neutralization in the Bactec Peds Plus system compared to those in the Pediatric FAN system.
TI  - Infectious etiology of acute exacerbations in severe COPD patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Since the new GOLD guidelines were implemented no data have been published about the etiology of acute exacerbations (AECOPD) in severe COPD patients with a different frequency of annual episodes. METHODS: One hundred and eleven COPD patients (FEV1 < 50%) were prospectively followed up for a year. Good-quality sputum samples recovered during AECOPD were processed, including quantitative culture and PCR detection of atypical bacteria. RESULTS: A total of 188 sputum samples were obtained from AECOPD episodes. Forty patients had a single episode, and 71 patients had >/=2. In 128 episodes a single pathogen was isolated, while 42 episodes were polymicrobial (>/=2 pathogens). Overall, the most frequent pathogen isolated was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 54), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (n = 37), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 31), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 29) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 12). P. aeruginosa was the most frequent in both groups of patients (35% and 27% in those with 1 and >/=2 AECOPD, respectively). H. influenzae was associated with patients with a single annual AECOPD (33% vs. 16%; P = 0.006), while Enterobacteriaceae were associated with frequent exacerbators (0% vs. 12%; P < 0.044). CONCLUSION: Overall, P. aeruginosa was the most frequent pathogen isolated from exacerbations. However, different bacterial etiology was observed depending on the number of annual episodes.
TI  - Ocular surface infections in northeastern state of malaysia: a 10-year review of  bacterial isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ocular surface infections that include infections of conjunctiva, adnexa, and cornea have the potential risk of causing blindness within a given population. Empirical antibiotic therapy is usually initiated based on epidemiological data of common causative agents. Thus, the aims of this study were to determine the bacterial agents and their susceptibility patterns of isolates from ocular surface specimens in our hospital. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis and records of bacterial isolates from ocular surface specimens in Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia from January 2001 to December 2010 were examined. Specimens were processed according to standard laboratory procedures. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted based on Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommendations. Only single, nonrepetitive isolates were included in the analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1,267 isolates were obtained during the study period, which comprised Staphylococcus aureus (n = 299, 23.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 194, 15.3%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 108, 8.5%), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 100, 7.9%), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 84, 6.6%), and Enterobacter spp. (n = 81, 6.4%). Fungi contributed to 4.4% of the total isolates. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing demonstrated that gram-positive bacteria were generally resistant to gentamicin (19%-57%), whereas gram-negative bacteria were resistant to chloramphenicol (27%-58%). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the above results, knowledge of the initial Gram stain findings is imperative before the commencement of empirical antibiotic therapy. Therefore, a simple Gram staining for all eye specimens is highly recommended.
TI  - Acute lower respiratory infections on lung sequelae in Cambodia, a neglected disease in highly tuberculosis-endemic country.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about post-infectious pulmonary sequelae in countries like Cambodia where tuberculosis is hyper-endemic and childhood pulmonary infections are highly frequent. We describe the characteristics of hospitalized Cambodian patients presenting with community-acquired acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) on post-infectious pulmonary sequelae (ALRIPS). METHODS: Between 2007 and 2010, inpatients >/=15 years with ALRI were prospectively recruited. Clinical, biological, radiological and microbiological data were collected. Chest radiographs were re-interpreted by experts to compare patients with ALRIPS, on previously healthy lungs (ALRIHL) and active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Patients without chest radiograph abnormality or with abnormality suggestive as other chronic respiratory diseases were excluded from this analysis. RESULTS: Among the 2351 inpatients with community-acquired ALRI, 1800 were eligible: 426 (18%) ALRIPS, 878 (37%) ALRIHL and 496 (21%) TB. ALRIPS patients had less frequent fever than other ALRI (p < 0.001) and more productive cough than ALRIHL (p < 0.001). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for 83% of ALRIPS group positive cultures. H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa were significantly associated with ALRIPS compared with ALRIHL. Treatment was appropriate in 58% of ALRIPS patients. Finally, 79% of ALRIPS were not recognized by local clinicians. In-hospital mortality was low (1%) but probably underestimated in the ALRIPS group. CONCLUSION: ALRIPS remains often misdiagnosed as TB with inappropriate treatment in low-income countries. Better-targeted training programs would help reduce the morbidity burden and financial costs.
TI  - Determination of the biofilm formation capacity of bacterial pathogens associated with otorhinolaryngologic diseases in the Malaysian population.
AB  - This study aims to assess the association between microbial composition, biofilm  formation and chronic otorhinolaryngologic disorders in Malaysia. A total of 45 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, chronic tonsillitis and chronic suppurative otitis media and 15 asymptomatic control patients were studied. Swab samples were obtained from these subjects. Samples were studied by conventional microbiological culturing, PCR-based microbial detection and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM). Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and other Streptococcus species were detected in subjects of both patient and control groups. Biofilm was observed in approximately half of the smear prepared from swab samples obtained from subjects of the patient group. Most of these were polymicrobial biofilms. S. aureus biofilm was most prevalent among nasal samples while H. influenzae biofilm was more common among ear and throat samples. Results from this study supported the hypothesis that chronic otorhinolaryngologic diseases may be biofilm related. Due to the presence of unculturable bacteria in biofilms present in specimens from ear, nose and throat, the use of molecular methods in combination with conventional microbiological culturing has demonstrated an improvement in the detection of bacteria from such specimens in this study.
TI  - Impact of swimming on chronic suppurative otitis media in Aboriginal children: a  randomised controlled trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To measure the impact of 4 weeks of daily swimming on rates of ear discharge among Aboriginal children with a tympanic membrane perforation (TMP) and on the microbiology of the nasopharynx and middle ear. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomised controlled trial involving 89 Aboriginal children (aged 5-12 2013s) with a TMP, conducted in two remote Northern Territory Aboriginal communities from August to December 2009. INTERVENTION: 4 school weeks of daily swimming lessons (45 minutes) in a chlorinated pool. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportions of children with ear discharge and respiratory and opportunistic bacteria in the nasopharynx and middle ear. RESULTS: Of 89 children randomly assigned to the swimming or non-swimming groups, 58 (26/41 swimmers and 32/48 non-swimmers) had ear discharge at baseline. After 4 weeks, 24 of 41 swimmers had ear discharge compared with 32 of 48 non-swimmers (risk difference, - 8% (95% CI, - 28% to 12%). There were no statistically significant changes in the microbiology of the nasopharynx or middle ear in swimmers or non-swimmers. Streptococcus pneumoniae and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae were the dominant organisms cultured from the nasopharynx, and H. influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the dominant organisms in the middle ear. CONCLUSIONS: Swimming lessons for Aboriginal children in remote communities should be supported, but it is unlikely that they will substantially reduce rates of chronic suppurative otitis media and associated bacteria in the nasopharynx and middle ear. However, swimming was not associated with increased risk of ear discharge and we found no reason to discourage it.

TI  - Induced sputum compared to bronchoalveolar lavage in young, non-expectorating cystic fibrosis children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Induced sputum (IS) is feasible and safe in young CF children and is  a readily accessible, non-invasive technique. However, it has not been compared to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), the gold standard for diagnosing lower airway infection. METHODS: We compared bacterial yield from IS and BAL in 11 non-expectorating CF children, aged 3 to 7.4 years. IS samples were obtained in 10/11 cases. RESULTS: Eight out of ten had the same predominant bacteria cultured from IS and BAL: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia[1], Staphylococcus aureus[3], and upper respiratory tract flora [4]. In one, Serratia marcescens and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were cultured from IS alone, whereas in one, non-group B Haemophilus influenzae was cultured from BAL alone. CONCLUSIONS: As proof of principle, IS samples showed good bacteriologic correlation with BAL. Larger studies are recommended to confirm IS as a clinically valuable tool and measure for early intervention studies in young CF children.
TI  - Ceftaroline fosamil: a review of its use in the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - Ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil (Zinforo, Teflaro), is an advanced-generation, parenteral cephalosporin with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro against Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Gram-negative bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, but not Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ceftaroline has demonstrated a low potential for the selection of resistance in vitro for drug-resistant Gram-positive organisms, including MRSA, as well as for Gram-negative respiratory pathogens. In pivotal phase III studies, intravenous ceftaroline fosamil demonstrated noninferiority to intravenous vancomycin plus aztreonam in patients hospitalized with complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTIs) and intravenous ceftriaxone in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) risk class III or IV]; however, patients with CAP admitted to the intensive care unit were not evaluated. Ceftaroline fosamil was generally well tolerated in these trials, with an adverse event profile similar to that of other cephalosporins. Diarrhoea was the most commonly reported adverse event; however, the risk of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea with ceftaroline fosamil appeared to be low. Potential limitations of the drug include the lack of an oral formulation and the requirement for twice-daily administration. Nonetheless, ceftaroline fosamil represents an attractive option (either alone or in combination with other agents) for the initial empirical treatment of patients hospitalized with cSSTIs (including those with suspected MRSA infection) or CAP (PORT risk class III or IV) who require intravenous antimicrobial therapy. As with all antibacterial agents, ceftaroline fosamil should be used in accordance with good antimicrobial stewardship.
TI  - Spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in mainland of China.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria-induced respiratory infection has been long considered to be the major cause of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Therefore, a clear picture about the distribution and drug-resistance of pathogenic bacteria in the lower airways should be helpful for treatment of the disease. So far, data on this topic among Chinese are lacking. METHODS: A surveillance study was performed in consecutive patients with AECOPD at five areas in China between October 2006 and April 2008. The sputum from these patients was cultured and isolated for bacteria. Agar dilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of levofoxacin and other 15 antibiotics against these strains. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-nine pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated among 884 patients with AECOPD. The predominant bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.3%), Haemophilus influenzae (14.2%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (11.7%), followed by Haemophilus parainfluenzae (9.5%), Acinetobacter baumannii (7.8%), Moraxella catarrhalis (6.4%) and Escherichia coli (3.6%). The majority of bacterial pathogens isolated in this study were susceptible to fuoroquinolones, ceftazidime, cefepime and imipenem. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacilli are the leading pathogens in patients with AECOPD in China. Haemophilus parainfluenzae may be one of the most important pathogens in AECOPD. This study provides evidence for local surveillance of AECOPD pathogens and appropriate choice of antimicrobials in China.
TI  - Infections of the respiratory system in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia.
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive multiorgan disease characterized by progressive neurologic deterioration in which the most common causes of death are diseases of the respiratory system and cancer. This retrospective case-series characterizes the pulmonary disease seen in 101 cancer-free A-T patients who were living with chronic respiratory symptoms or who had pulmonary disease listed as the cause of their death. All of the 101 patients developed chronic progressive pulmonary disease with intermittent acute exacerbations and irreversible radiographic changes. Seventy-nine patients had microbiologic analysis of their respiratory secretions and of the patients less than 15 years of age, 25/27 cultured Staphylococcus aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, or Streptococcus pneumoniae and 35/47 older patients cultured Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Opportunistic infections of the lungs were not observed. Thirty-two patients had histologic examination of their lungs and 21 of the specimens had both acute and chronic inflammatory changes. The results of this study describe the natural history of the suppurative lung disease in patients with A-T that often progresses to bronchiectasis and pneumonias and ultimately respiratory failure. The etiology of the progressive deterioration is unknown but the pulmonary disease of A-T described in this study shows similarities to the lung disease seen in cystic fibrosis. Treatment of the lung disease in patients with A-T may benefit from many of the same therapies that have improved the quality of life for patients with cystic fibrosis.
TI  - A screening for antimicrobial activities of Caribbean herbal remedies.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The TRAMIL program aims to understand, validate and expand health practices based on the use of medicinal plants in the Caribbean, which is a "biodiversity hotspot" due to high species endemism, intense development pressure and habitat loss. The antibacterial activity was examined for thirteen plant species from several genera that were identified as a result of TRAMIL ethnopharmacological surveys or were reported in ethnobotanical accounts from Puerto Rico. The aim of this study was to validate the traditional use of these plant species for the treatment of bacterial infections, such as conjunctivitis, fever, otitis media and furuncles. METHODS: An agar disc diffusion assay was used to examine five bacterial strains that are associated with the reported infections, including Staphylococcus saprophyticus (ATCC 15305), S. aureus (ATCC 6341), Escherichia coli (ATCC 4157), Haemophilus influenzae (ATCC 8142), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 7700) and Proteus vulgaris (ATCC 6896), as well as the fungus Candida albicans (ATCC 752). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were determined for each of the extracts that showed inhibitory activity. RESULTS: The decoctions of Pityrogramma calomelanos, Tapeinochilus ananassae, and Syzygium jambos, as well as the juice of Gossypium barbadense, showed > 20% growth inhibition against several bacteria relative to the positive control, which was the antibiotic Streptomycin. Extracts with the best antimicrobial activities were S. jambos that showed MIC = 31 mug/mL and MBC = 1.0 mg/mL against P. vulgaris and T. ananassae that showed MIC = 15 mug/mL against S. aureus. CONCLUSION: This report confirms the traditional use of P. calomelanos for the treatment of kidney infections that are associated with stones, as well as the antimicrobial and bactericidal effects of T. ananassae against P. vulgaris and S. saprophyticus and the effects of S. jambos against S. aureus and S. saprophyticus.
TI  - Molecular analysis of changes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa load during treatment of  a pulmonary exacerbation in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intravenous antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbations (PEs) of cystic fibrosis (CF) usually target Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Insights into the CF lung microbiome have questioned this approach. We used RT-qPCR to determine whether intravenous antibiotics reduced P. aeruginosa numbers and whether this correlated with improved lung function. We also investigated antibiotic effects on other common respiratory pathogens in CF. METHODS: Sputa were collected from patients when stable and again during a PE. Sputa were expectorated into a RNA preservation buffer for RNA extraction and preparation of cDNA. qPCR was used to enumerate viable P. aeruginosa as well as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia cepacia complex and Aspergillus fumigatus. RESULTS: Fifteen CF patients were followed through 21 PEs. A complete set of serial sputum samples was unavailable for two patients (three separate PEs). P. aeruginosa numbers did not increase immediately prior to a PE, but numbers during intravenous antibiotic treatment were reduced >/=4-log in 6/18 and >/=1-log in 4/18 PEs. In 7/18 PEs, P. aeruginosa numbers changed very little with intravenous antibiotics and one patient demonstrated a >/=2-log increase in P. aeruginosa load. H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were detected in ten and five PEs respectively, but with antibiotic treatment these bacteria rapidly became undetectable in 6/10 and 4/5 PEs, respectively. There was a negative correlation between P. aeruginosa numbers and FEV1 during stable phase (r(s)=0.75, p<0.05), and reductions in P. aeruginosa load with intravenous antibiotic treatment correlated with improved FEV1 (r(s)=0.52, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Exacerbations are not due to increased P. aeruginosa numbers in CF adults. However, lung function improvements correlate with reduced P. aeruginosa burden suggesting that current antibiotic treatment strategies remain appropriate in most patients. Improved understanding of PE characterised by unchanged P. aeruginosa numbers and minimal lung function improvement following treatment may allow better targeted therapies.
TI  - Disinfection of rigid nasal endoscopes following in vitro contamination with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - IMPORTANCE: If not adequately cleaned, rigid nasal endoscopes (RNEs) have the potential to cause iatrogenic cross-contamination. OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of various disinfection methods in reducing bacterial load on RNEs in vitro. DESIGN AND SETTING: In vitro model. INTERVENTIONS: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae contamination was separately induced on RNEs in vitro. Two experimental sets were completed. The RNEs were disinfected using the following protocols: 30-second scrub with antimicrobial soap (ABS) and water, 30-second scrub with 70% isopropyl alcohol (IA), 30-second scrub with ABS followed by 30-second scrub with IA, 30-second scrub with germicidal cloth, isolated 5-minute soak in an enzymatic soap solution, 5- and 10-minute soaks in ortho-phthalaldehyde, 0.55%, solution (Cidex OPA), and isolated 30-second rinse with tap water, all with 30-second precleaning and postcleaning rinses with tap water. Two sets of experiments (experiment sets A and B) were carried out with a 30-second tap water rinse after inoculation of each RNE. This was followed by immediate cleaning in set A and a 1-hour air-dry delay in set B. Otherwise there were no differences in the disinfection protocols between sets for each method noted. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Effectiveness of various disinfection protocols in cleaning rigid nasal endoscopes experimentally inoculated with bacteria commonly found in the upper aerodigestive tract. Positive cultures following disinfection indicated ineffective or incomplete disinfection. RESULTS: Most cleaning methods were effective in eliminating S aureus, S pneumoniae, and H influenzae from the scopes following experimental contamination. Continued growth of P aeruginosa was found after all of the disinfection trials in experiment set A with the exception of a 10-minute immersion in Cidex OPA, and in set B except for the 10-minute Cidex OPA immersion and ABS plus IA trials. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Most cleaning methods used in our trials appear to properly disinfect RNEs after in vitro inoculation with S aureus, S pneumoniae, and H influenzae. However, it appears that disinfectants may be less effective in cleaning rigid scopes experimentally inoculated with P aeruginosa. There is a paucity of published data regarding cross-contamination during rigid nasal endoscopy, and these results should guide future studies and to some extent practice to avoid iatrogenic spread of contamination.
TI  - Impact of age and comorbidity on cause and outcome in community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prolonged life expectancy has currently increased the proportion of the very elderly among patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The aim of this study was to determine the influence of age and comorbidity on microbial patterns in patients over 65 years of age with CAP. METHODS: This study was a prospective observational study of adult patients with CAP (excluding those in nursing homes) over a 12-year period. We compared patients aged 65 to 74 years, 75 to 84 years, and > 85 years for potential differences in clinical presentation, comorbidities, severity on admission, microbial investigations, causes, antimicrobial treatment, and outcomes. RESULTS: We studied a total of 2,149 patients: 759 patients (35.3%) aged 65 to 74 years, 941 patients (43.7%) aged 75 to 84 years, and 449 patients (20.8%) aged > 85 years. At least one comorbidity was present in 1,710 patients (79.6%). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequent pathogen in all age groups, regardless of comorbidity. Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for 9.1% of isolates, and Haemophilus influenzae, 6.4%. All these pathogens were isolated only in patients with at least one comorbidity. Mortality increased with age (65-74 years, 6.9%; 75-84 years, 8.9%; > 85 years, 17.1%; P < .001) and was associated with increased comorbidities (neurologic; OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.5-2.1), Pneumonia Severity Index IV or V (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.8-6.0), bacteremia (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.7), the presence of a potential multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogen (S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae; OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.3), and ICU admission (OR, 4.2; 95% CI, 2.9-6.1) on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Age does not influence microbial cause itself, whereas comorbidities are associated with specific causes such as H. influenzae and potential MDR pathogens. Mortality in the elderly is mainly driven by the presence of comorbidities and potential MDR pathogens.
TI  - Microbes bind complement inhibitor factor H via a common site.
AB  - To cause infections microbes need to evade host defense systems, one of these being the evolutionarily old and important arm of innate immunity, the alternative pathway of complement. It can attack all kinds of targets and is tightly controlled in plasma and on host cells by plasma complement regulator factor H (FH). FH binds simultaneously to host cell surface structures such as heparin or glycosaminoglycans via domain 20 and to the main complement opsonin C3b via domain 19. Many pathogenic microbes protect themselves from complement by recruiting host FH. We analyzed how and why different microbes bind FH via domains 19-20 (FH19-20). We used a selection of FH19-20 point mutants to reveal the binding sites of several microbial proteins and whole microbes (Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumonia, Candida albicans, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Borrelia hermsii). We show that all studied microbes use the same binding region located on one side of domain 20. Binding of FH to the microbial proteins was inhibited with heparin showing that the common microbial binding site overlaps with the heparin site needed for efficient binding of FH to host cells. Surprisingly, the microbial proteins enhanced binding of FH19-20 to C3b and down-regulation of complement activation. We show that this is caused by formation of a tripartite complex between the microbial protein, FH, and C3b. In this study we reveal that seven microbes representing different phyla utilize a common binding site on the domain 20 of FH for complement evasion. Binding via this site not only mimics the glycosaminoglycans of the host cells, but also enhances function of FH on the microbial surfaces via the novel mechanism of tripartite complex formation. This is a unique example of convergent evolution resulting in enhanced immune evasion of important pathogens via utilization of a "superevasion site."
TI  - [Microbial structure of acute bacterial conjunctivitis].
AB  - Microbiological investigation of 124 patients with acute conjunctivitis which were treated in one of Tbilisi policlinics in 2010-12 years, was performed; microbial structure containing 124 microbial strains of different species was detected. Namely, following species of microorganisms were isolated: S. aureus - 35 strains (28,2%), Str. pneumoniae - 10 strains (8,1%), S. epidermidis - 6 strains (4,8%), Ps. aeruginosa - 24 strains (19,4%), Moraxella catarrhalis - 21 strains (16,9%), Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegipticus - 17 strains (13,7%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae - 11 strains (8,9%). Identification of microorganisms was performed using classic methods of microbiological explorations and test systems API (bio Meriux). Study of sensitivity/resistance to antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tobramicin, norfoloxacin, moxifloxacin) containing in eye drops, was performed by diffusion in agar. High level of resistance to this antibiotic was found. As a result it is recommended to perform microbiological investigation in each case of acute conjunctivitis, to receive rational treatment.
TI  - Clinical measures of disease in adult non-CF bronchiectasis correlate with airway microbiota composition.
AB  - RATIONALE: Despite the potentially important roles for infection in adult non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis disease progression, the bacterial species present in the lower airways of these patients is poorly characterised. OBJECTIVES: To provide a comprehensive cross-sectional analysis of bacterial content of lower airway samples from patients with non-CF bronchiectasis using culture-independent microbiology. METHODS: Paired induced sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage samples, obtained from 41 adult patients with non-CF bronchiectasis, were analysed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene pyrosequencing. Assessment of species distribution and dispersal allowed 'core' and 'satellite' bacterial populations to be defined for this patient group. Microbiota characteristics correlated with clinical markers of disease. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: 140 bacterial species were identified, including those associated with respiratory tract infections and opportunistic infections more generally. A group of core species, consisting of species detected frequently and in high abundance, was defined. Core species included those currently associated with infection in bronchiectasis, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and many species that would be unlikely to be reported through standard diagnostic surveillance. These included members of the genera Veillonella, Prevotella and Neisseria. The comparative contribution of core and satellite groups suggested a low level of random species acquisition. Bacterial diversity was significantly positively correlated with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and bacterial community composition similarity correlated significantly with FEV1, neutrophil count and Leicester cough score. CONCLUSIONS: Characteristics of the lower airways microbiota of adult patients with non-CF bronchiectasis correlate significantly with clinical markers of disease severity.
TI  - Ceramide in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) molecule; these mutations result in a defect in chloride secretion in epithelial cell layers. The disease is characterized by severe gastrointestinal and pulmonary symptoms, but it is the pulmonary symptoms that dominate the clinical course of the disease and determine patients' life expectancy. These pulmonary symptoms include reduced mucociliary clearance, chronic inflammation, and recurrent and chronic pulmonary infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia cepacia, and Haemophilus influenzae. Recent studies have shown that sphingolipids, especially ceramide, play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis. These studies have demonstrated that ceramide accumulates in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients and mice, causing inflammation and high susceptibility to bacterial infections. The results of initial clinical studies suggest that interfering with sphingolipids may be a novel treatment strategy for cystic fibrosis.
TI  - [Bacterial isolates from respiratory samples of pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis and their distribution by ages].
AB  - The bacterial isolates from respiratory samples of 50 pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis, their distribution by ages and antimicrobial resistance pattern as well as the intermittence of isolations and coinfections, were investigated. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 72 % of patients, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (58 %), Haemophilus. influenzae (56 %), and the Burkholderia cepacia complex (12 %). The frequency of resistance of P. aeruginosa isolates to beta-lactam antibiotics was low (13.8 %). Fifty percent of S. aureus isolates was methicillin-resistant, and 57.1 % of H. influenza was ampicillin resistant due to beta-lactamase production. In children under 4 years-old, S. aureus was predominant, followed by P. aeruginosa and H. influenzae. This order of predominance was observed in all the groups studied, except in that of children between 10 and 14 years-old. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Achromobacter xylosoxidans isolates were intermittent and accompanied by other microorganisms. Finally, we observed a great variety of bacterial species, which imposes stringent performance requirements for microbiological studies in all respiratory samples of these patients.
TI  - [Pathogen distribution and antibiotic resistance for hospital aquired pneumonia in respiratory medicine intensive care unit].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the change of pathogen distribution and antibiotic resistance of pathogens isolated from in-patients with hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) in the Department of Respiratory Medicine Intensive Care Unit (RICU) of Xiangya Hospital in 2005 and in 2011, and to provide reasonable anti-infectious strategy. METHODS: The positive susceptibility test of sputum (bronchial secretions) culture was done in patients with HAP in RICU of Xiangya Hospital in 2005 and in 2011, and the distribution feature and antibiotic resistance were compared. RESULTS: 1) In the two years, the main pathogen in HAP patients was Gram negative bacteria (infection rate was 68.07% and 65.21% in 2005 and in2011 respectively). The primary pathogenic bacteria were changed, and Acinetobacter baumanii became the most common Gram negative bacterium which replaced Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with infection rate 6.81% in 2005 to 40.87% in 2011. The infection rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa reduced from 20.42% in 2005 to 15.60% in 2011. Haemophilus influenzae was rare. Staphylococcus aureus became the primary Gram positive bacteria, and its infection rate increased from 1.57% in 2005 to 4.83% in 2011, all of which were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Saccharomyces albicans' positive culture rate increased significantly. 2) Compared with in 2005, the antibiotic resistance of pathogen isolated from the HAP pationts changed a lot in 2011: increased antibiotic resistance rate and decreased sensitivity to many antibiotics. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was only relatively susceptible to meropenem, cefoperazone sulbactam, ceftazidime, cefpodoxime, and andamicaxin in 2011. The resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to levofloxacin, cyclopropane, amicacin, gentamicin, meropenem, cematrixone, and piperacilintazobactam increased obviously (P<0.05). Compared with 2005, Acinetobacter baumanii was totally susceptible to polymyxin and relatively susceptible to sulbactam, but it was almost completely resistant to Aminoglycoside antibiotics in 2011, with significant difference (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The main pathogen of HAP patients in RICU was Gram negative bacteria, with increased infection rate of Staphylococcus aureus and fungus. There is change pathogen distribution and antibiotic resistance, and the clinical initial experimental antibiotic therapy may be influenced. It is important to use antibiotics more rationally to delay the antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Secondary electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (SESI-MS) breathprinting of multiple bacterial lung pathogens, a mouse model study.
AB  - Bacterial pneumonia is one of the leading causes of disease-related morbidity and mortality in the world, in part because the diagnostic tools for pneumonia are slow and ineffective. To improve the diagnosis success rates and treatment outcomes for bacterial lung infections, we are exploring the use of secondary electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (SESI-MS) breath analysis as a rapid, noninvasive method for determining the etiology of lung infections in situ. Using a murine lung infection model, we demonstrate that SESI-MS breathprints can be used to distinguish mice that are infected with one of seven lung pathogens: Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, representing the primary causes of bacterial pneumonia worldwide. After applying principal components analysis, we observed that with the first three principal components (primarily comprised of data from 14 peaks), all infections were separable via SESI-MS breathprinting (P < 0.0001). Therefore, we have shown the potential of this SESI-MS approach for rapidly detecting and identifying acute bacterial lung infections in situ via breath analysis.
TI  - Markers of lower respiratory tract infections in emergency departments.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory tract infections are the common causes for admission to emergency department. Appropriate diagnosis and initiating treatment on time are important for reducing morbidity and mortality rate due to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). The aim of this study is to determine if C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and white blood cells (WBC) count are considerable markers to help rapid diagnosis and prediction of antibiotic need for lower respiratory infections in emergency departments. The relationships between infectious agents and those markers have also been evaluated. METHODS: Study subjects and control group were selected by defined criteria. Patients were analyzed and assessed for CRP and WBC, sputum Gram stain and culture besides routine laboratory tests and chest X-Rays. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety four episodes out of 175 patients were evaluated for the study. CRP level and WBC count were detected significantly higher in patients ofstudy group than in those of control group. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae were the pathogens most often isolated. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, CRP and WBC sputum are important markers for diagnosis of LRTI at the emergency departments and results of microbiological analysis of respiratory specimens were correlated with these markers. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registation number of ethic committee of Dr. Suat Seren Chest Diseases and Surgery Training and Research Hospital: 28.04.2006/114.
TI  - Bacterial growth on cochlear implants as a potential origin of complications.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence and spectrum of bacterial colonization in  relation to cochlear implant infections by introducing molecular biologic methods. METHOD: In a pilot test, a virgin device served as a control to validate the subsequent sampling and analysis process via PCR and SSCP. Subsequently, analysis was performed on specimens of 15 cochlear implants explanted from 15 patients because of device failures, infections, or malinsertions. RESULTS: Positive SSCP results could be verified on 8 of the 15 explanted CI, in detail, 3 of 4 infected cochlear implants and 5 of 9 cochlear implants explanted because of device failure. The germ spectrum shows common germs such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae, as well as germs from the dental cavity, with a peak of P. aeruginosa in infections. CONCLUSION: Detection and identification of microbial colonization on cochlear implants can be successfully conducted using the proposed approach of smear test subsequent genetic analysis. The prevalence of P. aeruginosa and germs from the dental cavity may demand an adaption of antibiosis with respect to these germs. Further investigations of the path of infection are needed, and patients might require a prevention by preoperative dental treatment.
TI  - Determination of disk diffusion and MIC quality control guidelines for GSK2251052: a novel boron-containing antibacterial.
AB  - GSK2251052 is a boron-containing antimicrobial agent in clinical development for  the treatment of serious Gram-negative bacterial infections. These GSK2251052 quality control (QC) studies were performed to establish ranges for control strains (broth microdilution [BMD] MIC and disk diffusion zones) as follows: Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (2-8 mug/mL and 15-24 mm), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (0.5-2 mug/mL and 23-30 mm), Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 (0.25-1 mug/mL and 22-31 mm), Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 (0.25-1 mug/mL and 19-28 mm), Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285 (1-4 mug/mL [BMD] and 1-4 mug/mL [agar dilution]), and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron ATCC 29741 (1-8 mug/mL [BMD] and 2-8 mug/mL [agar dilution]). These ranges, approved by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, will be crucial in accurately evaluating GSK2251052 in vitro potency.
TI  - Predictors of viral pneumonia: the need for viral testing in all patients hospitalized for nursing home-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - AIM: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is presumed to be bacterial in origin and empirical antibiotics are almost always given on admission. However, early detection of viral infection is also very important for hospital infection control and timely use of antiviral agents. The present study aimed to compare patients with viral and bacterial pneumonia, and identify independent predictors of viral pneumonia. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was carried out in a tertiary teaching hospital in a 1-year period. Older patients (aged >/= 65 years) were recruited if they were admitted for CAP confirmed by chest radiographs. RESULTS: A cohort of 488 patients was analyzed. Infective causes were found in 137 (28.1%) patients. Bacterial, viral and mixed infections were detected in 86 (17.6%), 41 (8.4%) and 10 (2.0%) patients, respectively. Bacteriology was established mostly by sputum culture and virology by nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) viral culture. The commonest bacterial isolates were Haemophilus influenzae (31), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (14), Klebsiella spp. (9) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (6). Influenza A virus (28, 8 were pandemic 2009 A/H1N1 subtype) and respiratory syncytial virus (16) were the most frequent viral causes. Independent predictors of viral pneumonia included nursing home residence (RR 3.056, P = 0.009) and absence of leukocytosis (RR 0.425, P = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: All nursing home residents hospitalized for CAP should undergo NPA viral testing because of infection control, early antiviral treatment and discharge planning. We suggest that empirical antiviral agents might be considered for nursing home residents hospitalized for CAP if outbreaks of influenza-like illness are reported in nursing homes.
TI  - Bacteremia, causative agents and antimicrobial susceptibility among HIV-1-infected children on antiretroviral therapy in Uganda and Zimbabwe.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteremia is common in HIV-infected children in Africa, including after start of antiretroviral therapy (ART), but there are limited data on causative pathogens and their antimicrobial sensitivity patterns in this population. METHODS: We analyzed data on blood cultures taken from HIV-infected children developing acute febrile illness after enrollment to the Antiretroviral Research for Watoto (ARROW) clinical trial in Uganda and Zimbabwe. Patterns of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined and bacteremia rates calculated over time from ART initiation. RESULTS: A total of 848 blood cultures were obtained from 461 children, of which 123 (14.5%) from 105 children (median age 3.5 years, 51% girls) were culture positive, including 75 (8.8%) with clearly pathogenic organisms. The event rates for positive cultures with clearly pathogenic organisms after 0-1, 2-3, 4-11 and >/=12 months on ART were 13.3, 11.4, 2.1 and 0.3 per 1000 person-months of follow-up, respectively. The pathogens isolated (n; %) were Streptococcus pneumoniae (36; 28.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (11; 8.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6; 4.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6; 4.7%), Salmonella spp (6; 4.7%), Escherichia coli (5; 3.9%), Haemophilus influenzae (1; 0.8%) and fungal spp (4; 3.1%). Other bacteria of doubtful pathogenicity (n = 52; 42%) were also isolated. Most isolates tested were highly (80-100%) susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin; very few (~5%) were susceptible to cotrimoxazole; S. pneumoniae had high susceptibility to amoxicillin/ampicillin (80%). CONCLUSIONS: Rates of proven bacteremia were >20-fold higher immediately after starting ART compared with 12 months later in African HIV-infected children. S. pneumoniae was most commonly isolated, suggesting need for pneumococcal vaccination and effective prophylactic antibiotics.
TI  - Lung microbiota and bacterial abundance in patients with bronchiectasis when clinically stable and during exacerbation.
AB  - RATIONALE: Characterization of bacterial populations in infectious respiratory diseases will provide improved understanding of the relationship between the lung microbiota, disease pathogenesis, and treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To comprehensively define lung microbiota composition during stable disease and exacerbation in patients with bronchiectasis. METHODS: Sputum was collected from patients when clinically stable and before and after completion of antibiotic treatment of exacerbations. Bacterial abundance and community composition were analyzed using anaerobic culture and 16S rDNA pyrosequencing. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In clinically stable patients, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were detected in 40 of 40 (100%) and 33 of 40 (83%) sputum samples, respectively. The dominant organisms cultured were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 10 patients), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 12), Prevotella (n = 18), and Veillonella (n = 13). Pyrosequencing generated more than 150,000 sequences, representing 113 distinct microbial taxa; the majority of observed community richness resulted from taxa present in low abundance with similar patterns of phyla distribution in clinically stable patients and patients at the onset of exacerbation. After treatment of exacerbation, there was no change in total (P = 0.925), aerobic (P = 0.917), or anaerobic (P = 0.683) load and only a limited shift in community composition. Agreement for detection of bacteria by culture and pyrosequencing was good for aerobic bacteria such as P. aeruginosa (kappa = 0.84) but poorer for other genera including anaerobes. Lack of agreement was largely due to bacteria being detected by pyrosequencing but not by culture. CONCLUSIONS: A complex microbiota is present in the lungs of patients with bronchiectasis and remains stable through treatment of exacerbations, suggesting that changes in microbiota composition do not account for exacerbations.
TI  - Baby bottle steam sterilizers disinfect home nebulizers inoculated with bacterial respiratory pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Contaminated nebulizers are a potential source of bacterial infection but no single method is universally accepted for disinfection. We hypothesized that baby-bottle steam sterilizers effectively disinfect home nebulizers. METHODS: Home nebulizers were inoculated with the common CF respiratory pathogens methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, mucoid and non mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The nebulizers were swabbed for bacterial growth, treated with either the AVENT (Philips), the NUK Quick & Ready (Gerber) or DRY-POD (Camera Baby) baby bottle steam sterilizer and reswabbed for bacterial growth. RESULTS: All steam sterilizers were effective at disinfecting all home nebulizers. Viable bacteria were not recovered from any inoculated site after steam treatment, under any conditions tested. CONCLUSIONS: Steam treatment is an effective disinfection method. Additional studies are needed to confirm whether these results are applicable to the clinical setting.
TI  - System specificity of the TpsB transporters of coexpressed two-partner secretion  systems of Neisseria meningitidis.
AB  - The two-partner secretion (TPS) systems of Gram-negative bacteria consist of a large secreted exoprotein (TpsA) and a transporter protein (TpsB) located in the outer membrane. TpsA targets TpsB for transport across the membrane via its approximately 30-kDa TPS domain located at its N terminus, and this domain is also the minimal secretory unit. Neisseria meningitidis genomes encode up to five TpsAs and two TpsBs. Sequence alignments of TPS domains suggested that these are organized into three systems, while there are two TpsBs, which raised questions on their system specificity. We show here that the TpsB2 transporter of Neisseria meningitidis is able to secrete all types of TPS domains encoded in N. meningitidis and the related species Neisseria lactamica but not domains of Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In contrast, the TpsB1 transporter seemed to be specific for its cognate N. meningitidis system and did not secrete the TPS domains of other meningococcal systems. However, TpsB1 did secrete the TPS2b domain of N. lactamica, which is related to the meningococcal TPS2 domains. Apparently, the secretion depends on specific sequences within the TPS domain rather than the overall TPS domain structure.
TI  - IL-17C is a mediator of respiratory epithelial innate immune response.
AB  - The IL-17 family of cytokines consists of at least six members (IL-17A to -F). IL-17 directly activates epithelial cells leading to the expression of inflammatory mediators and antimicrobial factors. Recent studies showed that IL-17C is expressed by epithelial cells. It was the purpose of this study to examine the expression of IL-17 family members in respiratory epithelial cells during bacterial infection. We show that common bacterial pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae, and ligands of Toll-like receptors 3 and 5 (flagellin, polyI:C) induced the expression and release of IL-17C in cultured human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs). The expression of IL-17A, -B, -D, or -E was not induced by bacterial stimuli in HBECs. IL-17C enhanced inflammatory responses of respiratory epithelial cells infected with P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cigarette smoke suppressed the expression of IL-17C in HBECs in response to bacterial infection and in vivo in the upper airways of mice colonized with H. influenzae. IL-17C could also be detected in bronchial tissue of subjects with infection-related lung diseases. These data show that IL-17C is involved in the innate immune response of respiratory epithelial cells and is suppressed by cigarette smoke.
TI  - Massilia sp. isolated from otitis media.
AB  - Common bacterial pathogens of otitis media include Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and Group A streptococci. We recently isolated a gram-negative, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming bacterium from a patient with otitis media following tympanocentesis. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity studies of effusion identified this strain (CCUG 43427AT) as Massilia sp. (99.7%). Massilia spp. have been isolated from soil, air, and immunocompromised patients. However, there are no reports of their isolation from cases of otitis media. This case report highlights a rare and novel bacterial organism of otitis media.
TI  - A reflection on bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents at a major tertiary  care center in Lebanon over a decade.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance has been inflecting deleterious health and economic consequences locally and globally. This study addresses the patterns and trends of bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents over a decade, at a major tertiary care center in Beirut. METHODS: Data on bacterial susceptibility patterns at the CAP accredited Clinical Microbiology Laboratory is analyzed from January 2000 to November 2011, along with related different studies conducted during this period. RESULTS: Increasing rates of ESBL-producing isolates were noted for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. Resistance to carbapenems remains problematic in Acinetobacter spp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and started emerging in E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Tigecycline and colistin maintained excellent activity against most ESBL and carbapenem resistant bacteria relevant to the treatment by these agents. Resistance to quinolones is being encountered in Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), though remaining relatively high, showed decreasing trends of resistance, while vancomycin maintain uniform activity. Rare and sporadic vancomycin resistant strains in enterococci are encountered. Macrolide and clindamycin increasing rates of resistance is noted in S. pneumoniae, group A streptococci, S. aureus, viridans streptococci and some others. CONCLUSION: Physicians should be aware of the local epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance to properly guide the initial therapy. These resistance problems can be attributed to uncontrolled use of antimicrobial agents, thus, highlighting the need for antimicrobial stewardship to curb this threat.
TI  - [Comparison of culture and real-time PCR methods in the detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae in acute otitis media effusion specimens].
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are the major etiologic agents of acute otitis media. This study was aimed to compare the detection rate of S.pneumoniae and H.influenzae by culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (Rt-PCR) in the middle ear effusions of patients diagnosed as acute otitis media. A total of 60 middle ear effusion samples collected from children with acute otitis media were included in the study. The samples were inoculated and incubated in BACTEC Ped Plus blood culture bottles and BACTEC 9120 system (BD Diagnostic Systems, MD), respectively, and the isolates were identified by conventional methods. For the molecular diagnosis of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae, ply pneumolysin gene and HIB capsule region, respectively were amplified by Rt-PCR (LightCycler, Roche Diagnostics, Germany). H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae were isolated from 5 (8.3%) and 3 (5%) of the patient samples with conventional culture methods, respectively. In addition in 11.6% of the samples other microorganisms (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus sanguinis, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans) were also isolated. On the other hand H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae were detected in 38 (63.3%) and 24 (40%) of the samples with Rt-PCR, respectively. There was about eight fold increase in the detection frequency of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae with Rt-PCR compared to culture methods. When culture was accepted as the gold standard method, the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of Rt-PCR in the detection of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae were estimated as 80%, 51% and 98.2%, respectively. As a result, Rt-PCR was shown to be a sensitive method and could be preferred for the rapid diagnosis of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae in the etiological diagnosis of acute otitis media, especially in culture negative cases.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  - Postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (LVFX) has been conducted continuously since 1992. The present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in Japan to 30 selected antibacterial agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (FQs). The common respiratory pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to FQs. In contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among S pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Regarding H. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). Enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to FQs, however, prevalence of LVFX-resistant Escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. Nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of LVFX-resistant E. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence of LVFX 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. Another Enterobacteriaceae member, Klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to FQs, in contrast with E. coli. In methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the percentage of FQ-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other FQs. However, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates were highly susceptible to FQs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. The prevalence of FQs-resistant isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of FQ-resistance in MRSA. The prevalence of FQs-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (UTIs) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in P. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (RTIs). While this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were noted in the prevalence of FQ-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates derived from UTIs. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from UTIs and 0.3% among isolates from RTIs, a decrease from the results of 2007. Acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to FQs. Imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). Neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance of 81.3-82.5%, to FQs. Ceftriaxone (CTRX) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to CTRX in some clinical isolates. The result of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant staphylococci, Enterococcus faecium, P. aeruginosa from UTIs, N. gonorrhoeae, and E. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the FQs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. While FQ resistance has been prevailing in E. coli, E. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to FQs. The other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against FQs.
TI  - Novel carbapenem antibiotics for parenteral and oral applications: in vitro and in vivo activities of 2-aryl carbapenems and their pharmacokinetics in laboratory animals.
AB  - SM-295291 and SM-369926 are new parenteral 2-aryl carbapenems with strong activity against major causative pathogens of community-acquired infections such as methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (including ciprofloxacin-resistant strains), with MIC(90)s of </= 1 mug/ml. Unlike tebipenem (MIC(50), 8 mug/ml), SM-295291 and SM-369926 had no activity against hospital pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC(50), >/= 128 mug/ml). The bactericidal activities of SM-295291 and SM-369926 against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren. The therapeutic efficacies of intravenous administrations of SM-295291 and SM-369926 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren, respectively, reflecting their in vitro activities. SM-295291 and SM-369926 showed intravenous pharmacokinetics similar to those of meropenem in terms of half-life in monkeys (0.4 h) and were stable against human dehydropeptidase I. SM-368589 and SM-375769, which are medoxomil esters of SM-295291 and SM-369926, respectively, showed good oral bioavailability in rats, dogs, and monkeys (4.2 to 62.3%). Thus, 2-aryl carbapenems are promising candidates that show an ideal broad spectrum for the treatment of community-acquired infections, including infections caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, have low selective pressure on antipseudomonal carbapenem-resistant nosocomial pathogens, and allow parenteral, oral, and switch therapies.
TI  - In vitro comparison of combination and monotherapy for the empiric and optimal coverage of bacterial keratitis based on incidence of infection.
AB  - PURPOSE: Cefazolin/tobramycin, cefuroxime/gentamicin, and moxifloxacin were compared using bacterial keratitis isolates to determine whether empiric therapy constituted optimal antibacterial treatment. METHODS: Based on percent incidence of corneal infection, 27 Staphylococcus aureus, 16 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 Serratia marcescens, 4 Moraxella lacunata, 3 Haemophilus influenzae, 9 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 7 Streptococcus viridans, 6 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 7 assorted Gram-positive isolates, and 11 assorted Gram-negative isolates were tested for minimum inhibitory concentrations to cefazolin, tobramycin, cefuroxime, gentamicin, and moxifloxacin using E-tests to determine susceptibility and potency. RESULTS: The in vitro coverage (susceptible to at least one antibiotic) of cefuroxime/gentamicin (97%) was statistically equal to cefazolin/tobramycin (93%) and moxifloxacin (92%) (P = 0.29). Double coverage (susceptible to both antibiotics) was equivalent (P = 0.77) for cefuroxime/gentamicin (42%) and cefazolin/tobramycin (40%). The susceptibilities of individual coverage were moxifloxacin (92%), gentamicin (89%), tobramycin (74%), cefazolin (58%), and cefuroxime (52%). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was best covered by gentamicin 100% (9 of 9). Tobramycin was more potent (P = 0.00001) than gentamicin for P. aeruginosa, whereas cefazolin was more potent (P = 0.0004) than cefuroxime for S. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: Although there seems to be no in vitro empiric coverage advantage between cefazolin/tobramycin, cefuroxime/gentamicin, and moxifloxacin monotherapy, potency differences may occur and optimal treatment can best be determined with laboratory studies.
TI  - Use of nasopharyngeal culture to determine appropriateness of antibiotic therapy  in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rhinosinusitis is one of the top 5 diagnoses for which an antibiotic  is prescribed, often without a clear bacterial etiology. This study evaluated whether nasopharyngeal culture and gram stain could serve as a surrogate for endoscopically obtained middle meatal cultures in directing appropriate therapy for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS). This study also investigated the utility of a rapid sinus test screen in differentiating bacterial from nonbacterial rhinosinusitis. METHODS: Thirty-one adult patients met inclusion criteria for ABRS. Samples were obtained from both the middle meatus and nasopharynx for Gram stain and culture. Nasal mucous samples were tested with a rapid sinus test strip measuring pH, levels of protein, nitrites, and leukocyte esterase. RESULTS: Sixty-one percent (61%) of nasopharyngeal and 48% of middle meatal samples grew pathogenic bacteria. The concordance rate was 84% between the 2 sites (p = 0.0006). The following pathogenic organisms were detected: Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. For nasopharyngeal samples, reliance on Gram stain alone exhibited a sensitivity of 31% and specificity of 100% and, similarly, for middle meatus samples, 47% and 93%, respectively. The rapid sinus test revealed a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 7%. CONCLUSION: Nasopharyngeal and middle meatal cultures exhibited high concordance for pathogenic bacteria. Gram stain exhibited moderate sensitivity and excellent specificity. Nasopharyngeal cultures could provide a viable method, especially in a primary care setting, for determining the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy. The rapid sinus test's lack of specificity precluded its utility in the differentiation between bacterial and nonbacterial rhinosinusitis.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin dry powder for inhalation in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis: a  phase II randomised study.
AB  - This phase II, randomised, double-blind, multicentre study (NCT00930982) investigated the safety and efficacy of ciprofloxacin dry powder for inhalation (DPI) in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Adults who were culture positive for pre-defined potential respiratory pathogens (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae) were randomised to ciprofloxacin DPI 32.5 mg or placebo administered twice daily for 28 days (with 56 days of follow-up). Bacterial density in sputum (primary end-point), pulmonary function tests, health-related quality of life and safety were monitored throughout the study. 60 subjects received ciprofloxacin DPI 32.5 mg and 64 received placebo. Subjects on ciprofloxacin DPI had a significant reduction (p<0.001) in total sputum bacterial load at the end of treatment (-3.62 log10 CFU.g(-1) (range -9.78-5.02 log10 CFU.g(-1))) compared with placebo (-0.27 log10 CFU.g(-1) (range -7.96-5.25 log10 CFU.g(-1))); the counts increased thereafter. In the ciprofloxacin DPI group, 14 (35%) out of 40 subjects reported pathogen eradication at end of treatment versus four (8%) out of 49 in the placebo group (p=0.001). No abnormal safety results were reported and rates of bronchospasm were low. Ciprofloxacin DPI 32.5 mg twice daily for 28 days was well tolerated and achieved significant reductions in total bacterial load compared with placebo in subjects with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.
TI  - The OmpA family of proteins: roles in bacterial pathogenesis and immunity.
AB  - The OmpA family of outer membrane proteins is a group of genetically related, heat-modifiable, surface-exposed, porin proteins that are in high-copy number in the outer membrane of mainly Gram-negative bacteria. OmpA proteins are characterized by an N-terminal domain that forms an eight-stranded, anti-parallel beta barrel, which is embedded in the outer membrane. The C-terminal domain is globular and located in the periplasmic space. Escherichia coli OmpA is the best characterized of the proteins. Other well-characterized OmpA-equivalent proteins from pathogenic bacteria include Pseudomonas aeruginosa OprF, Haemophilus influenzae P5, Klebsiella pneumoniae OmpA, and Chlamydia trachomatis major outer membrane protein (MOMP). OmpA from the veterinary pathogens Mannheimia haemolytica, Haemophilus parasuis, Leptospira interrogans, and Pasteurella multocida have been studied to a lesser extent. Among many of the pathogenic bacteria, OmpA proteins have important pathogenic roles including bacterial adhesion, invasion, or intracellular survival as well as evasion of host defenses or stimulators of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. These pathogenic roles are most commonly associated with central nervous system, respiratory and urogenital diseases. Alternatively, OmpA family proteins can serve as targets of the immune system with immunogenicity related to surface-exposed loops of the molecule. In several cases, OmpA proteins are under evaluation as potential vaccine candidates.
TI  - Fluoroquinolones in the treatment of bronchopulmonary disease in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Fluoroquinolones are commonly used to treat lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. These patients are susceptible to lung infection with common bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae, but are also prone to infection by opportunistic bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The good oral bioavailability and broad antimicrobial spectrum of activity, including antipseudomonal properties, make this class of antimicrobial attractive. We review the evidence assessing the use of fluoroquinolones in the context of preventing and eradicating early lung infection and in managing chronic lung infection and pulmonary exacerbations. The safety of fluoroquinolones and the use of newer agents in the class are also discussed.
TI  - Prevention of gentamicin-induced apoptosis with the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mitoquinone.
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Antioxidants have been shown to protect against aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss. Mitoquinone (MitoQ) is a mitochondria-targeted derivative of the antioxidant ubiquinone. MitoQ is attached to a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cation, which enables its accumulation inside the mitochondria several hundred-fold over the untargeted antioxidant. The goals of this study were to determine if MitoQ attenuates gentamicin-induced activation of caspase-3/7 activity as a marker of apoptosis and to determine if MitoQ impacts aminoglycoside antimicrobial efficacy. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective and controlled. METHODS: Antibiotic efficacy and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of gentamicin against three strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were evaluated with and without MitoQ using broth dilution methods. Apoptosis was assessed by caspase-3/7 activity in untreated HEI-OC1 cells and cells exposed to 2 mM gentamicin for 24 hours, with and without a 24-hour preincubation with 0.5 muM each of MitoQ, idebenone (an untargeted ubiquinone), or decylTPP (positive control). RESULTS: Gentamicin MICs for P aeruginosa and H influenzae were not affected by MitoQ at pharmacological levels. MICs for S aureus were enhanced by MitoQ. Cell viability was significantly lower in the gentamicin-treated cells. A significant increase in caspase-3/7 activity was observed in cells treated with gentamicin or with idebenone + gentamicin (P = .005). Preincubation with MitoQ decreased the gentamicin-induced apoptosis of HEI-OC1 cells to a greater extent compared to idebenone (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: MitoQ attenuates gentamicin-induced apoptosis in HEI-OC1 cells and does not compromise gentamicin antibiotic efficacy. MitoQ holds promise as a means of preventing aminoglycoside ototoxicity.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibilityof clinical isolates of aerobic gram-negative bacteria in 2008].
AB  - We determined MICs of antibacterial agents against 1145 clinical strains of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (22 species) isolated at 16 Japanese facilities in 2008. MICs were determined using mostly broth microdilution method and antibacterial activity was assessed. Strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) accounted for 3.8% of Escherichia coli, 2.6% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6.8% of Klebsiella oxytoca, 5.5% of Proteus mirabilis and 1.8% of Proteus vulgaris. ESBL produced strains were 6.8% at K. oxytoca that increased compared with 3.2% and 5.5% at P. mirabilis that decreased compared with 18.8% in 2006. Among Haemophilus influenzae, 61.7% that decreased compared with 67.7% in 2006, equaled 58.7% in 2004, were strains when classified by penicillin-binding protein 3 mutation. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2006. Although two antibacterial agents that tobramycin showed an MIC90 of 1 microg/mL and doripenem showed an MIC90 of 4 microg/mL against P. aeruginosa have potent activity. Of all P. aeruginosa strains, 4.3% were resistant to six agents of nine antipseudomonal agents, that decreased compared to 12.2% in 2004 and 5.7% in 2006. Against other glucose-non-fermentative Gram-negative rods, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2006.
TI  - Glycerol monolaurate antibacterial activity in broth and biofilm cultures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glycerol monolaurate (GML) is an antimicrobial agent that has potent  activity against gram-positive bacteria. This study examines GML antibacterial activity in comparison to lauric acid, in broth cultures compared to biofilm cultures, and against a wide range of gram-positive, gram-negative, and non-gram staining bacteria. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: GML is >/= 200 times more effective than lauric acid in bactericidal activity, defined as a >/= 3 log reduction in colony-forming units (CFU)/ml, against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes in broth cultures. Both molecules inhibit superantigen production by these organisms at concentrations that are not bactericidal. GML prevents biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae, as representative gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, tested in 96 well microtiter plates, and simultaneously is bactericidal for both organisms in mature biofilms. GML is bactericidal for a wide range of potential bacterial pathogens, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae. In the presence of acidic pH and the cation chelator ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, GML has greatly enhanced bactericidal activity for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae. Solubilization of GML in a nonaqueous delivery vehicle (related to K-Y Warming(R)) enhances its bactericidal activity against S. aureus. Both R and S, and 1 and 2 position lauric acid derivatives of GML exhibit bactericidal activity. Despite year-long passage of Staphylococcus aureus on sub-growth inhibitory concentrations of GML (0.5 x minimum bactericidal concentration), resistance to GML did not develop. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: GML may be useful as a broad-spectrum human or animal topical microbicide and may be useful as an environmental surface microbicide for management of bacterial infections and contamination.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the Surveillance Committee of Japanese Society of Chemotherapy, Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases, and Japanese Society for Clinical Microbiology in 2009: general view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  - For the purpose of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial respiratory pathogens from patients in Japan, the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy (JSC) started a survey in 2006. From 2009, JSC continued the survey in collaboration with the Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases and the Japanese Society for Clinical Microbiology. The fourth-year survey was conducted during the period from January and April 2009 by the three societies. A total of 684 strains were collected from clinical specimens obtained from well-diagnosed adult patients with respiratory tract infections. Susceptibility testing was evaluable with 635 strains (130 Staphylococcus aureus, 127 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 4 Streptococcus pyogenes, 123 Haemophilus influenzae, 70 Moraxella catarrhalis, 78 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 103 Pseudomonas aeruginosa). A maximum of 45 antibacterial agents including 26 beta-lactams (four penicillins, three penicillins in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, four oral cephems, eight parenteral cephems, one monobactam, five carbapenems, and one penem), four aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, six fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone were used for the study. Analysis was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI). Incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was as high as 58.5 %, and that of penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP and PRSP) was 6.3 % and 0.0 %, respectively. Among H. influenzae, 21.1 % of them were found to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediately resistant (BLNAI), 18.7 % to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ABPC-resistant (BLNAR), and 5.7 % to be beta-lactamase-producing ABPC-resistant (BLPAR) strains. A high frequency (76.5 %) of beta-lactamase-producing strains has been suspected in Moraxella catarrhalis isolates. Four (3.2 %) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae were found among 126 strains. Four isolates (2.5 %) of P. aeruginosa were found to be metallo-beta-lactamase-producing strains, including three (1.9 %) suspected multi-drug resistant strains showing resistance against imipenem, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. Continuous national surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory pathogens is crucial to monitor changing patterns of susceptibility and to be able to update treatment recommendations on a regular basis.
TI  - Frequency of fungi in respiratory samples from Turkish cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - An increased isolation of fungi from the respiratory tract of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) has been reported. The prevalence of different fungi in CF patients from Turkey is not known. Our aim was to determine the frequency of fungi in the respiratory tract of Turkish CF patients. We investigated a total of 184 samples from 48 patients. Samples were inoculated on Medium B+ and CHROMagar Candida. Candida albicans was the predominant yeast isolated [30 patients (62.5%)], followed by C. parapsilosis [6 (12.5%)] and C. dubliniensis 5 (10.4%). Aspergillus fumigatus was the most common filamentous fungus [5 (10.4%)] and non-fumigatus Aspergillus species were isolated from four (8.3%) patients. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently detected bacterium in C. albicans positive samples (53.57%). A. fumigatus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa or S. aureus were detected together in 75% of A. fumigatus positive samples each. No statistically significant relationship was detected between growth of yeast and moulds and age, gender, the use of inhaled corticosteroids or tobramycin. No significant correlation was found between the isolation of C. albicans, A. fumigatus and P. aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia or S. aureus, and the isolation of C. albicans and Haemophilus influenzae. Other factors which may be responsible for the increased isolation of fungi in CF need to be investigated.
TI  - Chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 1957, Tunisia introduced 117 species of Eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. Actually, Eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. A few investigations were reported on the biological activities of Eucalyptus oils worldwide. In Tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. At that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. METHODS: The essential oils of eight Eucalyptus species harvested from the Jbel Abderrahman, Korbous (North East Tunisia) and Souinet arboreta (North of Tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. RESULTS: Twenty five components were identified by GC/FID and GC/MS. These components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. The chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. According to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % I, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to Eucalyptus oils. The cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within Eucalyptus species oils. CONCLUSIONS: E. odorata showed the strongest activity against S. aureus, H. influenzae, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and against all the tested fungal strains. In addition, E. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. However, the best antiviral activity appeared with E. bicostata. Virus pretreatment with E. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (IC(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, SI = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (IC(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, SI = 3.33). The essential oil of E. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. This activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.
TI  - Comparison of the WST-8 colorimetric method and the CLSI broth microdilution method for susceptibility testing against drug-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) obtained from the susceptibility testing of various bacteria to antibiotics were determined by a colorimetric microbial viability assay based on reduction of a tetrazolium salt {2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazoli um, monosodium salt (WST-8)} via 2-methyl-1,4-napthoquinone as an electron mediator and compared with those obtained by the broth microdilution methods approved by the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI). Especially for drug-resistant bacteria, the CLSI method at an incubation time of 24h tended to give lower MICs. The extension of incubation time was necessary to obtain consistent MICs for drug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococi (VRE) and multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) in the broth microdilution method. There was excellent agreement between the MICs determined after 24h using the WST-8 colorimetric method and those obtained after 48-96 h using the broth microdilution method. The results suggest that the WST-8 colorimetric assay is a useful method for rapid determination of consistent MICs for drug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of sitafloxacin against bacteria isolated from Thai patients with urinary tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine comparative in vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates of bacteria from Thai patients with urinary tract infection and those with lower respiratory tract infection. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 1,255 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus spp, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis isolated from different Thai patients with urinary tract infection and those with lower respiratory tract infection in 2010 were included. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of sitafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, imipenem, amikacin, ampicillin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, penicillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, azithromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were determined by standard agar dilution method. RESULTS: The MIC50 and MIC90 values of sitafloxacin against all tested bacteria were lowest when compared with those of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Sitafloxacin was active against 51% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates. The activity of sitafloxacin against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria, such as, extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and K. pneumomiae, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii was comparable to or more than that of some beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins or carbapenems. CONCLUSION: Sitafloxacin is more active than levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against isolated bacteria from Thai patients with urinary tract and lower respiratory infections including antibiotic resistant bacteria, such as MRSA, ESBL-producing Gram-negatives, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii.
TI  - [Changes of etiology of chronic sinusitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore etiology distribution changes of chronic naso sinusitis. METHOD: The purulent discharges taken from the maxillary sinus and posterior ethmoid sinus of 111 patients during endoscopic sinus surgery were cultured for both bacteria and fungi as experimental group. In the control group, the discharges of the nasal cavity from 30 healthy adults were also cultured for bacteria. The culture results were compared with data of 2005, and changes in the distribution of pathogenic microorganisms were analyzed. RESULT: Fifteen species, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus viridans, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, were cultured from the testing group. The total positive rate of bacteria was 81.8%. The detectable rates of Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and various fungi were 37.8%, 54.4%, 7.8% respectively. Five species including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus viridans, Branhamella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus etc were cultured from the control group. There was significant differences between 2005 and 2010 in experimental group (chi2 = 0.009, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Bacterial infection is a major reason for chronic sinusitis. The bacteria distribution structure changed from the original gram-positive bacteria to gram-negative bacteria. Fungal infections can not be ignored. To bacteria culture and drug sensitivity test should be done before antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Prevalence of cystic fibrosis pathogens in the oropharynx of healthy children and implications for cystic fibrosis care.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of the CF pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae in OP cultures from healthy children. METHODS: Oropharyngeal (OP) swabs were collected from 100 healthy children </=18 years of age undergoing a clinically indicated procedure. RESULTS: P. aeruginosa was isolated from the OP swab of one participant, S. aureus from 48 participants (including 4 methicillin-resistant) and H. influenzae from 47 participants. Cultures from 75 participants grew one or more of these organisms (55 grew one, 19 grew 2 and one grew 3 organisms). CONCLUSION: P. aeruginosa is rarely recovered from the oropharynx of healthy children </=18 years of age, while recovery of S. aureus and H. influenzae is common. It is important to understand what the "normal" prevalence of CF pathogens is in the oropharynx in order to aid interpretation of OP cultures in CF patients.
TI  - Fatal pneumonia associated with temozolomide therapy in patients with malignant glioma.
AB  - This report presents the cases of three patients with fatal pneumonia that was highly suspected to be Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) based on serological diagnosis. Their chest radiographs showed bilateral pneumonia and each had presented with severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation when they arrived at the hospital. Although bronchoscopical sampling could not be performed, their chest computed tomography imaging and a marked elevation of serum KL-6 and beta-D-glucan levels were characteristic of Pneumocystis pneumonia. All three were found to have been treated with temozolomide after surgery for malignant glioma. Temozolomide can cause Pneumocystis pneumonia. The three patients did not receive prophylactic medication against Pneumocystis pneumonia during treatment with temozolomide, and their histories suggested that all had delayed seeking treatment. It may be difficult to diagnose Pneumocystis pneumonia because the symptoms are not specific for Pneumocystis pneumonia and they tend to be similar to those of common respiratory infectious diseases. Therefore, patients who receive temozolomide therapy have the potential to develop fatal pneumonia and should be carefully observed. The patients should also be adequately informed about Pneumocystis pneumonia, and prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia should be considered proactively before treatment with temozolomide is initiated.
TI  - Bacteria in sputum of stable severe asthma and increased airway wall thickness.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic asthma have thicker intrapulmonary airways measured on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). We determined whether the presence of lower airway bacteria was associated with increased airway wall thickness. METHODS: In 56 patients with stable severe asthma, sputum specimens obtained either spontaneously or after induction with hypertonic saline were cultured for bacteria and thoracic HRCT scans obtained. Wall thickness (WT) and area (WA) expressed as a ratio of airway diameter (D) and total area, respectively, were measured at five levels. RESULTS: Positive bacterial cultures were obtained in 29 patients, with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus being the commonest strains. Logistic regression analysis showed that this was associated with the duration of asthma and the exacerbations during the past year. In airways > 2 mm, there was no significant difference in WA (67.5 +/- 5.4 vs 66.4 +/- 5.4) and WT/D (21.6 +/- 2.7 vs 21.3 +/- 2.4) between the culture negative versus positive groups. Similarly, in airways (</= 2 mm), there were no significant differences in these parameters. The ratio of radicalwall area to Pi was negatively correlated with FEV1% predicted (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial colonization of the lower airways is common in patients with chronic severe asthma and is linked to the duration of asthma and having had exacerbations in the past year, but not with an increase in airway wall thickness.
TI  - Bacteriology of the paranasal sinuses in pediatric cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review the characteristic microbiology of the paranasal sinuses in patients with cystic fibrosis who undergo endoscopic sinus surgery. To examine the subtypes of organisms cultured from the maxillary sinuses and determine their sensitivity to antibiotic therapy. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Tertiary care children's hospital. METHODS: Sinus cultures were obtained from 51 patients with cystic fibrosis during endoscopic sinus procedures between 2000 and 2004 at a tertiary care children's hospital. A retrospective chart review was undertaken to obtain culture and sensitivity data of the sinus contents. RESULTS: The most common bacteria isolated was Staphylococcus aureus (71%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA) (27%), Haemophilus influenzae (21%), Staphylococcus non-aureus (16%) and Streptococcus viridans (12%). Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis were rarely isolated (2% and 0% respectively). Twenty-nine percent of the patients with cultures positive for PSA were of the mucoid variant. Only one patient had culture positive Escherichia coli. Antibiotic resistance among the more common organisms cultured from the sinus samples is also listed. CONCLUSION: Staph. aureus is the most common isolate in the sinuses of this pediatric CF population followed by P. aeruginosa and H. influenzae. Although many isolates are pansensitive, some isolates are panresistant.
TI  - Retrospective analysis of microorganisms isolated from cystic fibrosis patients in Southern Italy, 2002-2010.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aim was to determine the prevalence of microorganisms in the respiratory tract of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) admitted to the CF Reference Centre in Southern Italy between 2002-2010. METHODS: Microbiology assessment of samples (sputum and tracheal aspirates) collected from patients with pulmonary exacerbation admitted to hospital was carried out. All patients were registered in a database and clinical and microbiological data were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: Overall, 188 patients were included and a total of 1217 samples were analysed. The most common microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (78.7% of the patients) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (58%), followed by Candida albicans (19.1%), Haemophilus influenzae (13.3%) and Aspergillus fumigatus (9.6%). CONCLUSION: Compared to similar studies performed in other European countries, our microbiological data, especially the low occurrence of filamentous fungi, suggest a specific local epidemiology, probably related to some uncommon CFTR mutations, which are specific to Southern Italy.
TI  - [Antimicrobial treatment of patients with severe acute exacerbation of COPD].
AB  - Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death worldwide. In patients with acute exacerbations admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), potentially pathogenic microorganisms can be found in approximately 50%, with Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae as the leading strains, followed by enterobacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Viruses can also be detected in a large proportion of patients. The indication for antimicrobial treatment of acutely exacerbated COPD is still controversial but recommended by guidelines for all patients admitted to an ICU. Appropriate agents for an empiric initial treatment are penicillins + betalactamase inhibitor, 2(nd) and 3(rd) generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, and quinolones. Antimicrobial treatment should be adjusted according to the results of microbial investigation of sputum or endotracheal aspirate.
TI  - Acquired cilia dysfunction in chronic rhinosinusitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cilia are complex and powerful cellular structures of the respiratory mucosa that play a critical role in airway defense. Respiratory epithelium is lined with cilia that perform an integrated and coordinated mechanism called mucociliary clearance. Mucociliary clearance is the process by which cilia transport the mucus blanket overlying respiratory mucosa to the gastrointestinal tract for ingestion. It is the primary means by which the airway clears pathogens, allergens, debris, and toxins. The complex structure and regulatory mechanisms that dictate the form and function of normal cilia are not entirely understood, but it is clear that ciliary dysfunction results in impaired respiratory defense. METHODS: A literature review of the current knowledge of cilia dysfunction in chronic rhinosinsusitis was conducted. RESULTS: Ciliary dysfunction may be primary, the result of genetic mutations resulting in abnormal cilia structure, or, more commonly, secondary, the result of environmental, infectious, or inflammatory stimuli that disrupt normal motility or coordination. Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) have been found to have impaired mucociliary clearance. Many biochemical, environmental, and mechanical stimuli have been shown to influence ciliary beat frequency, and common microbial pathogens of respiratory mucosa such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae have developed toxins that appear to interrupt normal mucociliary function. Furthermore, inflammatory mediators known to be present in patients with CRS appear to impair secondarily mucociliary clearance. CONCLUSION: The goal of this article is to summarize the recent developments in the understanding of cilia dysfunction and mucociliary clearance in CRS.
TI  - Low serum mannose-binding lectin level is not associated with disease severity in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.
AB  - Deficiency of mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a serum protein involved in killing and promoting phagocytosis of pathogens, is associated with respiratory infection and disease progression in a number of acute and chronic lung diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF)- associated bronchiectasis. No such association has been studied in non-CF bronchiectasis (nCF-Br). One hundred and thirty-three adult patients with nCF-Br were studied. Serum MBL levels were measured and deficiency defined using two cut-off levels, i.e. MBL </=100 ng/ml and </=600 ng/ml. Parameters of severity included lung function impairment, annual exacerbation and hospital admission rates, breathlessness, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae infection rates. The incidence of MBL deficiency using cut-off levels of 100 ng/ml and 600 ng/ml was 10% and 26% respectively, similar to rates seen in the general population. There was no significant difference in mean FEV(1)% predicted between MBL deficient and sufficient patients at both cut-off levels (</=100 ng/ml: 63.8% vs. 64.6%, P = 0.91; </= 600 ng/ml: 66.5% vs. 63.9%, P = 0.56). In addition, exacerbation/hospital admission rates, symptoms of breathlessness and isolation/colonisation rates with P. aeruginosa and H. influenzae were similar in both groups at both cut-off levels. In conclusion, MBL deficiency is not associated with markers of disease severity in patients with nCF-Br.
TI  - Tympanostomy tube in vitro biofilm potential of common otopathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Post-tympanostomy tube otorrhea has been linked to microbial biofilms. The purpose of this study was to compare the tympanostomy tube-biofilm-forming propensity of common otopathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled, in vitro. SETTING: Academic research laboratory. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fluoroplastic coupons (1656 total, 46 per treatment per incubation period) were exposed to plasma and cultured with 3 strains each of the bacterial species for 2, 4, or 7 days. Half of the coupons were treated with antibiotics to kill planktonic bacteria. Total and biofilm colony counts and electron microscopy were performed. RESULTS: S aureus formed biofilm after 2 days, not different from 4- or 7-day biofilms (P > .05), and was most tolerant to antibiotic treatment. P aeruginosa also formed biofilms at 2 days, reached a plateau at 4 days (P > .05), and decreased at 7 days (P < .01). H influenzae formed biofilm only after 4 days (P </= .04). S pneumoniae did not form biofilm without catalase supplementation. With catalase, 1 S pneumoniae strain showed a delay in biofilm formation similar to H influenzae (P < .0001), while the other 2 strains formed biofilms after 2 days. CONCLUSIONS: Tympanostomy tube biofilm formation occurs with common middle ear pathogens but most readily with S aureus and P aeruginosa. Further investigation is needed to determine if these findings may, in part, explain the occasionally refractory nature of post-tympanostomy tube otorrhea associated with S aureus and P aeruginosa.
TI  - Pathogens in the lower respiratory tract of intensive care unit patients: impact  of duration of hospital care and mechanical ventilation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), the most common hospital-acquired infection in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, is caused by bacteria in the lower respiratory tract of mechanically ventilated patients. METHODS: The current study was focused on 443 bacterial isolates from the lower respiratory tract of mechanically ventilated ICU patients (n = 346) in a Swedish University Hospital. Data were obtained from a prospective infection control database covering 9 y (2002-2010). We analysed the correlation between duration of hospital care and mechanical ventilation at the time of sampling on the occurrence of different pathogens. RESULTS: Duration of hospital care and mechanical ventilation prior to sampling was similarly short for Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-streptococci, and Haemophilus influenzae (</= 2 days). In contrast, duration of hospital care and mechanical ventilation were longest for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (6 and 11 days). For Staphylococcus aureus, the most common Gram-positive isolate, the duration was longer than for S. pneumoniae but shorter than for most Gram-negative bacteria. With the exception of S. maltophilia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the median duration of mechanical ventilation was short and similar for most bacteria. In samples taken on the first day of mechanical ventilation, the rate of pathogens expected to be resistant to cefotaxime was 23%. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of pathogens with high antibiotic resistance in the lower respiratory tract increases with increased duration of hospital care and mechanical ventilation. An equally important result is that pathogens resistant to third-generation cephalosporins were more common than expected, even after a very short duration of hospital care and mechanical ventilation.
TI  - [Development and use of test-systems for molecular-genetic detection of out-of-hospital pneumonia agents].
AB  - AIM: Search of new targets and improvements of molecular-genetic detection methods of species specific DNA fragments of out-of-hospital pneumonia (OP) infection agents in sputum. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Species specific oligonucleotide primers to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Branhamella catarrhalis were selected. 103 sputum samples from OP patients and 15 from practically healthy humans were test by using PCR and bacteriological method. RESULTS: Mixed bacterial flora was detected by bacteriologic method in OP in 26 cases (25.2%). 14 patients (13.6%) had B. catarrhalis DNA in sputum, 12 patients (11.6%)--S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae was detected in 11 examined individuals (10.7%), K. pneumoniae (7.9%)-- in 8. In 32 cases (30%) etiology of OP could not be deciphered bacteriologically. B. catarrhalis was detected in 19 (18.5%) of OP patients, S. pneumoniae--in 17 (16.5%), H. influenzae and K. pneumoniae--in 14.5% and 12.6% (15 and 13 patients) respectively by Using the developed PCR primers. In 16.5% cases (17 patients) positive results against several bacteria species simultaneously were obtained by PCR method, in 3.9% (4 patients) P. aeruginosa was detected. CONCLUSION. Use of PCR for detection of out-of-hospital pneumonia agents DNA significantly increases informativity of the study when compared with bacteriological method.
TI  - Interactions of ocular isolates of gram-negative bacteria with lactoferrin.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim was to examine the interaction of lactoferrin with gram-negative bacteria isolated from ocular adverse responses. METHODS: Strains representing the species Pseudomonas aeruginosa (six strains), Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Haemophilus influenza were tested. A modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the binding of the strains to native and deglycosylated lactoferrin. The effect on the viability of strains was measured by incubating strains in media containing lactoferrin as the sole carbon and nitrogen source. Siderophore production by strains was measured using an established assay. RESULTS: All the strains except the single strain of E. coli (Ecol8) were capable of binding to lactoferrin. The ocular isolate of H. influenzae showed strong affinity for lactoferrin. The P. aeruginosa strains and the strain of S. maltophilia showed significantly reduced (80%-100% reduction; P<0.05) binding to lactoferrin that had been enzymatically deglycosylated, whereas deglycosylation had no effect on the binding of other strains/species tested. Most strains were able to grow and produce siderophores in the presence of lactoferrin as the sole carbon and nitrogen source. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to bind to and grow on lactoferrin can be important for gram-negative pathogens that colonize the ocular environment, because this could allow bacteria to survive and propagate in the presence of tear fluid.
TI  - The impact of intraoperative saline irrigations on bacterial load within the maxillary sinus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Saline irrigations are routinely employed during endoscopic sinus surgery to remove mucous and debris from the sinus cavities. What is unknown is whether this results in a quantitative reduction in pathologic bacteria within the sinus mucosa. The objectives of this study were to quantify the amount of 5 different bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS), and Streptococcus pneumoniae) within the maxillary sinus and to determine the impact of saline irrigations on bacterial counts. METHODS: Twenty patients with chronic rhinosinusitis were prospectively enrolled. After bilateral maxillary antrostomies, biopsies were taken of the maxillary sinus mucosa prior to any irrigation. In each patient, the left maxillary sinus was then irrigated with 250 cc of normal saline (NS) with a pressurized pulse-irrigation device and the right side was irrigated with 250 cc of NS using a 30-cc syringe attached to a curved suction tip. Repeat maxillary sinus mucosal biopsies were then taken from each side. Each biopsy was analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction to determine the presence and amount of each of the bacteria. RESULTS: Saline irrigations were found to significantly reduce the amount of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and S. pneumoniae found within the maxillary sinus mucosa. No difference was found for H. influenzae or CNS. No difference in bacterial load reduction was able to be shown between the pressurized saline flushes and manual saline rinse methods. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative saline irrigations are able to significantly reduce the amount of potentially pathogenic bacteria within the diseased sinus mucosa.
TI  - Lung function decline from adolescence to young adulthood in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite improving survival in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, there is a mortality peak in early adulthood. Defining risk factors that predict significant worsening of lung disease in young adulthood may identify opportunities to improve outcomes in adults. METHODS: We identified 4,680 patients in the Epidemiologic Study of Cystic Fibrosis 1994-2005 with data in both adolescence (age 14.0-17.4 years) and young adulthood (age 18.5-22.0 years) and analyzed 2,267 who had >/=5 encounters and >/=5 measurements of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1) ) spanning >/=1 year during both adolescence and young adulthood, and >/=1 encounter with weight and height and >/=1 FEV(1) measurement age 17.5-18.5 years. We compared the annualized rates of decline in FEV(1) during adolescence and young adulthood stratified by best FEV(1) around age 18. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors associated with substantial decline (>20 points) in FEV(1) % predicted in young adulthood. RESULTS: Annual rate of decline was greater in young adulthood than in adolescence. Risk factors for substantial decline included slower rate of FEV(1) decline, greater FEV(1) variability, faster body mass index (BMI) decline, male sex, chronic inhaled antibiotics, Haemophilus influenzae detection, and absence of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in adolescence, and lower than expected FEV(1) and BMI around age 18. CONCLUSIONS: Decline in lung function accelerates in young adults with CF, especially in those with early stage lung disease. Adolescents at risk for substantial decline in lung function in young adulthood have higher FEV(1) and worse nutritional status, among other identifiable risk factors.
TI  - [The comparison of patients with hospitalized health-care-associated pneumonia to community-acquired pneumonia].
AB  - Health-care-associated pneumonia (HCAP) is defined as pneumonia that develops in  patients with a history of recent hospitalization, hemodialysis as an outpatient, residence in a nursing home, outpatient intravenous therapy and home wound care. We aimed to compare the initial demographic characteristics, causative agents and prognosis between hospitalized HCAP and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients. HCAP and CAP patients hospitalized between 01 September 2008-01 September 2009 were evaluated retrospectively. Out of 187 patients (131 males, mean age 66.3 +/- 14.3 years) who were hospitalized during one-year period, 98 were diagnosed as HCAP and 89 as CAP. Among HCAP patients, 64 (65.3%) had a history of hospitalization in the last 90 days, 26 (26.5%) received outpatient intravenous therapy, 17 (17.3%) had home wound care, 6 (6.1%) were on hemodialysis program in the last 30 days and 4 (4.1%) lived in a nursing home. The causative pathogen was detected in 39 (39.8%) HCAP and 8 (9.0%) CAP patients. The most frequently isolated microorganisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii in HCAP, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae in CAP patients. Inappropriate empiric antibiotic treatment was documented in 8 (25.8%) of 39 HCAP patients, in whom a causative agent was isolated whereas the antibiotic treatment was appropriate in all CAP patients. The duration of hospitalization (14.4 +/- 11.4 vs. 10.7 +/- 7.9 days, p= 0.011) and mortality rate (34.7% vs. 9.0%, p< 0.001) were higher in HCAP compared with CAP patients. As HCAP is different than CAP in terms of patients' characteristics, causative microorganisms and prognosis, it should be considered in all patients hospitalized as CAP. Potentially drug-resistant microorganisms should be taken into consideration in the empirical antibiotic treatment of these patients.
TI  - Modulation of biofilm of strains isolated from patients with chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease by levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ceftriaxone.
AB  - The ability of levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid and ceftriaxone to interfere on biofilm produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was evaluated. The effects of antibiotics were evaluated on formation of biofilm (at 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 X MIC) and on preformed biofilm (at epithelial lining fluid peak concentrations) by means of a spectrophotometric method. Levofloxacin was the most active compound followed by ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ceftriaxone. Levofloxacin may contribute to clear the reservoir of pathogens involved in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, thus leading to decreased occurrence of acute exacerbations.
TI  - Thin-section CT findings of patients with acute Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia with and without concurrent infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the pulmonary thin-section CT findings of patients with acute Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia with and without concurrent infection. METHODS: The study group comprised 86 patients with acute S. pneumoniae pneumonia, 36 patients with S. pneumoniae pneumonia combined with Haemophilus influenzae infection, 26 patients with S. pneumoniae pneumonia combined with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and 22 patients with S. pneumoniae pneumonia combined with methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infection. We compared the thin-section CT findings among the groups. RESULTS: Centrilobular nodules and bronchial wall thickening were significantly more frequent in patients with pneumonia caused by concurrent infection (H. influenzae: p<0.001 and p<0.001, P. aeruginosa: p<0.001 and p<0.001, MSSA: p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively) than in those infected with S. pneumoniae alone. Cavity and bilateral pleural effusions were significantly more frequent in cases of S. pneumoniae pneumonia with concurrent P. aeruginosa infection than in cases of S. pneumoniae pneumonia alone (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively) or with concurrent H. influenzae (p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively) or MSSA infection (p<0.05 and p<0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: When a patient with S. pneumoniae pneumonia has centrilobular nodules, bronchial wall thickening, cavity or bilateral pleural effusions on CT images, concurrent infection should be considered.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial carbonic anhydrases and zinc proteases: from orphan targets to innovative new antibiotic drugs.
AB  - Zinc-containing enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrases (CAs) and metalloproteases (MPs) play critical functions in bacteria, being involved in various steps of their life cycle, which are important for survival, colonization, acquisition of nutrients for growth and proliferation, facilitation of dissemination, invasion and pathogenicity. The development of resistance to many classes of clinically used antibiotics emphasizes the need of new antibacterial drug targets to be explored. There is a wealth of data regarding bacterial CAs and zinc MPs present in many pathogenic species, such as Neisseria spp., Helycobacter pylori Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Brucella spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria spp, Vibrio spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, Streptomyces spp., Clostridium spp., Enterococcus spp., etc. Some of these enzymes have been cloned, purified and characterized by crystallographic techniques. However, for the moment, few potent and specific inhibitors for bacterial MPs have been reported except for Clostridium histolyticum collagenase, botulinum and tetanus neurotoxin and anthrax lethal factor, which will be reviewed in this article. Bacteria encode alpha-,beta-, and/or gamma-CA families, but up to now only the first two classes have been investigated in some detail in different species. The alpha-CAs from Neisseria spp. and H. pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from E. coli, H. pylori, M. tuberculosis, Brucella spp., S. pneumoniae, S. enterica and H. influenzae have been cloned and characterized. The catalytic/inhibition mechanisms of these CAs are well understood as X-ray crystal structures are available for some of them, but no adducts of these enzymes with inhibitors have been characterized so far. In vitro and in vivo studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates have been reported. Only for Neisseria spp., H. pylori, B. suis and S. pneumoniae CAs it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. Thus, bacterial CAs and MPs represent at this moment very promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.
TI  - MRSA and non-MRSA otorrhea in children: a comparative study of clinical course.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the perception that post-tympanostomy tube otorrhea caused by  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a more virulent disease than otorrhea caused by other pathogens by analyzing the clinical differences and disease courses in children diagnosed with otorrhea caused by MRSA bacteria vs non-MRSA bacteria. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Tertiary children's hospital. PATIENTS: We retrospectively examined the medical records of children who presented to a tertiary children's hospital from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2008, with otorrhea that occurred after tympanostomy tube insertion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Otorrhea culture records were used to group the 1079 patients into those whose otitis media was due to MRSA (n = 170) and those with non-MRSA otitis media (n = 909). From the non-MRSA group, we randomly selected an age-matched group of 170 and examined the differences between the MRSA and age-matched non-MRSA groups in organisms isolated by culture, demographic factors (including type of medical insurance), medical history, treatments, surgical procedures performed, audiometric data, and other admissions for infection-related illnesses. RESULTS: The overall incidence of MRSA in this series was about 16% (170 of 1079 patients). Of the 170 eligible children in each age-matched group, 135 with MRSA otorrhea and 141 with non-MRSA otorrhea had data in every category selected for statistical analysis. The groups did not differ significantly in type of insurance; history of tympanostomy tube placement, cholesteatoma, or prematurity; number or type (minor/major) of surgical procedures performed; or risk of subsequent infection-related diagnoses. More patients in the MRSA group received intravenous antibiotic therapy (11% vs 3.6%; P < .001). CONCLUSION: In this study, a diagnosis of otorrhea due to MRSA did not carry an increased risk for surgical procedures or infection-associated sequelae compared with a diagnosis of non-MRSA otorrhea.
TI  - [Determination of causative agents in ocular infection of external adnexa and anterior segments--multicenter study of causative agents and drug sensitivity of ocular infection by the Japanese Association for Ocular Infection part I].
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the causative agents of ocular infection of external adnexa and anterior segments due to selected criteria. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Between September 22, 2007 and August 25, 2008, 890 bacterial strains were collected from 476 patients in 18 facilities nationwide participating in the Drug Sensitivity for Ocular Infection Study Group. Usual aerobic and anaerobic cultures, enrichment cultures, smears, and measurements of bacterial quantity were performed and the determination of causative agents was made from the results of smears and culture, the presence of polymorphonuclear cells and bacterial quantity. The selection was divided into two categories, causative agents and presumed causative agents. Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella bacilli, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were distinctively considered as specified bacteria. RESULTS: Among 890 strains, 18.8% were determined to be causative agents, and 15.1% were determined to be presumed causative agents. Among the bacteria detected in normal flora, 2.0% of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2.6% of Propionibacterium acnes, and 38.3% of Corynebacterium spp. were determined to be causative agents. CONCLUSION: To determine the causative agents, the results of smears and bacterial quantity should be considered together with culture results. Bacteria constituting normal flora have the potential of becoming causative agents.
TI  - [Macrolides in antibiotic therapy of infections of the bronchial tree].
AB  - Macrolide antibiotics have been used to treat acute and chronic inflammation in the respiratory tract based on their antibacterial activity. Now it is well known that macrolides down-regulate damaging prolonged inflammation as well as increase mucous clearance and decrease bacterial virulence. Their ability to inhibit bacterial biofilm is a very important point in control of infections of the bronchial tree, where colonization of Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were documented in clinical and experimental studies.
TI  - Peptidylarginine deiminases present in the airways during tobacco smoking and inflammation can citrullinate the host defense peptide LL-37, resulting in altered activities.
AB  - Bacterial colonization of the lower respiratory tract is frequently seen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and may cause exacerbations leading to disease progression. Antimicrobial peptides comprise an important part of innate lung immunity, and not least the cathelicidin human cationic antimicrobial protein-18/LL-37. Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADIs) post-translationally modify proteins by converting cationic peptidylarginine residues to neutral peptidylcitrulline. An increased presence of PADI2 and citrullinated proteins was demonstrated in the lungs of smokers. In this study, preformed PADI4, stored in granulocytes and extracellularly in the lumina of bronchi, was found in lung tissue of individuals suffering from COPD. In vitro, recombinant human PADI2 and PADI4 both caused a time- and dose-dependent citrullination of LL-37. The citrullination resulted in impaired antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and nontypable Haemophilus influenzae, but less so against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using artificial lipid bilayers, we observed discrete differences when comparing the disrupting activity of native and citrullinated LL-37, suggesting that differences in cell wall composition are important during interactions with whole bacteria. Furthermore, citrullinated LL-37 showed higher chemotactic activity against mononuclear leukocytes than did native LL-37, but was less efficient at neutralizing lipolysaccharide, and also in converting apoptotic neutrophils into a state of secondary necrosis. In addition, citrullinated LL-37 was more prone to degradation by proteases, whereas the V8 endopetidase of S. aureus cleaved the modified peptide at additional sites, compared with native LL-37. Together, these findings demonstrate novel mechanisms whereby the inflammation-dependent deiminases PADI2 and PADI4 can alter the activites of antibacterial polypeptides, affecting the course of inflammatory disorders such as COPD.
TI  - [Treatment effects of co-amoxiclav (Amoxiclav 2x) in acute exacerbation of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: clinical evaluation].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is most often induced by an infection of bacterial origin in over 50% of the cases (or mixed bacterial and viral infection). This study was aimed at evaluating clinical effects of antibiotics co-amoxiclav. Amoxiicillin with clavulanic acid in the treatment of patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The investigation included 38 patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation hospitalized at the Institute for Pulmonary Diseases of Vojvodina, Sremska Kamenica. The patients were randomly selected for the antibiotic treatment with Amoxiclav twice a day in 12 hour intervals. The clinical effects of the applied treatment were evaluated by analyzing certain laboratory findings, microbiological sputum findings and improvement of subjective symptoms. RESULTS: Of the examined subjects, 65% were males and 35% were females, their mean age being 66.4 +/- 8.86, and who were mostly smokers (73%). After the completion Of Applied antibiotic treatment, a significant reduction and normalization of all inflammation markers were recorded, as well as a significant improvement of the patients' subjective symptoms. The positive microbiological sputum findings (Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were recorded in 13.58% of the patients. The bacterial agent was eradicated on the third day of the applied treatment. The mean length of the treatment was 7.07 +/- 0.91 days, with no undesirable treatment side effects observed CONCLUSION The antibiotic therapy is justifiable as the initial treatment regimen of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and amoxicillin with clavulanic acid is reported as the first-line antibiotic drug in most pharmacotherapy guidelines.
TI  - Lower airway microbiology and cellularity in children with newly diagnosed non-CF bronchiectasis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection and inflammation are important in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis. However, there are few published data describing the lower airway microbiology and cellularity in children. METHODS: Children with non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis who underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) within 4 weeks of diagnosis were identified by a retrospective patient-record review. The effects of infection (>/=10(5) colony-forming units of respiratory bacteria/ml; or detectable Pseudomonas aeruginosa; mycobacteria, fungi, mycoplasma, or respiratory viruses) on airway cellularity and the impact of age, gender, indigenous status, immune function, radiographic involvement and antibiotic usage on infection risk were evaluated. RESULTS: Of 113 children [median age 63 months (IQR 32-95)] with newly diagnosed bronchiectasis, 77 (68%) had positive BAL cultures for respiratory bacterial pathogens. Haemophilus influenzae was most commonly detected, being present in 53 (47%) BAL specimens. P. aeruginosa was found in just 7 (6%) children, five of whom had an underlying disorder, while mycobacterial and fungal species were not detected. Respiratory viruses were identified in 14 (12%) children and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in two others. Overall, 56 (49.5%) children fulfilled our definition of a lower airway infection and of these, 35 (63%) had more than one pathogen present. Compared to children without infection, children with infection had higher total cell counts (610 vs. 280 x 10(6) /L), neutrophil counts (351 vs. 70 x 10(6) /L), and neutrophil percentages (69% vs. 34%). Age at diagnosis was most strongly associated with infection. CONCLUSIONS: BAL microbiology of children with newly diagnosed bronchiectasis is dominated by H. influenzae. In the absence of CF, isolation of P. aeruginosa may suggest a serious co-morbidity in this group. Airway neutrophilia is common, especially with higher bacterial loads.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia in children after cardiac surgery in The Netherlands.
AB  - PURPOSE: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in an academic tertiary care center to characterize ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in pediatric patients after cardiac surgery in The Netherlands. METHODS: All patients following cardiac surgery and mechanically ventilated for >/=24 h were included. The primary outcome was development of VAP. Secondary outcomes were duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay. RESULTS: A total of 125 patients were enrolled. Their mean age was 16.5 months. The rate of VAP was 17.1/1,000 mechanical ventilation days. Frequently found organisms were Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Patients with VAP had longer duration of ventilation and longer ICU stay. Risk factors associated with the development of VAP were a PRISM III score of >/=10 and transfusion of fresh frozen plasma. CONCLUSION: The mean VAP rate in this population is higher than that reported in general pediatric ICU populations. Children with VAP had a prolonged need for mechanical ventilation and a longer ICU stay.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from Nunavik collections of the macroalgae Fucus evanescens C. Agardh (Fucaceae).
AB  - This study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga Fucus evanescens in cell culture. Accessions were collected on the Arctic coast of Ungava Bay, Nunavik, Quebec. The crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against Hemophilus influenzae , Legionella pneumophila , Propionibacterium acnes (ATCC and clinical isolate), and Streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/mL. This algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , whereas Bacillus cereus , Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. Further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against Propionibacterium acnes showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/mL. The main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl O-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/mL. Therefore, the semipurified F. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.
TI  - Lipids in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Cystic fibrosis is characterized by severe intestinal and pulmonary symptoms, but also changes in the liver, pancreas and reproductive tract. Since gastrointestinal symptoms can be controlled, the quality of live and longevity of cystic fibrosis patients is mainly determined by pulmonary inflammation and chronic pulmonary infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia cepacia and Haemophilus influenzae. Recent studies developed novel and exciting concepts regarding the pathogenesis and treatment of cystic fibrosis. In particular, several studies indicated a critical role of death receptors, caveolae proteins, membrane rafts, alterations of the ceramide metabolism with an accumulation of ceramide and a reduction of 15-keto-prostaglandin 2 in cystic fibrosis lungs. These alterations have been found to be critically involved in the pulmonary inflammation and infection susceptibility of cystic fibrosis patients. However, albeit these studies provided novel insights into molecular mechanisms causing inflammation and vulnerability to infection, the details of these processes are still unknown.
TI  - The oral health of critically ill children: an observational cohort study.
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study will describe the oral health status of critically ill children over time spent in the paediatric intensive care unit, examine influences on the development of poor oral health and explore the relationship between dysfunctional oral health and healthcare-associated infections. BACKGROUND: The treatment modalities used to support children experiencing critical illness and the progression of critical illness may result in dysfunction in the oral cavity. In adults, oral health has been shown to worsen during critical illness as well as influence systemic health. DESIGN: A prospective observational cohort design was used. METHOD: The study was undertaken at a single tertiary-referral Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. Oral health status was measured using the Oral Assessment Scale and culturing oropharyngeal flora. Information was also collected surrounding the use of supportive therapies, clinical characteristics of the children and the occurrence of healthcare-associated infections. RESULTS: Of the 46 participants, 63% (n = 32) had oral dysfunction and 41% (n = 19) demonstrated pathogenic oropharyngeal colonisation during their critical illness. The potential systemic pathogens isolated from the oropharynx and included Candida sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterococcus sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The severity of critical illness had a significant positive relationship (p < 0.05) with pathogenic and absent colonisation of the oropharynx. Sixty-three percent of healthcare-associated infections involved the preceding or simultaneous colonisation of the oropharynx by the causative pathogen. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests paediatric oral health to be frequently dysfunctional and the oropharynx to repeatedly harbour potential systemic pathogens during childhood critical illness. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Given the frequency of poor oral health during childhood critical illness in this study and the subsequent potential systemic consequences, evidence based oral hygiene practices should be developed and validated to guide clinicians when nursing critically ill children.
TI  - Elderly patients with community-acquired pneumonia: optimal treatment strategies.
AB  - Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common infectious disease that still causes substantial morbidity and mortality. Elderly people are frequently affected, and several issues related to care of this condition in the elderly have to be considered. This article reviews current recommendations of guidelines with a special focus on aspects of the care of elderly patients with CAP. The most common pathogen in CAP is still Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by other pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Legionella species. Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing problem, especially with regard to macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. With regard to beta-lactam antibacterials, resistance by H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis is important, as is the emergence of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The main management decisions should be guided by the severity of disease, which can be assessed by validated clinical risk scores such as CURB-65, a tool for measuring the severity of pneumonia based on assessment of confusion, serum urea, respiratory rate and blood pressure in patients aged >/=65 years. For the treatment of low-risk pneumonia, an aminopenicillin such as amoxicillin with or without a beta-lactamase inhibitor is frequently recommended. Monotherapy with macrolides is also possible, although macrolide resistance is of concern. When predisposing factors for special pathogens are present, a beta-lactam antibacterial combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor, or the combination of a beta-lactam antibacterial, a beta-lactamase inhibitor and a macrolide, may be warranted. If possible, patients who have undergone previous antibacterial therapy should receive drug classes not previously used. For hospitalized patients with non-severe pneumonia, a common recommendation is empirical antibacterial therapy with an aminopenicillin in combination with a beta-lactamase inhibitor, or with fluoroquinolone monotherapy. With proven Legionella pneumonia, a combination of beta-lactams with a fluoroquinolone or a macrolide is beneficial. In severe pneumonia, ureidopenicillins with beta-lactamase inhibitors, broad-spectrum cephalosporins, macrolides and fluoroquinolones are used. A combination of a broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibacterial (e.g. cefotaxime or ceftriaxone), piperacillin/tazobactam and a macrolide is mostly recommended. In patients with a predisposition for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a combination of piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, imipenem or meropenem and levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin is frequently used. Treatment duration of more than 7 days is not generally recommended, except for proven infections with P. aeruginosa, for which 15 days of treatment appears to be appropriate. Further care issues in all hospitalized patients are timely administration of antibacterials, oxygen supply in case of hypoxaemia, and fluid management and dose adjustments according to kidney function. The management of elderly patients with CAP is a challenge. Shifts in antimicrobial resistance and the availability of new antibacterials will change future clinical practice. Studies investigating new methods to detect pathogens, determine the optimal antimicrobial regimen and clarify the duration of treatment may assist in further optimizing the management of elderly patients with CAP.
TI  - [Nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2009].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 2655 strains including 810 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1635 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 210 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2009 was examined. The results were as follows; (1) MEPM was more active than the other carbapenem antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae. MEPM was also active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multidrug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). (2) MEPM maintained potent and stable antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The proportion of MEPM-resistant strains to ciprofloxacin-resistant strains or imipenem-resistant strains were 53.1% and 58.0% respectively. (3) The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 3.1% (26 strains) in enterobacteriaceae. And the proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 2.0% (6 strains) in P. aeruginosa. (4) Of all species tested, there were no species except for Bacteroides fragilis group, which MIC90 of MEPM was more than 4-fold higher than those in our previous study. Therefore, there is almost no significant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem for serious infections treatment at present, 14 years passed after available for commercial use in Japan.
TI  - [Chronic bronchial infection: the problem of Pseudomonas aeruginosa].
AB  - Pathogenic bronchopulmonary colonizations and the exacerbations produced are among the most important causes of reduced pulmonary function in patients with bronchiectasis. The most frequent pathogens in these patients are Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Lesions are produced by the local inflammatory process and the vicious circle developed by antigen stimulation, the release of inflammatory mediators, the presence of neutrophils, the increase of bacterial inoculum and the release of bacterial exoproducts. P. aeruginosa has been demonstrated to affect the patients with bronchiectasis and poorest quality of life and to colonize those with the poorest pulmonary function and the highest number of antimicrobial treatments. In bronchiectasis, as in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or cystic fibrosis, P. aeruginosa is able to colonize the respiratory mucosa chronically. Due to the ecological niche occupied by P. aeruginosa and the multitude of cycles with antimicrobial agents to which these patients are subjected, the development of antimicrobial resistance is highly likely, encouraged by the high proportion of hypermutation variants in existence. Likewise, P. aeruginosa naturally grows in the form of biofilms on the mucosal surface, greatly contributing to its persistence. Antimicrobial treatment in patients with bronchiectasis and P. aeruginosa colonization should be based on antimicrobial agents, alone or in combination, that do not lose activity when acting on biofilms.
TI  - Determination of disk diffusion and MIC quality control guidelines for JNJ-Q2, a  novel quinolone.
AB  - JNJ-Q2 is a novel fluorinated 4-quinolone in development for treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. This quality control (QC) study was performed to establish ranges for control strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 (0.004 to 0.015 mug/ml), Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 (0.015 to 0.06 mug/ml), Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (0.5 to 2 mug/ml and 17 to 23 mm), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (0.008 to 0.03 mug/ml and 30 to 36 mm), Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 (0.002 to 0.015 mug/ml and 31 to 39 mm), Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 (0.004 to 0.015 mug/ml and 28 to 35 mm), and S. aureus ATCC 25923 (32 to 38 mm). These ranges will be crucial in evaluating JNJ-Q2 potency as it progresses through clinical trial development.
TI  - Monitoring antibiotic resistance in ocular microorganisms: results from the Antibiotic Resistance Monitoring in Ocular micRorganisms (ARMOR) 2009 surveillance study.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the antibacterial susceptibility profile of bacterial pathogens from ocular infections against relevant aminoglycoside, beta-lactam, cephalosporin, chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolone, glycopeptide, lincosamide, and macrolide antibacterial agents. DESIGN: Laboratory investigation. METHODS: Isolates from patients with bacterial eye infections were collected prospectively by 34 institutions across the United States and were submitted to a central laboratory for inclusion in the Antibiotic Resistance Monitoring in Ocular micRorganisms (ARMOR) study. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by microbroth dilution for 200 Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), 144 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 75 Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), 73 Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae), and 100 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) isolates. RESULTS: A large proportion of S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates were resistant to oxacillin/methicillin, azithromycin, or fluoroquinolones; 46.5% of S. aureus, 58.3% of coagulase-negative staphylococci, 9.0% of P. aeruginosa, and 9.3% of pneumococcal isolates were nonsusceptible to 2 or more antibacterial drug classes. Only 2.7% of H. influenzae isolates were nonsusceptible to 1 of the agents tested. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci were statistically more likely (all P < .0038) also to be resistant to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and macrolides. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance to 1 or more antibiotics is prevalent among ocular bacterial pathogens. Current resistance trends should be considered before initiating empiric treatment of common eye infections.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus biofilms: Nemesis of endoscopic sinus surgery.
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) patients with biofilms have persistent postoperative symptoms, ongoing mucosal inflammation, and recurrent infections. Recent evidence suggests that biofilms of differing species confer varying disease profiles in CRS patients. We aimed to prospectively investigate the effects of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and fungal biofilms on outcomes following endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective blinded study. METHODS: In this prospective blinded study, 39 patients undergoing ESS for CRS assessed their symptoms preoperatively using internationally accepted standardized symptom scoring systems and quality-of-life measures (10-point visual analog scale, Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-20, global severity of CRS). Their sinonasal mucosa was graded (Lund-Kennedy scale) and extent of radiologic disease on computed tomography scans scored (Lund-McKay scale). Random sinonasal tissue samples were assessed for different bacterial species forming biofilms by using fluorescent in-situ hybridization and confocal laser microscopy. For 12 months after surgery, CRS symptoms, quality of life, and objective evidence of persisting disease were assessed by using the preoperative tools. RESULTS: Different bacterial species combinations were found in 30 of 39 patients; 60% of these 30 biofilms were polymicrobial biofilms and 70% had S aureus biofilms. Preoperative nasendoscopy and radiologic disease severity were significantly worse in patients with multiple biofilms (P = .02 and P = .01, respectively), and they had worse postsurgery mucosal outcomes on endoscopy (P = .01) requiring significantly more postoperative visits (P = .04). Those with S aureus biofilms progressed poorly with their symptom scores and quality-of-life outcomes, with significant differences in nasendoscopy scores (P = .007). CONCLUSIONS: S. aureus biofilms play a dominant role in negatively affecting outcomes of ESS with persisting postoperative symptoms, ongoing mucosal inflammation, and infections.
TI  - Direct evaluation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm mediators in a chronic infection model.
AB  - Biofilms contribute to Pseudomonas aeruginosa persistence in a variety of diseases, including cystic fibrosis, burn wounds, and chronic suppurative otitis media. However, few studies have directly addressed P. aeruginosa biofilms in vivo. We used a chinchilla model of otitis media, which has previously been used to study persistent Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae infections, to show that structures formed in vivo are biofilms of bacterial and host origin within a matrix that includes Psl, a P. aeruginosa biofilm polysaccharide. We evaluated three biofilm and/or virulence mediators of P. aeruginosa known to affect biofilm formation in vitro and pathogenesis in vivo--bis-(3',5')-cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP), flagella, and quorum sensing--in a chinchilla model. We show that c-di-GMP overproduction has a positive impact on bacterial persistence, while quorum sensing increases virulence. We found no difference in persistence attributed to flagella. We conclude from these studies that a chinchilla otitis media model provides a means to evaluate pathogenic mediators of P. aeruginosa and that in vitro phenotypes should be examined in multiple infection systems to fully understand their role in disease.
TI  - [Comparative studies on the composition and antibiotic-resistance of pathogenic bacteria between children with community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This research was to explore the difference between children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in the composition and antibiotic-resistance of pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: 241 CAP and 116 HAP with positive sputum culture who were hospitalized from January to December in 2008 in Children's Hospital Affiliated to Suzhou University were selected in this study. The bacteria were identified by traditionally manual method and antibiotic sensitivity tests were performed by K-B method. The chi-square or Fisher's exact test were used for statistical test. RESULTS: In 241 CAP, Streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenza accounted for (42.2%, 106/251) and (12.4%, 31/251) infection, respectively; however in 116 HAP, Enterobacteriaceae and Non-fermenters accounted for (88.2%, 127/144). In addition, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus weren't isolated, however, its detection rate was 66.7% in HAP. The drug resistance was 1.5 times higher in HAP than that in CAP for several types of antibiotics, such as ceftazidime (37.5% (6/16) vs 75.6% (31/41)), cefepime (37.5% (6/16) vs 78.0% (32/41)), aztreonam (50.0% (8/16) vs 90.2% (37/41)), cefoperazone/sulbactam (12.5% (2/16) vs 51.2% (21/41)) and piperacillin/tazobactam (12.5% (2/16) vs 56.0% (23/41)). Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from HAP had higher drug resistance than that isolated from CAP against some antibiotics, for example, gentamicin (0 vs 63.6% (7/11)), SMZ + TMP (20.0% (1/5) vs 63.6% (7/11)) and cefoperazone/sulbactam (0 vs 54.5% (6/11)). We also found Enterobacter cloacae isolated from HAP showed high drug resistance than that isolated from CAP against imipenem (0 vs 46.7% (7/15)), aztreonam (9.1% (1/11) vs 60.0% (9/15)) and cefoperazone (18.2% (2/11) vs 80.0% (12/15)) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from HAP had higher resistance than that from CAP against gentamicin (0 vs 50.0% (9/18)), amikacin (0 vs 38.9% (7/18)), ceftazidime (0 vs 55.6% (10/18)), cefepime (0 vs 50.0% (9/18)) and cefoperazone (33.3% (2/6) vs 94.4% (17/18)). The detection rates of ESBLs for Escherichia coli were 84.6% (11/13) and 93.3% (14/15) in CAP and HAP, respectively (chi(2) = 0.553, P > 0.05); while for Klebsiella pneumoniae, they were 81.3% (13/16) and 95.1% (39/41), respectively (chi(2) = 2.767, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: CAP was mainly comprised of Streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenza; while HAP was mainly comprised of Enterobacteriaceae and Non-fermenters. The drug resistance of gram-negative bacilli was higher in HAP than that in CAP.
TI  - Intragenomic and intraspecific heterogeneity of the 16S rRNA gene in seven bacterial species from the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients assessed by PCR-Temporal Temperature Gel Electrophoresis.
AB  - 16S rRNA gene-based cultivation-independent methods are increasingly used to study the diversity of microbiota during health and disease. One bias of these methods is the variability of 16S rRNA gene that may exist among strains of a same species (intraspecific heterogeneity) or between rrs copies in a genome (intragenomic heterogeneity). We evaluated the level of intraspecific and intragenomic 16S rDNA variability in seven species frequently encountered in respiratory tract samples in cystic fibrosis (CF). A total of 179 strains were subjected to V3 region 16S rDNA PCR-TTGE. Using this easy-to-perform and rapid method, different levels of V3 region rrs heterogeneity were demonstrated. No intraspecific and intragenomic rrs heterogeneity was demonstrated for Moraxella catarrhalis (n=16), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=31) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=14) showing a single PCR-TTGE band characteristic of the species. Low level of intraspecific heterogeneity was observed for Staphylococcus aureus (n=30), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=29) and Achromobacter xylosoxidans (n=28), and 17%, 38% and 96% of these strains showed intragenomic heterogeneity (two to four different rrs copies), respectively. Haemophilus influenzae (n=31) displayed the higher level of intraspecific variability with 23 different PCR-TTGE patterns and 61% of the strains showed intragenomic rrs heterogeneity (two to four different rrs copies). Although only one hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was explored, intraspecific and intragenomic rrs heterogeneity was frequently observed in this study and should be taken into consideration for a better interpretation of 16S rRNA gene-based diversity profiles in denaturing gels and to avoid any overestimation of the respiratory microbiota diversity in CF.
TI  - Bacteriological differences between COPD exacerbation and community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the differences in pathogen distribution and antibiotic susceptibility between patients with COPD exacerbation and patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and develop guidance for antibiotic treatment of those conditions. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 586 COPD-exacerbation patients and 345 community-acquired-pneumonia patients from January 2007 to December 2008, including sputum culture results, antibiotic susceptibilities of the microorganisms, and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: 276 (47%) of the COPD-exacerbation patients, and 183 (53%) of the community-acquired-pneumonia patients had a positive sputum culture. In order, the most common pathogens in the COPD-exacerbation patients were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Haemophilus influenzae. The most common pathogens in the community-acquired-pneumonia patients were Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: P. aeruginosa was the most common pathogen in our patients with COPD exacerbation, and S. pneumoniae was the most common in our patients with community-acquired pneumonia. P. aeruginosa is especially common in the patients with serious or extremely serious COPD.
TI  - A retrospective study of health care-associated pneumonia patients at Aichi Medical University hospital.
AB  - Health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP) was defined in the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines on hospital-acquired pneumonia in 2005. However, little is known about the occurrence of HCAP in Japan. A retrospective review of background characteristics, pathological conditions, causative organisms, initial treatments, and risk factors for HCAP was conducted to determine the relationship of HCAP to community-acquired pneumonia and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Thirty-five patients who were admitted to our hospital for pneumonia acquired outside our hospital were included and were stratified by disease severity according to the Japanese Respiratory Society risk stratification guidelines (A-DROP [age, dehydration, respiratory failure, orientation disturbance, and shock blood pressure] criteria). All patients had an underlying disease. A total of 70 microbial strains (25 gram-positive, 37 gram-negative, 6 anaerobic, and 2 causative of atypical pneumonia) were isolated from sputum cultures, showing high isolation frequencies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus and extremely low isolation frequencies of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. "History of hospitalization within 90 days before the onset of pneumonia" was the most common risk factor, and most of the patients had two or three risk factors. Initially, monotherapy [mainly tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC), sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC), ceftriaxone (CTRX), cefepime (CPFM), carbapenems, or fluoroquinolones] or combination therapy (beta-lactam and fluoroquinolone) were administered and gave clinical effects in 63% (22/35) of cases. Bacteriological effects were seen in most strains (57%; 40/70). Since the causative organisms of HCAP were closely related to those of hospital-acquired pneumonia and not to community-acquired pneumonia, we believe that aggressive chemotherapy using broad-spectrum antimicrobials is needed in the initial treatment.
TI  - Evaluation of the effect of bacterial efflux pumps on the antibacterial activity  of the novel fluoroquinolone besifloxacin.
AB  - This study examined the susceptibility of a variety of wild-type strains and efflux pump mutants to besifloxacin and the comparator agents sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, moxifloxacin, tetracycline, and ethidium bromide. Organisms tested included Staphylococcus aureus (mepA or norA), Streptococcus pneumoniae (pmrA, patB), Escherichia coli (acrAB::Tn903, tolC::Tn10), Haemophilus influenzae (acrAB) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mepAB-oprM, oprM::OmegaHg(r) rpsL). The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of besifloxacin and comparators were also measured in the presence of the efflux pump inhibitors reserpine, carbonyl cyanide mchlorophenyl- hydrazone, or sodium orthovanadate. Overall, very few meaningful changes (>2-fold) in besifloxacin MIC values resulted from the presence of efflux pump mutations or efflux pump inhibitors. In summary, the novel fluoroquinolone besifloxacin is no exception to the observation that newer fluoroquinolones are generally less affected by efflux pump-mediated resistance than older fluoroquinolones.
TI  - [Distributions and spreads of antimicrobial drug-resistant microorganisms in Saga prefecture].
AB  - We investigated the distribution of drug-resistant organisms to clarify transmission of the organisms. Drug-resistant organisms were surveyed in 12 facilities in 4 districts of Saga prefecture for 2 years, and were analyzed by beta-lactamase typing, antimicrobial susceptibility tests and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The number of isolates was 111,505 for the 2 years. Questionnaires for drug-resistant organisms revealed that Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 64.1% of S. aureus, penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP) or penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) 60.1% of S. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistent Haemophilus inflluenzae (BLNAR) 19.4% of H. influenzae, Metallo-beta-Lactamase (MBL) 0.1% of gram-negative bacilli, multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) 0.6% of P. aeruginosa and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing organisms 8.0% and 3.1% of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively. PFGE analysis of ESBL E. coli revealed that 33 isolates collected from 7 facilities in 3 districts belonged to the same one group, indicating that this strain is transferred between different hospitals in different saga districts. Investigations of distribution of drug-resistant organisms in not only each hospitals but also in the first and the second medical areas are important for controls of healthcare-associated infections and antibiotic prescriptions.
TI  - Clinical study concerning the relationship between community-acquired pneumonia and viral infection in northern Thailand.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The etiological agents associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Thailand have been studied extensively in bacterial pathogens, but not in viral pathogens. To clarify the association of viral pathogens with CAP, we conducted a comprehensive study of viral and bacterial pathogens in patients with CAP. METHODS: We enrolled 119 hospitalized patients with CAP in Nakornping Hospital, Chiang Mai, Thailand between 2006 and 2008. The severity of pneumonia was classified and the risk factors for death were estimated. Bacterial and fungal pathogens were determined from specimens taken from blood and sputum, and viral pathogens were identified from nasopharyngeal specimens by RT-PCR using primers specific for 7 respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Overall, 29 patients were HIV-infected and 90 patients were non-HIV-infected. The microbial pathogens most commonly isolated among HIV-infected patients were: 4 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4 Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 3 Haemophilus influenzae. Among non-HIV infected patients, predominant microbial pathogens were: 6 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 Haemophilus influenzae and 4 Klebsiella pneumoniae. As for viral pathogens for CAP, influenza virus was identified from 2 HIV-infected patients and 5 non-HIV infected patients. In addition, human rhinovirus (HRV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were identified from 2 patients each among non-HIV-infected patients. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that the most common viral agent was influenza virus (5%), followed by HRV (2%) and RSV (2%) among CAP patients in northern Thailand. The underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) seems to be correlated with the severity of illness.
TI  - Identification of unknown ocular pathogens in clinically suspected eye infections using ribosomal RNA gene sequence analysis.
AB  - DNA sequence-based identification of pathogens from ocular samples of patients with clinically suspected eye infections was accomplished using 16S and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) ribosomal RNA gene sequence analysis. PCR was positive for 24 of 99 samples tested. Both culture and 16S rDNA sequence analysis identified Pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococci and Enterobacteriaceae. Isolates misidentified as Burkholderia cepacia by biochemical tests were identified as Ralstonia mannitolilytica by 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Sequence analysis identified the following microorganisms from 19 culture-negative samples: Haemophilus influenzae, Sphingomonas sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Morganella morganii, Mycobacterium sp., Chryseobacterium sp., Pseudomonas saccharophila (Xanthomonas) and the fungus, Phaeoacremonium inflatipes.
TI  - Pathogen yield and antimicrobial resistance patterns of chronic rhinosinusitis patients presenting to a tertiary rhinology centre.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the yield and resistance profile of pathogens in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) patients receiving culture-directed management and to pay particular attention to the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in this population. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of a CRS microbiology database. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive CRS patients seen at the St. Paul's Sinus Centre between June 2007 and August 2008. SETTING: Canadian tertiary sinus centre. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: To determine the pathogens isolated, the frequency of these pathogens, and their resistance profiles. RESULTS: The most common bacterial pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, accounting for 39% of cultured samples, followed by Haemophilus influenzae (29%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (12%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (11%). Only three cases of MRSA were found, one in a patient with cystic fibrosis. CONCLUSION: MRSA does not appear to pose a significant risk of morbidity in our patient population. However, ongoing concern regarding the increasing prevalence of S. aureus and antimicrobial resistance in chronic sinonasal disease highlights the importance of using culture-directed antimicrobial therapy with the goal of minimizing future resistance patterns.
TI  - Sitafloxacin: in bacterial infections.
AB  - Sitafloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial with in vitro activity against a  broad range of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including anaerobic bacteria, as well as against atypical pathogens. It is approved in Japan for use in a number of bacterial infections caused by sitafloxacin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, other Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus spp., Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas spp., Fusobacterium spp., Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. In terms of clinical efficacy, oral sitafloxacin was noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia or an infectious exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract disease, noninferior to oral tosufloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, and noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, according to the results of randomized, double-blind, multicentre, noninferiority trials. Noncomparative studies demonstrated the efficacy of oral sitafloxacin in otorhinolaryngological infections, urethritis in men, C. trachomatis-associated cervicitis in women and odontogenic infections. Gastrointestinal disorders and laboratory abnormalities were the most commonly occurring adverse reactions in patients receiving oral sitafloxacin. Adverse reactions reported in sitafloxacin recipients in the active comparator trials were of mild to moderate severity.
TI  - Ultra-fast and sensitive detection of non-typhoidal Salmonella using microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence ("MAMEF").
AB  - Certain serovars of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica cause invasive disease (e.g., enteric fever, bacteremia, septicemia, meningitis, etc.) in humans and constitute a global public health problem. A rapid, sensitive diagnostic test is needed to allow prompt initiation of therapy in individual patients and for measuring disease burden at the population level. An innovative and promising new rapid diagnostic technique is microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence (MAMEF). We have adapted this assay platform to detect the chromosomal oriC locus common to all Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovars. We have shown efficient lysis of biologically relevant concentrations of Salmonella spp. suspended in bacteriological media using microwave-induced lysis. Following lysis and DNA release, as little as 1 CFU of Salmonella in 1 ml of medium can be detected in <30 seconds. Furthermore the assay is sensitive and specific: it can detect oriC from Salmonella serovars Typhi, Paratyphi A, Paratyphi B, Paratyphi C, Typhimurium, Enteritidis and Choleraesuis but does not detect Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or Acinetobacter baumanii. We have also performed preliminary experiments using a synthetic Salmonella oriC oligonucleotide suspended in whole human blood and observed rapid detection when the sample was diluted 1:1 with PBS. These pre-clinical data encourage progress to the next step to detect Salmonella in blood (and other ordinarily sterile, clinically relevant body fluids).
TI  - Pseudomonas biofilm formation after Haemophilus infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Tympanostomy tube (TT) biofilm formation may lead to refractory otorrhea and occlusion. Biofilms are commonly composed of multiple microbial species. One species may promote or inhibit biofilm formation by other species.The aim of this study was to determine if Haemophilus influenzae(HI) promotes the development of Pseudomonas aeruginosa(PA) biofilm on TTs. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled, in vitro. SETTING: Academic research laboratory. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fluoroplastic TTs (20 per group) were exposed to plasma, allowed to dry, and cultured with HI for 7 days. TTs were either gas sterilized or treated for 24 hours with 10 or 3000 mug/mL ciprofloxacin. Half of the TTs from each treatment group underwent bacterial counts or scanning electron microscopy. The remainder, as well as TTs not exposed to HI, were cultured with PA for 4 days and treated with gentamicin to kill planktonic PA. Biofilm formation was quantified with bacterial counts. RESULTS: TTs treated with ciprofloxacin 3000 mug/mL had lower HI counts than TTs treated with 10 mug/mL (P = .0001), but viable HI persisted. PA biofilm formation on TTs with prior HI biofilm and treated with ciprofloxacin 10 mug/mL or gas sterilization was not different than TTs without HI. Less PA biofilm formed on TTs with HI treated with 3 mg/mL ciprofloxacin(P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: HI biofilm does not promote PA biofilm formation on TTs. Use of high-dose ototopical therapy to clear HI may reduce subsequent PA biofilm formation.
TI  - Targeting Nrf2 signaling improves bacterial clearance by alveolar macrophages in  patients with COPD and in a mouse model.
AB  - Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have innate immune dysfunction in the lung largely due to defective macrophage phagocytosis. This deficiency results in periodic bacterial infections that cause acute exacerbations of COPD, a major source of morbidity and mortality. Recent studies indicate that a decrease in Nrf2 (nuclear erythroid-related factor 2) signaling in patients with COPD may hamper their ability to defend against oxidative stress, although the role of Nrf2 in COPD exacerbations has not been determined. Here, we test whether activation of Nrf2 by the phytochemical sulforaphane restores phagocytosis of clinical isolates of nontypeable Haemophilus influenza (NTHI) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) by alveolar macrophages from patients with COPD. Sulforaphane treatment restored bacteria recognition and phagocytosis in alveolar macrophages from COPD patients. Furthermore, sulforaphane treatment enhanced pulmonary bacterial clearance by alveolar macrophages and reduced inflammation in wild-type mice but not in Nrf2-deficient mice exposed to cigarette smoke for 6 months. Gene expression and promoter analysis revealed that Nrf2 increased phagocytic ability of macrophages by direct transcriptional up-regulation of the scavenger receptor MARCO. Disruption of Nrf2 or MARCO abrogated sulforaphane-mediated bacterial phagocytosis by COPD alveolar macrophages. Our findings demonstrate the importance of Nrf2 and its downstream target MARCO in improving antibacterial defenses and provide a rationale for targeting this pathway, via pharmacological agents such as sulforaphane, to prevent exacerbations of COPD caused by bacterial infection.
TI  - Bacteriology and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of peritonsillar abscess.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Peritonsillar abscess is a common complication of acute tonsillitis. Its management consists of aspiration or surgical drainage followed by appropriate antibiotics. Appropriate antibiotic treatment depends on the common organisms associated with infection and their antibiotic sensitivity pattern in local scenario. METHODS: Pus samples aspirated from diagnosed cases of peritonsillar abscess and submitted for culture and sensitivity in last two years were included in this study. Identification of different microorganisms was made on the basis of the microscopic findings, observation of their colony morphology and standard biochemical reactions. Susceptibility pattern to commonly used antibiotics were determined by Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. RESULTS: Altogether 24 pus samples were included in the study. Positive culture was obtained from 18 samples. Among them one organism was isolated from 13 samples whereas from five samples multiple organisms were isolated. From six samples no organisms could be cultured. Altogether Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated from 12 samples and Staphylococcus aureus from five samples. Other isolated organisms included Haemophlilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus species. Penicillin was effective for Streptococcus pyogenes whereas Staphylococcus aureus was resistant to it. Cloxacillin was found to be effective for Staphylococcus aureus. Ciprofloxacin and Ceftazidime were found to be effective for both organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus were more commonly associated with peritonsillar abscess. Streptococcus pyogenes were sensitive to penicillin but all Staphylococcus aureus were resistant to it. This fact should be considered in clinical practice for management of peritonsillar abscess.
TI  - Airway microbiology and host defences in paediatric non-CF bronchiectasis.
AB  - Bronchiectasis in children without cystic fibrosis is most common in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. Recurrent pneumonia in early childhood and defective pulmonary defences are important risk factors. These help establish a 'vicious cycle' of impaired mucociliary clearance, infection, airway inflammation and progressive lung injury. Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the main infecting pathogens. H. influenzae predominates across all ages, while P. aeruginosa is found in older children with advanced disease. It is uncertain whether viruses and upper airway commensal bacteria play an important aetiological role. Overall, the microbiological data are limited however and there are difficulties obtaining reliable respiratory specimens from young children. Bronchiectasis is a complex disorder resulting from susceptibility to pulmonary infection and poorly regulated respiratory innate and adaptive immunity. Airway inflammatory responses are excessive and persist, even once infection is cleared. Improved specimen collection, molecular techniques and biomarkers are needed to enhance management.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria in 2006].
AB  - We determined MICs of antibacterial agents against 1280 clinical strains of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (19 genus or species) isolated at 16 Japanese facilities in 2006. MICs were determined using mostly broth microdilution method and antibacterial activity was assessed. Strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) accounted for 3.7% of Escherichia coli, 2.7% of Klebsiella spp., and 11.4% of Proteus spp. Notably, 18.8% of Proteus mirabilis was found to produce ESBL higher than 16.7% in 2004. This result was higher extremely than other species. Among Haemophilus influenzae, only 1.2% produced beta-lactamase and 62.8% that increased compared with 57.7% in 2004, were beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains when classified by penicillin-binding protein 3 mutation. Although few antibacterial agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa have potent activity, only three agents--doripenem, ciprofloxacin, and tobramycin-showed an MIC90 of 4 microg/mL. Of all P aeruginosa strains, 5.7% were resistant to six or more agents of nine antipseudomonal agents, a decrease compared to 8.7% in 2004. Against other glucose-non-fermentative Gram-negative bacteria, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2004.
TI  - [In vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates in 2009].
AB  - In vitro activity of sitafloxacin (STFX) and various oral antimicrobial agents against bacterial isolates recovered from clinical specimens between January and December 2009, at different healthcare facilities in Japan was evaluated. A total of 1,620 isolates including aerobic and anaerobic organisms was available for the susceptibility testing using the microbroth dilution methods recommended by Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute. The minimum inhibitory concentration of STFX at which 90% of isolates (MIC90) was 0.06 microg/mL for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and was equal to that of garenoxacin (GRNX), 2 times lower than that of moxifloxacin (MFLX), and 8 times lower than that of levofloxacin (LVFX). STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 microg/mL or less. The MIC90s of STFX ranged from 0.03 to 0.06 microg/mL and were 1 to 2 times lower than those of GRNX, 2 to 4 times lower than those of MFLX, and 16 to 32 times lower than those of LVFX. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, the MIC90 of STFX was 0.06 microg/mL and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 4 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.25 microg/mL for Enterococcus faecalis, and was 2 times lower than those of GRNX and MFLX, and 8 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for E. coli was 2 microg/mL, and the MIC90s of other 10 species of Enterobacteriaceae which were the lowest values of the quinolones tested ranged from 0.03 to 1 microg/mL. The MIC90 of STFX for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates recovered from urinary infections was 8 microg/mL and was 16 times lower than those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for P aeruginosa isolates recovered from respiratory infections was 2 microg/mL and was 32 times lower than those of GRNX and MFLX, and 16 times lower than that of LVFX. STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Haemophilus influenzae at 0.004 microg/mL or less, and was 2 to 4 times lower than those of GRNX, 8 times lower than those of MFLX, and 4 times lower than those of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.008 microg/mL for Moraxella catarrhalis, and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 8 times lower than those of MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90s of STFX ranged from 0.015 to 0.12 microg/mL for all the species of anaerobic bacteria and were the lowest values of all the antimicrobial agents tested. In conclusion, the activity of STFX against Gram-positive cocci was comparable or superior to those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. STFX showed the most potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria of all the antimicrobial agents tested in this study.
TI  - The Vi conjugate typhoid vaccine is safe, elicits protective levels of IgG anti-Vi, and is compatible with routine infant vaccines.
AB  - Typhoid fever remains a serious problem in developing countries. Current vaccines are licensed for individuals who are 5 years old or older. A conjugate of the capsular polysaccharide (CP) of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (Vi) bound to recombinant exoprotein A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Vi-rEPA) enhanced Vi immunogenicity and protected 2- to 5-year-olds in Vietnam. In this study, Vi-rEPA was evaluated for use in infants. A total of 301 full-term Vietnamese infants received Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) vaccines alone or with Vi-rEPA or Haemophilus influenzae type b-tetanus toxoid conjugate (Hib-TT) at 2, 4, and 6 months and Vi-rEPA or Hib-TT alone at 12 months. Infants were visited 6, 24, and 48 h after each injection to monitor adverse reactions. Maternal, cord, and infant sera were assayed for IgG anti-Vi and for IgG antibodies to Hib CP and the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis toxins at 7, 12, and 13 months. No vaccine-related serious adverse reactions occurred. In the Vi-rEPA group, the IgG anti-Vi geometric mean (GM) increased from the cord level of 0.66 to 17.4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay units (EU) at 7 months, declined to 4.76 EU at 12 months, and increased to 50.1 EU 1 month after the 4th dose (95% of infants had levels of >/= 3.5 EU, the estimated protective level). Controls had no increase of the IgG anti-Vi GM. Infants with cord anti-Vi levels of <3.5 EU responded with significantly higher IgG anti-Vi levels than those with levels of >/= 3.5 EU. Anti-diphtheria, -tetanus, and -pertussis toxin levels were similar in all groups. Vi-rEPA was safe, induced protective anti-Vi levels, and was compatible with EPI vaccines, and it can be used in infants. High cord IgG anti-Vi levels partially suppressed infant responses to Vi-rEPA.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy in 2008: general view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  - For the purpose of nationwide surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial respiratory pathogens collected from patients in Japan, the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy conducted a third year of nationwide surveillance during the period from January to April 2008. A total of 1,097 strains were collected from clinical specimens obtained from well-diagnosed adult patients with respiratory tract infections. Susceptibility testing was evaluable with 987 strains (189 Staphylococcus aureus, 211 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 6 Streptococcus pyogenes, 187 Haemophilus influenzae, 106 Moraxella catarrhalis, 126 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 162 Pseudomonas aeruginosa). A total of 44 antibacterial agents, including 26 beta-lactams (four penicillins, three penicillins in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, four oral cephems, eight parenteral cephems, one monobactam, five carbapenems, and one penem), three aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including a ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, six fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone were used for the study. Analysis was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI). The incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was as high as 59.8%, and those of penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP and PRSP) were 35.5 and 11.8%, respectively. Among H. influenzae, 13.9% of them were found to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediately resistant (BLNAI), 26.7% to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ABPC-resistant (BLNAR), and 5.3% to be beta-lactamase-producing ABPC-resistant (BLPAR) strains. A high frequency (76.5%) of beta-lactamase-producing strains was suspected in Moraxella catarrhalis isolates. Four (3.2%) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae were found among 126 strains. Four isolates (2.5%) of P. aeruginosa were found to be metallo beta-lactamase-producing strains, including three (1.9%) suspected multidrug-resistant strains showing resistance to imipenem, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. Continual national surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory pathogens is crucial in order to monitor changing patterns of susceptibility and to be able to update treatment recommendations on a regular basis.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals in 2009.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline and comparative agents were determined for a collection of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from hospital-associated patients across Canada in 2009 as part of the ongoing CANWARD surveillance study. In total, 4,546 isolates from 15 sentinel Canadian hospital laboratories were tested using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method. Compared with other cephalosporins, including ceftobiprole, cefepime, and ceftriaxone, ceftaroline exhibited the greatest potency against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with a MIC(9)(0) of 0.25 mug/ml. Ceftaroline also demonstrated greater potency than ceftobiprole against community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (MIC(9)(0), 0.5 mug/ml) and health care-associated MRSA (MIC(9)(0), 1 mug/ml) and was at least 4-fold more active than other cephalosporins against Staphylococcus epidermidis; all isolates of MSSA and MRSA tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=1 mug/ml). Against streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline MICs (MIC(9)(0), </=0.03 mug/ml) were comparable to those of ceftobiprole; however, against penicillin-nonsusceptible, macrolide-nonsusceptible, and multidrug-nonsusceptible isolates of S. pneumoniae, ceftaroline demonstrated 2- to 4-fold and 4- to 16-fold more potent activities than those of ceftobiprole and ceftriaxone, respectively. All isolates of S. pneumoniae tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=0.25 mug/ml). Among Gram-negative isolates, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity (MIC(9)(0), </=0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli (92.2% of isolates were susceptible), Klebsiella pneumoniae (94.1% of isolates were susceptible), Proteus mirabilis (97.7% of isolates were susceptible), and Haemophilus influenzae (100% of isolates were susceptible). Ceftaroline demonstrated less potent activity (MIC(9)(0), >/=4 mug/ml) against Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Overall, ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a recent collection of the most frequently encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates from patients attending hospitals across Canada in 2009.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological evaluation of hemodialysis-associated pneumonia (HDAP): should HDAP be included in healthcare-associated pneumonia?
AB  - Although hemodialysis-associated pneumonia (HDAP) was included among the healthcare-associated pneumonias (HCAP) in the 2005 American Thoracic Society (ATS)/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline, little information relevant to clinical epidemiology, especially microbiological characteristics, is available. This study aimed to reveal microbiological characteristics and clinical outcomes of HDAP and to assess whether HDAP should be included in the HCAP category. We retrospectively analyzed 69 HDAP patients [42 with moderate and 27 with severe disease based on A-DROP (age, dehydration, respiratory failure, orientation disturbance, and low blood pressure)] in whom sputum cultures were performed at our hospital between 2007 and 2009. The most common pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (37.7%), which were composed of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (27.5%) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) (10.1%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.7%), Haemophilus influenzae (7.2%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (5.8%). This distribution mostly resembled the microbiological characteristics of HCAP reported previously, except that the frequency of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) gram negatives such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%) was clearly lower and that of MRSA was higher. There were no significant differences in microbiological findings, including the incidence of MDR pathogens, between the two severity groups. Despite most cases (82.6%) receiving only monotherapy, the prognosis (30-day survival and in-hospital mortality rates were 88.4% and, 17.4%, respectively) was similar to the past HCAP reports, but there were no significant correlations between prognosis and presence of MDR pathogens (30-day mortality rates 18.2% in MDR positive vs. 8.5% in MDR negative; p = 0.242). Assessment for not only MDR pathogens, but also severity of illness by the A-DROP system made it possible to conduct stratification based on prognosis. Our results suggest that HDAP should be included in the HCAP category, while understanding that there are some differences.
TI  - Microbiology of sinusitis.
AB  - Most sinus infections are viral, and only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection. Rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, and parainfluenza viruses are the most common causes of sinusitis. The most common bacteria isolated from pediatric and adult patients with community-acquired acute purulent sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria (Prevotella and Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium and Peptostreptococcus spp.) are the main isolates in chronic sinusitis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other aerobic and facultative gram-negative rods are commonly isolated from patients with nosocomial sinusitis, the immunocompromised host, those with HIV infection, and in cystic fibrosis. Fungi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common isolates in neutropenic patients. The microbiology of sinusitis is influenced by the previous antimicrobial therapy, vaccinations, and the presence of normal flora capable of interfering with the growth of pathogens.
TI  - A multicentre surveillance study on the characteristics, bacterial aetiologies and in vitro antibiotic susceptibilities in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Antimicrobial resistance is a global problem and the prevalence is high in many Asian countries. METHODS: A prospective observational study of the prevalence of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibilities in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) was conducted in Indonesia, Philippines, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan and Hong Kong from August 2006 to April 2008. The diagnosis of AECB was based on increased cough and worsening of two of following: dyspnoea, increased sputum volume or purulence. Patients who had taken antibiotics within 72 h of presentation were excluded. All bacterial strains were submitted to a central laboratory for re-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to 16 antimicrobial agents according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. RESULTS: Four hundred and seven isolates were identified among 447 patients of AECB. The most frequent organisms isolated were Klebsiella pneumoniae and associated species (n = 91 + 17), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 71), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 63), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 32), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 22) and Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 21). According to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute susceptibility breakpoints, 85.7% and >90% of these pathogens were susceptible to levofloxacin and cefepime respectively. Other options with overall lower susceptibilities include imipenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and amoxicillin/clavulanate. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacteria including Klebsiella spp., P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. constitute a large proportion of pathogens identified in patients with AECB in some Asian countries. Surveillance on the local prevalence and antibiotic resistance of these organisms is important in guiding appropriate choice of antimicrobials in the management of AECB.
TI  - [Evaluation of target attainment rate of pazufloxacin mesilate using Monte Carlo  simulation method].
AB  - We calculated achievement rates of target attainment of AUC/MIC using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). Two doses of pazufloxacin mesilate (PZFX) between q.d. and b.i.d. were compared for each species of bacterium. Concentrations for AUC of PZFX of 8 patients were measured at this hospital, and those from a phase I clinical study (phase I, 6 healthy volunteers) were used. MICs of PZFX were determined for each species of bacterium of respiratory organ origin (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae). AUC per day of 500 mg b.i.d. used twice AUC (PZFX 500 mg x 2/day by patient, PZFX 500 mg x 2/day by phase I). Target attainment of AUC/MIC was AUC/MIC > or = 30 in S. pneumoniae and AUC/MIC > or = 125 in the other species of bacteria (P. aeruginosa, H. influenzae, and K. pneumoniae). As a result, patients showed an about 3 times higher AUC than the phase I subjects (67.9/21.9 microg/mL). In addition, the target attainment of AUC/MIC showed the highest rate in PZFX 500 mg x 2/day in patients with each type of bacteria: H. influenzae (98%), K. pneumoniae (89%), S. pneumoniae (66%), and P aeruginosa (41%). Target attainment of AUC/MIC was H. influenzae (91%), K. pneumoniae (81%), P. aeruginosa (5%), and S. pneumoniae (0%) in phase I. Therefore, the effectiveness of PZFX was estimated to be low using the MCS method with the phase I data.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of ceftobiprole against clinical isolates from French teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  - The aims of this study were to determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, against a large number of bacterial pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorisation according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints. MICs of ceftobiprole were determined by broth microdilution against 1548 clinical isolates collected in eight French hospitals. Disk diffusion testing was performed using 30 mug disks according to the method of the Comite de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie (CA-SFM). The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole, expressed by MIC(50/90) (MICs for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) (mg/L), was as follows: meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25/0.5; meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 1/2; meticillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 0.12/0.5; meticillin-resistant CoNS, 1/2; penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, </= 0.008/0.03; penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, 0.12/0.5; viridans group streptococci, 0.03/0.12; beta-haemolytic streptococci, </= 0.008/0.016; Enterococcus faecalis, 0.25/1; Enterococcus faecium, 64/128; Enterobacteriaceae, 0.06/32; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4/16; Acinetobacter baumannii, 0.5/64; Haemophilus influenzae, 0.03/0.12; and Moraxella catarrhalis, 0.25/0.5. According to the regression curve, zone diameter breakpoints could be 28, 26, 24 and 22 mm for MICs of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mg/L respectively. In conclusion, this study confirms the potent in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against many Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA but not E. faecium, whilst maintaining a Gram-negative spectrum similar to the advanced-generation cephalosporins such as cefepime. Thus ceftobiprole appears to be well suited for the empirical treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.
TI  - An in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (CloSYS Oral Rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. METHODS: Oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. The numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity. RESULTS: As expected, Listerine and Crest Pro-Health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. Breath Rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. CloSYS and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, CloSYS oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that CloSYS Oral Rinse has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.
TI  - Evaluation of three swab transport systems for the maintenance of clinically important bacteria in simulated mono- and polymicrobial samples.
AB  - In this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: M40 Transystem, Amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both Copan Diagnostics, Corona, CA, USA), and SSI transportmedium (Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen Denmark). The CLSI M40-A standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. The transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. After 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all organisms tested. SSI transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two Copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. In polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. At 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. The species most difficult to recover in all the three systems was Neisseria gonorrhoeae. When selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.
TI  - [Bacterial flora in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  (COPD) in Kunming, China].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chinese recommendations for the management of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) include antibiotic treatments targeting the most frequently isolated pathogens according to the severity of COPD. The study objective was to check the relevance of these recommendations in Yunnan, a Southern Chinese province. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A descriptive and analytical survey was conducted in the Kunming Medical University hospital among patients over 60 years of age, hospitalized with AECOPD, between March 2007 and June 2008. RESULTS: The 74 included patients were predominantly male (90%), with a mean age of 78.6 years, active or ex-smokers (81%), mainly with moderate (43%) or severe COPD (34%). Out of 87 AECOPD episodes, 47 (54%) yielded significant quantitative sputum cultures for S. pneumoniae (10%), P. aeruginosa (10%), H. influenzae (7%), M. catarrhalis (7%), and K. pneumoniae (7%). The positivity of sputum cultures was significantly linked with a history of smoking (P=0.002). More than half of the P. aeruginosa isolates were multidrug resistant. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of pathogens isolated from EABPCO in Kunming corroborates published results. It does not question Chinese recommendations for first-line antibiotic therapy, but the high prevalence of P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae requires a periodic screening for acquired antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Mechanisms of bacterial resistance to antibiotics in infections of COPD patients.
AB  - A key characteristic of airway inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the persistent presence of bacteria in the lower airways. The most commonly isolated bacteria in the lower respiratory tract of COPD patients are nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae, with growing evidence of the significance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in severe COPD disease. This review focuses on the antibiotic resistant mechanisms associated with the gram-negative bacteria H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis and comparison with P. aeruginosa infection because of the recent evidence of its significance in patients with severe COPD disease. These mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactams in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis are mostly associated with serine beta-lactamases of class A type, whereas P. aeruginosa strains exhibit a much broader repertoire with class A-D type mechanisms. Other mechanisms of antibiotic resistance include membrane permeability, efflux pump systems and mutations in antimicrobial targets. Antimicrobial resistance within biofilm matrices appears to be different to the mechanisms observed when the bacteria are in the planktonic state. P. aeruginosa exhibits a more numerous and diverse range of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in comparison to M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae. The recognition that P. aeruginosa is associated with exacerbations in patients with more severe COPD and that turnover in infecting strains is detected (unlike in cystic fibrosis patients), then further investigation is required to better understand the contribution of antimicrobial resistance and other virulence mechanisms to poor clinical outcomes to improve therapeutic approaches.
TI  - Reliability of quantitative real-time PCR for bacterial detection in cystic fibrosis airway specimens.
AB  - The cystic fibrosis (CF) airway microbiome is complex; polymicrobial infections are common, and the presence of fastidious bacteria including anaerobes make culture-based diagnosis challenging. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) offers a culture-independent method for bacterial quantification that may improve diagnosis of CF airway infections; however, the reliability of qPCR applied to CF airway specimens is unknown. We sought to determine the reliability of nine specific bacterial qPCR assays (total bacteria, three typical CF pathogens, and five anaerobes) applied to CF airway specimens. Airway and salivary specimens from clinically stable pediatric CF subjects were collected. Quantitative PCR assay repeatability was determined using triplicate reactions. Split-sample measurements were performed to measure variability introduced by DNA extraction. Results from qPCR were compared to standard microbial culture for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae, common pathogens in CF. We obtained 84 sputa, 47 oropharyngeal and 27 salivary specimens from 16 pediatric subjects with CF. Quantitative PCR detected bacterial DNA in over 97% of specimens. All qPCR assays were highly reproducible at quantities>/=10(2) rRNA gene copies/reaction with coefficient of variation less than 20% for over 99% of samples. There was also excellent agreement between samples processed in duplicate. Anaerobic bacteria were highly prevalent and were detected in mean quantities similar to that of typical CF pathogens. Compared to a composite gold standard, qPCR and culture had variable sensitivities for detection of P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and H. influenzae from CF airway samples. By reliably quantifying fastidious airway bacteria, qPCR may improve our understanding of polymicrobial CF lung infections, progression of lung disease and ultimately improve antimicrobial treatments.
TI  - [Acute mastoiditis in the pneumococcal vaccine era].
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Acute mastoiditis is the most common complication of acute otitis media. Recent studies have noticed an increase in cases. The goal of this study was to review acute mastoiditis cases diagnosed in children younger than 14 years old. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study of all patients under 14 years old admitted with a diagnosis of mastoiditis between 1996 and 2008 was performed. Epidemiological, laboratory and clinical variables were analysed. RESULTS: Sixty-one charts were reviewed. The mean age was 28 months; 55.7% of the patients were male. Most cases were in the autumn and winter; 79% occurred from 2002 to 2008. Most cases (82%) had antecedents of an upper airway catarrhal process and 60.7% had a clinical diagnosis of acute otitis media. Prior antibacterial agent therapy had been administered in 55.7% of the cases. Culture of middle ear effusions was performed in 48 patients, revealing Streptococcus pneumonia in 39.7%, Haemophilus influenzae in 2%, Staphylococcus aureus in 12.5% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 8.3%. Cultures were sterile in 18 patients (37.5%). Of the pneumococcal isolates, 26.2% were resistant to penicillin or third generation cephalosporins. Most cases (93.4%) responded well to antibacterial therapy alone or with myringotomy. There were complications in 7 patients (11.5%). Mastoid surgery was performed in 4 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Acute mastoiditis shows a rising incidence in recent years. The most commonly isolated form is the pneumococcus, the high rates of antibiotic resistance in our study being notable. Treatments with antibiotics alone or in combination with myringotomy are effective in less severe forms.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of doripenem against clinical isolates from French teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  - The aims of the study were to determine the in vitro activity of doripenem, a new carbapenem, against a large number of bacterial pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorization in France according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints. The MICs of doripenem were determined by the broth microdilution method against 1,547 clinical isolates from eight French hospitals. The disk diffusion test was performed (10-mug discs) according to the Comite de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie (CASFM) method. The MIC(50/90) (mg/L) values were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (0.03/0.25), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (1/2), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (MSCoNS) (0.03/0.12), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS) (2/8), Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.016/0.25), viridans group streptococci (0.016/2), beta-hemolytic streptococci (</=0.008/</=0.008), Enterococcus faecalis (2/4), Enterococcus faecium (128/>128), Enterobacteriaceae (0.06/0.25), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.5/8), Acinetobacter baumannii (0.25/2), Haemophilus influenzae (0.12/0.25), and Moraxella catarrhalis (0.03/0.06). According to the regression curve, the zone diameter breakpoints were 24 and 19 mm for MICs of 1 and 4 mg/L, respectively. This study confirms the potent in vitro activity of doripenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Enterobacteriaceae, MSSA, MSCoNS, and respiratory pathogens. According to the EUCAST MIC breakpoints (mg/L) </=1/>4 for Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter, and </=1/>1 for streptococci, pneumococci, and Haemophilus, the zone diameter breakpoints could be (mm) >/=24/<19 and >/=24/<24, respectively.
TI  - Investigation of oral opportunistic pathogens in independent living elderly Japanese.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pneumonia is reported to be associated with high morbidity in elderly  and compromised individuals, with poor oral health demonstrated to be a significant risk factor for pneumonia. Several opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, have been detected in patients with pneumonia. We investigated the prevalence of opportunistic pathogens in the oral cavity of healthy independent living Japanese elderly subjects and analysed factors related to harbouring those pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 265 subjects, each of whom received a dental examination, during which specimens were collected with a tongue swab and examined for the presence of 10 oral opportunistic pathogens using single or multiple selective media. Furthermore, the presence of occult blood in saliva was examined using test paper strips. RESULTS: Oral opportunistic pathogens were detected in 13.6% of the subjects. Those positive for occult blood in saliva had a significantly higher rate of harbouring the pathogens (p < 0.05). In addition, age was a significant factor for the presence of pathogenic microbes in the oral cavity (p = 0.033). CONCLUSION: Positive findings of occult blood in saliva and older age are suggested to be significant factors for harbouring opportunistic pathogens in the oral cavity.
TI  - Incidence of postoperative eye infections in a private eye hospital in Lagos, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a dearth of information on postoperative eye infections in Nigeria and most hospitals do not have an infection control program in place. OBJECTIVE: This study was done to investigate the incidence of post-operative eye infections, their potential sources and the preparedness of the hospital to prevent such infections. METHODS: A microbiological survey of all eye surgical procedures between March 2004 and May 2005 was performed. Relevant samples were taken and cultured pre, intra and post operatively as required. Definitions of infections were based on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Criteria. In the eye clinic, and operation theatre, infection control procedures and practices were audited using a pre-designed questionnaire. RESULTS: There were 2 cases of post operative eye infections (with Haemophilus influenzae and Corynebacterium species) during the one year of survey of 339 performed surgeries. S. aureus, Coagulase negative staphylococcus (CNS), and Enterobacter spp were cultured from the aqueous humour, as well as pre and post operative conjunctivae swabs of three other patients. Eighty four (24.8%) other patients were colonized post operatively with CNS (32), S. aureus (28), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), E. coli (5), Corynebacterium species (3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1) Proteus mirabilis (4), Enterobacter species alone (1) and in association with CNS on 2 occasions. Seventy eight percent of patients had contact with staff who consistently haboured Staphylococcus species in their nares. Four patients (0.11%) were exposed to surgeons whose hands were contaminated and one eye (0.003%) to contaminated antiseptic solution. Facilities for hand washing and protective clothing were adequate but staffs were observed to perform an inadequate hands scrubbing. Most items were heat sterilized. Cleaning facilities were adequate and the environment was clean. The choice of antiseptic was correct, but that of disinfectant was considered incorrect. The ophthalmic equipments except the eye occluder were appropriately disinfected. Staffs were not protected when handling linen. Infected linens were separated from soiled linens only in the theatre. They were not bagged, and were hand sluiced. The only type of waste that was properly handled was sharps. All waste types were stored together prior to final disposal away from the public. CONCLUSION: The incidence of post-operative infection was 1.69% and their sources were the patients' normal flora. Other potential sources of post-operative eye infections identified included nares of hospital staff, hands of surgeon and hospital disinfectants. Areas of deficiencies in infection control practices, which require proper infection control policies, include hand scrubbing practices, disinfection, linen management and waste handling.
TI  - Nursing home-acquired pneumonia: a review of risk factors and therapeutic approaches.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the risk factors, etiologic profile, treatment approaches, and guidelines for the management of nursing home-acquired pneumonia (NHAP). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A search of the current literature was conducted using the MEDLINE and Embase databases. This search, limited to studies performed in humans and published in English between January 1, 1990 and October 31, 2009, included the terms 'acquired pneumonia', 'associated pneumonia', 'nursing home', 'long-term care', 'institution', and 'healthcare'. RESULTS: Older age, male gender, swallowing difficulty, and inability to take oral medications are all significant risk factors for pneumonia. Medications such as antipsychotics and anticholinergics, histamine receptor blockers and proton pump inhibitors have also been linked to higher risk of pneumonia. The etiology of NHAP overlaps with that of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae as predominant pathogens in long-term care facilities. In patients who require hospitalization, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and influenza virus have also been identified. In contrast, the etiology of severe NHAP overlaps with that of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), with S. aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enteric Gram-negative bacilli as important causative pathogens. Therapy is dependent on disease severity and, on the treatment setting. Respiratory fluoroquinolones or beta-lactams plus a macrolide are recommended in patients with NHAP. Patients hospitalized with severe NHAP may require triple combination therapy that covers both MRSA and P. aeruginosa. However, there is little evidence of the clinical superiority of one regimen over another, making it challenging to establish guidelines for the treatment of NHAP in the nursing home setting. CONCLUSION: There is a pressing need for clinical trials of antibiotic therapy in nursing home patients that would help establish uniform guidelines to standardize therapy in the nursing home setting.
TI  - Prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory pathogens in patients  with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Respiratory infection is very common in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF). However, the antimicrobial resistance rate of isolates from CF patients is not often documented. In this study, 279 respiratory specimens of 146 patients were prospectively collected from July to December 2006. Microbiological cultures and antimicrobial susceptibility tests of the most frequently isolated bacteria were performed. Sputum and oropharyngeal swabs were processed for culture. During the study period, 50% of the patients harbored Staphylococcus aureus, 35% Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.7% Haemophilus influenzae. Methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) were detected in 8 (6%) patients; ESBL and MBL-producing P. aeruginosa were not identified in these patients. The detection of MRSA in CF patients confirms that antimicrobial resistance patterns should be always kept under surveillance. Moreover, hygiene regulations in CF clinics should prevent a further spread of resistant bacterial strains.
TI  - Murine models of acute and chronic lung infection with cystic fibrosis pathogens.
AB  - Animal models of acute and chronic infection, along with mice genetically modified for the Cftr gene, are a key asset in cystic fibrosis (CF) research. Despite some limitations, these models provide valuable resources to mimic the initial and progressive bronchopulmonary infection typical of CF patients. The following review summarizes the strengths and weaknesses of different types of animal models with a major emphasis placed on the significant species differences between mice and humans. Murine models of acute and chronic lung infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae have been used to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogen virulence and host defense. In addition, they have provided insights in the potential of vaccination to restrict infectious exacerbations, the activity of antibiotics, and the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory therapy in reducing lung damage. Indeed, animal models of infection should allow the validation of future therapeutic interventions for lung infections in patients with CF.
TI  - CFTR-dependent susceptibility of the cystic fibrosis-host to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Cystic fibrosis is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in western countries. The disease is characterized by recurrent and chronic infections of the lung in particular with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia cepacia, and Haemophilus influenzae. Albeit intensive research in the last years, the molecular mechanisms causing the high susceptibility of cystic fibrosis patients to bacterial infections are still unknown. Animal models provided important novel information on the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis and mimicked many of the pathological findings in humans, for instance chronic inflammation and increased infection susceptibility. These animal models were recently employed to identify several proteins and lipids that are critically involved in the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis. Thus, several studies identified death receptors, caveolin proteins, membrane rafts, and alterations of the ceramide metabolism with an accumulation of ceramide in cystic fibrosis lungs to be critically involved in the infection susceptibility, the chronic inflammation, and the reduced mucociliary clearance in cystic fibrosis.
TI  - Utility of ampicillin-sulbactam for empiric treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia in a trauma population.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ampicillin-sulbactam is guideline-recommended treatment for early-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). However, intensive care unit clinicians are encountering increasing resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam. We sought to analyze the time period for early-onset VAP in our trauma population by using daily evaluation of resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was completed on all mechanically ventilated trauma patients admitted to a rural level-1 trauma center from January 2003 to December 2008 who were diagnosed with VAP. Daily bacterial resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam > 15% was defined as the threshold for early empiric antibiotic failure for the first episode of VAP. A univariate analysis of risk factors for multi-drug resistant pathogens (MDRPs) and comorbidities was completed to assess for predisposing factors for ampicillin-sulbactam resistance. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-three pathogens were identified in 121 trauma patients diagnosed with VAP. Of these isolates, 71% were gram-negative, 28% were gram-positive, and 1% was fungal. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (23.9%), H aemophilus influenzae (20.9%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.7%) were the most common infecting organisms. Daily ampicillin-sulbactam resistance was 40%, 26%, 32%, 43%, 50%, and 60% on days 3 to 7 and >/= 8 days, respectively. Only the presence of MDRP risk factors (89% vs. 65%, p < 0.01) and hospital LOS (36.8 [22.8-49.0] vs. 25.7 days [19.0-32.5], p < 0.01) was different between ampicillin- sulbactam resistant and ampicillin-sulbactam susceptible VAP groups. On univariate analysis, hospital length of stay >4 days and antibiotic use within 90 days were associated with ampicillin-sulbactam resistant VAP (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Ampicillin-sulbactam is not an effective empiric therapy for early-onset VAP in our rural trauma population. The utility of ampicillin-sulbactam should be reviewed at other institutions to assess for appropriate empiricism.
TI  - Bacterial hypermutation in cystic fibrosis, not only for antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Hypermutable or mutator microorganisms are those that have an increased spontaneous mutation rate as a result of defects in DNA repair or error avoidance systems. Over the last two decades, several studies have provided strong evidence for a relevant role of mutators in the evolution of natural bacterial populations, particularly in the field of infectious diseases. Among them, chronic respiratory infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients was the first natural environment to reveal the high prevalence and important role of mutators. A remarkable positive selection of mutators during the course of the chronic infection has been reported, mainly as a result of the emergence of DNA mismatch repair system (mutS, mutL or mutU)-deficient mutants, although strains defective in the GO system (mutM, mutY and mutT) have also been observed. High frequencies of mutators have also been noted among other pathogens in the CF setting, particularly Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. Enhanced antimicrobial resistance development is the most thoroughly studied consequence of mutators in CF and other chronic infections, although recent studies show that mutators may additionally have important effects on the evolution of virulence, genetic adaptation to the airways of CF patients, persistence of colonization, transmissibility, and perhaps lung function decline. Further prospective clinical studies are nevertheless still needed for an in-depth evaluation of the impact of mutators on disease progression and outcome.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of carbapenems against clinical isolates of respiratory bacterial pathogens in the northeastern region of Japan in 2007.
AB  - As the increasing prevalence of resistant strains of respiratory bacterial pathogens has recently been reported, continuous monitoring of the susceptibility of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents is important. We performed a surveillance study focusing on the susceptibility of major respiratory bacterial pathogens in the northeastern region of Japan to carbapenems and control drugs. A total of 168 bacterial strains isolated from patients with respiratory tract infections in 2007 were collected and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determined. MIC data were subjected to pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis with Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the probability of achieving the target of time above MIC with each carbapenem. All Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus isolates were susceptible to carbapenems. Despite the increasing prevalence of beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-resistant strains, all Haemophilus influenzae isolates were susceptible to meropenem. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the susceptibility rates for meropenem and biapenem were 76.7%, and the highest probability of achieving pharmacodynamic target (40% of the time above MIC) was obtained with meropenem 0.5 g three times daily as a 4-h infusion (89.4%), followed by meropenem 0.5 g four times daily as a 1-h infusion (88.4%). Carbapenems have retained their position as key drugs for severe respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Mutators in cystic fibrosis chronic lung infection: Prevalence, mechanisms, and consequences for antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - Hypermutable (or mutator) microorganisms are those that have an increased spontaneous mutation rate due to defects in DNA repair or error avoidance systems. Over last decade, several studies have provided strong evidence of a relevant role of mutators in the evolution of natural bacterial populations, with a special emphasis in the field of infectious diseases. Among them, chronic respiratory infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients was the first natural environment revealing a high prevalence and important role of mutators. High frequencies of mutators have also been noted for other pathogens in the CF setting, particularly Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. In addition to a strong statistical link between hypermutation and antibiotic resistance (i.e., mutators are more frequently resistant against antibiotics) obtained from the analysis of collections of clinical isolates from CF patients, several in vitro and in vivo experiments have further highlighted the dramatic consequences of hypermutation, especially when acting on microorganisms that are genetically equipped to acquire efficient resistance to most antibiotics by mutations in chromosomal genes such as P. aeruginosa. Recent studies additionally showed that mutators accelerate genetic adaptation of P. aeruginosa to the airways of CF patients and that patients infected by mutator strains have a poorer lung function. Further prospective clinical studies are nevertheless needed for a deep evaluation of the impact of mutators in disease progression and outcome. Future research should particularly focus on the investigation of the optimal therapeutical strategies to prevent the emergence of mutator strains in the lungs of CF patients and to avoid multiple-antimicrobial resistance development if they have already been selected.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in Canadian hospitals: results of the Canadian Ward Surveillance Study (CANWARD 2008).
AB  - A total of 5,282 bacterial isolates obtained between 1 January and 31 December 31 2008, inclusive, from patients in 10 hospitals across Canada as part of the Canadian Ward Surveillance Study (CANWARD 2008) underwent susceptibility testing. The 10 most common organisms, representing 78.8% of all clinical specimens, were as follows: Escherichia coli (21.4%), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; 13.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.0%), coagulase-negative staphylococci/Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.4%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; 5.1%), Haemophilus influenzae (4.1%), Enterococcus spp. (3.3%), Enterobacter cloacae (2.2%). MRSA comprised 27.0% (272/1,007) of all S. aureus isolates (genotypically, 68.8% of MRSA were health care associated [HA-MRSA] and 27.6% were community associated [CA-MRSA]). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli occurred in 4.9% of E. coli isolates. The CTX-M type was the predominant ESBL, with CTX-M-15 the most prevalent genotype. MRSA demonstrated no resistance to ceftobiprole, daptomycin, linezolid, telavancin, tigecycline, or vancomycin (0.4% intermediate intermediate resistance). E. coli demonstrated no resistance to ertapenem, meropenem, or tigecycline. Resistance rates with P. aeruginosa were as follows: colistin (polymyxin E), 0.8%; amikacin, 3.5%; cefepime, 7.2%; gentamicin, 12.3%; fluoroquinolones, 19.0 to 24.1%; meropenem, 5.6%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 8.0%. A multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype occurred frequently in P. aeruginosa (5.9%) but uncommonly in E. coli (1.2%) and K. pneumoniae (0.9%). In conclusion, E. coli, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Enterococcus spp. are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in Canadian hospitals. The prevalence of MRSA was 27.0% (of which genotypically 27.6% were CA-MRSA), while ESBL-producing E. coli occurred in 4.9% of isolates. An MDR phenotype was common in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Specific resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in zebrafish is mediated  by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.
AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by recessive mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene and is associated with prevalent and chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections. Despite numerous studies that have sought to elucidate the role of CFTR in the innate immune response, the links between CFTR, innate immunity, and P. aeruginosa infection remain unclear. The present work highlights the zebrafish as a powerful model organism for human infectious disease, particularly infection by P. aeruginosa. Zebrafish embryos with reduced expression of the cftr gene (Cftr morphants) exhibited reduced respiratory burst response and directed neutrophil migration, supporting a connection between cftr and the innate immune response. Cftr morphants were infected with P. aeruginosa or other bacterial species that are commonly associated with infections in CF patients, including Burkholderia cenocepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Intriguingly, the bacterial burden of P. aeruginosa was found to be significantly higher in zebrafish Cftr morphants than in controls, but this phenomenon was not observed with the other bacterial species. Bacterial burden in Cftr morphants infected with a P. aeruginosa DeltaLasR mutant, a quorum sensing-deficient strain, was comparable to that in control fish, indicating that the regulation of virulence factors through LasR is required for enhancement of infection in the absence of Cftr. The zebrafish system provides a multitude of advantages for studying the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa and for understanding the role that innate immune cells, such as neutrophils, play in the host response to acute bacterial infections commonly associated with cystic fibrosis.
TI  - Different biofilms, different disease? A clinical outcomes study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: A potential role for biofilms in Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) has been proposed, and the adverse impact they have on disease severity and postoperative outcomes has also been well described. Recent advances have allowed the species within the biofilms of CRS patients to be clearly characterized. This study investigates whether different biofilm species have different disease outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review. METHODS: Twenty-four patients with medically recalcitrant CRS undergoing Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (ESS), in whom we had previously characterized their biofilms using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), were reviewed a median of 11 months after their surgery. They were evaluated for preoperative disease markers and evidence of on-going disease in the postoperative period. RESULTS: Thirty-seven biofilms were identified in the 24 patients. Almost half had polymicrobial biofilms. The presence of polymicrobial, rather than single-species biofilms adversely affected preoperative disease severity but did not alter postsurgical outcome. Patients with single organism Haemophilus influenzae biofilms presented with mild disease symptomatically and radiologically and achieved normal mucosa a short time after their surgery. Conversely, patients with Staphlococcus aureus in their biofilm makeup had more severe disease and a more complicated postoperative course. The effect of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and fungal biofilms is less clear. CONCLUSIONS: Different biofilm species are associated with different disease phenotypes. H. influenzae biofilms are typically found in patients with mild disease, whereas S. aureus is associated with a more severe, surgically recalcitrant pattern.
TI  - Assessment of sample handling practices on microbial activity in sputum samples from patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to quantitatively and qualitatively assess the effect of sample storage on the metabolically active microbial community found in sputum samples from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). METHODS: Sputum samples were collected and split in two equal aliquots one of which was immersed in RNAlater and refrigerated immediately, the second stored at room temperature for 24 h and RNAlater was subsequently added. mRNA was extracted, and RT-PCR-DGGE and qPCR analysis of the bacterial and fungal communities was carried out. RESULTS: Significant differences in the bacterial communities between the two protocols were observed but there were no significant difference seen in the fungal community analyses. Analysis by qPCR demonstrated that room temperature storage gave statistically significant increases in eubacteria and Pseudomonas spp. and a statistically significant decrease in those of Haemophilus influenzae. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of metabolically active microbial communities from CF sputum using molecular techniques indicated that samples should be stored at 4 degrees C upon addition of RNAlater to obtain an accurate depiction of the CF lung microbiota. Also, storing respiratory samples at room temperature may cause an over representation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and mask the presence of other clinically significant organisms.
TI  - Microbial etiologies of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia.
AB  - Hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) and ventilator-associated bacterial  pneumonia (VABP) can be caused by a wide variety of bacteria that originate from the patient flora or the health care environment. We review the medical and microbiology literature and the results of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (1997-2008) to establish the pathogens most likely to cause HABP or VABP. In all studies, a consistent 6 organisms (Staphylococcus aureus [28.0%], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [21.8%], Klebsiella species [9.8%], Escherichia coli [6.9%], Acinetobacter species [6.8%], and Enterobacter species [6.3%]) caused approximately 80% of episodes, with lower prevalences of Serratia species, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and community-acquired pathogens, such as pneumococci and Haemophilus influenzae. Slight changes in the pathogen order were noted among geographic regions; Latin America had an increased incidence of nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. In addition, VABP isolates of the same species had a mean of 5%-10% less susceptibility to frequently used extended-spectrum antimicrobials, and the rate of drug resistance among HABP and VABP pathogens has been increasing by 1% per year (2004-2008). In conclusion, the empirical treatment of HABP and VABP due to prevailing bacterial causes and emerging drug resistance has become more challenging and requires use of multidrug empirical treatment regimens for routine clinical practice. These facts have profound impact on the choices of comparison therapies to be applied in contemporary new drug clinical trials for pneumonia.
TI  - Differential adaptation of microbial pathogens to airways of patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common autosomal recessive disorder in Caucasians, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a disease of adults, are characterized by chronic lung inflammation, airflow obstruction and extensive tissue remodelling, which have a major impact on patients' morbidity and mortality. Airway inflammation is stimulated in CF by chronic bacterial infections and in COPD by environmental stimuli, particularly from smoking. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the major bacterial pathogen in CF, while in COPD, Haemophilus influenzae is most frequently observed. Molecular studies indicate that during chronic pulmonary infection, P. aeruginosa clones genotypically and phenotypically adapt to the CF niche, resulting in a highly diverse bacterial community that is difficult to eradicate therapeutically. Pseudomonas aeruginosa clones from COPD patients remain within the airways only for limited time periods, do not adapt and are easily eradicated. However, in a subgroup of severely ill COPD patients, P. aeruginosa clones similar to those in CF persist. In this review, we will discuss the pathophysiology of lung disease in CF and COPD, the complex genotypic and phenotypic adaptation processes of the opportunistic bacterial pathogens and novel treatment options.
TI  - Standardized comparison of antiseptic efficacy of triclosan, PVP-iodine, octenidine dihydrochloride, polyhexanide and chlorhexidine digluconate.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study presents a comparative investigation of the antimicrobial  efficacy of the antiseptics PVP-iodine, triclosan, chlorhexidine, octenidine and polyhexanide used for pre-surgical antisepsis and antiseptic treatment of skin, wounds and mucous membranes based on internationally accepted standards. METHODS: MICs and MBCs were determined in accordance with DIN 58940-7 and 58940-8 using Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Haemophilus influenzae and Candida albicans. The microbicidal efficacy was determined in accordance with DIN EN 1040 and 1275 using S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans. RESULTS: For chlorhexidine, octenidine and polyhexanide, MIC(48) and MBC(24) ranged from 16 to 32 mg/L. Maximum values for triclosan ranged from 256 to 512 mg/L, with an efficacy gap against P. aeruginosa, while the maximum values of PVP-iodine were 1024 mg/L, with a gap against S. pneumoniae. Comparing the minimal effective concentrations, octenidine was most effective. After 1 min, only octenidine and PVP-iodine fulfil the requirements for antiseptics. CONCLUSIONS: Tests under standardized and harmonized conditions help to choose the most efficacious agent. When a prolonged contact time is feasible, ranking of agents would be polyhexanide = octenidine > chlorhexidine > triclosan > PVP-iodine. This is consistent with the recommendations for antisepsis of acute wounds. Polyhexanide seems to be preferable for chronic wounds due to its higher tolerability. If an immediate effect is required, ranking would be octenidine = PVP-iodine>> polyhexanide > chlorhexidine > triclosan.
TI  - Microbiological profile of bacterial conjunctivitis in ibadan, Nigeria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In bacterial conjunctivitis, clinical presentations are not diagnostic of the causative agent, therefore, microbiological analysis is mandatory for specific treatment option. This study was undertaken to determine the microbiology profile of bacterial conjunctivitis in our environment. METHODOLOGY: This is a laboratory-based study carried out in the Medical Microbiology Laboratory of University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. Conjunctival swabs collected from 365 patients with clinically diagnosed conjunctivitis, were analysed by standard bacteriological methods. RESULTS: Bacterial pathogens were detected in 342 (93.7%) conjunctival samples while 23(6.3%) were sterile. Of the pathogens, 256 (74.9%) were Staphylococcus aureus, 35(10.2%) Coagulase- negative staphylococci, 22 (6.4%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa , 11(3.2%) Escherichia coli, 7(2.1%) Klebsiella species, 5(1.5%) Streptococcus pneumoniae , 4(1.2%) Haemophilus influenzae, 1(0.3%) Proteus mirabilis, and 1(0.3%)Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The highest rate of conjunctivitis 96(26.3%) was found among infants and children (0-10years).Resistance rates to most of the tested antibiotics were high. However, 67% of them were susceptible to ceftriaxone while only 39.2% were susceptible to chloramphenicol. CONCLUSION: This study has recorded high antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens of conjunctivitis in this environment; therefore, determining the susceptibility pattern of these pathogens to available antibiotics is crucial to effective management of bacterial conjunctivitis.
TI  - [The role of macrolides in treatment of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].
AB  - Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) cause a lot of hospital admissions, mortality, and strongly influence health-related quality of life. Approximately half of COPD exacerbations are associated with bacterial infections and many patients have lower airways colonization. Current guidelines recommend antibotic therapy in course of COPD exacerbation for patients with sputum purulence and suggest correlation between severity of symptoms and the type of infecting pathogen. The most common bacterial pathogens isolated in COPD exacerbation are Haemophilus influenzae and parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. The presence of these bacteria are more common for mild and moderate exacerbations. More virulent organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been found in more severe cases. Atypical pathogens such Chlamydophila and Mycoplasma could cause exacerbation alone or they could coexist with typical pathogen. Rules of antibiotic therapy and usefulness of macrolides in treatment of COPD exacerbation has been described in the article.
TI  - Antibiotic therapy in elderly patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - Chronic bronchitis (CB) is a critical component of chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease (COPD). Emphysema, reversible airway disease and bronchiectasis also contribute to COPD. Elderly patients are at increased risk for COPD and its components - emphysema, CB and bronchiectasis. In addition, older patients are at increased risk for resistant organisms during episodes of acute exacerbation of CB (AECB). These organisms include the more common bacteria implicated in AECB, such as Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and less common nonenteric, Gram-negative organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Risk-stratified antibiotic treatment guidelines for AECB appear to be useful, although they have not been prospectively validated for the general CB population, and especially not in the elderly CB population. Many of the AECB treatment guidelines that are stratified based on risk factors have recommended that the oral respiratory fluoroquinolone antibiotics (gemifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin) play a second-line but pivotal role, particularly in patients who have failed initial antibiotic treatment for simple CB or as initial treatment for complicated CB.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia in a tertiary care hospital in India: role of multi-drug resistant pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) is the most frequent intensive-care-unit (ICU)-acquired infection. The aetiology of VAP varies with different patient populations and types of ICUs. METHODOLOGY: A prospective study was performed over a period of 15 months in a tertiary care hospital to determine the various aetiological agents causing VAP and the prevalence of multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens. Combination disk method, Modified Hodge test, EDTA disk synergy (EDS) test and AmpC disk test were performed for the detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), carbapenemases, metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL) and AmpC beta-lactamases respectively. RESULTS: Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Candida spp. were more common in early-onset VAP, while non-fermenters (Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp.) were significantly associated with late-onset VAP (P value 0.0267, Chi-square value 4.91). Thirty-seven (78.7%) of the 47 VAP pathogens were multidrug resistant. ESBL was produced by 50% and 67% of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae respectively. MBL was produced by 20% of P. aeruginosa. AmpC beta-lactamases were produced by 33.3% and 60.7% of the Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters respectively. Of the S. aureus isolates, 43% were methicillin resistant. Prior antibiotic therapy and hospitalization of five days or more were independent risk factors for VAP by MDR pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: VAP is increasingly associated with MDR pathogens. Production of ESBL, AmpC beta-lactamases and metallo beta-lactamases were responsible for the multi-drug resistance of these pathogens. Increasing prevalence of MDR pathogens in patients with late-onset VAP indicate that appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics should be used to treat them.
TI  - The diagnosis and treatment of elderly patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic bronchitis.
AB  - The syndrome of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) consists of chronic  bronchitis (CB), bronchiectasis, emphysema, and reversible airway disease that combine uniquely in an individual patient. Older patients are at risk for COPD and its components--emphysema, CB, and bronchiectasis. Bacterial and viral infections play a role in acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) and in acute exacerbations of CB (AECB) without features of COPD. Older patients are at risk for resistant bacterial organisms during their episodes of AECOPD and AECB. Organisms include the more-common bacteria implicated in AECOPD/AECB such as Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Less-common nonenteric, gram-negative organisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, gram-positive organisms including Staphylococcus aureus, and strains of nontuberculosis Mycobacteria are more often seen in AECOPD/AECB episodes involving elderly patients with frequent episodes of CB or those with bronchiectasis. Risk-stratified antibiotic treatment guidelines appear useful for purulent episodes of AECOPD and episodes of AECB. These guidelines have not been prospectively validated for the general population and especially not for the elderly population. Using a risk-stratification approach for elderly patients, first-line antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin, ampicillin, pivampicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and doxycycline), with a more-limited spectrum of antibacterial coverage, are used in patients who are likely to have a low probability of resistant organisms during AECOPD/AECB. Second-line antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, second- or third-generation cephalosporins, and respiratory fluoroquinolones) with a broader spectrum of coverage are reserved for patients with significant risk factors for resistant organisms and those who have failed initial antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Bacterial aetiology in ventilator-associated pneumonia at a Swedish university hospital.
AB  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common complication of respiratory support and is associated with increased mortality, morbidity and costs, and a prolonged stay in the intensive care unit. Scandinavian data on the aetiology in VAP are lacking. We hereby present a retrospective study on the aetiology of VAP diagnosed by protective specimen brush culture at Malmo University Hospital in relation to early- and late-onset VAP, antibiotic treatment and the incidence of drug-resistant bacteria. Patients registered with a diagnosis of VAP between January 2004 and September 2007 were included in the study. Sixty-five of 109 patients diagnosed with VAP met the inclusion criteria, and 103 bacterial isolates were cultured from these patients. The most common findings among the 65 VAP episodes were Enterobacteriaceae (28), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13), Haemophilus influenzae (12) and Staphylococcus aureus (8). Patients with no antibiotic treatment at the onset of VAP had significantly more H. influenzae (p = 0.035) and Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria (p = 0.019). There was no difference in incidence of P. aeruginosa between early- and late-onset VAP. Resistant bacteria were found in 18% of the patients.
TI  - Eleven-year study of causes of neonatal bacterial meningitis in Ahvaz, Iran.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial meningitis is a devastating infection with a high mortality rate, especially in neonates. The aim of this study was to determine the causative agents that cause bacterial meningitis in Khuzestan province in the south-western region of Iran. METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional study was carried out from 1997 to 2007 at the neonatal ward of a university teaching hospital (Emam Khomeini hospital) in Ahvaz. All infants younger than 29 days old who suffered from meningitis were included. Laboratory tests included Gram stain, culture, and biochemical tests. Cases were defined as meningitis if the cerebrospinal fluid culture was positive. RESULTS: Based on cerebrospinal fluid culture, 31 infants were identified as having bacterial meningitis. Eleven (35.5%) of these cases were caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, nine (29%) were caused by Enterobacter spp., three (9.6%) were caused by Escherichia coli, three (9.6%) were caused by Enterococcus spp., two (6.4%) were caused by Acinetobacter, and one case each (3.2%) was caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae. The male-to-female ratio was 2 : 1 (67.7% were male). The birthweights of 20 (64.5%) patients were under 2500 g and 11 (35.4%) patients had normal birthweights. Thirteen (42%) were early-onset cases and 18 (58%) were late-onset cases. More than half of the cases (54.8%) acquired the infection from the hospital. Blood cultures were positive for 18 (58%) patients. Thirty-two percent of cases died in spite of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter spp. were the two main causative agents that caused neonatal bacterial meningitis, and nosocomial meningitis was the most common type in our ward.
TI  - Adhesion of respiratory-infection-associated microorganisms on degradable thermoplastic composites.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate bacterial adhesion and early colonization on a composite consisting of bioactive glass (BAG) particles and copolymer of epsilon-caprolactone/D,L-lactide. Materials were incubated with suspensions of both type strains and clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa for 30 minutes (adhesion) and 4 hours (colonization). Clear differences exist in the microorganisms' ability to adhere on the experimental materials. However, the presence of BAG particles does not inhibit bacterial adhesion, but early colonization of the materials with P. aeruginosa was inhibited by the addition of 90-315 mum BAG particles.
TI  - Evaluation of bacterial biofilms in chronic rhinosinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the presence of biofilms in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. DESIGN: Prospective study. METHODS: Thirty patients with chronic rhinosinusitis scheduled for endoscopic sinus surgery were enrolled in this study. Nasal swab cultures were taken at the time of surgery. Samples were cultured using conventional methods for Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Culture-positive samples were evaluated for slime-forming ability. Qualitative detection of biofilm formation by all slime-producing strains was studied by culturing the strains on Congo red agar plates. RESULTS: Twenty-three of 30 patients' samples were culture positive (76.6%). Thirteen S. aureus and 10 P. aeruginosa cultures were identified on 23 specimens. Bacterial biofilms were present on 15 of 23 (65.2%) culture-positive specimens. Nine of 13 (69.2%) S. aureus cultures and 6 of 10 (60%) P. aeruginosa cultures produced bacterial biofilms. CONCLUSION: This conventional method is capable of demonstrating biofilm-forming ability in bacteria recovered from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. The biofilm-forming ability was higher in S. aureus compared with P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of meropenem in Japanese pediatric patients.
AB  - The aims of this study were to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for meropenem in Japanese pediatric patients, and to use this model to assess the pharmacodynamics of meropenem regimens against common bacterial populations. Pharmacokinetic data were pooled from nine separate studies (229 plasma samples and 61 urine samples from 40 infected children), modeled using the NONMEM program, and used for a pharmacodynamic simulation to estimate the probabilities of attaining the bactericidal target (40% of the time above the MIC for the bacterium). In the final population pharmacokinetic model, body weight (BW, kg) was the most significant covariate: Cl(r) (l/h) = 0.254 x BW, Cl(nr) (l/h) = 3.45, V (c) (l) = 0.272 x BW, Q (l/h) = 1.65, and V (p) (l) = 0.228 x BW, where Cl(r) and Cl(nr) are the renal and non-renal clearances, V (p) and V (c) are the volumes of distribution of the central and peripheral compartments, and Q is the intercompartmental (central-peripheral) clearance. In most typical patients (BW = 10, 20, and 30 kg), the approved regimens of 10-40 mg/kg, three times a day (0.5-h infusions), achieved a target attainment probability of >80% against Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of meropenem in Japanese pediatric patients.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic target attainment analysis of meropenem in Japanese adult patients.
AB  - This study was a pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic (PD) target attainment analysis of meropenem in Japanese adult patients. Plasma drug concentration data (265 samples from 42 patients) were used for population PK modeling and Monte Carlo simulation to assess the probability of attaining the PK-PD target (40% of the time above the MIC for the bacterium). The final population PK model identified creatinine clearance (Cl(cr), ml/min) and body weight (BW, kg) as the most significant covariates: Cl (l/h) = 0.0905 x Cl(cr) + 2.03, V(c)(l) = 0.199 9 BW, Q (l/h) = 4.02, and V(p) (l) = 4.55, where Cl is the clearance, Vc and Vp are the volumes of distribution of the central and peripheral compartments, respectively, and Q is the intercompartmental clearance. The Monte Carlo simulation developed the PK-PD breakpoints (the highest MIC values at which the probabilities of target attainment in plasma are 80% or more) for meropenem regimens, the values of which varied with the Cl(cr) and BW of the patient. The simulation also demonstrated that 0.25 g every 12 h (0.5-h infusion) achieved a target attainment probability of 82.4-100% against Escherichia coli, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. However, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 0.5 g every 8 h or 1 g every 8 h was required to achieve 80% or more probability in most typical patients. These results provide a PK-PD-based strategy for tailoring a meropenem regimen according to Clcr and BW of a Japanese adult patient and susceptibility of the causative bacteria.
TI  - Inhibitory mechanism of novel inhibitors of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Bacterial UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase (MurA) catalyzes the transfer of enolpyruvate from phosphoenolphyruvate (PEP) to uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine (UNAG), which is the first step of bacterial cell wall synthesis. We identified thimerosal, thiram, and ebselen as effective inhibitors of Heamophilus influenzae MurA by screening a chemical library that consisted of a wide range of bioactive compounds. When MurA was preincubated with these inhibitors, their 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) were found to range from 0.1 to 0.7 microM. In particular, thimerosal suppressed the growth of several different Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium at a concentration range of 1-2 microg/ml. These inhibitors covalently modified the cysteine residue near the active site of MurA. This modification changed the open conformation of MurA to a more closed configuration, which may have prevented the necessary conformational change from occurring during the enzyme reaction.
TI  - Population pharmacokinetic modeling and pharmacodynamic assessment of cefozopran  in pediatric patients.
AB  - The aims of this study were to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for cefozopran in pediatric patients, and to use this model to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of cefozopran regimens against common bacterial populations. Plasma drug concentration data (110 samples from 31 pediatric patients) were modeled using the NONMEM program. The mean estimate and interindividual variance of the model were used in a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probabilities of attaining the bactericidal target for cefozopran (the time which the drug concentration remains above the minimum inhibitory concentration for the bacterium is 70% of the dosing interval). A two-compartment model fitted the data and body weight (BW, kg) was the most significant covariate. The final model was: Cl (l/h) = 0.674 x BW0.538, Vc (l) = 0.00233 x BW2.25 + 1.85, Q (l/h) = 1.46, and Vp (l) = 0.0964 x BW, where Cl is the clearance, Vc, and Vp are the volumes of distribution of the central and peripheral compartments, and Q is the intercompartmental clearance. The approved regimens of 20- or 40-mg/kg four times a day (0.5-h infusions), which were more effective than the corresponding three times a day-regimens, provided sufficient bactericidal effects on common bacterial populations (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in most typical patients. These results better define the pharmacokinetics of cefozopran and help in the choice of appropriate regimens for pediatric patients.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from more than 10,000 patients with infectious respiratory diseases: a 25-year longitudinal study.
AB  - The Study Group on Antimicrobial Susceptibility of Pathogens Isolated from Respiratory Infections was established in 1981 in Japan to elucidate trends in such susceptibilities in patients with infectious respiratory diseases; the Group has conducted nationwide research in collaboration with 21 medical institutions. Examination of more than 10,000 patients by 2005 allowed a summary of study findings. Streptococcus pneumoniae started to become resistant to penicillin G in the 1990s, and the isolation rate of penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP + PRSP) reached almost 60% in 2001. The proportion of PRSP also increased, reaching 19.4%. Thereafter, the rate of PISP + PRSP decreased somewhat to the mid-30% range. Macrolide resistance was also observed; in 2005, the prevalence of strains highly susceptible to erythromycin with MICs <or= 0.06 microg/ml had decreased to 15.5%, whereas the proportion of highly resistant strains with MICs >or= 128 microg/ml exceeded 40%. Among Staphylococcus aureus isolates, the proportion of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains began to increase rapidly in 1986 and constituted around 60% of all S. aureus strains identified in 1990 and in the following years. In 1993, the prevalence of ampicillin-resistant isolates of Haemophilus influenzae had increased remarkably, presumably related to the outbreak of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) H. influenzae strains, and the proportion of these strains among the isolates surpassed 30% in 2002 and thereafter. For Klebsiella pneumoniae, the antimicrobial activity of first- to fourth-generation cephems improved with each generation. The MIC distribution patterns of Pseudomonas aeruginosa shifted towards higher MICs when compared with the MICs for other pathogens. Broad patterns with no distinct peaks reflected the difficulty in treating P. aeruginosa infection. Regarding Moraxella catarrhalis, beta-lactamase-producing strains already constituted a majority of the isolates in 1990, and the proportion of strains highly susceptible to ampicillin, with MICs <or= 0.06 microg/ml, was less than 10% at that time.
TI  - Factors associated with mucoid transition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - Although the mucoid form of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is largely responsible for the progression of lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF), the relationship between factors relating daily-care regimes to mucoidy acquisition are as yet poorly investigated. Fifty-two CF patients registered at the CF centre of Dijon, France, were retrospectively evaluated from the date of Pa colonization either to the first positive sputum culture for mucoid Pa (n = 26) or to the last culture in which the Pa remained non-mucoid (n = 26). All clinical, pathological and therapeutic events were recorded. The association between the parameters collected and mucoid transition of Pa was assessed in a Cox model with time-dependant covariables. The mean follow-up was 4.7 + or - 4.3 years. Three independent parameters were associated with the higher risk of mucoid transition of Pa: persistence of Pa in sputum (OR 7.89; p <0.01), use of inhaled bronchodilators (OR 3.40; p = 0.04), and the use of inhaled colimycin (OR 4.04; p = 0.02). Isolation of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae or Streptococcus pneumoniae in sputum was associated with a lower risk (OR 0.24; p < 0.01). Mucoid transition of Pa was associated with variables that reflected the severity of both lung disease and Pa colonization. Although they do not lead to prophylactic measures, these results corroborate the need to avoid Pa persistence.
TI  - Crystal structures of penicillin-binding proteins 4 and 5 from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - We have determined high-resolution apo crystal structures of two low molecular weight penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), PBP4 and PBP5, from Haemophilus influenzae, one of the most frequently found pathogens in the upper respiratory tract of children. Novel beta-lactams with notable antimicrobial activity have been designed, and crystal structures of PBP4 complexed with ampicillin and two of the novel molecules have also been determined. Comparing the apo form with those of the complexes, we find that the drugs disturb the PBP4 structure and weaken X-ray diffraction, to very different extents. PBP4 has recently been shown to act as a sensor of the presence of penicillins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and our models offer a clue to the structural basis for this effect. Covalently attached penicillins press against a phenylalanine residue near the active site and disturb the deacylation step. The ready inhibition of PBP4 by beta-lactams compared to PBP5 also appears to be related to the weaker interactions holding key residues in a catalytically competent position.
TI  - Characterization of bacterial and fungal biofilms in chronic rhinosinusitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conclusive evidence exists that biofilms are present on the mucosa of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) patients. Less is known about the species constituting these biofilms. This study developed a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) protocol for characterization of bacterial and fungal biofilms in CRS. METHODS: Fifty CRS patients and 10 controls were recruited. Bacteria FISH probes for Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a universal probe for fungi were applied to sinus mucosal specimens and then analyzed using confocal scanning laser microscopy. RESULTS: Thirty-six of 50 CRS patients had biofilms present in contrast to 0/10 controls, suggesting a role for biofilms in the pathogenesis of this disease. S. aureus was the most common biofilm-forming organism. Eleven of 50 CRS patients had characteristic fungal biofilms present. CONCLUSION: This is the largest study of biofilms in CRS. It has validated mucosal tissue cryopreservation for delayed biofilm analysis. Fungal biofilms have been identified and the importance of S. aureus biofilms in the polymicrobial etiology of CRS is highlighted.
TI  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: role of bacteria and updated guide to antibacterial selection in the older patient.
AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. COPD is especially prevalent in the elderly, affecting 25% of those aged>or=75 years. The course of the disease in the elderly is often complicated by co-morbid conditions, and its management is complicated by drug-drug interactions. Exacerbations of COPD increase rates of hospitalization and mortality and decrease quality of life. Exacerbations are marked by an increase from baseline in dyspnoea, sputum volume and sputum purulence. Approximately 50% of acute exacerbations of symptoms in COPD are caused by non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Stratification of exacerbations based on severity of symptoms and signs, and severity of underlying COPD, is useful in selecting patients likely to benefit from antibacterial therapy. Patients who are hospitalized with exacerbations, those who have all three symptoms (increased dyspnoea, sputum volume and sputum purulence), and those with severe underlying COPD and exacerbations benefit most from antibacterials. Antibacterial susceptibility patterns among the bacterial pathogens are evolving, and knowledge of local susceptibility patterns is useful in antibacterial selection. Penicillin, amoxicillin, cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) and doxycycline should not be used as an initial antibacterial because of resistance patterns. We recommend second-/third-generation cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, azithromycin and respiratory fluoroquinolones as initial choices. In patients at risk of colonization by, and infection as a result of, P. aeruginosa, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin or an advanced penicillin/penicillinase combination effective against this species should be used. Drug-drug interactions should be considered in antibacterial choice. The goals of antibacterial therapy for exacerbations of COPD are the prevention of complications such as respiratory failure and death, and the reduction of treatment failures. The role of pathogenic bacteria in progression of stable COPD and the use of prophylactic antibacterials in stable COPD are under investigation. Currently available evidence does not support routine clinical use of prophylactic antibacterials in stable COPD. In conclusion, pathogenic bacteria cause a significant proportion of acute exacerbations of COPD. Use of antibacterials, based on current susceptibility patterns, is beneficial in patients with severe COPD experiencing exacerbations and in patients with severe exacerbations.
TI  - Anti-infective strategies of the future: is there room for species-specific antibacterial agents?
AB  - Broad-spectrum antibiotics, directed against conserved bacterial targets, are the mainstay of antibacterial therapy. Increasing resistance, however, demands new strategies. Over time a number of therapeutic concepts have evolved, starting out with the use of polyclonal antisera, which were rapidly replaced by the easier to use antibiotics. Other concepts, such as immunotherapy, radioimmunotherapy, anti-virulence agents, phage therapy and others are under evaluation and often limited in application. In the discovery process of new antibiotics in the pharmaceutical industry quite a number of new agents have emerged, which exhibit a surprisingly high degree of species-specificity. None of them has been considered for development so far. Some examples from the literature which show selectivity for Helicobacter pylori, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, anaerobes, and others, will be discussed here. It is postulated that there is a room for such agents in future antibacterial therapy, e.g. in difficult to treat infections caused by nonfermenters such as multiresistant P. aerugoinosa, Acinetobacter, Enterobacteriaceae, and S.aureus, including MRSA. Their application would include monotherapy as well as combination therapy with other antibiotics, anti-virulence agents or immunotherapy and these possibilities would greatly expand the current anti-infective armamentarium.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,919 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2007].
AB  - We have reported in this journal in vitro susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics every year since 1992. In this paper, we report the results of an analysis of in vitro susceptibilities of 12,919 clinical isolates from 72 centers in Japan to selected antibiotics in 2007 compared with the results from previous years. The common respiratory pathogens, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae maintained a high susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (FQs). The resistance of S. pyogenes to macrolides has been increasing every year and this was especially clear this year. Most strains of Enterobacteriaceae except for Escherichia coli showed a high susceptibility to FQs. Almost 30% of E. coli strains were resistant to FQs and the resistance increased further this year. FQs resistance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was approximately 95% with the exception of 45% for sitafloxacin (STFX). FQs resistance of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) was low at about 10%. FQs resistance of methicillin-resistant coagulase negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) was higher than that of methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative Staphylococci (MSCNS), but it was lower than that of MRSA. However, FQs resistance of MSCNS was higher than that of MSSA. FQs resistance of Enterococcus faecalis was 22.5% to 29.6%, while that of Enterococcusfaecium was more than 85% except for STFX (58.3%). In clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa derived from urinary tract infections, FQs resistance was 21-27%, which was higher than that of P. aeruginosa from respiratory tract infections at 13-21%, which was the same trend as in past years. Multidrug resistant strains accounted for 5.6% in the urinary tract and 1.8% in the respiratory tract. Acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to FQs. The carbapenem resistant strains, which present a problem at present, accounted for 2.7%. Neisseria gonorrhoeae showed high resistance of 86-88% to FQs. The results of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant Staphylococci, Enterococci, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and N. gonorrhoeae showed resistance tendencies, and other species maintained high susceptibility rates more than 90% against FQs, which have been used clinically for over 15 years.
TI  - Rapid detection of ESBL-producing gram-negative bacteria isolated from blood: a reasonable and reliable tool for middle and low resource countries.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Delay in appropriate treatment in patients with bacteraemia can increase morbidity, mortality, and health expenditures. We compared the Rapid Direct Test (RDT) designed to detect ESBL-producing gram-negative bacteria (GNB) directly from positive blood cultures bottles, with two conventional ESBL detection tests: Screening and Confirmatory Disk Diffusion Assay (SC-DDA) and an MIC Screening and ESBL E-test (MIC/ET). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We screened all blood cultures in a tertiary care facility from August to December 2005. We only included one positive bottle per patient in which GNB were observed. RDT: Blood from each bottle was inoculated on Mueller-Hinton agar. Ceftazidime and cefotaxime disks with and without clavulanic acid were added and incubated at 35 degrees C +/- 2 degrees C for 24 h. Results were interpreted according to CLSI recommendations for the SC-DDA and MIC/ET. All methods were performed simultaneously. Time for reporting as an ESBL-producer and cost of the tests were recorded. RESULTS: We isolated 124 GNB in 114 episodes of bacteraemia, 10 of them (8.8%) polymicrobial; 79 (63.7%) of the GNB were enteric bacteria, 44 (35.5%) glucose non-fermenter GNB and one Haemophilus influenzae. The most common microorganism was Escherichia coli in 56 episodes (45.2%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 24 (19.3%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 13 (10.5%). Of the 114 episodes, 41 (36%) had at least one GNB resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporins, and 25 (21.9%) were caused by an ESBL-producing GNB. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for the RDT were 96%, 98.9%, 96% and 98.9%, respectively. Agreement by kappa index between RDT and SC-DDA was 0.95 and between the RDT and MIC/ET was 0.92. The RDT detected 24/25 ESBL-producing bacteria. The mean time to detect an isolate as an ESBL producer after a positive blood culture bottle signal was 1.02 +/- 0.19 days when using the RDT, and 3.40 +/- 0.59 days when using any other method. The difference in reporting time was 2.38 +/- 0.63 days (p < 0.0001). Our estimated cost per test was $1.54 for RDT, $2.32 for screening/ confirmatory SC-DDA, and $49.65 for MIC screening and MIC/ET. Conclusions. The RDT is a rapid, reliable and easy analysis to perform, as well as cost-effective.
TI  - [Bacteria and biofilm in respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Biofilm is a structured community of bacterial cells included in a self-produced  polymeric matrix adherent to an inert or living surface. The main property of biofilm consists of making microrganisms more resistant to exogenous insults. Antibiotic therapy typically resolves symptoms determined by planktonic cells released by biofilms but is not able to eradicate and completely clear biofilm. This is why infections sustained by biofilm-producer bacteria are often recurrent, making mandatory repeated antibiotic treatments. The typical conformation of biofilm, the phenotypical and genetical features existing among the different microrganisms confer a natural resistance to a number of antimicrobials so that it is necessary to test antimicrobial activity against the microbial species itself and also against biofilm, when it is present. Comparative studies, performed on quinolones and beta-lactams, evidenced a significant activity against biofilm produced by pneumococci, haemophyli and pseudomonas as well.
TI  - Bacteriology of external ocular infections in Aba, South Eastern Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria are microbial agents that frequently cause infections of the eye and possible loss of vision. METHOD: The common isolates were studied in 298 bacterial infections of the anterior eye, consisting of 35 blepharitis, 208 conjunctivitis and 55 keratitis. Isolates were cultured in blood agar and chocolate agar. Each strain's susceptibility to the antibiotics was determined using a standard table of antibiotic susceptibility. RESULTS: In decreasing order of frequency, the implicated bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus 80 (23.7 per cent), Staphylococcus albus 65 (19.2 per cent), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 34 (10.1 per cent), Streptococcus pneumoniae 29 (8.6 per cent), Haemophilus influenzae 26 (7.7 per cent), Streptococcus pyogene 20 (6.2 per cent), Klebsiella pneumoniae 18 (6.2 per cent), Escherichia coli 15 (4.4 per cent), Neisseria gonorrhoeae 13 (3.9 per cent), Streptococcus viridans 11 (3.5 per cent), Moraxella catarrhalis 10 (3.0 per cent), Streptococcus faecalis 5 (1.5 per cent), Proteus mirabilis 5 (1.5 per cent) and Neisseria meningitides 1 (0.3 per cent). Bacteria were isolated most frequently from infections of the conjunctiva (222, 66.7 per cent), then the cornea (65, 20.1 per cent) and least from the eyelids (44, 13.2 per cent). Bacterial isolates varied in their clinical features (p < 0.01). The age distribution showed isolations of 77 (23.2 per cent) and 79 (23.7 per cent) in the age groups of newborn to under three years and three to under 12 years, respectively. This was comparable to 66 (19.8 per cent) for the 12 to under 18 years, 61 (18.3 per cent) for the 18 to under 40 years age group and 50 (15 per cent) for those 40 years and above. Bacterial isolates had no predilection for the age of patients (p < 0.95). Conjunctivitis was diagnosed more in children, 60 (28.8 per cent) in the newborn to under three years and 53 (25.5 per cent) in the three to under 12 years age groups. Blepharitis was diagnosed most frequently (15, 42.8 per cent) in adolescents 12 to under 18 years, while keratitis was more in adults (20, 36.4 per cent) in the 18 to under 40 years and (15, 27.3 per cent) in the 40 years and above. Diagnosis varied among age groups but there was no relationship between sex and diagnosis (p < 0.75). Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most resistant to all the anti-bacterial preparations. The bacterial isolates were more susceptible to the second generation quinolones than the first. CONCLUSION: The study recommends that quinolones be available as ophthalmic preparations to be prescribed by the qualified practitioners to avoid development of resistance from indiscriminate use.
TI  - Predictors of positive sputum cultures in exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Although sputum culture in patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD is of uncertain value, it is routinely done. The ability to clinically identify patients likely or unlikely to yield bacterial sputum isolates would potentially reduce unnecessary tests. The objective of this study was to identify the clinical predictors of positive sputum cultures in this patient population. METHODS: Consecutive patients with a COPD exacerbation requiring an emergency visit were prospectively enrolled. Quantitative sputum culture was performed on-site. Data on current smoking, sputum purulence, FEV(1), Medical Research Council chronic dyspnoea scale, BMI, severe exacerbations in the preceding year requiring hospitalization, PaO(2), PaCO(2), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, and oral and inhaled steroid use were recorded. RESULTS: Of the 94 patients enrolled, sputum from 36 yielded bacterial pathogens. These patients were characterized by a higher frequency of purulent sputum, lower FEV(1), BMI and PaO(2,) higher APACHE II score and more frequent use of inhaled steroids (P < 0.05). On multivariate regression, purulent sputum, FEV(1) and BMI were independent determinants of a positive sputum culture. Using receiver-operator-optimized thresholds for these variables (purulent sputum, FEV(1) < 35% predicted and BMI < or = 22 kg/m(2)), we proposed a regression coefficient-weighted prediction model that accurately determined the likelihood of sputum bacterial isolation. CONCLUSIONS: A prediction model based on the variables of purulent sputum, FEV(1) and BMI predicted sputum culture result with about 90% accuracy. Pending further validation, this model may save valuable healthcare resources.
TI  - Trends in pathogens colonising the respiratory tract of adult patients with cystic fibrosis, 1985-2005.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The treatment of patients with CF has continued to evolve. We hypothesised that sputum microbiology may have changed as a result of this. METHOD: Retrospective analysis of sputum microbiology from adult CF patients (1985 to 2005) using the Royal Brompton Hospital CF database. RESULTS: Colonisation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus between 1985 and 2005 remained stable (77 to 82%, p=0.159; 54 to 47%, p=0.108; respectively). Haemophilus influenzae (48 to 6%; p<0.001), Aspergillus species (18 to 9%; p=0.002) and Burkholderia cepacia complex (9 to 4%; p=0.041) prevalence decreased. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and MRSA increased (1 to 4%, p=0.02; 1 to 6%, p=0.002, respectively). CONCLUSION: P. aeruginosa colonisation has remained stable; there has been a decline in B. cepacia complex, H. influenzae and Aspergillus sp., and only a small increase in S. maltophilia and MRSA. Intensive antibiotic strategies have been employed, which, so far, have not resulted in clinically significant emergence of new pathogens.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms: tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Against Gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline MIC(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline MIC(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (7.0%) and K. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (45.9%) and E. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (13.8%). Tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult to treat organisms.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of a fosfomycin/tobramycin combination: a novel inhaled  antibiotic for bronchiectasis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the in vitro and in vivo activities of a 4:1 (w/w) fosfomycin/tobramycin combination (FTI) with those of fosfomycin and tobramycin alone against cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchiectasis pathogens. METHODS: Clinical isolates of CF Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Escherichia coli and Klebsiellia spp. were evaluated by MIC, MBC, post-antibiotic effect (PAE), synergy, time-kill, a rat pneumonia model and spontaneous mutation frequency (SMF). RESULTS: FTI showed high activity against E. coli, H. influenzae, S. aureus and Klebsiella spp. For the S. aureus strains, 75% of which were methicillin resistant (MRSA), FTI had a lower MIC(90) than tobramycin. For P. aeruginosa, FTI had a lower MIC(90) than fosfomycin, but tobramycin was more active than either. Synergy studies showed no antagonism between fosfomycin and tobramycin, and 93% of the isolates demonstrated no interaction. FTI was rapidly bactericidal and exhibited concentration-dependent killing in time-kill studies. In the rat pneumonia model, FTI and tobramycin demonstrated bactericidal killing of P. aeruginosa; both were more active than fosfomycin alone. The SMF for S. aureus resistance to FTI was 2-4 log(10) lower than that for tobramycin and 2-7 log(10) lower than that for fosfomycin. For P. aeruginosa, the FTI SMF was 2-3 log(10) lower than that for fosfomycin and 1-2 log(10) lower than that for tobramycin. CONCLUSIONS: FTI is a broad-spectrum antibiotic combination with high activity in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest FTI could be a potential treatment for respiratory infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic bacteria.
TI  - Otitis media microbes: culture, PCR, and confocal laser scanning microscopy.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the presence of middle ear pathogens in nasopharynx (NP), middle ear fluid (MEF), and middle ear mucosal swabs (MES) of 14 patients undergoing middle ear surgery. METHODOLOGY: Bacteria were assessed by culture and species specific PCR. Biofilm was investigated by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) of middle ear biopsies (MEBs). RESULTS: Bacteria were absent in CLSM of MEBs in three of the four closed and healthy middle ears. Bacteria occurred in the ear with a foreign body (middle ear prosthesis), which showed localized living and dead bacteria, indicating biofilm. Bacterial growth was present in ten patient ears, but biofilm occurred in only one patient. CLSM indicated biofilm in the middle ear of two patients for whom PCR detected Haemophilus influenzae in the MEF. The three classical pathogens could frequently be found in the nasopharynx, by culture and PCR, but not from the middle ear. Alloiococcus otitidis was detected in the MEF of all five patients with open inflamed ears, though virtually absent from the nasopharynx. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was present in seven. It was the only pathogen found on several occasions in all three locations in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the association of H. influenzae with middle ear biofilm, and indicates a potential role of P. aeruginosa in middle ear inflammation and biofilm formation. Biofilm does not seem to cause inflammation. It is unclear whether the predominance of A. otitidis in chronically inflamed open middle ears indicates a pathogenic or contaminant role for this organism.
TI  - Frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria isolated from 2 hospitals in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of the gram-negative bacteria isolated from 2 hospitals in Makkah. METHODS: This study was undertaken in 2 main tertiary care hospitals namely; Al-Noor Specialist Hospital, and Hera Hospital in Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from October 2005 to March 2006. A total of 1137 gram-negative bacteria were identified in non-duplicate clinical specimens obtained from 965 patients of various body sites infections. Demographic data, identity of microorganisms, and antimicrobial susceptibilities were obtained from medical and laboratory records. RESULTS: The most prevalent gram-negative bacteria were Escherichia coli (31.6%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (31.2%), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (10.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.3%), Klebsiella sp. (6.2%), Haemophilus influenzae (3.7%), Proteus sp. (3.3%), and Enterobacter sp. (1.9%). Results demonstrated that gram-negative bacteria have a high rate of resistance to commonly used antibiotics. Furthermore, multi-drug resistance was also common in this study. CONCLUSION: Our data showed a high rate of resistance among gram-negative pathogens in comparison with other countries in the world. The implementation of monitoring programs is an important part of the prevention strategy against the development of antibiotic resistance in hospitals.
TI  - Importance of viral and bacterial infections in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the contribution of both viruses and bacteria in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). OBJECTIVES: This study estimated the burden of both types of pathogens among adults seeking care for an AECOPD during two consecutive winter seasons. STUDY DESIGN: Patients 50 years or older who consulted within 10 days of AECOPD onset were eligible. Clinical data were collected on a standardized questionnaire, and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA), paired sera, and non-induced sputum were collected. Polymerase chain reaction (PRC) assays were used to identify viral, atypical and bacterial pathogens in NPA specimen. RESULTS: Overall, 108 patients with AECOPD were included, 88% of patients were admitted and 2 patients (2%) received intensive care. A third of patients (31%) had evidence of a viral infection, 9% with influenza A, 7% RSV and 7% with PIV-3. One patient was positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Bacterial pathogens were identified in 49% of patients with available sputum, most frequently Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae. Among virus-infected patients, 14 (58%) also had bacteria in their sputum, but co-infected patients did not present with different symptoms than patients with single infections. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that influenza and RSV are frequent contributors of AECOPD, and that coinfection with bacteria does not appear to be more severe among virus-infected patients. Clinicians should be aware that AECOPD may be frequently triggered by viruses, and may consider antivirals and proper infection control measures in appropriate epidemiological setting.
TI  - Variability and effects of bronchial colonisation in patients with moderate COPD.
AB  - Sputum and lung function were periodically assessed in stable moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) outpatients to determine relationships between bronchial colonisation and inflammation. Relationships between potentially pathogenic microorganism (PPM) typology, bronchial inflammation (neutrophilia, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12) and post-bronchodilator decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) were analysed. PPMs periodically showing the same molecular profile using pulse field gel electrophoresis were considered long-term persistent. Bronchial colonisation was observed in 56 out of 79 follow-up examinations (70.9%) and was mainly due to Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteria (n = 47). These PPMs were all related to sputum neutrophilia (p< or =0.05, Chi-squared test), and H. influenzae was related to higher levels of IL-1beta (p = 0.005) and IL-12 (p = 0.01), with a dose-response relationship (Spearman's correlation coefficient of 0.38 for IL-1beta (p = 0.001), and of 0.32 for IL-12 (p = 0.006)). Haemophilus parainfluenzae was not associated with an identifiable inflammatory response. Long-term persistence of the same strain was observed in 12 examinations (21.4%), mainly due to P. aeruginosa or enterobacteria. A neutrophilic bronchial inflammatory response was associated with a statistically significant decline in FEV(1) during follow-up (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.07-6.62). A load-related relationship to bronchial inflammation in moderate COPD was observed for colonisation by H. influenzae, but not for colonisation by H. parainfluenzae.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy in 2007: general view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  - For the purpose of a nationwide surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility  of bacterial respiratory pathogens in patients in Japan, the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy conducted their second year survey, during the period from January to August, 2007. A total of 1178 strains were collected from clinical specimens obtained from adult patients with well-diagnosed respiratory tract infections. Susceptibility testing was evaluable for 1108 strains (226 Staphylococcus aureus, 257 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 6 Streptococcus pyogenes, 206 Haemophilus influenzae, 120 Moraxella catarrhalis, 122 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 171 Pseudomonas aeruginosa). A total of 44 antibacterial agents, including 26 beta-lactams (four penicillins, three penicillins in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, four oral cephems, eight parenteral cephems, one monobactam, five carbapenems, and one penem), three aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, six fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone were used for the study. Analysis was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The incidence of methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was high, at 59.7%, and the incidences of penicillin-intermediateresistant and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP and PRSP) were 30.4% and 5.1%, respectively. Among Haemophilus influenzae strains, 19.9% of them were found to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediately-resistant (BLNAI), 29.1% to be beta-lactamasenon-producing ABPC-resistant (BLNAR), and 6.7% to be beta-lactamase-producing ABPC-resistant (BLPAR) strains. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was not isolated. Two isolates (1.2%) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to be metallo-beta-lactamase-producing strains, including one (0.6%) suspected multidrug-resistant strain showing resistance to imipenem, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. These data will be a useful reference for future periodic surveillance studies and for investigations to control resistant infections as well. Continued surveillance is required to prevent the further spread of these antimicrobial resistances.
TI  - Respiratory microbiology of patients with cystic fibrosis in the United States, 1995 to 2005.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous improvements in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have occurred during the past 2 decades. We hypothesized that these changes could impact trends in respiratory microbiology. METHODS: Data from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry were used to examine trends in the incidence and prevalence of bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with CF in the United States from 1995 to 2005. RESULTS: The number of patients with CF in the patient registry increased from 19,735 in 1995 to 23,347 in 2005. During the study period, the reported annual prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa significantly declined from 60.4% in 1995 to 56.1% in 2005 (p < 0.001). The decline was most marked in children 6 to 10 years old (48.2 to 36.1%) and adolescents 11 to 17 years old (68.9 to 55.5%). Both the incidence (21.7% in 1995 and 33.2% in 2005) and prevalence (37.0% in 1995 and 52.4% in 2005) of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus significantly increased and the age-specific prevalence was highest in patients 6 to 17 years old. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant S aureus increased from 0.1% in 1995 to 17.2% in 2005 and from 2002 to 2005 was highest in adolescents 11 to 17 years old. Both the prevalence and incidence of Burkholderia cepacia complex declined, while the prevalence of Haemophilus influenzae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans increased. CONCLUSIONS: Data from the patient registry suggest that the epidemiology of bacterial pathogens in patients with CF changed during the study period. Future studies should continue to monitor changing trends and define the association between these trends and care practices in CF.
TI  - Inhibition of NFkappaB by the natural product Withaferin A in cellular models of  Cystic Fibrosis inflammation.
AB  - Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common autosomal genetic disorders in humans. This disease is caused by mutations within a single gene, coding for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. The phenotypic hallmark of CF is chronic lung infection and associated inflammation from opportunistic microbes such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. This eventually leads to deterioration of lung function and death in most CF patients. Unfortunately, there is no approved therapy for correcting the genetic defect causal to the disease. Hence, controlling inflammation and infection in CF patients are critical to disease management. Accordingly, anti-inflammatory agents and antibiotics are used to manage chronic inflammation and infection in CF patients. However, most of the anti-inflammatory agents in CF have severe limitations due to adverse side effects, and resistance to antibiotics is becoming an even more prominent problem. Thus, new agents that can be used to control chronic inflammation in CF are needed in the absence of a cure for the disease. Activation of the transcription factor NFkappaB through Toll-like receptors (TLR) following bacterial infection is principally involved in regulating lung inflammation in CF. NFkappaB regulates the transcription of several genes that are involved in inflammation, anti-apoptosis and anti-microbial activity, and hyper-activation of this transcription factor leads to a potent inflammatory response. Thus, NFkappaB is a potential anti-inflammatory drug target in CF. Screening of several compounds from natural sources in an in vitro model of CF-related inflammation wherein NFkappaB is activated by filtrates of a clinically isolated strain of PA (PAF) led us to Withaferin A (WFA), a steroidal lactone from the plant Withania Somnifera L. Dunal. Our data demonstrate that WFA blocks PAF-induced activation of NFkappaB as determined using reporter assays, IL-8 measurements and high-content fluorescent imaging of NFkappaB subunit p65 translocation. Since the airways of CF patients can be specifically targeted for delivery of therapeutics, we propose that WFA should be further studied as an anti-inflammatory agent in models of CF related inflammation mediated by NFkappaB.
TI  - Infection control in cystic fibrosis: cohorting, cross-contamination, and the respiratory therapist.
AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex genetic disease characterized by lung infections that lead to early morbidity and death. Pathogens that commonly infect the lungs of patients with CF include Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Burkholderia cepacia. Aggressively treating pulmonary infection with antibiotics has contributed to improved survival in patients with CF but has also promoted multiple-drug-resistant bacteria. Other complexities include the ability of bacteria to form biofilms, which makes them more resistant to antibiotics, and emerging pathogens in CF, of which the clinical importance is not yet clear. Increasing evidence of patient-to-patient transmission of CF pathogens led the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to produce evidence-based infection-control recommendations, which stress 4 principles: standard precautions, transmission-based precautions, hand hygiene, and care of respiratory equipment. Respiratory therapists need to know and follow these infection-control recommendations. Cohorting patients infected with B. cepacia complex is one of several interventions successful at keeping the spread of this pathogen low, but cohorting patients who are infected/colonized with other microbes is controversial, the main argument of which is not being certain of a patient's present respiratory culture status at any given patient visit.
TI  - Bugs, biofilms, and resistance in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Bacteria infect the respiratory tract early in the course of cystic fibrosis disease, often fail to be eradicated, and together with an aggressive host inflammatory response, are thought to be key players in the irreversible airway damage from which most patients ultimately die. Although incompletely understood, certain aspects of the cystic fibrosis airway itself appear to favor the development of chronic modes of survival, in particular biofilm formation; this and the development of antibiotic resistance following exposure to multiple antibiotic courses lead to chronic, persistent infection. In addition to the common cystic fibrosis pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, several newer species are becoming more common. Furthermore, new molecular techniques have led to the identification of multiple different organisms within respiratory secretions, many of which are not cultured with conventional tools. Future work should aim to develop clinically applicable methods to identify these and to determine which have the potential to impact pulmonary health. We outline the basic tenets of infection control and treatment.
TI  - Evolving concepts in biofilm infections.
AB  - Several pathogens associated with chronic infections, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae in chronic otitis media, Staphylococcus aureus in chronic rhinosinusitis and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli in recurrent urinary tract infections, are linked to biofilm formation. Biofilms are usually defined as surface-associated microbial communities, surrounded by an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix. Biofilm formation has been demonstrated for numerous pathogens and is clearly an important microbial survival strategy. However, outside of dental plaques, fewer reports have investigated biofilm development in clinical samples. Typically biofilms are found in chronic diseases that resist host immune responses and antibiotic treatment and these characteristics are often cited for the ability of bacteria to persist in vivo. This review examines some recent attempts to examine the biofilm phenotype in vivo and discusses the challenges and implications for defining a biofilm phenotype.
TI  - Early- and late-onset pneumonia: is this still a useful classification?
AB  - The choice of empirical treatment of nosocomial pneumonia in the intensive-care unit (ICU) used to rely on the interval after the start of mechanical ventilation. Nowadays, however, the question of whether in fact there is a difference in the distribution of causative pathogens is under debate. Data from 308 ICUs from the German National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System, including information on relevant pathogens isolated in 11,285 cases of nosocomial pneumonia from 1997 to 2004, were used for our evaluation. Each individual pneumonia case was allocated either to early- or to late-onset pneumonia, with three differentiation criteria: onset on the 4th day, the 5th day, or the 7th day in the ICU. The frequency of pathogens was evaluated according to these categories. A total of 5,066 additional cases of pneumonia were reported from 2005 to 2006, after the CDC criteria had been modified. From 1997 to 2004, the most frequent microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (2,718 cases, including 720 with methicillin [meticillin]-resistant S. aureus), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1,837 cases), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,305 cases), Escherichia coli (1,137 cases), Enterobacter spp. (937 cases), streptococci (671 cases), Haemophilus influenzae (509 cases), Acinetobacter spp. (493 cases), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (308 cases). The order of the four most frequent pathogens (accounting for 53.7% of all pathogens) was the same in both groups and was independent of the cutoff categories applied: S. aureus was first, followed by P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli. Thus, the predictabilities of the occurrence of pathogens were similar for the earlier (1997-to-2004) and later (2005-to-2006) time frames. This classification is no longer helpful for empirical antibiotic therapy, since the pathogens are the same for both groups.
TI  - [Conservation of the regulatory elements implicated in the control of the rpsB-tsf operon expression in gamma-proteobacteria].
AB  - In eubacteria, the rpsB-tsf operon encodes two essential components of translational apparatus, ribosomal protein (r-protein) S2 and elongation factor Ts. Recently, we located the promoter region of the Escherichia coli rpsB-tsf operon and demonstrated that both rpsB and tsf genes are negatively regulated by r-protein S2 at the translational level. In this paper, we present data of phylogenetic analysis showing high conservation of both the promoter signature and the structure of the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the rpsB mRNA in gamma-proteobacteria. Despite the difference in length and overall primary structure of the rpsB 5'-UTRs for various representatives of this bacterial phylum, several short regions within the 5'-UTRs appeared to be universally conserved, implying their participation in the expression regulation. Phylogenetic predictions have been experimentally confirmed. We show here that the presumable rpsB promoter regions from Yersinia pestis, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are able to drive transcription of the lacZ -reporter in E. coli and that the corresponding rpsB 5'-UTRs are subjected to autogenous repression by r-protein S2 in vivo.
TI  - [Microbiological diagnosis of bronchopulmonary colonization-infection in cystic fibrosis].
AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF), a condition produced by mutations in the gene that encodes  the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, is the most prevalent autosomal-recessive hereditary disease in caucasian populations. Among other repercussions, this defect leads to an alteration of respiratory secretions and determines a predisposition for chronic bronchopulmonary colonization-infection, which is the main driver of the high morbidity and early mortality of CF patients. Colonization by Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae is frequent in children younger than 10 years, but mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa is by far the most relevant pathogen in adults with CF and is responsible for the progressive bronchopulmonary deterioration. As a consequence of repeated, long-lasting antimicrobial treatments and deterioration of lung function, colonization by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter spp. and Burkholderia cepacia complex, is also frequent in adult CF patients. The special characteristics of the pathologic process and the microorganisms implicated in CF make it advisable to consider microbiological follow-up of chronic bronchopulmonary colonization-infection in these patients a specific diagnostic entity.
TI  - Bacteriology of postradiotherapy chronic rhinosinusitis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients and chronic rhinosinusitis.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the bacteriology of postradiotherapy chronic rhinosinusitis (postRT-CRS) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) by evaluating the aspiration materials of the maxillary sinus of patients with postRT-CRS and patients with CRS. We collected the secretions of the maxillary sinus from 30 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with postRT-CRS and 30 patients with CRS for aerobe/facultative anaerobe bacteria culture. The most common isolates in the postRT-CRS group were Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae, while those in the CRS group were Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Isolated gram-positive coccus rate in postRT-CRS patients was significantly higher than in CRS patients (62.50% compared with 30.00%, respectively; P < 0.05), and isolated gram-negative bacilli rate in postRT-CRS patients was significantly lower than in CRS patients (31.25% compared with 70.00%, respectively; P < 0.05). However, the incidence of positive cultures was not significantly different between the postRT-CRS group and the CRS group (P > 0.05). This study found that there were some differences in bacteriology between postRT-CRS and CRS. Gram-positive coccus was the predominant aerobic/facultative anaerobe pathogenic bacterium in patients with postRT-CRS, and gram-negative bacilli was predominant in CRS patients.
TI  - [Bacterial etiology of pneumonia in hospitalized children: combined detection with culture and polymerase chain reaction].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial cultures from respiratory aspirate or sputum have been the conventional diagnostic method for pneumonia, but the results of culture was often affected by early extensive use of antibiotics, sample collection and delivery. The objective of this study was to explore application of the combined detection of culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in hospitalized children with pneumonia. METHODS: Totally 187 hospitalized children with pneumonia were enrolled. The age of the patients ranged from 1 month to 10 years, 124 were male, 63 female; 175 of the patients received antibiotics treatment before admission. Deep respiratory aspirate sample from patients was cultured by Streptococcus pneumoniae selective plate, Hemophilus influenzae selective plate and conventional plate. The aspirate samples were also amplified for DNA of 14 bacteria with target enriched multiplex polymerase chain reaction (Tem-PCR) and detected with Luminex xMAP technology platform. RESULTS: The total positive rate by bacterial culture was 40.1% (75/187), of which 17.1% (24/187) were Hemophilus influenzae b, 8.6% (16/187) were Escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4.8% (9/187) were Staphylococcus aureus, 3.7% (7/187) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1.6% (3/187) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1.1% (2/187) were Acinetobacter baumannii, and 1.1% (2/187) were Enterobacter cloacae. The total positive rate by combined detection of culture and Tem-PCR assay were 78.6% (147/187), of which 28.9% (54/187) were Hemophilus influenzae b, 19.3% (36/187) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 8.6% (16/187) were Escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 5.9% (11/187) were Staphylococcus aureus, 5.9% (11/187) were Acinetobacter baumannii, 2.7% (5/187) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 1.1% (2/187) were Enterobacter cloacae. CONCLUSION: The Tem-PCR assay may increase the detection rate of Hemophilus influenzae b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. The Combined detection may increase the positive rate of bacterial pathogens in hospitalized children with pneumonia, and the results might reflect the real patterns of bacterial etiology. The Tem-PCR needs further improvement for diagnosis of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Buffering by gene duplicates: an analysis of molecular correlates and evolutionary conservation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: One mechanism to account for robustness against gene knockouts or knockdowns is through buffering by gene duplicates, but the extent and general correlates of this process in organisms is still a matter of debate. To reveal general trends of this process, we provide a comprehensive comparison of gene essentiality, duplication and buffering by duplicates across seven bacteria (Mycoplasma genitalium, Bacillus subtilis, Helicobacter pylori, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli), and four eukaryotes (Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), Caenorhabditis elegans (worm), Drosophila melanogaster (fly), Mus musculus (mouse)). RESULTS: In nine of the eleven organisms, duplicates significantly increase chances of survival upon gene deletion (P-value < or = 0.05), but only by up to 13%. Given that duplicates make up to 80% of eukaryotic genomes, the small contribution is surprising and points to dominant roles of other buffering processes, such as alternative metabolic pathways. The buffering capacity of duplicates appears to be independent of the degree of gene essentiality and tends to be higher for genes with high expression levels. For example, buffering capacity increases to 23% amongst highly expressed genes in E. coli. Sequence similarity and the number of duplicates per gene are weak predictors of the duplicate's buffering capacity. In a case study we show that buffering gene duplicates in yeast and worm are somewhat more similar in their functions than non-buffering duplicates and have increased transcriptional and translational activity. CONCLUSION: In sum, the extent of gene essentiality and buffering by duplicates is not conserved across organisms and does not correlate with the organisms' apparent complexity. This heterogeneity goes beyond what would be expected from differences in experimental approaches alone. Buffering by duplicates contributes to robustness in several organisms, but to a small extent--and the relatively large amount of buffering by duplicates observed in yeast and worm may be largely specific to these organisms. Thus, the only common factor of buffering by duplicates between different organisms may be the by-product of duplicate retention due to demands of high dosage.
TI  - Major age group-specific differences in conjunctival bacteria and evolution of antimicrobial resistance revealed by laboratory data surveillance.
AB  - PURPOSE: We hypothesized that observation and analysis of microbiological laboratory statistics from patients with suspected bacterial conjunctivitis should increase our understanding of microbiological epidemiology of the disease in age categories. We further assumed that the statistical data should expose evolution of antimicrobial resistance that may eventually have an influence on clinical decisions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed statistical data of bacterial isolates (1139 strains) and their resistance to common antibiotics from 2494 patients with suspected bacterial conjunctivitis. RESULTS: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus displayed their presence in 0- to 5-year-old children. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common in the elderly (>age 70) among whom a rapid increase in resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin (MRSA) was recognized. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the spectrum of conjunctival bacteria varies among age groups. In addition, our results confirm that a shift in antimicrobial susceptibility can be rapid and age-group specific, thus emphasizing the need for continuous surveillance of bacterial findings.
TI  - The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of meropenem in the cerebrospinal fluid of neurosurgical patients.
AB  - This study examined the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of meropenem in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Meropenem (0.5 g every 8 h) was administered by 0.5-h infusion to six neurosurgical patients. Lumbar CSF and venous blood samples were obtained at 0.5-16 h after the start of the first infusion. Drug concentrations in the CSF and plasma were analyzed pharmacokinetically and used for a Monte Carlo simulation with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data of clinical isolates in Japan. Meropenem penetrated into the CSF with the area under the drug concentration-time curve ratio of 0.10 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- SD) and the repeated infusions caused the drug concentration in the CSF to accumulate slightly. Against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli isolates, 0.5 g q8h achieved a >90% probability of pharmacodynamic target (50% of the time above MIC) attainment, and 1 g q8h was needed for a >90% probability of target (100% of the time above MIC) attainment. However, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 g q8h achieved a lower probability of target attainment. These results should help us to better elucidate the pharmacokinetics of meropenem in the cerebrospinal space while also helping us to choose the appropriate drug dosages for the management of bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Development of a single-tube polymerase chain reaction assay for the simultaneous detection of Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus spp. directly in clinical samples.
AB  - This study describes the development and evaluation of a multiplex single-tube polymerase chain reaction assay for the simultaneous detection of Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus spp. used as target species-specific or genus-specific genes. The assay enables the detection of 5 to 50 pg of bacterial DNA. The sensitivity of the assay was evaluated as 100% for P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and Streptococcus spp., and 94.3% for H. influenzae; the specificity was 100% for all 4 microorganisms (positive predictive value, 100%; negative predictive value, 98.2%). The assay permits rapid and accurate detection of these 4 microorganisms in a wide range of clinical samples such as whole blood, cerebrospinal, ear, pleural and ophthalmic fluids, as well as bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial secretions.
TI  - [Nationwide susceptibility surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antimicrobials against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--third ciproxan injection special survey (2005)].
AB  - We conducted 3 nationwide surveillance studies between 2001 and 2005 at 39 participating institutions throughout Japan according to the special survey plan to investigate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and various parenteral antimicrobials using clinical isolates from patients with severe infection during the reexamination period of parenteral CPFX. Results of the first special survey (2001) were already reported in this journal. The current third special survey (2005) was conducted at 34 participating institutions throughout Japan to determine susceptibility to CPFX and 22 various parenteral antimicrobials with the use of the microdilution method with respect to 1696 strains isolated and identified from various clinical specimens between January and June 2005. The results of CPFX in this survey were compared with those in the first and second special surveys. The minimum inhibitory concentration of CPFX at which 90% of isolates were susceptible (MIC90) ranged from < or =0.063 to 2 microg/mL for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Serratia marcescens, and Acinetobacter baumannii, revealing no marked change from results of the first and second surveys. However, the CPFX-susceptibility rate of Escherichia coli decreased in the second and third surveys compared to that in the first survey. For Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC90 of CPFX tended to increase with time. The CPFX-susceptibility rates calculated from the pneumonia breakpoint were 85.2% for P. aeruginosa and 67.9% for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. With the exception of these 2 species, major causative organisms of respiratory tract infection had susceptibility rates as high as 90% or more for CPFX, which were similar to results of the first and second special surveys. These susceptibility rates for CPFX were similar to the rates for cefozopran and imipenem. These values generally indicated favorable CPFX susceptibility testing results of major bacteria and the potent antimicrobial activity of CPFX particularly against Gram-negative bacteria. Further surveillance is required regarding the trend in susceptibility of E. coli, M. morganii, and P. aeruginosa, which tended to become less susceptible with time.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2005)].
AB  - From October 2005 to September 2006, we collected the specimen from 366 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 12 institutions in Japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. Of 411 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in infection, 406 strains were examined. The isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 70, Streptococcus pneumoniae 85, Haemophilus influenzae 78, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 46, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 14, Klebsiella pneumoniae 21, and Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 40. Of 70 S. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-susceptible S. aureus: MSSA) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) were 38 (54.3%) and 32 (45.7%) strains, respectively. Against MSSA, imipenem had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of 37 strains (97.4%) at 0.063 microg/ml or less. Against MRSA, arbekacin and vancomycin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/ml. Carbapenems showed the most potent activities against S. pneumoniae and in particular, panipenem inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. Faropenem also had a preferable activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25 microg/ml. In contrast, there were high-resistant strains (MIC: over 128 microg/ml) for erythromycin (38.1%) and clindamycin (22.6%). Against H. influenzae, levofloxacin showed the most potent activity and its MIC90 was 0.063 microg/ml or less. Meropenem showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid) and its MIC90 was 0.5 microg/ml. Against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid), arbekacin had the most potent activity and its MIC90 was 8 microg/ml. Against K. pneumoniae, cefozopran was the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. Also, all the antibacterial agents except ampicillin generally showed a potent activity against M. (B.) catarrhalis and the MIC90 of them were 2 microg/ml or less. The approximately half the number (53.6%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. Bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for 44.3% and 29.8% of all the respiratory infection, respectively. The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were S. aureus (15.4%), S. pneumoniae (23.4%), and H. influenzae (21.3%). S. aureus (25.4%) and S. pneumoniae (18.0%) also were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. Before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were S. pneumoniae (22.0%) and H. influenzae (21.4%). The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients treated with macrolides were S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, and their isolation frequencies were each 35.3%.
TI  - Procalcitonin levels in acute exacerbation of COPD admitted in ICU: a prospective cohort study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotics are recommended for severe acute exacerbation of chronic  obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) admitted to intensive care units (ICU). Serum procalcitonin (PCT) could be a useful tool for selecting patients with a lower probability of developing bacterial infection, but its measurement has not been investigated in this population. METHODS: We conducted a single center prospective cohort study in consecutive COPD patients admitted to the ICU for AECOPD between September 2005 and September 2006. Sputum samples or tracheal aspirates were tested for the presence of bacteria and viruses. PCT levels were measured at the time of admittance, six hours, and 24 hours using a sensitive immunoassay. RESULTS: Thirty nine AECOPD patients were included, 31 of which (79%) required a ventilator support at admission. The median [25%-75% interquartile range] PCT level, assessed in 35/39 patients, was: 0.096 microg/L [IQR, 0.065 to 0.178] at the time of admission, 0.113 microg/L [IQR, 0.074 to 0.548] at six hours, and 0.137 microg/L [IQR, 0.088 to 0.252] at 24 hours. The highest PCT (PCTmax) levels were less than 0.1 microg/L in 14/35 (40%) patients and more than 0.25 microg/L in 10/35 (29%) patients, suggesting low and high probability of bacterial infection, respectively. Five species of bacteria and nine species of viruses were detected in 12/39 (31%) patients. Among the four patients positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one had a PCTmax less than 0.25 microg/L and three had a PCTmax less than 0.1 microg/L. The one patient positive for Haemophilus influenzae had a PCTmax more than 0.25 microg/L. The presence or absence of viruses did not influence PCT at time of admission (0.068 vs 0.098 microg/L respectively, P = 0.80). CONCLUSION: The likelihood of bacterial infection is low among COPD patients admitted to ICU for AECOPD (40% with PCT < 0.1 microg/L) suggesting a possible inappropriate use of antibiotics. Further studies are necessary to assess the impact of a procalcitonin-based therapeutic strategy in critically ill COPD patients.
TI  - RISA-HPLC analysis of lung bacterial colonizers of cystic fibrosis children.
AB  - Microbiological analysis of sputum samples, from children affected by cystic fibrosis (CF) and showing signs of acute or chronic infections, is routinely performed by culture-dependent approaches involving selective media and biochemical tests. These identification schemes are time-consuming, and may lead to false negative results. The aim of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of a Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (RISA) coupled to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for the detection and monitoring of CF lung microbial colonizers including Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the Burkholderia cepacia complex, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Achromobacter xylosoxidans. These RISA-HPLC analyses were performed over a 10-months period on infants (below 18 months) and children that were or were not yet known to be colonised by P. aeruginosa. The RISA-HPLC profiles were found specific of the patients' microbial communities. A specific P. aeruginosa RISA-HPLC peak corresponding to 550 bp PCR products was recorded, and used to investigate P. aeruginosa persistence through time and after various therapeutic treatments. The RISA-HPLC profiles showed the CF children to be colonized by few bacterial species, and sometimes revealed peaks corresponding to bacterial species that were not detected by the selective plating approaches. Significant RISA-HPLC infra-specific variations were observed for most bacterial colonizers of CF lungs except P. aeruginosa. These species could yield as much as 5 distinct RISA-HPLC peaks, with some of these profiles being strain-specific. RISA-HPLC shows a great potential for revealing colonization by novel emerging pathogens, and for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic treatments on the global bacterial community of CF lungs.
TI  - Bacteriology in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in patients admitted to hospital.
AB  - We investigated the bacterial flora and antimicrobial sensitivity in sputum from  patients admitted to hospital with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) in order to recommend the best empirical treatment for these patients. The survey was a retrospective study of all patients admitted to Hvidovre hospital with the diagnosis AECOPD during 2004. A total of 118 patients were included. Microscopy, culture and sensitivity testing investigated their sputums. Clinical and paraclinical features were collected from the patients' files. Among the 118 patients, 59 (50%) had a positive sputum culture. The group with positive cultures had a higher blood neutrophil count (p=0.03). There were no other clinical differences between the groups with and without positive sputum culture. The majority of patients with positive sputum cultures were infected with bacteria other than S. pneumonia, mostly H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Patients with low FEV(1)<1.0 litre were more likely to be infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p=0.03). The sensitivity patterns of the bacteria showed that the majority were resistant to penicillin. If antibiotics are initiated empirically for AECOPD we recommend either cefuroxime for intravenous treatment or amoxicillin-clavulanate for oral treatment.
TI  - Long-term, low-dose azithromycin treatment reduces the incidence but increases macrolide resistance in Staphylococcus aureus in Danish CF patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since 2001, long-term, low-dose azithromycin treatment has been used  for CF patients chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the Copenhagen CF centre. Our study investigates changes in incidence of colonization with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis and changes in macrolide sensitivity in these microorganisms during azithromycin treatment. METHODS: CF patients treated continuously with azithromycin for at least 3 months were included. Results of microbiological examination, including phage typing results of S. aureus, obtained during treatment were compared to results obtained 2 years before treatment. RESULTS: 70 patients (median age 29.1 years) treated for a median of 4 years (range 0.7-5.1) were included. Before treatment, 44 patients had at least one culture positive for S. aureus compared to 25 patients during treatment (p<0.01). Mean percentage of sputum samples with growth of S. aureus decreased from 12.1% (range 0-82.6%) before treatment to 6.1% (range 0-93.2) during treatment (p<0.0006). Prevalence's of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae also decreased significantly. Fifteen of 214 isolates (7%) of S. aureus were macrolide resistant before treatment, increasing to 95 of 181 isolates (52.5%) during treatment (p<0.001). Macrolide resistant strains were found in 3 of 44 S. aureus colonized patients before treatment and in 11 of 25 patients at some time during treatment (p<0.03), all belonging to different phage types. First resistant S. aureus isolate was isolated after a median treatment duration of 1.5 years (range 0.3-2.9). No MRSA were isolated. Only 1 macrolide resistant isolate of M. catarrhalis was found during treatment. No macrolide resistance was found in H. influenzae or S. pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Long-term, low-dose treatment with azithromycin in CF patients leads to reduced prevalence of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae, but increased macrolide resistance in S. aureus. Reduction in the prevalence of S. aureus will make increasing macrolide resistance clinically insignificant in these patients.
TI  - Mucosal vaccination against bacterial respiratory infections.
AB  - Mucosal vaccination offers attractive advantages to conventional systemic vaccination, such as higher levels of antibodies and protection at the airway surface. This review gives an overview of recent experimental and clinical data on nasal, oral and sublingual vaccines against bacterial respiratory pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , Neisseria meningitidis , Moraxella catarrhalis , Bordetella pertussis , Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Subsequently, we discuss further vaccine development that opens the focus to clinical use.
TI  - Clinicobacteriological study of chronic dacryocystitis in adults.
AB  - Chronic dacryocystitis is the inflammation of lacrimal sac, frequently caused by  bacteria. Obstruction of nasolacrimal duct converts the lacrimal sac a reservoir of infection. It is a constant threat to cornea and orbital soft tissue. Moreover, it causes social embarrassment due to chronic watering from the eye. This study was conducted to find out the current clinicobacteriological profile of chronic dacryocystitis in adults. A total of 56 adult patients were selected from ophthalmology OPD. Detail history and clinical examinations were carried out. All patients underwent either dacryocystorhinostomy or dacryocystectomy. A part of the sac was collected for culture and sensitivity. This study revealed that chronic dacryocystitis is more common in females and left eye is more frequently involved than right eye. It is common among lower socioeconomic strata with habit of pond-bathing. Some form of nasal pathology like hypertrophied inferior turbinate, deviated nasal septum, nasal polyp and allergic rhinitis werefound in 19.6% of the patients. Complications of chronic dacryocystitis like conjunctivitis, corneal ulcer, acute on chronic dacryocystitis, lacrimal abscess and fistula were seen in 25.0% of these patients; 53.6% of the culture samples were positive for bacterial growth. Gram-positive organisms were most common isolate. Unlike other studies, Staphylococcus aureus (40.0%) was found to be most common Gram-positive organism, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (10.0%) and Steptococcus pneumoniae (10.0%). Among the Gram-negative organisms, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.6%) was the most common, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.6%) and Haemophilus influenzae (6.6%). Antibiotic sensitivity tests were done. Most of the organisms were resistant to penicillin. Chloramphenicol was effective against most of the Gram-positive organisms. Aminoglycosides, tobramycin in particular, was effective against Staphylococcus epidermidis. Fluoroquinolones, namely ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Effect of lidocaine gel on povidone-iodine antisepsis and microbial survival.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether the use of lidocaine gel prior to povidone-iodine antisepsis is associated with increased microbial survival. SETTING: Ophthalmology Department, Madigan Army Medical Center, Fort Lewis, Washington, USA. METHODS: A standardized suspension of Staphylococcus epidermidis was used to inoculate 5 blood agar plates that served as a control. A second group of 5 blood agar plates was inoculated, and then lidocaine gel was applied to the plates. A third group of 5 blood agar plates was inoculated, lidocaine gel was applied, and then povidone-iodine 5% was applied and allowed to cover the plates. A fourth group of 5 blood agar plates was inoculated, and then povidone-iodine 5% was allowed to cover the plates. Cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenza were tested in a similar fashion. Microbial growth was evaluated after 24 hours. RESULTS: The number of colony forming units (CFUs) was similar in the control group and the S epidermidis, S aureus, and P aeruginosa lidocaine only and lidocaine with povidone-iodine groups. In these groups, each plate grew between 200 CFUs and 300 CFUs. In the Haemophilus influenza series, the lidocaine with povidone-iodine group had fewer CFUs than the control group. In all 4 series, the povidone-iodine only group had the least amount of CFUs, ranging from 0 to 6. CONCLUSIONS: The use of lidocaine gel before application of povidone-iodine 5% resulted in decreased effectiveness of antisepsis and increased microbial survivability. The increase in microbial survivability may increase the risk for postoperative infection in ocular surgery performed under topical anesthesia.
TI  - Epidemiology of community-acquired pneumonia in older adults: a population-based  study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assessed incidence, aetiology, clinical outcomes and risk factors for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in older adults. METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study that included 11,241 community-dwelling individuals aged 65 years or more, who were followed between 2002 and 2005 in the region of Tarragona, Spain. Primary endpoints were all-cause CAP (hospitalised and outpatient) and 30-day mortality after the diagnosis. All cases were radiographically proved and validated by checking clinical records. RESULTS: Incidence rate of overall CAP was 14 cases per 1000 person-years (10.5 and 3.5 for hospitalised and outpatient cases, respectively). Incidence was almost three-fold higher among immunocompromised patients (30.9 per 1000) than among immunocompetent subjects (11.6 per 1000). Maximum incidences were observed among patients with chronic lung disease and long-term corticosteroid therapy (46.5 and 40.1 cases per 1000 person-years, respectively). Overall 30-day case-fatality rate was 12.7% (2% in cases managed as outpatient and 15% in hospitalised patients). Among 358 patients with an aetiological work-up, a total of 142 pathogens were found (single pathogen in 121 cases and mixed pathogens in 10 cases). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen (49%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15%), Chlamydia pneumoniae (9%) and Haemophilus influenzae (6%). In multivariable analysis, the variables most strongly associated with increasing risk of CAP were history of hospitalisation for CAP in the previous 2 years and presence of any chronic lung disease. CONCLUSIONS: CAP remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults. Incidence rates in this study largely doubled prior rates reported in Southern European regions.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic target attainment analysis of biapenem in adult patients: a dosing strategy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) target attainment analysis  to build a dosing strategy for biapenem in adult patients has not been conducted. METHODS: A total of 321 plasma concentration samples from 68 adult patients (1-6 samples per patient) were assayed biologically and chromatographically, and used for a population PK modeling and Monte Carlo simulation to assess the probability of attaining the PK-PD target (40% of the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration). RESULTS: The population PK model was based on the standard two-compartment model, and creatinine clearance (Cl(cr)) was the most significant covariate that affected the drug clearance. The Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that the dosages up to 600 mg Q12H (0.5-h infusions) achieved a PK-PD target attainment probability of > or =90%, which varied with Cl(cr) of the patient and susceptibility of the tested bacterium; however, higher dosage with prolonged infusion time (600 mg Q8H, 3 h infusion) was required for a high probability against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae isolates in the case of Cl(cr) = 90 ml/min. CONCLUSION: These results provide guidance for constructing a PK-PD-based strategy for tailoring biapenem regimens in adult patients.
TI  - The first nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy. Part 1: a general view of antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  - The Japanese Society of Chemotherapy (JSC) conducted the first nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens during the period from January to August 2006. With the cooperation of 32 medical institutions throughout Japan, a total of 924 strains belonging to seven clinically relevant bacterial species were collected from adult patients with well-diagnosed respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the 887 evaluable strains (205 Staphylococcus aureus, 200 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 9 Streptococcus pyogenes, 165 Haemophilus influenzae, 91 Moraxella catarrhalis, 74 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 143 Pseudomonas aeruginosa) to 42 antibacterial agents was conducted at the Central Laboratory of the Research Center for Anti-infective Drugs of the Kitasato Institute, according to recommendations issued by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The antibacterial agents employed were 25 beta-lactams, three aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including one azalide and one ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, five fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone. The incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was 63.4%, and the incidences of penicillin-intermediately resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP) and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) were 35.0% and 4.0%, respectively. Among H. influenzae, 21.2% of the strains were found to be beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediately resistant (BLNAI), 29.1% to be beta-lactamase-nonproducing ABPC-resistant (BLNAR), and 4.8% to be beta-lactamaseproducing ABPC-resistant (BLPAR) strains. The incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae was 2.7% (2 of 74 strains). Three (2.1%) of the 143 P. aeruginosa strains were found to be metallo-beta-lactamaseproducing, including 1 (0.7%) multidrug-resistant strain. Through the nationwide surveillance, we obtained fundamental antimicrobial susceptibility data of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens in adult RTI to various antibacterial agents. These data will be a useful reference for future periodic surveillance studies, as well as for investigations to control antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Transcription of foreign DNA in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Propagation of heterologous DNA in E. coli host cells is central to molecular biology. DNA constructs are often engineered for expression of recombinant protein in E. coli, but the extent of incidental transcription arising from natural regulatory sequences in cloned DNA remains underexplored. Here, we have used programmable microarrays and RT-PCR to measure, comprehensively, the transcription of H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa, and human DNA propagating in E. coli as bacterial artificial chromosomes. We find evidence that at least half of all H. influenzae genes are transcribed in E. coli. Highly transcribed genes are principally involved in energy metabolism, and their proximal promoter regions are significantly enriched with E. coli sigma(70) (also known as RpoD) binding sites. H. influenzae genes acquired from an ancient bacteriophage Mu insertion are also highly transcribed. Compared with H. influenzae, a smaller proportion of P. aeruginosa genes are transcribed in E. coli, and in E. coli there is punctuated transcription of human DNA. The presence of foreign DNA in E. coli disturbs the host transcriptional profile, with expression of the E. coli phage shock protein operon and the flagellar gene cluster being particularly strongly up-regulated. While cross-species transcriptional activation is expected to be enabling for horizontal gene transfer in bacteria, incidental expression of toxic genes can be problematic for DNA cloning. Ongoing characterization of cross-expression will help inform the design of biosynthetic gene clusters and synthetic microbial genomes.
TI  - Proanthocyanidins: target compounds as antibacterial agents.
AB  - Grape seeds accumulate in huge quantities as byproduct during wine production and are therefore a cheap source for pharmacologically active agents. However, studies prove poor antibacterial activity, and results of analyses are sometimes contradictory. The aim of this study was, thus, to determine the antibacterial activity of grape seed extracts with special focus on the chromatographic characterization of active fractions. In the course of these investigations, extraction protocols were optimized so that microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) guaranteed highest preconcentration efficiency. Proanthocyanidins, monomeric flavonoid aglycones, as well as some of their glycosides could be identified within yielded extracts via high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). By that means the coherence number of possible isomers of procyanidins was approximated by a newly developed equation. As far as antibacterial activity determined via screening tests is concerned, the extracts generally have been found to be positively responsive toward 10 different gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria strains. After fractionation of the raw extracts, proanthocyanidins P2, P3, P4 and gallate esters P2G and P3G (P = proanthocyanidin consisting of catechin and epicatechin units, n = oligomerization degree, G = gallate ester) were determined as active antibacterial agents toward 10 different pathogens. Only moderate activity was found for monomeric flavonoid fractions.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic target attainment analysis of cefozopran in Japanese adult patients.
AB  - This study aimed to perform a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) target attainment analysis to create a dosing strategy for cefozopran in Japanese adult patients. A total of 145 plasma concentration samples from 32 adult patients were used for a population pharmacokinetic modeling and Monte Carlo simulation to assess the probability of attaining the PK-PD target (70% of the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration for the bacterium). The final population pharmacokinetic model was based on a two-compartment model, and creatinine clearance (Cl(cr)) and body weight (BW) were the most significant covariates: Cl(l/h) = 0.0263 x Cl(cr) + 1.49, V (c)(l) = 0.185 x BW(0.931), Q(l/h) = 4.55, V (p)(l) = 5.86, where Cl is the clearance, V (c) is the volume of distribution of the central compartment, Q is the intercompartmental clearance, and V (p) is the volume of distribution of the peripheral compartment. The Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that 1 g q 12 h achieved a PK-PD target attainment probability of > or =85% against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. However, against Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 1 g q 8 h and (2 g, 1 g, 1 g) q 8 h were required to achieve a high probability, which value varied with the Cl(cr) and BW of the patient. These results provide a PK-PD-based strategy for tailoring cefozopran regimens in Japanese adult patients.
TI  - [Nosocomial infections in pediatric patients following cardiac surgery].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nosocomial infection (NI) is a possible complication in patients who undergo cardiac surgery, and represents an important cause of morbidity and mortality. This study was undertaken to determine the NI rate, main risk factors, and microbial spectrum in a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for this group of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective review was performed, including all patients admitted to the PICU after cardiac surgery between December 2003 and November 2004. NI was defined according to Centers for Disease Control criteria. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were included. Sixteen patients (23.2 %) acquired at least one episode of NI. The NI rate was 4.9 per 100 patient-days. The most common NI was pneumonia, followed by urinary tract infection. There were no episodes of sepsis. No patients died from infectious causes. The main aetiological organism was Haemophilus influenzae, associated with 41.6 % of pneumonias, and followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. No multiresistant organisms were isolated. There was a statistically significant association between the duration of use of external devices (mechanical ventilation, urinary and central venous catheterization) and development of NI. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive monitoring and support devices are the main risk factors for NI. Based on our data, we suggest early removal of these. Presumed NI should be diagnosed according standard criteria before starting antibiotic therapy, and treatment modified depending on culture results.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DC-159a, a new fluoroquinolone, against 1,149 recently  collected clinical isolates.
AB  - The activity of DC-159a, a novel orally administered fluorinated quinolone, was evaluated by reference broth microdilution or agar dilution methods against 1,149 recently collected clinical isolates from five continents. Against pathogens associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CA-RTIs), the MIC(90)s were 0.12 microg/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.015 to 0.03 microg/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, 0.03 microg/ml for Moraxella catarrhalis, and 0.12 microg/ml for beta-hemolytic streptococci. Similarly, DC-159a was potent against various types of staphylococci (MIC(90) range, 0.03 to 2 microg/ml), Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90), 4 microg/ml), wild-type isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MIC(90) range, 0.06 to 2 microg/ml), wild-type Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC(90), 2 microg/ml), and Acinetobacter spp. (MIC(90), 0.12 microg/ml). Fluoroquinolone-nonsusceptible organism subsets usually had elevated DC-159a MICs, but the MICs were often two- to fourfold lower than those of levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. In conclusion, DC-159a appears to possess a balanced broad spectrum of activity that exceeds the activities of the currently marketed fluoroquinolones, especially against pathogens that cause CA-RTIs.
TI  - A one-year prospective study of infectious etiology in patients hospitalized with acute exacerbations of COPD and concomitant pneumonia.
AB  - AIM: This study assessed the infectious etiology of patients hospitalized for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) with concomitant pneumonia. METHODS: Patients admitted to medical wards in an acute hospital were recruited prospectively from May 1, 2004 to April 30, 2005. Sputum culture, blood culture, paired serology, and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) viral culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies were performed. Spirometry was assessed in stable phase at 2-3 months post-hospital discharge. RESULTS: Seventy eight subjects were admitted for AECOPD with concomitant pneumonia. The mean (SD) age was 77.1 (7.5) years, with FEV(1) of 41.5 (20.8)% predicted normal. Overall, an infectious etiology could be established in 48.7% of the subjects. Among the 71 subjects with sputum collected, 40.8% had positive bacterial culture. The commonest bacteria identified were Streptococcus pneumoniae (8[11.3%]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7[9.9%]) and Haemophilus influenzae (7[9.9%]). Among the 66 subjects with NPA collected, 9.0 and 12.2% had positive viral culture and PCR results, respectively. The commonest viruses identified by NPA PCR were influenza A (4[6.1%] subjects) and rhinovirus (2[3.0%]). Paired serology was positive in 4.4%. Patients on high dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (>1000 mcg beclomethasone-equivalent/day) had a higher rate of positive sputum bacterial culture than those on low-medium dose of ICS (50.0% vs 18.2%, p=0.02). CONCLUSION: An infectious etiology could be established in about half of patients hospitalized with AECOPD and concomitant pneumonia. The majority of identifiable causes were bacterial. Patients on high dose ICS might have impaired airway defense as reflected by the higher rate of positive sputum culture.
TI  - Ghrelin treatment suppresses neutrophil-dominant inflammation in airways of patients with chronic respiratory infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Persistent neutrophil influx into the airways is a characteristic of  chronic respiratory infection and contributes to the deterioration of pulmonary function. Ghrelin is a novel growth hormone (GH)-releasing peptide with potential anti-inflammatory activities. The present study investigated whether or not ghrelin can reduce neutrophil-dominant inflammation in airways of patients with chronic respiratory infection. POPULATIONS AND METHODS: Synthesized ghrelin was administered intravenously for 3 weeks to 7 cachectic patients with chronic respiratory infection to confirm ghrelin's effects on airway inflammation and nutrition state. Neutrophils, neutrophil products and inflammatory cytokines in sputum were used as markers of airway inflammation. Changes in serum protein levels were also evaluated along with plasma catecholamine levels. Exercise tolerance was assessed by measuring 6-min walking distance before and after 3 weeks of ghrelin treatment. RESULTS: Three-week ghrelin administration decreased neutrophil density and inflammatory cytokine levels in sputum, reduced plasma norepinephrine level, and increased body weight, serum protein level, and 6-min walking distance. CONCLUSIONS: Ghrelin administration suppressed airway inflammation by decreasing neutrophil accumulation in lungs and increased body weight. These findings may contribute to the development of supportive therapies for patients with refractory chronic respiratory infection.
TI  - [Evaluation of antibiotic resistance in material isolated from the middle ear in  children with acute otitis media not responding to standard antibiotic treatment].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: An increasing antibiotic resistance of pathogens is the main cause  of failures during treatment of acute otitis media (AOM). Aim. A qualitative and quantitative bacteriological analysis of material isolated from the middle ear in children with AOM treated with antibiotic without improvement. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a prospective study performed in Department of Otolaryngology in Warsaw between 2005 and 2007. An examined group consisted of 72 children aged from 6 months to 17 years, admitted to Department of Otolaryngology because of failure of antibiotic therapy of AOM, severe course of this disease and complications of AOM or persistent AOM. In all children were performed the myryngotomy and/or ventilatory tube insertion and/or mastoidectomy and the material from the middle ear was collected to bacteriological examinations. RESULTS: The positive cultures were obtained in 63.9% patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae (40.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (14%), Haemophilus influenzae (10.5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.5%) were the most frequently found bacteria in the culture of middle ear. beta-lactamase producing bacteria were isolated in 12 children (21.1% of isolated bacteria). Staphylococcus aureus (7 children, 12.3% of positive cultures) was the bacteria most frequent producing beta-lactamase. The most of organisms were susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanate--56.1% of bacteria from the middle ear. The most of organisms presented resistance to penicillin--63.9% of bacteria from the middle ear. CONCLUSIONS: Microbiological identifications and antibiotic resistance determination of pathogens isolated from the middle ear in children with AOM not responding to empirical antibiotic treatment gives possibility of the choice of an effective antibiotic and its proper dosage. The pathogenic bacterial flora isolated from the middle ear in children with AOM shows evidence to accomplishing changes in the most frequent pathogens causing acute otitis media in children.
TI  - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for rapid identification of nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria isolated from sputum samples from cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - The accurate and rapid identification of bacteria isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is critical in epidemiological studies, during intrahospital outbreaks, for patient treatment, and for determination of therapeutic options. While the most common organisms isolated from sputum samples are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae, in recent decades an increasing fraction of CF patients has been colonized by other nonfermenting (NF) gram-negative rods, such as Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) bacteria, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Ralstonia pickettii, Acinetobacter spp., and Achromobacter spp. In the present study, we developed a novel strategy for the rapid identification of NF rods based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in combination with artificial neural networks (ANNs). A total of 15 reference strains and 169 clinical isolates of NF gram-negative bacteria recovered from sputum samples from 150 CF patients were used in this study. The clinical isolates were identified according to the guidelines for clinical microbiology practices for respiratory tract specimens from CF patients; and particularly, BCC bacteria were further identified by recA-based PCR followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis with HaeIII, and their identities were confirmed by recA species-specific PCR. In addition, some strains belonging to genera different from BCC were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A standardized experimental protocol was established, and an FTIR spectral database containing more than 2,000 infrared spectra was created. The ANN identification system consisted of two hierarchical levels. The top-level network allowed the identification of P. aeruginosa, S. maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Acinetobacter spp., R. pickettii, and BCC bacteria with an identification success rate of 98.1%. The second-level network was developed to differentiate the four most clinically relevant species of BCC, B. cepacia, B. multivorans, B. cenocepacia, and B. stabilis (genomovars I to IV, respectively), with a correct identification rate of 93.8%. Our results demonstrate the high degree of reliability and strong potential of ANN-based FTIR spectrum analysis for the rapid identification of NF rods suitable for use in routine clinical microbiology laboratories.
TI  - [Nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2006].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 876 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1764 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 198 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2006 was measured. The results were as follows; 1. MEPM was more active than the other carbapenem antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae. MEPM was also active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. 2. As for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, all of the MEPM-resistant strains were resistant to imipenem (IPM). MEPM showed low cross-resistant rate both againt IPM-resistant P. aeruginosa (41.8%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (33.3%). 3. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 4.3% (6 strains) in Escherichia coli, 1.1% (1 strain) in Citrobacter freundii, 21.7% (5 strains) in Citrobacter koseri, 3.1% (4 strains) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3.3% (3 strains) in Enterobacter cloacae, 0.8% (1 strain) in Serratia marcescens, and 4.9% (2 strains) in Providencia spp. The proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 3.1% (10 strains) in P. aeruginosa. 4. Of all species tested, there were no species, which MIC90 of MEPM was more than 4-fold higher than those in our previous study. Therefore, there is almost no significant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem at present, 11 years after available for commercial use.
TI  - [Microbial sensitivity to ambazone (Faringosept) in pharyngeal samples from patients with acute infections of the upper respiratory tract].
AB  
TI  - Biofilms with fungi in chronic rhinosinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Demonstrate that bacterial biofilm in sinus mucosal samples from patients with eosinophilic mucin chronic rhinosinusitis (EMCRS) and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS) contains fungal elements; identify specific organisms in the biofilm. METHODS: Mucosa samples from 11 patients undergoing sinus surgery were collected. Patients were classified as having AFRS, EMCRS, or chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) based on histopathologic findings. Three mucosal samples from controls were also collected. Samples were stained with specific bacterial fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) DNA probes (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumophilia, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and a general pan-fungal FISH probe. The samples were analyzed for bacterial biofilm ultrastructure and fungal elements using epifluorescent microscopy. RESULTS: Bacterial biofilm was demonstrated in 9/11 samples and 2/3 controls. H. influenzae was the predominant biofilm present. There was a trend showing more fungal elements in AFRS and EMCRS biofilms than in CRS and controls. CONCLUSION: This is a preliminary study demonstrating fungal elements within sinus mucosal biofilm and demonstrating biofilm in AFRS.
TI  - Abscess of residual lobe after pulmonary resection for lung cancer.
AB  - Abscess of the residual lobe after lobectomy is a rare but potentially lethal complication. Between January 1975 and December 2006, 1,460 patients underwent elective pulmonary lobectomy for non-small-cell lung cancer at our institution. Abscess of the residual lung parenchyma occurred in 5 (0.3%) cases (4 bilobectomies and 1 lobectomy). Postoperative chest radiography showed incomplete expansion and consolidation of residual lung parenchyma. Flexible bronchoscopy revealed persistent bronchial occlusion from purulent secretions and/or bronchial collapse. Computed tomography in 3 patients demonstrated lung abscess foci. Surgical treatment included completion right pneumonectomy in 3 patients and a middle lobectomy in one. Complications after repeat thoracotomy comprised contralateral pneumonia and sepsis in 1 patient. Residual lobar abscess after lobectomy should be suspected in patients presenting with fever, leukocytosis, bronchial obstruction and lung consolidation despite antibiotic therapy, physiotherapy and bronchoscopy. Computed tomography is mandatory for early diagnosis. Surgical resection of the affected lobe is recommended.
TI  - The antibacterial and antifungal properties of trappin-2 (pre-elafin) do not depend on its protease inhibitory function.
AB  - Trappin-2 (also known as pre-elafin) is an endogenous inhibitor of neutrophil serine proteases and is involved in the control of excess proteolysis, especially in inflammatory events, along with the structurally related secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor. Secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor has been shown to have antibacterial and antifungal properties, whereas recent data indicate that trappin-2 has antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. In the present study, we tested the antibacterial properties of trappin-2 towards other respiratory pathogens. We found that trappin-2, at concentrations of 5-20 microm, has significant activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis and the pathogenic fungi Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans, in addition to P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. A similar antimicrobial activity was observed with trappin-2 A62D/M63L, a trappin-2 variant that has lost its antiprotease properties, indicating that trappin-2 exerts its antibacterial effects through mechanisms independent from its intrinsic antiprotease capacity. Furthermore, the antibacterial and antifungal activities of trappin-2 were sensitive to NaCl and heparin, demonstrating that its mechanism of action is most probably dependent on its cationic nature. This enables trappin-2 to interact with the membranes of target organisms and disrupt them, as shown by our scanning electron microscopy analyses. Thus, trappin-2 not only provides an antiprotease shield, but also may play an important role in the innate defense of the human lungs and mucosae against pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - [Analysis on variance of common pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance in children in Chengdu area from 2001 to 2006].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the variance and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria isolated from children with infectious diseases seen between 2001 and 2006 in Chengdu area. METHODS: A total of 2888 pathogenic bacterial strains isolated from children in Chengdu Children's Hospital from 2001 to 2006 were analyzed. Tests were performed according to the guidelines of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) of the United States. RESULT: (1) Of the 2888 strains, 1845 (63.9%) were Gram negative bacteria. The main pathogenic bacteria included Escherichia coli (Ec, 718 strain, 24.9%), Hemophilus (H, 476 strain, 16.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp, 412 strain, 14.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp, 369 strain, 12.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (Sa, 353 strain, 12.2%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (Se, 278 strain, 9.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa, 146 strain, 5.1%) and other non-zymocyte (Onz, 136 strain, 4.7%). (2) The common pathogens found in blood specimen were 158 strain, which included Se (78 strain, 49.4%), Ec (23 strain, 14.6%), Kp (17 strain, 10.8%), Sa (14 strain, 8.9%), Onz (14 strain, 8.9%), Sp (7 strain, 4.4%) and Pa (5 strain, 3.2%). (3) The number of common pathogens isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infection was 2018, including Ec (441 strains, 21.9%), H (430 strains, 21.3%), Sp (368 strains, 18.2%), Kp (253 strains, 12.5%), Sa (207 strains, 10.3%), Se (149 strains, 7.3%), Pa (97 strains, 4.8%) and Onz (73 strains, 3.6%). (4) There were 120 strains of common pathogens isolated from urine specimens, including Ec (78 strains, 65%), Kp (25 strains, 20.8%), Onz (7 strains, 5.8%), Pa (5 strains, 4.2%) and Se (5 strains, 4.2%). (5) There were 497 strains of common pathogens found in pus specimens, including Ec 167 strains, (33.6%), Sa (126 strains, 25.4%), Se (46 strains, 9.3%), H (44 strains, 8.9%), Onz (37 stains, 7.4%), Kp (31 strains, 6.2%), Sp (26 strains, 5.2%) and Pa (20 strain, 4.0%). The trend of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics deteriorated. The proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 6.7% and the methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) rate was 20% in 2001 - 2003. The total proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase stains (ESBL(S)) in Ec and Kp was 21.8%, and the rate of beta-lactamase production stains of Hemophilus influenzae (Hi) was 19.4% in 2001 - 2003.The proportion of MRSA was 17.2% and the MRCNS rate was 70.2%, the total proportion of ESBL(S) in Ec and Kp was 43.8%, and the rate of beta-lactamase producing stains of Hi was 39.7% in 2004 - 2006. CONCLUSION: The distribution of common pathogenic bacteria seen in Chengdu Children's Hospital has changed and the trend of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics deteriorated in recent three years. Regionally monitoring the changes in pathogenic bacteria and the trend of drug resistance to antibiotics is paramount in guiding the pediatric clinical treatment.
TI  - Subdural empyema in children--20-year experience in a medical center.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Subdural empyema (SDE) is a serious neurological condition in children and adults. Although otorhinolaryngeal infections are regarded as the most important predisposing factors in the literature, this has not been our experience. This study reviewed clinical data on pediatric patients with SDE at our institution over the last 20 years. METHODS: Charts of children hospitalized in Mackay Memorial Hospital from 1985 to 2005, with a final diagnosis of SDE were reviewed. Gender, predisposing factors, symptoms and signs, bacteriologic data, diagnostic work-up, treatment procedures, and outcome were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 31 patients were enrolled. Twenty seven of them (87.1%) were below the age of one year. The male-to-female ratio was 1.21. Only 3 patients (9.7%) had prior otorhinolaryngeal infections; 6 patients (19.4%) had SDE following head trauma or surgery. The leading clinical manifestations were fever (96.8%), seizure (70.1%), and focal neurological signs (58.1%). The most common pathogens included Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.1%), group B Streptococcus (12.9%), Haemophilus influenzae type b (12.9%), Salmonella spp. (12.9%), Escherichia coli (9.7%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.7%). Cerebrospinal fluid leukocyte counts and protein levels were usually high and the glucose levels were usually low. SDE was first suspected or found via brain sonography in 9 infants. Nine patients (29.0%) received only medical treatment for SDE. Three patients (9.7%) died--all were infected by S. pneumoniae. Twelve patients (38.7%) recovered without neurological sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: In the past 20 years, most of our cases of pediatric SDE occurred in infancy, and only one-tenth of them had prior otorhinolaryngeal infections. Brain sonography could be a helpful tool for early diagnosis of SDE in infancy.
TI  - [Physiopathology of cystic fibrosis and of infections associated to this disease].
AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common lethal inherited diseases in the caucasian population. The hope of understanding the physiopathology of CF appeared after identification of the gene which encodes CF. The alteration in CFTR protein breaks the hydric balance of the mucosal secretions, producing mucus with increased viscosity. Broncho-pulmonary infections are constant encountered because of the stasis of the mucus. The most common bacterial pathogens in the sputum of patients with MV are Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia. MV remains a severe, incurable disease, but the evolution is getting better because of the improvements of care methods.
TI  - Identification of an inhibitor of the MurC enzyme, which catalyzes an essential step in the peptidoglycan precursor synthesis pathway.
AB  - The pathway for synthesis of the peptidoglycan precursor UDP-N-acetylmuramyl pentapeptide is essential in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This pathway has been exploited in the recent past to identify potential new antibiotics as inhibitors of one or more of the Mur enzymes. In the present study, a high-throughput screen was employed to identify potential inhibitors of the Escherichia coli MurC (UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid:L-alanine ligase), the first of four paralogous amino acid-adding enzymes. Inhibition of ATP consumed during the MurC reaction, using an adaptation of a kinase assay format, identified a number of potential inhibitory chemotypes. After nonspecific inhibition testing and chemical attractiveness were assessed, C-1 emerged as a compound for further characterization. The inhibition of MurC by this compound was confirmed in both a kinetic-coupled enzyme assay and a direct nuclear magnetic resonance product detection assay. C-1 was found to be a low micromolar inhibitor of the E. coli MurC reaction, with preferential inhibition by one of two enantiomeric forms. Experiments indicated that it was a competitive inhibitor of ATP binding to the MurC enzyme. Further work with MurC enzymes from several bacterial sources revealed that while the compound was equally effective at inhibiting MurC from genera (Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae) closely related to E. coli, MurC enzymes from more distant Gram-negative species such as Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baylyi, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not inhibited.
TI  - Tannerella forsythia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in subgingival bacterial samples  from parous women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information on the subgingival microbiota in parous women is limited. The present study assessed 74 bacterial species at periodontal sites. METHODS: Subgingival bacterial plaque was collected from women > or =6 months after delivery. Bacteria were assessed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Gingivitis was defined as > or =20% of sites with bleeding on probing (BOP), and periodontitis was defined as radiographic evidence of bone loss and probing depths > or =5.0 mm. RESULTS: A total of 197 women (mean age: 29.4 +/- 6.8 years; range: 18 to 46 years) were included in the study. Gingivitis was identified in 82 of 138 subjects without evidence of periodontitis (59.4%). Periodontitis was found in 59 women (32%). Higher bacterial levels in subjects with gingivitis compared to those without evidence of gingivitis were observed for Actinomyces neuii, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Corynebacterium pseudogenitalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella bivia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P <0.001 for each). Higher bacterial levels in subjects with periodontitis compared to those without periodontitis (BOP not accounted for) were found for 32 of 79 species (P <0.001) including Lactobacillus iners, Haemophilus influenzae, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Prevotella bivia, P. aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. Binary univariate logistic regression analysis identified that P. aeruginosa (P <0.001) and T. forsythia (P <0.05) were independently predictive of periodontal status. The odds ratio of having P. aeruginosa at levels > or =1 x 10(5) in the sample and periodontitis was 3.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 5.9; P <0.001). CONCLUSION: In addition to P. gingivalis and T. forsythia, a diverse microbiota, including P. aeruginosa, P. endodontalis, P. bivia, and S. aureus, can be found in subgingival plaque samples from women of child-bearing age with periodontitis.
TI  - [Distribution and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria in children with lower respiratory tract infection from Chengdu Children's Hospital between 2001 and 2006].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and the changes of drug resistance of  common pathogenic bacteria in children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) of Chengdu. METHODS: Sputum specimens for bacterial cultures were collected from children with LRTL who had been admitted to the Chengdu Children's Hospital between 2001 and 2006. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed after bacteria had been identified. The results between 2001 and 2003 were compared with those between 2004 and 2006. RESULTS: Hemophilus (24.3%) was the most common pathogenic bacteria for LRTI in children between 2001 and 2003, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (18.8%), Escherichia coli (18.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.0%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.4%) and other non-zymocyte (4.4%). Escherichia coli (23.7%) was the most common pathogenic bacteria in children with LRTL between 2004 and 2006, followed by Hemophilus (19.8%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (17.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.3%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.0%) and other non-zymocyte (3.2%). Compared with the years of 2001-2003, the rate of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics between 2004 and 2006 increased: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 18.0% vs 8.8%, Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci 70.5% vs 18.1%, Extended-spetrum beta-lactamase stains 44.4% vs 22.6%, and beta-lactamase production stains of Hemophilus influenzae 40.2% vs 20.1%. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of common pathogenic bacteria of children with LRTL has changed and the rate of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics is increasing in recent three years in Chengdu.
TI  - Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in intensive care units in Canada: results of the Canadian National Intensive Care Unit (CAN-ICU) study, 2005-2006.
AB  - Between 1 September 2005 and 30 June 2006, 19 medical centers collected 4,180 isolates recovered from clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (ICUs) in Canada. The 4,180 isolates were collected from 2,292 respiratory specimens (54.8%), 738 blood specimens (17.7%), 581 wound/tissue specimens (13.9%), and 569 urinary specimens (13.6%). The 10 most common organisms isolated from 79.5% of all clinical specimens were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (16.4%), Escherichia coli (12.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.0%), Haemophilus influenzae (7.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci/Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.5%), Enterococcus spp. (6.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.8%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (4.7%), and Enterobacter cloacae (3.9%). MRSA made up 22.3% (197/884) of all S. aureus isolates (90.9% of MRSA were health care-associated MRSA, and 9.1% were community-associated MRSA), while vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) made up 6.7% (11/255) of all enterococcal isolates (88.2% of VRE had the vanA genotype). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae occurred in 3.5% (19/536) and 1.8% (4/224) of isolates, respectively. All 19 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were PCR positive for CTX-M, with bla CTX-M-15 occurring in 74% (14/19) of isolates. For MRSA, no resistance against daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin was observed, while the resistance rates to other agents were as follows: clarithromycin, 89.9%; clindamycin, 76.1%; fluoroquinolones, 90.1 to 91.8%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 11.7%. For E. coli, no resistance to amikacin, meropenem, and tigecycline was observed, while resistance rates to other agents were as follows: cefazolin, 20.1%; cefepime, 0.7%; ceftriaxone, 3.7%; gentamicin, 3.0%; fluoroquinolones, 21.1%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 1.9%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 24.8%. Resistance rates for P. aeruginosa were as follows: amikacin, 2.6%; cefepime, 10.2%; gentamicin, 15.2%; fluoroquinolones, 23.8 to 25.5%; meropenem, 13.6%; and piperacillin-tazobactam, 9.3%. A multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype (resistance to three or more of the following drugs: cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, amikacin or gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin) occurred frequently in P. aeruginosa (12.6%) but uncommonly in E. coli (0.2%), E. cloacae (0.6%), or K. pneumoniae (0%). In conclusion, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), E. coli, P. aeruginosa, H. influenzae, Enterococcus spp., S. pneumoniae, and K. pneumoniae are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in Canadian ICUs. A MDR phenotype is common for P. aeruginosa isolates in Canadian ICUs.
TI  - Airway epithelial control of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Defective expression or function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) underlies the hypersusceptibility of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients to chronic airway infections, particularly with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CFTR is involved in the specific recognition of P. aeruginosa, thereby contributing to effective innate immunity and proper hydration of the airway surface layer (ASL). In CF, the airway epithelium fails to initiate an appropriate innate immune response, allowing the microbe to bind to mucus plugs that are then not properly cleared because of the dehydrated ASL. Recent studies have identified numerous CFTR-dependent factors that are recruited to the epithelial plasma membrane in response to infection and that are needed for bacterial clearance, a process that is defective in CF patients hypersusceptible to infection with this organism.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia: impact of organisms on clinical resolution and medical resources utilization.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical resolution of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) determines the duration of treatment and mechanical ventilation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of organisms and their susceptibility to treatment on outcomes. METHODS: Prospective observational study in three teaching ICUs. Sixty episodes of VAP with appropriate therapy (Haemophilus influenzae, 15 episodes; methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus [MSSA], 15 episodes; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 15 episodes; and methicillin-resistant S aureus [MRSA], 15 episodes), and 30 episodes with initial inappropriate therapy, all due to P aeruginosa, were compared. The main outcome measures were clinical resolution variables and, in survivors, length of mechanical ventilation after VAP onset. RESULTS: A significant delay in the resolution of hypoxemia was observed in VAP episodes due to MRSA and P aeruginosa with inappropriate antibiotic therapy (IAT) (median time to resolution, 10 and 8 days, respectively) when compared with the remaining pathogens (median time to resolution, 2 days). A multiple regression model, adjusted for disease severity, confirmed the delayed clinical resolution for MRSA and P aeruginosa with IAT. Similar associations were documented for defervescence. Among survivors, the median duration of mechanical ventilation after VAP onset was significantly longer for MRSA (17 days) and P aeruginosa IAT (11 days) when compared with episodes due to H influenzae or MSSA (6 days). Multiple regression analysis, adjusted for disease severity, confirmed that MRSA required significantly (R(2) = 0.132; p < 0.01) longer respiratory support than other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: When treated promptly, the resolution of VAP due to MSSA, H influenzae, and P aeruginosa was comparable. The resolution of MRSA VAP, regardless of the appropriateness of initial antibiotic therapy, was associated with longer respiratory support.
TI  - Effects of systemic antibiotic therapy on bacterial persistence in the respiratory tract of mechanically ventilated patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial respiratory tract colonization predisposes critically ill patients to intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired infections. It is unclear to what extent systemic antibiotics affect colonization persistence. Persistence of respiratory tract colonization, and the effects of systemic antibiotics hereon, were determined in a cohort of ICU patients. DESIGN: Clinical and microbiological data were collected from 715 admitted mechanically ventilated ICU patients with bacterial growth documented in respiratory tract samples. First day of colonization, persistence of colonization and antibiotic effects hereon were analyzed for six groups of pathogens: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Systemic antibiotics were grouped into 'effective' and 'ineffective' antibiotics, based on in-vitro susceptibility data for the relevant bacteria. The effects of antibiotics were quantified as relative risk (RR) of bacterial persistence in the absence of effective antibiotics. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Persistence of colonization differed significantly between pathogens, ranging from 4 days (median) for H. influenzae and Strep. pneumoniae to 8 days for P. aeruginosa. Systemic antibiotics were administered on 7,102 (61%) of patient days. Antibiotic use was associated with non-persistence for all pathogens, except Acinetobacter species and P. aeruginosa. RR for non-persistence (as compared to ineffective or no antibiotics) ranged from 3.1 (95% CI 1.4-6.6) for H. influenzae to 0.5 (0.3-1.0) for Acinetobacter species. CONCLUSIONS: In mechanically ventilated patients, persistence dynamics of bacterial respiratory tract colonization, and the effects of (in-vitro) effective antibiotics hereon, are pathogen-specific.
TI  - Microbiological surveillance and parenteral antibiotic use in a critical care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate parenteral antibiotic utilization and bacterial resistance patterns in a critical care unit (CrCU). DESIGN: Descriptive, prospective audit of infection site, culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test results, parenteral antibiotic usage and duration, total antibiotic acquisition costs, and length of stay. SETTING: A 17-bed medical-surgical CrCU in a tertiary care teaching hospital in Metropolitan Toronto. PATIENTS: Two hundred and fifty-eight patients admitted to the CrCU between May 1995 and April 1996 who received antimicrobial therapy. RESULTS: The most frequently prescribed antibiotics were cefazolin (47%, 1098 g), gentamicin (33%,141 g) and ceftriaxone (20%, 255 g). The most common indications for antimicrobial therapy included surgical prophylaxis (34%) and pneumonia (35%). The following organisms were isolated from patients treated with antibiotics: Staphylococcus aureus (26%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%), enterococci (12%), Haemophilus influenzae (11%), Escherichia coli (11%), Enterobacter cloacae (8%) and other Gram-negative bacilli (19%). Only 9% of Gram-negative bacilli were resistant to aminoglycosides, 3% were resistant to ciprofloxacin and no extended-spectrum beta-lactamases or imipenem-resistance were detected. No vancomycin-resistant enterococci and only two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic use during the audit appeared appropriate for the specific clinical indications. Low levels of bacterial resistance were detected during the audit.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of tigecycline against aerobic and facultative isolates recovered from hospitalized patients: an Argentinean multicenter study.
AB  - Tigecycline, the 9-t-butylglycylamino derivative of minocycline is the first commercially available glycylcycline exhibiting an extended spectrum of antibacterial activity due to its capacity to evade the tetracycline ribosomal and efflux resistance mechanisms. We conducted a collaborative in vitro study determining the activity of tigecycline compared to 14 antimicrobials against clinically relevant isolates obtained from adult patients hospitalized in 9 Argentinean institutions. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the reference broth microdilution method. The number of isolates and MICs 50/90 (mg/L) for tigecycline were the following: Acinetobacter spp. 132 (0.5/1); Escherichia coli 220 (0.12/0.25); Klebsiella spp. 220 (0.5/1), Enterobacter spp. 205 (0.5/1); Serratia spp. 84 (0.5/2); Haemophilus influenzae 96 (0.25/0.5); Staphylococcus aureus 223 (0.12/0.25); Streptococcus pneumoniae 98 (<or= 0.25/1); S. agalactiae 51 (0.5/0.5); Enterococcus spp. 104 (0.06/0.12); Pseudomonas aeruginosa 169 (8/16). We conclude that tigecycline is a promising drug for the treatment of infections in hospitalized patients in Argentina.
TI  - Pediatric mastoiditis in the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine era: symptom duration guides empiric antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microbiology of acute otitis media has changed in the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) era. We hypothesize similar changes with pediatric mastoiditis. OBJECTIVES: To compare the etiology of mastoiditis in the pre-PCV (January 1995-December 2000) and post-PCV (January 2001- April 2005) eras to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy in the pediatric emergency department. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of all patients admitted with a diagnosis of mastoiditis from January 1995 to April 2005. RESULTS: : One hundred twenty-two charts were reviewed, 68 pre-PCV and 54 post-PCV. Etiological agents were determined by culture results in 60 patients. The most common bacterial isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae (24), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), Staphylococcus aureus (12), Streptococcus pyogenes (8), and Haemophilus influenzae (2). There was no reduction in mastoiditis due to S. pneumoniae from the pre-PCV to the post-PCV eras (odds ratio [OR], 0.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.4-2.1; P = 0.77). Ceftriaxone nonsusceptibility was seen in 30% of post-PCV S. pneumoniae isolates compared with 7% of pre-PCV isolates. Acute mastoiditis was diagnosed in 93 patients, and chronic mastoiditis (defined as >or=3 wk of symptoms) was diagnosed in 29 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae was more likely to be implicated in acute versus chronic mastoiditis (OR, 9.2; 95% CI, 1.2-52.2; P = 0.01). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more frequently implicated in chronic versus acute mastoiditis (OR, 16.4; 95% CI, 2.1-75.8; P = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in the proportion of pediatric mastoiditis cases caused by S. pneumoniae in the pre-PCV versus post-PCV eras. Empiric antimicrobial therapy with ceftriaxone alone is not sufficient in the post-PCV era.
TI  - Evaluation of dosing designs of carbapenems for severe respiratory infection using Monte Carlo simulation.
AB  - Using the Monte Carlo simulation method, the influence of various doses and dosing frequencies of carbapenems on the antimicrobial activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are the main causative organisms of respiratory infections, was studied with the aim of identifying optimized effectiveness. Based on pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of individual carbapenems in healthy adults, data on changes in the respective blood concentrations in 2000 cases were simulated by applying a lognormal distribution to probability distributions of their volume of distributions and half-life periods. Based on minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) distribution data of the individual carbapenems against these strains, MICs in the 2000 cases were also simulated. Using these data in blood concentrations and MICs, the probabilities of attaining various percentages of the dosing interval during which drug concentrations remain above MIC (T > MIC) were calculated at several dosing regimens. Considering the probabilities of attaining the bactericidal effect (50% T>MIC) and daily drug costs, imipenem (IPM) at 500 mg i.v. BID, panipenem (PAPM) at 500 mg i.v. BID, and biapenem (BIPM) at 300 mg i.v. BID against Streptococcus pneumoniae; meropenem (MEPM) at 500 mg i.v. BID or TID against Haemophilus influenzae infections; and MEPM at 500 or 1000 mg i.v. TID against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, each over 30 min, were determined as appropriate empirical treatments. Selecting carbapenems with superior antimicrobial activities and optimizing their dose regimens are important to improve the efficacy. Application of Monte Carlo simulation to MIC distributions allows determination of appropriate empiric therapy even if drug susceptibility of a causative organism in individual patients is unknown.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of a novel propolis formulation (Actichelated propolis).
AB  - AIMS: This study compared in vitro activities of Actichelated propolis (a multicomposite material obtained with mechano-chemichal activation) and of a hydroalcoholic extract of propolis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), determined by means of microdilution broth method, against five strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, showed a greater potency of Actichelated propolis (MIC range: 0.016-4 mg flavonoids ml(-1)) in respect to the hydroalcoholic extract (MIC range: 0.08-21.4 mg flavonoids ml(-1)). Concentrations of Actichelated propolis active against adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and herpes virus type 1 were at least 10 times lower than those of the hydroalcoholic extract. Preincubation of Strep. pyogenes and H. influenzae with subinhibitory concentrations of Actichelated propolis (1/4 and 1/8 x MIC) significantly reduced the number of bacteria that adhered to human buccal cells. CONCLUSIONS: Actichelated propolis has proven to possess antibacterial and antiviral activity higher than a hydroalcoholic extract, being also able to interfere on bacterial adhesion to human oral cells. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This new formulation of propolis showing better antimicrobial and physical characteristics could improve the application of propolis in respiratory tract infections.
TI  - [Descriptive epidemiology of non-meningococcal bacterial meningitis in the province of Saragossa [Spain] from 1999 to 2004. Evaluation of the Epidemiological Surveillance System].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe non-meningococcal bacterial meningitis (nMM) and to evaluate the Epidemiological Surveillance System (ESS) in the province of Saragossa (Spain) between 1999 and 2004. METHODS: Information was obtained from the register of diseases subject to mandatory reporting and the Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS). The ESS was evaluated by using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria and by estimating the completeness of the system through the capture-recapture technique. RESULTS: 111 cases of nMM were notified (62.2% in males) and the mean age was 40.7 years. The largest proportion of cases (16.5%) occurred in children under 2 years of age. The clinical presentation was meningitis in 81.1%. Diagnosis was through bacterial culture in 70.3%. Streptococcus sp. was found in 54% (82% due to S. pneumoniae), enterobacteria in 5.4%, Listeria and Staphylococcus in 4.5%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 1.8%, and Haemophilus influenzae in 0.9%. The incidence rate per 100,000 inhabitants was 1.6 in 2004 and 2.6 in 2001. The case fatality was 7.3%. The completeness of the mandatory reporting system reached a peak in 2004 at 84.4%. The combined completeness of the MBDS and the mandatory reporting system was above 85% and timeliness of reporting was 2 days. The acceptability of the system was high since 75% of all variables were complete in 97% of the questionnaires. CONCLUSION: We highlight the importance of evaluation of the ESS, based on its results. nMM due to S. pneumoniae represent an important group of diseases and their case fatality is high. The completeness of the ESS in Saragossa was over 80% when the mandatory reporting system and the MBDS were combined. Incorporating the MBDS into surveillance would facilitate the estimation of the real incidence of various diseases subject to mandatory reporting.
TI  - Community-acquired pneumonia in Thai patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
AB  - Infection, particularly pneumonia, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This study was performed to assess the prevalence, causative organisms, and outcomes of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Thai SLE patients, and determine the predicting factors for death. A retrospective chart review of adult SLE patients, age >16 years, seen at the Division of Rheumatology, Chiang Mai University over an 18 year period was carried out. Cases diagnosed with CAP were selected for this study. Of 542 SLE patients, a total of 56 episodes of CAP occurred in 52 patients. Their mean age +/- SD and duration of SLE were 37.98 +/- 11.48 years and 34.99 +/- 54.53 months, respectively. Thirty-three CAP cases (58.9%) occurred within the first year of diagnosis with SLE. The causative organisms identifiable in 40 patients (71.5%) were Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 12, Nocardia spp in 6, Aspergillus spp in 5, Staphylococcus aureus in 3, Pneumocystis carinii, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 each, and Acinetobactor baumanii, Burkholderia pseudomallei, and Strongyloides stercoralis in 1 each. The remaining 3 patients had mixed bacterial infection. The overall mortality rate was 26.8%. Use of high dose prednisolone (> or =15 mg/day), and ventilator support were significantly associated with death.
TI  - Bacterial colonization in suspected sexually abused children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous studies concluded that symptomatic prepubertal children with  Gardnerella vaginalis infection should be investigated for child sexual abuse. Gardnerella vaginalis is only one out of a group of organism that cause bacterial vaginosis. The aim of the study was to report the frequency of bacterial colonization as well as sexually transmitted diseases and to correlate these data with patient characteristics. METHODS: Data were collected from 1996 to 2006. Medical records of 180 girls, median age at first sexual abuse 7.44 years (range 1-16, SD 3.937), have been evaluated retrospectively. SPSS software 12.0 has been used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Only 18.3% of patients complained of vaginal discharge or pruritus. Sexually transmitted diseases were documented: Gonorrhoea 1 (1.8%, 56 tested), Chlamydia trachomatis 1 (1.6%, 62 tested), Syphilis 0 (0%, 5 tested), Trichomonas vaginalis 1 (0.7%, 136 tested) and HIV 0 (0%, 27 tested). Bacterial colonization were documented (121 tested): Gardnerella vaginalis 29 (24%), Enterobacteriaceae 50 (41.3%), Haemophilus influenzae 11 (9.1%), Streptococcus a haemolyticus 35 (28.9%), Streptococcus Group B 8 (6.6%), Staphylococcus Koag neg. 37 (30.6%), Staphylococcus aureus 10 (8.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 (4.1%), Bacteroides 19 (15.7%), Prevotella 24 (19.8%), Klebsiella 4 (3.3%), Corynebacteria 20 (16.5%) and Ureaplasma 9 (7.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Sexually transmitted diseases are infrequent in children suspected for child sexual abuse. Bacterial colonization is common, however, not correlated with clinical symptoms (except for Bacteroides) and hymenal/vaginal injuries.
TI  - [Species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility tests by the fully automated RAISUS using an early-harvested cell suspension].
AB  - We evaluated the usefulness of an early-harvested bacterial cell suspension to the fully automated RAISUS (Nissui Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Tokyo) to provide the results of species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testings within a day after overnight-incubation of the primary cultures. A single, well-separated colony appeared on the primary culture plate was transferred onto a blood agar or chocolate agar plates, then incubated for 3 to 6 hours. The cell suspension to the RAISUS was properly prepared to the McFarland 0.5 turbidity from the early-harvested bacterial cells. When the five ATCC reference strains, consisting of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, were repeatedly tested for the species-identification, all the identification results were acceptable. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were evaluated with the above five strains and Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247. The results obtained indicated that the most susceptibility test results were comparable to those MICs obtained by the standard test procedure, but some strains, in particular, H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa gave significantly discrepant MICs for certain antimicrobial agents. The significant discrepancy in MIC determinations regarded the difference of viable cell concentrations in the cell suspension prepared respectively. Through the analysis of laboratory workflow, it became to apparent that 18S to 20S of the tests were completed by 5:00 p.m., and it required to wait until 3:00 a.m. to complete 90S of the tests. With these results, the early-harvested bacterial cell suspension is applicable to species-identification by RAISUS, but it is necessary to adjust viable cell concentrations to antimicrobial susceptibility test. Also, it is urgent to reconstitute a daily workflow to improve the rapidity of RAISUS test function.
TI  - Prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of microorganisms isolated from sputa of patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: New emerging pathogens and associated antimicrobial resistance mechanisms have been observed in the respiratory tract of patients suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF) in the last years. Amongst others, the rate of metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains is growing. However, there are no published data on the prevalence of MBL-producing P. aeruginosa in CF patients to our knowledge. METHODS: In this study, 271 sputum samples of 60 CF patients were collected during a 12-months period. Microbiological cultures and antimicrobial susceptibility tests of the most frequently isolated bacteria were performed. RESULTS: 464 bacterial and 414 fungal strains were isolated and characterized. 63.3% of the patients harbored Staphylococcus aureus, 50% P. aeruginosa, 16.6% Haemophilus influenzae, 15% Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and 13.3% non tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM). Methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and MBL-producing P. aeruginosa were detected in 3 (5%) and 5 (8.3%) patients respectively. Among the fungi, Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans showed the highest prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of MBL-producing P. aeruginosa and MRSA in CF patients confirms that antimicrobial resistance patterns should be always kept under surveillance. Moreover hygiene regulations in CF clinics should prevent a further spread of resistant bacterial strains.
TI  - Health care-associated pneumonia and community-acquired pneumonia: a single-center experience.
AB  - Pneumonia occurring outside of the hospital setting has traditionally been categorized as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, when pneumonia is associated with health care risk factors (prior hospitalization, dialysis, residing in a nursing home, immunocompromised state), it is now more appropriately classified as a health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP). The relative incidences of CAP and HCAP among patients requiring hospital admission is not well described. The objective of this retrospective cohort study, involving 639 patients with culture-positive CAP and HCAP admitted between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2005, was to characterize the incidences, microbiology, and treatment patterns for CAP and HCAP among patients requiring hospital admission. HCAP was more common than CAP (67.4% versus 32.6%). The most common pathogens identified overall included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (24.6%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (20.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.8%), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (13.8%), and Haemophilus influenzae (8.5%). The hospital mortality rate was statistically greater among patients with HCAP than among those with CAP (24.6% versus 9.1%; P < 0.001). Administration of inappropriate initial antimicrobial treatment was statistically more common among HCAP patients (28.3% versus 13.0%; P < 0.001) and was identified as an independent risk factor for hospital mortality. Our study found that the incidence of HCAP was greater than that of CAP among patients with culture-positive pneumonia requiring hospitalization at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. Patients with HCAP were more likely to initially receive inappropriate antimicrobial treatment and had a greater risk of hospital mortality. Health care providers should differentiate patients with HCAP from those with CAP in order to provide more appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Characterization of the dsDNA prophage sequences in the genome of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and visualization of productive bacteriophage.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bioinformatic analysis of the genome sequence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae revealed the presence of nine probable prophage islands. The distribution, conservation and function of many of these sequences, and their ability to produce bacteriophage particles are unknown. RESULTS: Our analysis of the genomic sequence of FA1090 identified five genomic regions (NgoPhi1 - 5) that are related to dsDNA lysogenic phage. The genetic content of the dsDNA prophage sequences were examined in detail and found to contain blocks of genes encoding for proteins homologous to proteins responsible for phage DNA replication, structural proteins and proteins responsible for phage assembly. The DNA sequences from NgoPhi1, NgoPhi2 and NgoPhi3 contain some significant regions of identity. A unique region of NgoPhi2 showed very high similarity with the Pseudomonas aeruginosa generalized transducing phage F116. Comparative analysis at the nucleotide and protein levels suggests that the sequences of NgoPhi1 and NgoPhi2 encode functionally active phages, while NgoPhi3, NgoPhi4 and NgoPhi5 encode incomplete genomes. Expression of the NgoPhi1 and NgoPhi2 repressors in Escherichia coli inhibit the growth of E. coli and the propagation of phage lambda. The NgoPhi2 repressor was able to inhibit transcription of N. gonorrhoeae genes and Haemophilus influenzae HP1 phage promoters. The holin gene of NgoPhi1 (identical to that encoded by NgoPhi2), when expressed in E. coli, could serve as substitute for the phage lambda s gene. We were able to detect the presence of the DNA derived from NgoPhi1 in the cultures of N. gonorrhoeae. Electron microscopy analysis of culture supernatants revealed the presence of multiple forms of bacteriophage particles. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the genes similar to dsDNA lysogenic phage present in the gonococcus are generally conserved in this pathogen and that they are able to regulate the expression of other neisserial genes. Since phage particles were only present in culture supernatants after induction with mitomycin C, it indicates that the gonococcus also regulates the expression of bacteriophage genes.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of tosufloxacin against major organisms detected from patients with respiratory infections].
AB  - We determined the susceptibility of bacteria which were isolated from the patients with respiratory infections between January and October 2005, to tosufloxacin and other fluoroquinolones. A total of 900 isolate including 300 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 Streptococcus pyogenes, 100 Moraxella catarrhalis, 200 Haemophilus influenzae, 100 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 100 Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested. Tosufloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin and prulifloxacin were used as the test antimicrobials. Tosufloxacin, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were potent antibiotics tested for the antibacterial activity against Streptococcus including penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae; the MIC90 were 0.12-0.5/ micromL. Fluoroquinolones exerted the potent antibacterial activity against M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae; the MIC90 of fluoroquinolones tested were < or =0.06 microg/mL. Tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and prulifloxacin showed to be more active against K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, but parts of some strains were resistant. These results indicate that tosufloxacin has the potent antibacterial activity against major organisms detected from patients with respiratory infections. Since it was approved in 1990, tosufloxacin was considered to be useful as a therapeutic antimicrobial for the treatment of respiratory infections.
TI  - Coxiella burnetii and acute exacerbations/infections in patients with chronic lung disease.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to determine the incidence of Q fever in patients with an acute exacerbation of a chronic lower respiratory tract infection. Eighty patients treated for acute exacerbation of chronic lower respiratory tract infections during a 30-month period were studied. Q fever was diagnosed by ELISA. Two elderly woman with pre-existing bronchiectasis (2.5%) were diagnosed as having an acute infection by Coxiella burnetii. The acute illness was considered to be a result of mixed infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae with C. burnetii. Co-infection with C. burnetii can occur during a bacterial exacerbation of a chronic lower respiratory tract infection.
TI  - The three-dimensional crystal structure of the PrpF protein of Shewanella oneidensis complexed with trans-aconitate: insights into its biological function.
AB  - In bacteria, the dehydration of 2-methylcitrate to yield 2-methylaconitate in the 2-methylcitric acid cycle is catalyzed by a cofactor-less (PrpD) enzyme or by an aconitase-like (AcnD) enzyme. Bacteria that use AcnD also require the function of the PrpF protein, whose function was previously unknown. To gain insights into the function of PrpF, the three-dimensional crystal structure of the PrpF protein from the bacterium Shewanella oneidensis was solved at 2.0 A resolution. The protein fold of PrpF is strikingly similar to those of the non-PLP-dependent diaminopimelate epimerase from Haemophilus influenzae, a putative proline racemase from Brucella melitensis, and to a recently deposited structure of a hypothetical protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Results from in vitro studies show that PrpF isomerizes trans-aconitate to cis-aconitate. It is proposed that PrpF catalysis of the cis-trans isomerization proceeds through a base-catalyzed proton abstraction coupled with a rotation about C2-C3 bond of 2-methylaconitate, and that residue Lys73 is critical for PrpF function. The newly identified function of PrpF as a non-PLP-dependent isomerase, together with the fact that PrpD-containing bacteria do not require PrpF, suggest that the isomer of 2-methylaconitate that serves as a substrate of aconitase must have the same stereochemistry as that synthesized by PrpD. From this, it follows that the 2-methylaconitate isomer generated by AcnD is not a substrate of aconitase, and that PrpF is required to generate the correct isomer. As a consequence, the isomerase activity of PrpF may now be viewed as an integral part of the 2-methylcitric acid cycle.
TI  - A prediction model for bacterial etiology in acute exacerbations of COPD.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bacteria play a leading role in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but we lack predictors of bacterial etiology. We developed a prediction model for infection with gram-negative enteric bacteria (GNEB) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. METHODS: Clinical presentation, sputum characteristics, microbial sputum patterns, lung function and previous and concomitant medication were prospectively recorded in patients with moderate to severe exacerbation of COPD. Risk factors for a specific bacterial etiology were calculated and a prediction model developed. RESULTS: A total of 193 patients with acute exacerbation were included. In 121 (62.6%) of them a microbial etiology could be identified, most frequently Haemophilus influenzae (32 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (22 strains) and P. aeruginosa (12 strains). Multivariate analysis identified severe airflow obstruction and use of systemic steroids as predictors for exacerbation due to gram-negative enteric bacilli and P. aeruginosa. A prediction model including FEV1 < 35% of predicted value, systemic steroid use and prior antibiotic therapy within preceeding 3 months had a negative predictive of 89%, being a helpful tool in excluding patients at risk of exacerbation due to gram-negative enteric bacilli and P. aeruginosa when all criteria are absent. CONCLUSION: A simple prediction model based on three factors may identify COPD patients at low risk for exacerbations with gram-negative enteric bacilli and P. aeruginosa. Bacterial Etiology in COPD Exacerbations.
TI  - The antimicrobial effect of heparin on common respiratory pathogens.
AB  - AIM: The mucolytic, anticoagulative, anti-inflammatory and neo-angiogenic properties of inhaled heparin may benefit patients with burns and cystic fibrosis. We assessed the antibacterial effects of unfractionated heparin. METHODS: Stored clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii (n =4), Candida albicans (n = 5), Haemophilus influenzae (n =5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n =4), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n=3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 7) were subcultured on horse blood agar, incubated at 35 degrees C overnight, then inoculated into trypticase soy broth to a density of 1 McFarland standard. Dilutions of unfractionated heparin (containing 250- 7500 U) and 100 microL of the 1.0 McFarland standard broth were incubated at 35 degrees C overnight in microtitre plates and then subcultured on horse blood agar using 1 microL standard loops. Colonies (representing viable organisms) were counted. RESULTS: Heparin produced dose-dependent growth inhibition of three of seven S. pneumoniae isolates (complete inhibition at 2500U dose per 200 microL) and one of five H. influenzae isolates (complete inhibition at 7500 U dose per 200 microL), but no inhibition of other isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Unfractionated heparin is unlikely to have antibacterial effects because of its unpredictable inhibition of growth of common respiratory pathogens.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute rhinosinusitis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma survivors: a result of maxillary sinus punctures.
AB  - Rhinosinusitis is a common complication in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who receive radiotherapy. An impaired mucociliary clearance due to this treatment may be the major cause of rhinosinusitis in these irradiated patients. The relative frequency with which various pathogens cause rhinosinusitis in these patients is unknown. This study investigates the bacteriology of acute rhinosinusitis in irradiated NPC patients by maxillary sinus puncture. From October 2001 through July 2006, 20 irradiated NPC patients with radiograph-proven acute maxillary sinusitis received maxillary sinus punctures. Aspirate contents of the sinuses were collected for aerobic and anaerobic cultivation. A total sampling of 26 sides was performed in the 20 patients. The culture rate was 85%. Frequently identified aerobes and facultative anaerobes included alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (n = 8), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, however, are far less common. This may provide important information about the antibiotic therapy in irradiated NPC patients with acute rhinosinusitis.
TI  - Comparative in vitro antimicrobial activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline compound, in freshly prepared medium and quality control.
AB  - The in vitro spectra of activity of tigecycline and tetracycline were determined  for 2,490 bacterial isolates representing 50 different species or phenotypic groups. All isolates were tested simultaneously by broth microdilution using freshly prepared Mueller-Hinton broth and by disk diffusion. Portions of these data were submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in support of the sponsor's application for new drug approval. In a separate study, MIC and disk diffusion quality control ranges were determined. The tigecycline MICs at which 50%/90% of bacteria were inhibited were (in microg/ml) as follows: for Streptococcus spp., 0.06/0.12; for Moraxella catarrhalis, 0.06/0.12; for Staphylococcus spp., 0.12/0.25; for Enterococcus spp., 0.12/0.25; for Listeria monocytogenes, 0.12/0.12; for Neisseria meningitidis, 0.12/0.25; for Haemophilus spp., 0.25/0.5; for Enterobacteriaceae, 0.05/2.0; for non-Enterobacteriaceae, 0.5/8.0. Tigecycline was consistently more potent than tetracycline against all species studied. The data from this study confirm the FDA-approved MIC and disk diffusion breakpoints for tigecycline for Streptococcus spp. other than Streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci, and Enterobacteriaceae. Provisional breakpoints for Haemophilus spp. and S. pneumoniae are proposed based on the data from this study. The following MIC and/or disk diffusion quality control ranges are proposed: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml; S. aureus ATCC 25923, 20 to 25 mm; Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml and 20 to 27 mm; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, 9 to 13 mm, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, 0.03 to 0.12 microg/ml; S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619, 0.015 to 0.12 microg/ml and 23 to 29 mm; Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247, 0.06 to 0.5 microg/ml and 23 to 31 mm; and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226, 30 to 40 mm.
TI  - Microbiologic follow-up study in adult bronchiectasis.
AB  - There is minimal published longitudinal data about pathogenic microorganisms in adults with bronchiectasis. Therefore a study was undertaken to assess the microbiologic profile over time in bronchiectasis. A prospective study of clinical and microbiologic outcomes was performed. Subjects were assessed by a respiratory physician and sputum sample were collected for analysis. Subjects were followed up and had repeat assessment performed. Eighty-nine subjects were followed up for a period of 5.7+/-3.6 years. On initial assessment the two most common pathogens isolated were Haemophilus influenzae (47%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12%) whilst 21% had no pathogens isolated. On follow-up review results were similar (40% H. influenzae, 18% P. aeruginosa and 26% no pathogens). The prevalence of antibiotic resistance of isolates increased from 13% to 30%. Analysis of a series of H. influenzae isolates showed they were nearly all nontypeable and all were different subtypes. Subjects with no pathogens isolated from their sputum had the mildest disease, while subjects with P. aeruginosa had the most severe bronchiectasis. Many subjects with bronchiectasis are colonized with the same bacterium over an average follow-up of 5 years. Different pathogens are associated with different patterns of clinical disease.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from ophthalmic specimens between 1984 and 2005 in Zurich, Switzerland.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing resistance of bacteria cultured from ophthalmic specimens  to antibiotic therapy has been documented worldwide. Inappropriate prescribing practices are thought to represent a major risk factor for antibiotic resistance. This study investigates the pattern of bacterial antibiotic susceptibility in Zurich, Switzerland over a period of twenty years. METHODS: Antibiotic susceptibilities of bacterial isolates from all ophthalmic specimens cultured at the Institute of Medical Microbiology in Zurich between 1984 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 7,862 ocular surface samples have been collected. 3,010 specimens (38.3 %) were positive for aerobic bacteria. The strains isolated most frequently were Staphylococcus aureus (23.9 %), coagulase-negative staphylococci (16.1 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.0 %), Haemophilus influenzae (6.3 %), Escherichia coli (5.1 %), Serratia marcescens (4.7 %), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (3.9 %). Various bacteria accounted for the remaining 30.0 %. Susceptibility of these strains to the aminoglycosides, quinolones, and cephalosporins tested did not change over this period of time. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that bacteria cultured from ophthalmic specimens in Zurich, Switzerland have not changed their pattern of antibiotic susceptibility over the past 20 years.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of carbapenems against clinically isolated respiratory bacterial pathogens in Japan between 2005 and 2006.
AB  - The current status of the susceptibility of the main respiratory bacterial pathogens was evaluated by analysing the antibacterial activity of 21 drugs, including four carbapenems, against five species of the pathogens isolated between January 2005 and January 2006. A total of 157 strains were studied. Carbapenems inhibited the growth of all of the tested strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains at concentrations that were below the breakpoints set by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy (2 and 1mug/mL for pneumonia and chronic respiratory tract infection, respectively). However, the majority of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains were resistant to carbapenems. Meropenem, but not the other carbapenems, inhibited the growth of all of the tested strains of Haemophilus influenzae isolates, including beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin-resistant strains, at concentrations of <or=1 microg/mL. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) of meropenem, 0.25 and 4 microg/mL, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the lowest of the carbapenems. By comparing these results with our previous data, it was found that there was no increase in resistance to carbapenems in any of the species tested. Thus, it can be stated that carbapenems have retained their position as key drugs for severe respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Microbial ecology of the cystic fibrosis lung.
AB  - Understanding the microbial flora of the cystic fibrosis (CF) respiratory tract is of considerable importance, as patient morbidity and death are primarily caused by chronic respiratory infections. However, chronically colonized CF airways represent a surprisingly complex and diverse ecosystem. The precise contributions of different microbes to patient morbidity, and in particular the importance of inter-specific interactions, remain largely unelucidated. The importance of within-species genetic and phenotypic variation has similarly received limited explicit attention. While a host of studies provide data on the microbial species recovered from patients, these are often incomparable due to differences in sampling and data reporting, or do not present the data in a way that aids our understanding of the ecosystem within each patient. This review brings together a cross-section of recent research on the CF airways and the microbes which infect them. The results presented suggest that understanding the CF lung in terms of its community and evolutionary ecology could benefit our understanding of disease progression and influence treatment regimens.
TI  - [In-vitro susceptibilites to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 18,639 clinical isolates obtained from 77 centers in 2004].
AB  - A total of 18,639 clinical isolates in 19 species collected from 77 centers during 2004 in Japan were tested for their susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (FQs) and other selected antibiotics. The common respiratory pathogens, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae showed a high susceptible rate against FQs. The isolation rate of beta lactamase non-producing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae was approximately three times as large as those of western countries. Most strains of Enterobacteriaceae were also susceptible to FQs. The resistance rate of Escherichia coli against FQs has however been rapidly increasing so far as we surveyed since 1994. The FQs-resistant rate in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) showed approximately 90% except for 36%. of sitafloxacin while FQs-resistant rate in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) was around 5%. The FQs-resistant rate of methicillin-resistant coagulase negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) was also higher than that of methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative Staphylococci (MSCNS), however, it was lower than that of MRSA. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates, 32-34% from UTI and 15-19% of from RTI was resistant to FQs. Acinetobacter spp. showed a high susceptibility to FQs. Although FQs-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae have not been increased in western countries, it is remarkably high in Japan. In this survey, isolates of approximately 85% was resistant to FQs.
TI  - A day in the life of a nebulizer: surveillance for bacterial growth in nebulizer  equipment of children with cystic fibrosis in the hospital setting.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by chronic lung infection. Minimizing exposure to pathogens is important. Treating a CF pulmonary exacerbation includes nebulizer therapies, but little is known about pathogen exposure from nebulizer equipment in CF. OBJECTIVE: To assess microbial growth in nebulizer equipment used by hospitalized CF patients. HYPOTHESIS: The small-volume nebulizer would not support the growth of the important CF pathogens: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Burkholderia cepacia. METHODS: During a 6-month period, we prospectively enrolled 30 patients who were admitted for pulmonary exacerbation of CF and were prescribed an aerosolized bronchodilator 4 times daily. Bronchodilator was administered via disposable small-volume nebulizer, prior to airway clearance. The nebulizer was not cleaned or disinfected between treatments, but instead was replaced after 24 hours. Sputum or throat cultures were obtained prior to admission or on the day of admission, and standard culture techniques were used for CF microbes. After the first bronchodilator treatment, a sample was taken from the residual fluid inside the nebulizer cup. The second, third, and fourth samples were taken from the nebulizer cup after it was filled with a unit dose of the bronchodilator but prior to administering the bronchodilator. At the 24th hour, the nebulizer was filled with 3 mL of sterile water, from which the fifth sample was obtained, then the nebulizer was disposed of. RESULTS: On respiratory culture, ten patients had Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 had both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, 6 had only S. aureus, and 1 had both S. aureus and H. influenzae. Three had other organisms, 4 had normal flora, and 1 had no culture data. Of the 150 nebulizer sample cultures, only 3 showed bacterial growth. Bacillus species, Corynebacterium, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Candida albicans were isolated at low colony counts. CONCLUSIONS: We suspect that the organisms identified were caused by skin contamination of the samples rather than contamination of the nebulizer cup. We conclude that there is a low risk of microbial contamination with CF pathogens from the interior of a disposable nebulizer over a 24 hour period.
TI  - Bacterial infection and risk factors in outpatients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a 2-year prospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are commonly observed in community-based patients worldwide. The factors causing exacerbation are largely unknown. This study was undertaken to determine the predominant bacterial pathogens cultured from sputum in community-based patients with AECOPD, to assess the risk factors associated with exacerbations and to compare these findings with published studies. METHODS: Forty-five patients with stable COPD were prospectively followed in the outpatients' clinic of King Abdulaziz University Hospital. At the first visit, personal data, CXR and measurement of baseline PEF were obtained from each patient. In the subsequent visits, sputum culture and CXR were carried out during exacerbations. RESULTS: Over a period of 24 months, patients made a total of 139 visits for exacerbations, and 69.8% had a positive sputum culture for a single pathogen. Moraxella catarrhalis (25.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.2%) and Haemophilus influenzae (11.5%) were the most common isolated organisms. Patients with a lower level of baseline PEF had a significantly increased frequency of exacerbations (r = 0.337, P = 0.024). However, there was a weak correlation between exacerbation frequency and duration of COPD and exposure to cigarette smoking. CONCLUSION: There was a higher incidence of Moraxella catarrhalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than reported in previous studies. These findings should influence antibiotic selection for exacerbations. COPD patients with a low baseline PEF are at a higher risk of having repeated exacerbations and gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Usefulness of bronchoscopic microsampling to detect the pathogenic bacteria of respiratory infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchoscopic microsampling (BMS) is a method in which a device consisting of a wire with a polyester probe at the tip is used to collect bronchial epithelial lining fluid with bronchoscopy. In this study, we bacteriologically investigated sample collection using BMS to incorporate BMS into diagnosis of respiratory infection. METHODS: Strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), were used for experiments. In the standard sampling procedure using BMS, the probe coming out of the sheath was immersed in approximately 6 x 10(6) cfu/mL bacterial suspension for 30 s and cut into a tube containing 1 mL of normal saline solution. The tube was stirred for 1 min using a vortex. The sampling rate was calculated by the following equation: (actual amount of bacteria collected by BMS [colony forming units per milliliter])/(bacterial amount in suspension for sampling [colony forming units per milliliter]) x 100 (percentage). RESULTS: The sampling rate of S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and MAC showed no significant difference among three bacteria, but the sampling rate of P aeruginosa was higher. The shortened time of sampling, stirring, and the reduced bacterial amount in the suspension (1/100) did not significantly affect the rates of standard procedure. In contrast, in comparison with a protected specimen brush (PSB), the recoveries of S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and MAC using PSB were significantly lower than those by BMS, but the recovery of P aeruginosa was not significantly different. CONCLUSION: This in vitro study might suggested the usefulness of BMS as a new diagnostic technique capable of quantitative and stable sampling.
TI  - [In vitro study to evaluate the antibacterial activity of a combination of the haulm of nasturtium (Tropaeoli majoris herba) and of the roots of horseradish (Armoraciae rusticanae radix)].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in-vitro antimicrobial properties of a commercialized  preparation (Angocin Anti-Infekt N) containing a combination of the haulm of nasturtium (Tropaeoli majoris herba; N) and of the roots of horseradish (Armoraciae rusticanae radix; H). This preparation can be used to treat upper respiratory tract (URTI) and urinary tract infections (UTI). The active ingredients are volatile mustard oils, which are activated in the gastrointestinal tract after oral intake. Previous research has shown mustard oils derived from either N or H to possess antibacterial activity. METHODS: In order to assess the antimicrobial capacity of phytotherapeutic compounds containing volatile mustard oils, a modified gas-test was used. Native preparations of N and H were applied to the lids of Columbia agar plates (ratio N:H = 2.5:1) and mixed with sterile H20. Thirteen different bacterial species including Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible and resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, MRSA) were tested (20 isolates each). The test organisms were plated onto the blood agar plates and placed above the native preparations. The plates were sealed with adhesive tape and incubated at 37 degrees C. Following incubation of 24 h and 92 h, colony forming units (CFU) were counted and the minimal inhibitory concentrationg (MIC90) was determined for each bacterial species. RESULTS: Relevant antimicrobial activities of the combined native preparations were found against H. influenzae (MIC90 50 mg N / 20 mg H), M. catarrhalis (100 mg N / 40 mg H), E. coli (400 mg N / 160 mg H), P aeruginosa (400 mg N / 160 mg H), MSSA (400 mg N 1 160 mg H), MRSA (400 mg N / 160 mg H), and S. pyogenes (400 mg N / 160 mg H). CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial testing of a combination of N and H revealed broad antibacterial activities against clinically relevant pathogens covering both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, thus confirming previous reports of the antibacterial properties of mustard oils. Additionally, this study demonstrated that the combination of N and H leads to synergistic activity in terms of improved Pseudomonas-susceptibility compared to the previous reported activities of the single compounds. Thus, these results prove that there is a rational basis for treatment of URTI and UTI with a combination of N and H.
TI  - A 1-year prospective study of the infectious etiology in patients hospitalized with acute exacerbations of COPD.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infection is a major cause of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPDs). We aimed to study the infectious etiology related to AECOPD. METHODS: Patients admitted to an acute care hospital in Hong Kong with an AECOPD were recruited prospectively from May 1, 2004, to April 30, 2005. Sputum samples, nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples, and paired serology specimens were collected. Spirometry was performed with patients in the stable phase 2 to 3 months after hospital discharge. RESULTS: There were 643 episodes of AECOPD among 373 patients. Their mean age was 75.3 years (SD, 7.9 years) with 307 male patients. The mean FEV(1) was 40.4% predicted (SD, 18.7% predicted), and the mean FEV(1)/FVC ratio was 58.4% (SD, 16.0%). Among sputum samples from the 530 episodes of AECOPD hospital admissions that were saved, 13.0%, 6.0%, and 5.5%, respectively, had positive growth of Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Among the 505 hospital admissions with patients who had NPA samples saved, 5.7%, 2.3%, 0.8%, and 0.8%, respectively, had influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza B, and parainfluenza 3 isolated from viral cultures. Paired serology test results revealed a fourfold rise in viral titers in 5.2%, 2.2%, and 1.4% of patients, respectively, for influenza A, RSV, and influenza B. Very severe airflow obstruction (stable-state spirometry) was associated with a higher chance of a positive sputum culture (FEV(1) >/= 30% predicted, 28.2%; FEV(1) < 30% predicted, 40.4%; p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: H influenzae and influenza A were the most common etiologic agents in patients who were hospitalized with AECOPDs. More severe airflow obstruction was associated with a higher chance of a positive sputum culture finding.
TI  - Sputum bacteriology in hospitalized patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Taiwan with an emphasis on Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Bacterial infection is one of the major causes of acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). This study was undertaken to investigate the microbiology of AECOPD. METHODS: Medical records from 494 episodes of AECOPD in patients admitted to the National Taiwan University Hospital from January 2000 to June 2004 were reviewed. Severity of COPD was classified according to the 2003 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guideline. RESULTS: Potential pathogenic microorganisms were isolated from patients in 328 (66.4%) episodes of AECOPD. The predominant bacteria were Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.8%) and Haemophilus influenzae (7.5%), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (6.9%), Enterobacter species (6.1%) and Staphylococcus aureus (6.1%). The incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae was 2.4%. Spirometry results obtained within 1 year of the exacerbation were available in 186 cases. K. pneumoniae was more frequently isolated in stage I COPD (39.1%) than stage II (16.6%), III (13.8%) and IV (9.4%). No glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli were isolated in stage I patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that P. aeruginosa (odds ratio (OR) 3.19; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21-8.38), intubation (OR 14.81; 95% CI: 5.08-43.12) and age (OR 1.1; 95% CI: 1.03-1.17) were independent risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa are the most common sputum pathogens in hospitalized patients with AECOPD in Taiwan, with the former being more commonly isolated from mild COPD and the latter associated with poor clinical outcome. These results should be considered when deciding which antibiotics should initially be used to treat patients with AECOPD.
TI  - [Isolation and identification of Burkholderia cepacia complex from cystic fibrosis patients].
AB  - In this study, sputum samples collected from cystic fibrosis patients with preliminary diagnosis of pulmonary infection were evaluated for the presence of bacteria belonging to Burkholderia cepacia complex by commercial phenotypic systems and recA polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 85 patients ages between 5-30 years (mean age: 12.8 years) were included to the study with female/male ratio of 44/41. The mostly isolated bacteria from 85 sputum samples were found as Staphylococcus aureus (55.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (48.2%) and Haemophilus influenzae (15.3%), whereas B. cepacia complex was phenotypically identified from two (2.3%) out of the samples. However only one was confirmed by PCR and typed as Burkholderia multivorans by restriction fragment lenght polymorphism method. This study emphasizes the importance of molecular methods as confirmatory tests for accurate identification of B. cepacia complex.
TI  - [Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation in bronchiectatic patients and clinical reflections].
AB  - Bronchiectasis is characterized with irreversible dilatation according to destruction of epithelium, elastic and muscular layer. Most important cause of bronchiectasis is chronic bacterial infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation is frequently seen in bronchiectatic patients. We aimed to find out P. aeruginosa colonisation frequency and clinical, radiological and spirometric reflections due to colonisation. We analysed 83 cases retrospectively. Mean age was 58.2 and 54.2% of them were female. Bronchiectasis were localised 19.3% in left lung, 19.3% right and 61.4% bilaterally. 29 (35.8%) normal, 28 (34.6%) obstructive, 7 (8.6%) restrictive, 17 (21%) mixed type disorders are detected in spirometric measures. Sputum culture performed in 50 cases. No microorganism colonisation determined in 30 (60%) cases, P. aeruginosa colonisation 16 (32%), Haemophilus influenzae 2 (4%), 1 (2%) Streptococcus pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis 1 (2%) cases. P. aeruginosa colonisation determined more frequent in males (p<0.05). No significant correlation detected between colonisation and age or smoking habits (p>0.05). In cases with colonisation; clubbing and hemoptysis were significantly frequent (p<0.05). Only peribronchial thickening was significantly correlated with colonisation in radiological findings (p<0.05). In blood gase analysis PaO2, oxygen saturation were lower and PaCO2 higher in cases colonised with P. aeruginosa but it was not statisticaly significant (p>0.05). Hospitalization rate was higher in P. aeruginosa colonised cases (p>0.05). It is an important problem about mortality because of higher hemoptysis and hospitalisation requirement rate in P. aeruginosa colonised cases.
TI  - [Antimicrobial resistance surveillance: VIRA STUDY 2006].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to determine the current antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the most frequent multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the two VIRA studies carried out in 2001 and 2004. METHODS: In February 2006, the 40 participating hospitals sent the following microorganisms: non-penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (92), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (290), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (136), ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (89), ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (67), ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli (365), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (181), and Acinetobacter baumannii (92). The hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. Susceptibility was determined with a broth microdilution method. RESULTS: Among the non-penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae isolates, the proportion of those ones resistant to this antibiotic showed a significant (p < 0.001) decrease (59.8% in 2001, 30.2% in 2004 and 14.3% in 2006). Among MRSA, we detected one isolate nonsusceptible to linezolid, four resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin and one strain with a vancomycin MIC of 4 microg/mL. The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli was 12.1%. Resistance of A. baumannii to imipenem varied from 27% in the 2001-2004 period to 47.8% in 2006 (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: These results again emphasize that resistance surveillance systems are an important tool for preventing the emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Low gammaglobulin subclass 2 levels in paediatric cystic fibrosis patients followed over a 2-year period.
AB  - The aim of this study was to relate serum immunoglobulin G2 subclass levels in a  large paediatric population with cystic fibrosis, to clinical status and antibody levels to Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae and to observe any changes over a 2-year period. IgG subclasses were measured in 131 patients. Results were compared with levels from age-related normal population data. The following clinical data were collected at baseline and 2 years later; genotype: height, weight, and BMI z-scores: FEV1 (as percent predicted): Shwachman-Kulczcyki and Northern chest X-ray scores: Pseudomonas aeruginosa status. Antibody levels to H. influenzae type b and S. pneumoniae measured at baseline were related to IgG2 level. There was a reduction in the prevalence of low levels of IgG2 from 29% to 10% over the 2-year period. Low levels of IgG2 were not associated with any decline in clinical well-being. Low levels of IgG2 alone were associated with low antibody levels to S. pneumoniae. Low levels of IgG2 and low levels of antibody to H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were not associated with any decline in clinical well-being. Children with high levels of IgG2 had worse lung function, worse Shwachman-Kulczcyki and Northern chest X-ray scores and higher levels of P. aeruginosa infection. Children with low IgG2 levels were not worse clinically compared to those with normal or high IgG2 levels. High IgG2 levels were associated with a worse clinical status.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2004)].
AB  - From October 2004 to September 2005, we collected the specimen from 319 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 12 institutions in Japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. Of 383 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 381 strains were examined. The breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 87, Streptococcus pneumoniae 80, Haemophilus influenzae 78, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 35, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 9, Klebsiella pneumoniae 15, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 30, etc. Of 87 S. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/mL or less of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-sensitive S. aureus: MSSA) and those with 4 microg/mL or more of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) were 40 (46.0%) and 47 (54.0%) strains, respectively. Against MSSA, imipenem had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/mL. Against MRSA, vancomycin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/mL. Arbekacin (ABK) also showed the potent activity and its MIC90 was 2 microg/mL. Carbapenems showed the most potent activities against S. pneumoniae and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25-0.5 microg/mL. Cefozopran (CZOP) also had a preferable activity (MIC90: 1 microg/mL) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/mL. In contrast, there were high-resistant strains (MIC: 128 microg/mL or more) for ABK (2.5%), erythromycin (37.5%), and clindamycin (38.8%). Against H. influenzae, levofloxacin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.125 microg/mL. Meropenem showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/mL. Against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid), amikacin (AMK) had the most potent activity and its MIC90 was 4 microg/mL. The activity of CZOP against the non-mucoid type also was preferable and its MIC90 was 8 microg/mL. Against K. pneumoniae, CZOP, cefmenoxime, cefpirome, flomoxef were the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/mL. Also, all the agents generally showed a potent activity against M. (B.) catarrhalis and the MIC90 of them were 4 microg/mL or less. The approximately half the number (57.0%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. Bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for 50.8% and 23.8% of all the respiratory infection, respectively. The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were S. aureus (21.6%), S. pneumoniae (24.7%) and H. influenzae (20.1%). S. aureus (20.9%), S. pneumoniae (16.1%), and H. influenzae (16.1%) also were relatively frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. Before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were S. pneumoniae (22.3%) and H. influenzae (25.1%). The bacteria relatively frequently isolated from the patients treated with macrolides were P. aeruginosa and the isolation frequency was 43.5%.
TI  - Pneumocystis jirovecii and microbiological findings in children with severe pneumonia in Nairobi, Kenya.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the significance of Pneumocystis jirovecii infection in the Kenyan paediatric population. DESIGN: Sixty samples of induced sputum from children aged < or =23 months, half of whom were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, admitted with severe pneumonia in Nairobi were subjected to immunofluorescent staining for detection of P. jirovecii and microbiological culture. RESULTS: P. jirovecii was detected in 8/60 (13%) as a copathogen with other respiratory pathogens. Five of eight samples with >5 oocysts were from HIV-positive children aged < or =6 months, while equivocally scored samples (< or =5 oocysts) were from HIV-negative children aged >6 months. Klebsiella pneumoniae was significantly recovered in 26/ 60 (43%), followed by Escherichia coli 11/60 (18%) and Staphylococcus aureus 8/60 (13%). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated infrequently. Candida albicans was recovered from 27/60 (45%), while the frequency of C. tropicalis, C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis was 7%, 5% and 3% respectively. Multidrug resistance among E. coli and K. pneumoniae were: sulphamethoxazoletrimethoprim 100% vs. 69%, chloramphenicol 55% vs. 73% and ampicillin 100% vs. 89%. CONCLUSION: Paediatricians in Kenya should be aware of Pneumocystis pneumonia, irrespective of the patient's HIV status.
TI  - Bronchiectasis.
AB  - Bronchiectasis is generally classified into cystic fibrosis and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. This review article describes non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis in adults. Bronchiectasis can be considered a heterogeneous condition characterized by irreversible airway dilatation with chronic bronchial infection/inflammation. It remains a common condition and is a major cause of respiratory morbidity. Many factors are associated with bronchiectasis, but most commonly patients will have idiopathic disease. Important clinical findings include chronic productive cough, rhinosinusitis, fatigue and bi-basal crackles. Patients have usually had symptoms for many years. Diagnosis is confirmed by high-resolution computed tomography scanning using standardized criteria. Spirometry shows moderate airflow obstruction and there is a high prevalence of bronchial hyperreactivity. The most common pathogens are non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There may be considerable overlap with other chronic airway diseases. Treatment regimens are still not well defined. Patients tend to have ongoing symptoms and decline in respiratory function despite treatment.
TI  - Diffuse panbronchiolitis.
AB  - Diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) is an idiopathic inflammatory disease, well recognised in Japan and principally affecting the respiratory bronchioles, causing a progressive suppurative and severe obstructive respiratory disorder. If left untreated, DPB progresses to bronchiectasis, respiratory failure and death. It was first described in the early 1960s. Subsequently, in 1969, the disease was named DPB to distinguish it from chronic bronchitis. "Diffuse" refers to the distribution of the lesions throughout both lungs, and "pan-" refers to the involvement of inflammation in all layers of the respiratory bronchioles. The distinctive imaging and histological features, the coexisting sinusitis, and the isolation of Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum enhance disease recognition. Histologically, DPB is characterised by chronic inflammation, localised mainly in the respiratory bronchioles and adjacent centrilobular regions, with characteristic interstitial accumulation of foamy histiocytes, neutrophils and lymphocyte infiltration. Neutrophils and T-lymphocytes, particularly CD8+ cells, together with the cytokines interleukin-8 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1, are believed to play key roles in the development of DPB. A significant improvement in the prognosis of this potentially fatal disease has been recently reported thanks to the use of long-term therapy with macrolide antibiotics, the effect of which is attributed to an anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory action.
TI  - Assessment of pathogen frequency and resistance patterns among pediatric patient  isolates: report from the 2004 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program on 3 continents.
AB  - Selecting empiric or directed therapy for pathogens isolated from pediatric patients can be problematic. Many antimicrobial agents are not indicated for use in pediatric patients, and regional variations of resistance mechanisms have been reported. The purpose of this study was to analyze antimicrobial resistance patterns and pathogen occurrence rates in pediatric-aged patient infections on 3 continents using data from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. A total of 3537 clinical isolates were collected from 47 medical centers in 2004. With a protocol that dictated a sampling of 80 consecutive isolates from children (< or =18 years of age), all samples were forwarded to a central laboratory for reference susceptibility testing. Broth microdilution methods and current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoint criteria were used. The 15 most frequently observed pathogens accounted for 93.6% of all isolates. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen isolated in North America (27.4%) and Europe (19.0%), but Escherichia coli was most common in Latin America (19.3%). All Streptococcus pneumoniae strains from North America and Latin America were susceptible to the newer fluoroquinolones, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. However, 2 S. pneumoniae strains from Italy were resistant to gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin (> or =4 microg/mL). Ribotype and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns found that these resistant pneumococci were clonal. Numerous strains of Klebsiella spp. (22.5%), E. coli (4.5%), and Proteus mirabilis (4.9%) exhibited phenotypic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase resistance patterns. Four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (3 from Latin America and 1 from Europe) were multidrug resistant, 2 P. aeruginosa isolates from Turkey were resistant to polymyxin B (> or =4 microg/mL), and 8.7% of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates from Latin America were resistant to the "drug of choice", trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Physicians should be aware of pathogen occurrences that vary by children's age, geographic location, and prior antimicrobial exposure. Therefore, continued surveillance will be necessary to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance in the pediatric patient population, especially because new agents such as the fluoroquinolones are used to a greater extent in this age group.
TI  - Comparisons of parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporins tested against bacterial  isolates from pediatric patients: report from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (1998-2004).
AB  - A contemporary collection of 12737 strains from pediatric patients (<18 years) isolated over a 7-year period (1998-2004) from 52 sentinel hospitals in North America was tested to determine the comparative antimicrobial potency of broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporins and selected comparator agents. Most of the strains (84.1%) were isolated from blood stream or respiratory tract infections. The rank order of the top 10 pediatric pathogens analyzed was Streptococcus pneumoniae (15.5%) >Haemophilus influenzae (14.6%) >Staphylococcus aureus (13.8%) >Moraxella catarrhalis = coagulase-negative staphylococci (8.0%) >Escherichia coli (7.8%) >Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.2%) >Klebsiella spp. (4.8%) >Enterococcus spp. (4.7%) > beta-hemolytic streptococci (4.4%). Both cefepime and ceftriaxone (MIC(90), 1 microg/mL; 93.9% and 93.7% susceptible, respectively) were highly active against S. pneumoniae. However, the S. pneumoniae strains showed reduced susceptibility to ceftazidime (56.6%), as well as penicillin (56.6%) < trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (57.1%) < erythromycin (66.2%) < tetracycline (71.4%). beta-Hemolytic streptococci showed 100.0% susceptibility to penicillin, cefepime, and ceftriaxone. Cefepime and ceftriaxone exhibited high activity against oxacillin (methicillin)-susceptible S. aureus, (MIC(90), 4 microg/mL; 100.0% and 99.8% susceptible, respectively), whereas ceftazidime (MIC(90), 16 microg/mL) was active against only 86.7% of strains. H. influenzae strains showed complete susceptibility to cefepime, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin (MIC(90), < or =0.5 microg/mL; 100.0%), and 34.0% of H. influenzae and 99.2% of M. catarrhalis strains produced beta-lactamase. Although the 3 cephalosporins tested (cefepime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime) were very active (98.6-99.6% susceptible) against E. coli, cefepime (99.0% susceptible) was slightly more active than ceftriaxone and ceftazidime (96.4% and 95.1% susceptible, respectively) against Klebsiella spp. Cefepime was also the most active beta-lactam agent tested against Enterobacter spp. (MIC(90), 2 microg/mL; 99.3% susceptible), whereas the susceptibility rates of other broad-spectrum beta-lactams (ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and piperacillin-tazobactam) were significantly lower (78.4-81.5%). Against P. aeruginosa, imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam showed the highest susceptibility rates (94.4% and 93.3%, respectively), whereas imipenem and cefepime showed the lowest resistance rates (1.4% and 2.3%, respectively). Our results indicate that cefepime was the most broad-spectrum cephalosporin analyzed and remains a very potent alternative for the treatment of contemporary pediatric infections in North America.
TI  - How long do nosocomial pathogens persist on inanimate surfaces? A systematic review.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inanimate surfaces have often been described as the source for outbreaks of nosocomial infections. The aim of this review is to summarize data on the persistence of different nosocomial pathogens on inanimate surfaces. METHODS: The literature was systematically reviewed in MedLine without language restrictions. In addition, cited articles in a report were assessed and standard textbooks on the topic were reviewed. All reports with experimental evidence on the duration of persistence of a nosocomial pathogen on any type of surface were included. RESULTS: Most gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. (including VRE), Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), or Streptococcus pyogenes, survive for months on dry surfaces. Many gram-negative species, such as Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, or Shigella spp., can also survive for months. A few others, such as Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus vulgaris, or Vibrio cholerae, however, persist only for days. Mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and spore-forming bacteria, including Clostridium difficile, can also survive for months on surfaces. Candida albicans as the most important nosocomial fungal pathogen can survive up to 4 months on surfaces. Persistence of other yeasts, such as Torulopsis glabrata, was described to be similar (5 months) or shorter (Candida parapsilosis, 14 days). Most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as corona, coxsackie, influenza, SARS or rhino virus, can persist on surfaces for a few days. Viruses from the gastrointestinal tract, such as astrovirus, HAV, polio- or rota virus, persist for approximately 2 months. Blood-borne viruses, such as HBV or HIV, can persist for more than one week. Herpes viruses, such as CMV or HSV type 1 and 2, have been shown to persist from only a few hours up to 7 days. CONCLUSION: The most common nosocomial pathogens may well survive or persist on surfaces for months and can thereby be a continuous source of transmission if no regular preventive surface disinfection is performed.
TI  - X-linked agammaglobulinemia in northern Thailand.
AB  - X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by  a failure to generate immunoglobulins of all isotypes due to the absence of mature B cells and plasma cells, secondary to mutations in the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) gene. We report six patients with XLA, confirmed by mutation analysis, from northern Thailand. The mean age of onset was 2.5 years and the mean age at diagnosis was 7.3 years. All patients had a history of otitis media, pneumonia and arthritis at the time of diagnosis, five patients had developed bronchiectasis and 3 patients septicemia. Other infections reported included sinusitis (5/6), pericarditis (1/6), meningitis (1/6) and pyoderma (1/6). Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated on multiple occasions. One patient died of sepsis at the age of 16 years. These observations demonstrate that early diagnosis and treatment can improve prognosis and quality of life.
TI  - Respiratory tract infections: at-risk patients, who are they? Implications for their management with levofloxacin.
AB  - Two of the most serious respiratory tract infections are community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB). The most common pathogens found in patients with these infections are Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is also relatively common, particularly in elderly patients with AECB. S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa are also of concern in relation to the development of resistance to antimicrobial drugs. The administration of antibiotics at doses that result in concentrations exceeding the mutant prevention concentration at the site of infection is one strategy to prevent the development of drug-resistant pathogens. AECB is associated with a high risk of in-hospital mortality, particularly in patients treated in the intensive care unit. CAP is also associated with significant risks and often requires treatment under hospital supervision. Several patient-related factors help identify those patients who are most at risk of mortality and morbidity. Treatment should be tailored towards the severity of the disease. The fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, are an effective treatment option for AECB and CAP. Compared with many other antibiotics, resistance to levofloxacin remains low for most infecting pathogens. The oral bioavailability of levofloxacin is over 99%, enabling simple switching from intravenous to oral therapy during treatment. It is also preferentially distributed to compartments in the lung, thus achieving high concentrations at the site of respiratory tract infections. Combined with cover of the major infecting pathogens found in patients with AECB and CAP, and a cost-effective treatment compared with many alternative therapies, levofloxacin is an attractive option for the treatment of at-risk patients with these respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Bacterial neuraminidase facilitates mucosal infection by participating in biofilm production.
AB  - Many respiratory pathogens, including Hemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, express neuraminidases that can cleave alpha2,3-linked sialic acids from glycoconjugates. As mucosal surfaces are heavily sialylated, neuraminidases have been thought to modify epithelial cells by exposing potential bacterial receptors. However, in contrast to neuraminidase produced by the influenza virus, a role for bacterial neuraminidase in pathogenesis has not yet been clearly established. We constructed a mutant of P. aeruginosa PAO1 by deleting the PA2794 neuraminidase locus (Delta2794) and tested its virulence and immunostimulatory capabilities in a mouse model of infection. Although fully virulent when introduced i.p., the Delta2794 mutant was unable to establish respiratory infection by i.n. inoculation. The inability to colonize the respiratory tract correlated with diminished production of biofilm, as assessed by scanning electron microscopy and in vitro assays. The importance of neuraminidase in biofilm production was further demonstrated by showing that viral neuraminidase inhibitors in clinical use blocked P. aeruginosa biofilm production in vitro as well. The P. aeruginosa neuraminidase has a key role in the initial stages of pulmonary infection by targeting bacterial glycoconjugates and contributing to the formation of biofilm. Inhibiting bacterial neuraminidases could provide a novel mechanism to prevent bacterial pneumonia.
TI  - Comparison of throat swabs and nasopharyngeal suction specimens in non-sputum-producing patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Both throat swabs and nasopharyngeal suction (NPS) specimens are used for microbiological assessment in non-sputum-producing patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), but studies comparing their diagnostic yield are lacking. We, therefore, conducted a prospective study in young CF patients, in which both techniques were performed in random order. Forty-seven consecutive CF children aged 6 months to 10 years were studied during routine visits to the clinic. CF relevant pathogens were found in the majority of patients with no significant differences in the rate of positive cultures for Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A statistically significant difference was observed in the rate of detection of other organisms with only 9/47 (19%) of throat swab specimens and 27/47 (57%) of NPS specimens being positive (P = 0.0004). This included 12 positive cultures for Streptococcus pneumoniae and 11 cultures that were positive for Moraxella catarrhalis, both of which are frequent colonizers of the upper airway. Therefore, the most common bacterial pathogens affecting the CF lung appear to be detected in similar frequency by throat swab as by nasopharyngeal suction. There is evidence that nasopharyngeal suction yields more specimens of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis, which may reflect upper airway colonization rather than lower airway infection. We conclude that nasopharyngeal suction is not routinely warranted as there is no benefit over throat swab in detection of CF pathogens in infants and young children with CF.
TI  - [Use of transport medium in sputum bacterial culture examination of lower airway  infection].
AB  - Our medical institution does not have a bacterial culture facility, requiring outsourcing of bacterial culture tests. Due to the time elapsed from the time of specimen collection to culturing, the identification of causative bacteria in respiratory tract infections tends to be difficult. We therefore used transport medium for sputum bacteria examinations. Expectorated purulent or purulent-mucous sputum specimens were collected from 32 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. We divided each of the sputum specimens into the two treatment groups: transport medium (Seedswab gamma2) ndar and stad disinfection container. Paired samples prepared from each patient were sent out for bacterial culture together. The time elapsed from collection to delivery to the lab were as follows: day 0 (same day, n = 14 patients), day 1 (n = 15), day 2 (n = 2), and day 3 (n = 1). The identified causative bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6 patients), Haemophilus influenzae (n =5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), and Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 1). Samples prepared by each of the two methods gave similar results. The utility of transport medium for examination of general bacteria for lower airway infection from sputum samples was not demonstrated. The rate of detection of bacteria decreased, when the transport of samples was delayed. Therefore, we need to send the sputum specimens as quickly as possible.
TI  - [Antibiotics for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study had for aim to evaluate the rationale and indications for antibiotic treatment in acute exacerbations of COPD and to identify potential differences among various antibiotics available for the treatment of exacerbations in France. METHODS: A search was performed in Medline and for references quoted in identified articles from 1995 to 2005. Open or blind randomized studies involving antibiotics available in France were reviewed. RESULTS: About 50% of all exacerbations are related to bacterial infection. Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the main pathogens responsible for bacterial exacerbations. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp are frequently found in patients with severe functional impairment. Increased purulence of sputum is associated with bacterial infection. Patients with severe functional impairment benefit the most from antibiotic treatment. Although new molecules have larger antibiotic spectrum and better pharmacological properties, the evidence supporting their use compared to standard therapy remains scarce. CONCLUSIONS: Additional studies are needed to better identify the subset of patients benefiting from antibiotics and to determine whether new molecules produce significant improvement on relevant outcomes such as exacerbation free interval compared to standard therapy.
TI  - Bacterial biofilms on the sinus mucosa of human subjects with chronic rhinosinusitis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common disease poorly controlled  by antibiotics. Postulated etiologies of CRS include allergy, fungi, functional factors, and biofilm. OBJECTIVES: We presented a preliminary study demonstrating bacterial biofilms' presence on the sinus mucosa of patients with CRS using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The advantage of FISH in biofilm identification is that it is the only method that identifies the specific bacteria creating the biofilm matrix. We now present the results of a larger series of patients. METHODS: Patients with CRS scheduled for sinus surgery were enrolled in the study. Biopsies of the sinus mucosa and cultures were taken at the time of surgery. Control samples were taken from patients undergoing septoplasty. Specimens underwent FISH testing for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenza, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RESULTS: Bacterial biofilms were present on 14 of 18 specimens. The predominant species were H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and S. aureus. P. aeruginosa biofilm was not identified on any specimens. The intraoperative cultures of the planktonic bacteria present in the sinuses did not correlate with the biofilms identified. Two of the five control samples were positive for biofilm. CONCLUSION: The presence of biofilms on the mucosa of patients with CRS offers a possible cause of antimicrobial therapy failure and could change the approach to treatment. However, the presence of biofilms on healthy control samples implies that biofilms may simply be colonizers. The precise role that biofilms play in CRS still remains to be determined. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed.
TI  - [Guidelines for treatment of pneumonia in intensive care units].
AB  - Patients affected by pneumonia can be admitted in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) independently by the setting where the infection has been acquired (community, hospital, long-term care facilities); even more frequently pneumonia can develop in patients already hospitalized in ICU especially in those requiring mechanical ventilation for different reasons. Within the severe community acquired pneumonia requiring admission in ICU, the most frequently responsible micro-organisms are mainly represented by Streptococcus pneumoniae, but also by Legionella and Haemophilus. Pseudomonas aeruginona, anyway, cannot be excluded. The most recent Canadian and American guidelines for treatment of the above mentioned infections suggest the use of a combination therapy with beta-lactams (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam) and a new generation macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone. In case of allergy to beta-lactams, the association fluoroquinolone-clindamycin should be preferred. Whenever a Pseudomonas etiology is suspected because of the presence of risk factors such as COPD, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, previous and/or frequent therapies with antibiotics and/or steroids, the same guidelines suggest the use of an anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam (such as piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenems, cefepime) associated with an anti-pseudomonas fluoroquinolone (high doses ciprofloxacin). An anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside or aminoglicosyde plus fluoroquinolone can be an alternative. Early onset Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (HAP) and early onset Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) in patients without risk factors for multi-resistant etiological agents are generally sustained by S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, methicillin-susceptible Staphylocccus aureus e Gram negative enteric rods. These infections can be treated with one of the following antibiotics: ceftriaxone or fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin or ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) or ampicillin/sulbactam or ertapenem. Late onset VAP and HAP in patients with risk factors for multi-resistant, by contrast, should be treated with a combination therapy: in case of defined or suspected P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESbL+), Acinetobacter sp etiology, it is required the use of an anti-pseudomonas cephalosporin or an anti-pseudomonas carbapenem or b-lactam + beta-lactamase inhibitor associated with an anti-pseudomonas fluoroquinolone or an aminoglicoside. The possible presence of MRSA or Legionella pneumophila suggests the use of anti-Gram positive antibiotics such as glycopeptides or linezolid. These quidelines confirm the role of ciprofloxacin combined with beta-lactams whenever P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESbL+), Acinetobacter sp. etiology is suspected.
TI  - Quinolones sensitize gram-negative bacteria to antimicrobial peptides.
AB  - The treatment of infections caused by bacteria resistant to the vast majority of  antibiotics is a challenge worldwide. Antimicrobial peptides (APs) make up the front line of defense in those areas exposed to microorganisms, and there is intensive research to explore their use as new antibacterial agents. On the other hand, it is known that subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics affect the expression of numerous bacterial traits. In this work we evaluated whether treatment of bacteria with subinhibitory concentrations of quinolones may alter the sensitivity to APs. A 1-h treatment of Klebsiella pneumoniae with 0.25 x the MIC of ciprofloxacin rendered bacteria more sensitive to polymyxins B and E, human neutrophil defensin 1, and beta-defensin 1. Levofloxacin and nalidixic acid at 0.25 x the MICs also increased the sensitivity of K. pneumoniae to polymyxin B, whereas gentamicin and ceftazidime at 0.25 x the MICs did not have such an effect. Ciprofloxacin also increased the sensitivities of K. pneumoniae ciprofloxacin-resistant strains to polymyxin B. Two other pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae, also became more sensitive to polymyxins B and E after treatment with 0.25 x the MIC of ciprofloxacin. Incubation with ciprofloxacin did not alter the expression of the K. pneumoniae loci involved in resistance to APs. A 1-N-phenyl-naphthylamine assay showed that ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin increased the permeabilities of the K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa outer membranes, while divalent cations antagonized this action. Finally, we demonstrated that ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin increased the binding of APs to the outer membrane by using dansylated polymyxin B.
TI  - Bacteremia in children at a regional hospital in Trinidad.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to provide a Trinidadian perspective on pediatric community-acquired and hospital-acquired bacteremia via the documentation of common etiologic agents, antimicrobial profiles of the isolated pathogens, and patient outcome. METHODS: This was a six-year retrospective study of children with bacteremia admitted to the pediatric wards of the San Fernando General Hospital, Trinidad. RESULTS: Seven hundred and four episodes of pediatric bacteremia were reviewed during the six-year study period. The predominant isolate was Staphylococcus aureus (23.9%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.5%), and Enterobacter spp (11.1%). The remaining isolates each accounted for less than 10% of total isolates. The mortality rate was highest for P. aeruginosa (39.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.5%), and Escherichia coli (19.2%). Of the six cases due to Neisseria meningitidis, only two survived. The overall mortality rate for the study period was 15.1%, but varied considerably according to age. All deaths due to P. aeruginosa and E. coli occurred in neonates. Almost 90% and about half of all S. aureus were resistant to ampicillin and erythromycin, respectively; nineteen (11.3%) were methicillin-resistant. More than 95% of K. pneumoniae and more than 87% of Haemophilus influenzae were resistant to ampicillin. Group B streptococci were fully susceptible to ampicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, but showed >90% and >70% resistance to tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, respectively. Of the 40 strains of S. pneumoniae isolated, 10.0% had a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) >or=4 microg/mL (resistance) and 12.5% had a MIC=2.0 microg/mL (intermediate resistance) to ceftriaxone, while 7.5% showed intermediate resistance (MIC between 0.12 and 1 microg/mL) and 25.0% showed resistance (MIC >or=2 microg/mL) to penicillin. CONCLUSION: The bacteremia rate was found to be 8.4% among hospitalized children suspected of having sepsis and from whom a blood culture was positive. Bacteremia was also associated with a high mortality rate of 15.1%. An unusually high level of bacteremia with Gram-negative enteric bacteria was seen, which might indicate cross infection and reflect a breakdown in infection control measures. Relatively high-level resistance of S. pneumoniae to penicillin and ceftriaxone was not seen, even though the overall prevalence of resistance to other antibiotics among other pathogens was relatively low. The drugs that showed the greatest efficacy were imipenem, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and the cephalosporins ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.
TI  - Etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized patients in Jordan.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the causative organisms of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Jordanian patients requiring hospital admission. METHODS: A prospective study of both adults and children admitted to Princess Basma and Princess Rahma Teaching Hospitals in Irbid, Jordan with a diagnosis of CAP over a 6-month period from April to October 2002. RESULTS: A total of 35 adult patients were admitted with a mean age of 47 years, and 63 children with a mean age of 3 years. A pathogen was isolated from 25 (71%) adults, and from 17 (27%) children, and sputum cultures gave the best diagnostic yield. In adults Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common isolate (26%), followed by Chlamydia pneumoniae (23%), Haemophilus influenzae (17%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (9%), and Legionella pneumophila and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6%) each. Seven of the 9 gram negative isolates were from patients with some co morbid illness. While in children, Chlamydia pneumoniae was the most common (14%), followed by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (6%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3%) each. CONCLUSION: Streptococcus pneumoniae and atypical microorganisms are the most common cause of CAP in previously healthy adults; while in those with associated co morbid illness, gram negative organisms are the likely cause. In children, the overall detection rate of causative organisms was low with atypical microorganisms being the most common.
TI  - Demographics and microbiological profile of pneumonia in United Arab Emirates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is a common respiratory disease, which has a mortality rate of approximately 14% worldwide. The management of pneumonia is based on the patient and microbiological profile existing in the community. There is a paucity of data regarding patient demographics and the microbiological profile for pneumonia in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of in-patients with pneumonia in the UAE. Epidemiological, clinical and microbiological data was collected from patients over the age of 16 years admitted to a single university hospital with a diagnosis of pneumonia between the years 1997 and 2002. Patients were categorised as having community acquired (CAP) or hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP). RESULTS: Among the 361 patients, 186 were females and 175 males. The mean age (+/- SEM) of the males was 59 +/- 1.6 years and of the females, 56.9 +/- 1.5 years. The annual hospital admission rate for pneumonia increased from 410 per million population in 1997 to 760 in 2002. The pneumonia was community acquired in 289 (80%) and hospital acquired in 72 (20%). Hospitalisation for CAP showed a significant seasonal variation with peak admission rates in March and April and the nadir in August and September. The overall mortality rate was 13%, and was significantly higher for HAP (24%) than for CAP (10%, p < 0.01). The common microorganisms isolated from sputum culture in CAP were Haemophilus influenzae (18.6%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (10%). The common pathogen in HAP was Pseudomonas aeruginosa in (50%). 4 out of 17 (23%) H. influenzae isolates were resistant to amoxicillin and 2 of 9 S. pneumoniae isolates (22%) were resistant to penicillin. CONCLUSIONS: The hospitalisation rate for CAP has increased over the years and showed a clear seasonal trend in the UAE. H. influenzae was the most common organism among patients with CAP and P. aeruginosa in HAP. The mortality rate for HAP was significantly higher than for CAP. The drug resistance pattern was similar to reports from centres elsewhere in South East Asia.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of BacT/ALERT 3D and BACTEC systems for the recovery of pathogens causing bloodstream infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare BacT/ALERT (BTA) and BACTEC 9240 (BAC), two continuously monitoring automated blood culture systems, for the recovery of bloodstream pathogens and standard media available for these systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples from 100 adults and 50 paediatric patients suspected of having bloodstream infections were inoculated at the bedside into non-vented BTA and BAC standard blood culture bottles and incubated in their respective instruments. The time to growth detection (TD) was recorded for each bottle that became positive. A quantitative assay was also carried out with 5 standard bloodstream pathogens to assess TD of each pathogen as well as the quantity of organisms recovered. RESULTS: A total of 23 isolates representing true infections were recovered by both BTA and BAC bottles, indicating a blood culture positivity rate of 15.3%, 18 (78.3%) by BTA bottles and 13 (56.5%) by BAC. Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium perfringens were recovered only by the BTA system. The average TDs were 19.0 and 24.6 h for BTA and BAC, respectively. Analysis of the quantitative growth of known pathogens in both systems was more or less the same for Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa but slightly different for Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The anaerobic bottle ofthe BTA did not support the growth of H. influenzae below an inoculum of 10(10) CFU/ml whereas the BAC did so at a lower inoculum of 10(8) CFU/ml. TD for S. pneumoniae in the BTA was about half of that in the BAC. CONCLUSIONS: The BTA system appears to be more efficient in detecting common bloodstream pathogens asa higher inoculum is needed for the BAC system to detect the same organism.
TI  - [A multicentre study on the pathogenic agents in 665 adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia in cities of China].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pathogenic causes of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adult patients in China, the relation of previous antibiotic use and the Pneumonia Patient Outcome Research Team (PORT) classification to microbial etiology, and the prevalence of drug resistance of common CAP bacteria. METHODS: A prospective study was performed on 665 consecutive adult patients with CAP at 12 centers in 7 Chinese cities during one year. The etiology of pneumonia was considered if one of the following criteria was met: (1) valid sputum sample yielding one or more predominant strains; (2) blood cultures yielding a bacterial pathogen; (3) seroconversion, a > or = 4-fold increase or decrease titers of antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of respiratory tract isolates was determined using the agar dilution method. RESULTS: Pathogens were identified in 324/610 patients (53.1%) with valid serum samples and sputum cultures as follows: Mycoplasma pneumoniae (126, 20.7%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (63, 10.3%), Haemophilus influenzae (56, 9.2%), Chlamydia pneumoniae (40, 6.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (37, 6.1%), Legionella pneumophila (31, 5.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (23, 3.8%), Escherichia coli (10, 1.6%), Moraxella catarrhalis (8, 1.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6, 1.0%). Of 195 patients with a bacterial pathogen, an atypical pathogen was identified in 62 (10.2%) cases. The non-susceptibility rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin, azithromycin, and moxifloxacin was 20.3%, 75.4% and 4.3% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Atypical pathogens have important role in CAP, with Mycoplasma pneumoniae being the most common pathogen, and mixed infection of atypical pathogens with bacteria was found in 10.2% of the cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae remain the most important bacteria for CAP. More than 75.0% of Streptococcus pneumoniae was resistant to macrolides and 20.3% was resistant to penicillin.
TI  - [Using antibiotics in case of influenza].
AB  - Acute respiratory bacterial infection is the most common complication of influenza and a leading cause for excess rate of outpatient visits, hospitalization, and death (pneumonia). Influenza promotes bacterial infection as stated by epidemiologic evidence of temporal association between outbreaks or peaks of both influenza and bacterial pneumonia. The bacteria involved are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus. However, Gram-negative rods, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, anaerobes and methicillin resistant S. aureus may be involved in institutionalized elderly patients. Various studies confirm that antibiotics are over-prescribed in patients with influenza or influenza like illness, even in the absence of bacterial infection signs, and in patients without comorbidity. No data has proven the benefice of antibiotic prescription in influenza-infected patients without bacterial infection. Neuraminidase inhibitors may be of interest for the management of influenza infected patients, because they can decrease the risk of bacterial complications and the use of antibiotics.
TI  - Compliance of clinical microbiology laboratories in the United States with current recommendations for processing respiratory tract specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Respiratory tract specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) require unique processing by clinical microbiology laboratories to ensure detection of all potential pathogens. The present study sought to determine the compliance of microbiology laboratories in the United States with recently published recommendations for CF respiratory specimens. Microbiology laboratory protocols from 150 of 190 (79%) CF care sites were reviewed. Most described the use of selective media for Burkholderia cepacia complex (99%), Staphylococcus aureus (82%), and Haemophilus influenzae (89%) and identified the species of all gram-negative bacilli (87%). Only 52% delineated the use of agar diffusion assays for susceptibility testing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Standardizing laboratory practices will improve treatment, infection control, and our understanding of the changing epidemiology of CF microbiology.
TI  - [The analysis of the isolated microorganisms from the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients treated in Children's Memorial Health Institute 1999-2002].
AB  - The aim of the study was, to analyze the microorganisms cultured from materials from the airways of children with cystic fibrosis treated in the Children's Memorial Health Institute in Warsaw during 1999-2002. A total of 411 samples were tested, obtained from the airways of 58 patients with diagnosed mucoviscidosis. The age of the treated patients was within the range of 1 month and 20 years. The bacteriological tests were taken during routine visits in the Consultation and Pulmonology Clinic, which took place 3-4 times a year. The most often isolated strain was Staphylococcus aureus--48%. 17% of the isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and 13% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were obtained. Most S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and H. infiuenzae isolates showed high susceptibility to tested antimicrobial agents. About 6% of all S. aureus isolates were resistant to methicillin (MRSA). S. aureus was occurring in all age groups with the same frequency. The rods H. influenzae were cultured more often from children under 10 years, while P. aeruginosa more often from older patients.
TI  - [Nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2004].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 907 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1790 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 192 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2004 was measured. The results were as follows; 1. MIC90 of MEPM for almost all of enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae were 4-fold to 32-fold lower than those of other carbapenems. MEPM was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and H. influenzae. MEPM were active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. 2. As for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, imipenem (IPM) showed high cross-resistant rate againt meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (87.9%). MEPM showed low cross-resistant rate both againt IPM-resistant P. aeruginosa (49.2%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (38.0%). 3. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in Escherichia coli, 8.0% (2 strains) in Citrobacter koseri, 2.5% (3 strains) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.5% (2 strains) in Enterobacter cloacae, 0.9% (1 strains) in Serratia marcescens, and 2.2% (2 strains) in Proteus mirabilis. The proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 1.6% (5 strains) in P. aeruginosa. 4. Of all species tested, Peptostreptococcus spp. was the only species, which MIC90 of MEPM was more than 4-fold higher than that in our previous study using clinical isolates during 2002 (0.25 microg/ml --> 1 microg/ml). Therefore, there is almost no siginificant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem at present, 9 years after available for commercial use.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from chronic upper and lower respiratory tract infections and  the associated therapeutic strategies--in paranasal sinusitis].
AB  - Nasal sinusitis, tonsillitis, and pharyngolaryngitis typify upper respiratory tract infections, while bronchitis and pneumonia typify lower respiratory tract infections. Cases of paranasal sinusitis with severe suppuration are reportedly becoming less frequent, while those of chronic catarrhal paranasal sinusitis and edematous allergic paranasal sinusitis are becoming more so, The primary factor in paranasal sinusitis, a typical infectious disease encountered in otolaryngology, is bacterial infection. The main causative bacteria are Streptococcus pneumoniae, reported in 13.4% of cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 12.8% Moraxella catarrhalis in 5.5%, Staphylococcus aureus in 26.5%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 5.2%, and anaerobes. The incidence of strains resistant to antimicrobial agents has grown for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis and decreased for S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Acute exacerbation or severe suppuration in chronic paranasal sinusitis requires the administration of antimicrobial agents, with the same agent administered 2 weeks for maximal effect. First-line agents are AMPC/CVA, SBTPC, CDTR-PI, CFPN-PI, and GFLX for adults, with ASPC, SBPC, ACPC, CTRX, CMZ, FMOX, PAPM/BP, and MEPM injected in severe cases. Attention must be paid to strains that resist cephems and macrolides, such as PISP, PRSP, and BLNAR. In refractory chronic paranasal sinusitis, attention must also be paid to biofilms produced by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Suitable antimicrobial agents should be determined for treating of chronic paranasal sinusitis, in addition to the best procedure to ensure early recovery from inflammation, such as puncturing or irrigating the maxillary sinus, injecting a suitable agent, nebulization, and/or surgically widening the middle meatus.
TI  - Moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin protect human respiratory epithelial cells against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae in vitro.
AB  - The fluoroquinolones moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin display excellent in vitro activities against many respiratory tract pathogens. Here we show that moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin accumulate approximately 7- to 10-fold in primary human respiratory epithelial cells, derived from nasal polyps and grown in 3-dimensional vesicles. Furthermore, using these vesicles, we assessed the bactericidal effect of moxifloxacin on Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae and that of ciprofloxacin on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae. Finally, we determined the protective effect of the fluoroquinolones on vesicles infected with these pathogens. All four bacterial strains were highly toxic for vesicles. S. aureus and S. pneumoniae were readily killed by moxifloxacin regardless whether the antibiotics were present intra/extracellularly or only intracellularly in vesicles. Similar results were obtained for the killing of H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa. Exclusively intracellularly located fluoroquinolones rescued 42% to 76% of the cells after bacterial challenge compared to the rescue of 48% to 94% cells when the fluoroquinolones were present intra/ extracellularly. Without addition of fluoroquinolones cell survival in vesicles was 0% to 38%. The results suggest that intracellular accumulation of moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin is important for the protection of respiratory epithelial cells from the cytotoxic effects of major respiratory tract pathogens.
TI  - Microbiology of acute sinusitis in Mexican patients.
AB  - Acute bacterial sinusitis is a common disorder affecting children and adults. We  performed a study to assess the bacteriology of acute sinusitis in a community hospital in Mexico City. Patients with an acute exacerbation of persistent sinusitis or acute sinusitis were enrolled. Aspiration of sinus secretions was performed and aspirates were sent for culture. All patients received antibiotic treatment for the infection based on microbiologic sensitivity reports. Follow-up consultation included endoscopy and a computed tomography scan of paranasal sinuses to assess response to treatment. A total of 110 patients were enrolled for evaluation. Forty nine percent of patients were women; median age was 31 years. A total of 136 cultures were recovered for analysis. Twenty seven percent of cultures were negative. Isolated organisms were Haemophilus influenzae (26%), Moraxella catarrhalis (15%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (14%), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (7%), enterobacteriaceae (6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%) and miscellaneous (3%). Twenty eight percent of H. influenzae strains were resistant to ampicillin. Penicillin-sensitive S. pneumoniae (PSSP) and penicillin-intermediate-resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP) accounted for 21% and 79% of the S. pneumoniae strains, respectively. H. influenzae was the most common isolated organism. About 55% of those isolates were found in patients <18 years old and only 25% were resistant to ampicillin. Sinus endoscopy continues to be a useful diagnostic tool in addition to imaging studies in sinus infection and should be pursued by the clinician whenever feasible.
TI  - Patterns and outcome of acute bacterial meningitis in a South Indian tertiary level hospital.
AB  - A retrospective analysis of childhood Acute Bacterial Meningitis from a tertiary  care hospital in Bangalore revealed a winter clustering of cases and an absence of typical signs and symptoms in 40% of patients, with Staphylococcus aureus (10%) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus (9%) being the most common etiological agents. Mortality rate was 8.5%. High priority for the prevention of disease by these pathogens, especially in rural population and during winter, and a high degree of alertness for the detection of atypical disease is warranted.
TI  - Nosocomial pneumonia : rationalizing the approach to empirical therapy.
AB  - Nosocomial pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) causes considerable morbidity and mortality. It is the second most common nosocomial infection and the leading cause of death from hospital-acquired infections. In 1996 the American Thoracic Society (ATS) published guidelines for empirical therapy of HAP. This review focuses on the literature that has appeared since the ATS statement. Early diagnosis of HAP and its etiology is crucial in guiding empirical therapy. Since 1996, it has become clear that differentiating mere colonization from etiologic pathogens infecting the lower respiratory tract is best achieved by employing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or protected specimen brush (PSB) in combination with quantitative culture and detection of intracellular microorganisms. Endotracheal aspirate and non-bronchoscopic BAL/PSB in combination with quantitative culture provide a good alternative in patients suspected of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Since culture results take 2-3 days, initial therapy of HAP is by definition empirical. Epidemiologic studies have identified the most frequently involved pathogens: Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus ('core pathogens'). Empirical therapy covering only the 'core pathogens' will suffice in patients without risk factors for resistant microorganisms. Studies that have appeared since the ATS statement issued in 1996, demonstrate several new risk factors for HAP with multiresistant pathogens. In patients with risk factors, empirical therapy should consist of antibacterials with a broader spectrum. The most important risk factors for resistant microorganisms are late onset of HAP (>/=5 days after admission), recent use of antibacterial therapy, and mechanical ventilation. Multiresistant bacteria of specific interest are methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Each of these organisms has its specific susceptibility pattern, demanding appropriate antibacterial treatment. To further improve outcomes, specific therapeutic options for multiresistant pathogens and pharmacological factors are discussed. Antibacterials developed since 1996 or antibacterials with renewed interest (linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin, meropenem, new fluoroquinolones, and fourth-generation cephalosporins) are discussed in the light of developing resistance.Since the ATS statement, many reports have shown increasing incidences of resistant microorganisms. Therefore, one of the most important conclusions from this review is that empirical therapy for HAP should not be based on general guidelines alone, but that local epidemiology should be taken into account and used in the formulation of local guidelines.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of doripenem (S-4661): a global surveillance report (2003).
AB  - The spectrum of activity and potency of doripenem, a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem currently in clinical development, was evaluated using 16 008 clinical bacterial isolates collected as part of an international surveillance project during 2003. Using reference broth microdilution methods, doripenem was found to be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2705 and 297 isolates, respectively; MIC90s 0.06 mg/L), with a potency greater than that of other carbapenem antibiotics. Against enterococci (1474 isolates), with the exception of Enterococcus faecium, doripenem displayed modest activity (MIC50 4). Doripenem was among the most potent agents tested against Streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci (885, 140 and 397 isolates; MIC(90)s 0.5, 0.5 and 0.03 mg/L, respectively). For Enterobacteriaceae (> 6200 isolates), doripenem was four- to 32-fold more active than imipenem against wild-type isolates (MIC90s 0.03-0.5 mg/L). MIC90s for confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (121 and 155 isolates; 0.06 and 0.12 mg/L, respectively) were two-fold higher than for wild-type isolates. Doripenem was also active against Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp. and Serratia spp. (MIC90s 0.06-0.25 mg/L), including ceftazidime-resistant isolates. Doripenem and meropenem were the most active agents among all beta-lactams against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (829 isolates; MIC50/90s 0.5/8 and 0.5/16 mg/L, respectively), whereas doripenem and imipenem were the most active agents against Acinetobacter spp. (155 isolates; MIC50/90s 0.5/4 and <or= 0.5/2 mg/L, respectively). Doripenem was slightly more potent (MIC50 2 mg/L) than ertapenem and imipenem (MIC50 4 mg/L), and had a potency similar to that of meropenem (MIC50 2 mg/L), against Burkholderia cepacia (20 isolates). Both Haemophilus influenzae (1824 isolates) and Moraxella catarrhalis (108 isolates), including beta-lactamase-positive isolates, were susceptible to doripenem (MIC90s 0.25 and 0.03 mg/L, respectively). Doripenem displays the favourable characteristics of other carbapenems, and appears to offer certain advantages in terms of potency, spectrum and beta-lactamase stability when compared with some carbapenems used currently to treat nosocomial infections.
TI  - Conserved role of the linker alpha-helix of the bacterial disulfide isomerase DsbC in the avoidance of misoxidation by DsbB.
AB  - In the bacterial periplasm the co-existence of a catalyst of disulfide bond formation (DsbA) that is maintained in an oxidized state and of a reduced enzyme that catalyzes the rearrangement of mispaired cysteine residues (DsbC) is important for the folding of proteins containing multiple disulfide bonds. The kinetic partitioning of the DsbA/DsbB and DsbC/DsbD pathways partly depends on the ability of DsbB to oxidize DsbA at rates >1000 times greater than DsbC. We show that the resistance of DsbC to oxidation by DsbB is abolished by deletions of one or more amino acids within the alpha-helix that connects the N-terminal dimerization domain with the C-terminal thioredoxin domain. As a result, mutant DsbC carrying alpha-helix deletions could catalyze disulfide bond formation and complemented the phenotypes of dsbA cells. Examination of DsbC homologues from Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Erwinia chrysanthemi, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Vibrio cholerae (30-70% sequence identity with the Escherichia coli enzyme) revealed that the mechanism responsible for avoiding oxidation by DsbB is a general property of DsbC family enzymes. In addition we found that deletions in the linker region reduced, but did not abolish, the ability of DsbC to assist the formation of active vtPA and phytase in vivo, in a DsbD-dependent manner, revealing that interactions between DsbD and DsbC are also conserved.
TI  - [Study of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of levofloxacin].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the dosing regimens of levofloxacin. METHODS: The drug concentrations in serum and urine were assayed by HPLC method and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated after intravenous infusion of a single dose of 200 mg, 300 mg and 500 mg levofloxacin to healthy volunteers. The in vitro activity MIC of levofloxacin against 823 clinical isolates were determined and compared with other antimicrobial agents. Based on the above results, the PK/PD parameters C(max)/MIC and AUC/MIC were calculated and the dosing regimens of levofloxacin were proposed for infections caused by different pathogens. RESULTS: The results of clinical pharmacokinetic study showed that the C(max) of levofloxacin was 3.4 mg/L +/- 0.8 mg/L, 4.8 mg/L +/- 1.4 mg/L and 7.6 mg/L +/- 1.1 mg/L respectively, AUC(0-infinity) was 14.4 mg.h/L +/- 2.5 mg.h/L, 21.9 mg.h/L +/- 4.5 mg.h/L and 38.3 mg.h/L +/- 4.9 mg.h/L respectively, T(1)/2 beta was 6.2 h +/- 0.4 h, 6.4 h +/- 0.9 h and 6.5 h +/- 0.6 h respectively, and 69% +/- 5%, 69% +/- 6%, and 65% +/- 4% of the doses were excreted in urine within 24 h after intravenous infusion of a single dose of levofloxacin 200 mg, 300 mg and 500 mg. The in vitro pharmacodynamic study showed that levofloxacin was highly active against Hemolytic streptococcus and Moraxella catarrhalis. It was active against Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin nonsusceptible strains), Hemophilus influenzae, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Levofloxacin also had good activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and K.pneumoniae. However, most of isolates of enterococcal spp. were resistant to levofloxacin. Above 50% of Escherichia coli isolates were resistant to levofloxacin. Based on the results of PK/PD parameters, the adequate dosing regimens of levofloxacin should be once daily 200 mg once daily of levofloxacin was expected to be effective for the treatment of infections caused by M. catarrhalis. The regimen of 300 mg once daily could be effective for the treatment of infections caused by Hemolytic streptococcus. 500 mg once daily of levofloxacin was expected to be effective for the treatment of respiratory tract infections caused by S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae. For treatment of respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections caused by levofloxacin-susceptible organisms including K. pneumoniae, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S.maltophilia, 500 mg once daily of levofloxacin was needed to obtain good clinical efficacy. But PK/PD parameters predicted that 500 mg daily of levofloxacin was not effective for infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococci. CONCLUSION: The proposed dosing regimens of levofloxacin based on PK/PD concepts are expected to provide good efficacy in clinical practice.
TI  - Sputum bacteriology in patients hospitalized with acute exacerbations of chronic  obstructive pulmonary disease and concomitant pneumonia in Hong Kong.
AB  - AIM: To study the sputum microbiology of patients admitted to a teaching hospital with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) with concomitant pneumonia. METHODS: This was a retrospective study in a tertiary university hospital in Hong Kong. All episodes of AECOPD with pneumonia, patient demographics, length of stay, sputum culture and radiological results admitted in the first half of the year 2000 were retrieved from hospital records. RESULTS: There were 118 patients (91 male) with 150 episodes of AECOPD with concomitant pneumonia. The age of the patients was 74.8 +/- 10.0 years. Positive routine sputum culture was detected in 45.6% of the patients. Among these hospital admissions, 8.7, 4.0 and 12.0%, respectively, required intensive care unit admissions, mechanical ventilation and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. Haemophilus influenzae was the commonest organism found in sputum (26.0%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3.4%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (3.4%). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was found in 1.5% of the admissions. The presence of P. aeruginosa in sputum was associated with a longer hospital length of stay (9.1 +/- 3.1 vs. 7.1 +/- 4.2 days, P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: In contrast to most other studies reporting S. pneumoniae as the most likely bacterial pathogen, H. influenzae was the commonest bacterium isolated in sputum in our patients with AECOPD and concomitant pneumonia.
TI  - Human airway epithelial cells sense Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection via recognition of flagellin by Toll-like receptor 5.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic respiratory pathogen that infects the majority of patients with cystic fibrosis, initiates host inflammatory responses through interaction with airway epithelial cells. The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of pathogen pattern recognition receptors that play key roles in host innate immunity. In this study we aimed to determine whether TLRs mediate the interaction between P. aeruginosa and airway epithelial cells. Individual murine TLRs (TLR1 to TLR9) and dual combinations of these TLRs that activate an NF-kappaB-driven luciferase reporter in response to PAO1 were screened in HEK 293 cells. TLR5, TLR2, a combination of TLR1 and TLR2, or a combination of TLR2 and TLR6 responded to PAO1. Another P. aeruginosa strain, strain PAK, activated TLR5 similarly, while the isogenic flagellin-deficient strain PAK/fliC and the flagellum-free bacterium Haemophilus influenzae failed to activate TLR5. Reverse transcription-PCR was used to probe the presence of multiple TLRs (including TLR5) in primary human airway epithelial cells (HAECs). Immunostaining with TLR5 antibodies showed that TLR5 was expressed in HAECs and on the apical surface of the human trachea epithelium. In HAECs, PAO1, PAK, and Burkholderia cepacia, but not flagellin-deficient strain PAK/fliC or a B. cepacia fliC mutant, activated the NF-kappaB reporter. Dominant negative TLR5 specifically blocked the response to P. aeruginosa but not to the response to lipoteichoic acid, a specific ligand of TLR2. We also determined that MyD88, IRAK, TRAF6, and Toll-interacting protein (Tollip), but not TIRAP, were involved in the TLR-mediated response to P. aeruginosa in HAECs. These findings demonstrate that the airway epithelial receptor TLR5 senses P. aeruginosa through its flagellin protein, which may have an important role in the initiation of the host inflammatory reaction to clear the invading pathogen.
TI  - Azithromycin and lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that has been structurally modified from erythromycin with an expanded spectrum of activity and improved tissue pharmacokinetic characteristics relative to erythromycin. This allows once-daily administration for 3-5 days of treatment compared with traditional multi dosing 7-10-day treatment regimens. It has been successfully employed in lower respiratory tract infections. Recent data indicate that azithromycin may exert anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory effects that may be of use in the treatment of both acute and chronic airway diseases. This review examines the role of azithromycin in lower respiratory tract infections analysing published data on exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia and cystic fibrosis both in adults and children. In addition, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the drug are also considered.
TI  - [Q fever in acute exacerbation of chronic lower respiratory tract infection].
AB  - We studied the effect of Q fever in acute exacerbation of chronic lower respiratory tract infection. The subjects consisted of 80 cases with acute exacerbation of chronic lower respiratory tract infection treated during the period from March 2002 till October 2004. Q fever was diagnosed using a PanBio Coxiella burnetii ELISA test kit. Two cases (2.5%) were positive for IgM in the acute stage, and were diagnosed as having acute infection by C. burnetii. They were elderly women with bronchiectasis, aged 76 and 82. They had no history of keeping cats or dogs, but the onset of acute exacerbation of chronic lower respiratory tract infection was June and March which is the breeding seasons for cats and dogs. Acute exacerbation of chronic lower respiratory tract infection were considerd to be a mixed infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (the 76-year-case) and Haemophilus influenzae (the 82-year-case). It is concluded that C. burnetii can induce exacerbation of chronic lower respiratory tract infection, their cases were considerd to be mixed infection with C. burnetii and other bacteria.
TI  - Sensitivity of respiratory bacteria to lignocaine.
AB  - AIM: Lignocaine, a topical anaesthetic agent, is generally used in variable concentrations usually between 2% and 4% on the vocal cords prior to flexible bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) procedures. The aim of this study was to investigate whether 2% or 1% lignocaine significantly inhibits the growth of organisms commonly found in the respiratory tract, in particular Streptococcus pneumoniae. METHOD: In order to determine the antibiotic effect of lignocaine on lower respiratory tract flora, five different organisms were examined in vitro using well diffusion, disc diffusion and microbroth dilution against 1% and 2% concentrations of lignocaine. RESULTS: Antimicrobial activity could not be detected using the well diffusion and the disc diffusion methods, as lignocaine failed to diffuse through the media. The microbroth dilution method showed reproducible bactericidal effect of these respiratory isolates against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae at 2% concentration. Lignocaine 2% showed no growth inhibition against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Lignocaine 1% also partially inhibited S. pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: As lignocaine shows significant inhibition of respiratory pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae even at a concentration of 1%, the lowest concentration possible should be used for flexible bronchoscopy and BAL to maximise the chance of recovery of these organisms.
TI  - Oxymetazoline solutions inhibit middle ear pathogens and are not ototoxic.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to explore the antimicrobial activity of two commercially available oxymetazoline hydrochloride preparations against the common pathogens of otitis media and to demonstrate the lack of ototoxicity of these agents and of United States Pharmacopeia (USP) oxymetazoline in a standard animal model. METHODS: Disc diffusion assays and minimum inhibitory concentration studies against American Type Culture Collection reference strains of common middle ear pathogens were used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of oxymetazoline solutions and fluoroquinolone drops, and outer hair cell counts were performed on scanning electron micrographs of guinea pig basal cochlear segments after chronic exposure to oxymetazoline solutions and positive and negative controls. RESULTS: Oxymetazoline nasal spray and eyedrops had activity against all species tested except Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The USP oxymetazoline had limited antimicrobial activity. Oxymetazoline nasal spray, oxymetazoline eyedrops, and USP oxymetazoline had ototoxicity profiles indistinguishable from that of the saline solution control. CONCLUSIONS: Commercially available oxymetazoline solutions are active against several of the common pathogens of otitis media. This antimicrobial activity is not due to oxymetazoline, and is more likely due to preservatives present in the solutions. The solutions tested are not ototoxic to guinea pig outer hair cells. Oxymetazoline solutions are potential substitutes for broad-spectrum antibiotic drops after tympanostomy tube placement.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of SM-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - SM-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. In agar dilution susceptibility testing, the MIC of SM-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains tested (MIC(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. SM-216601 was also very potent against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (MIC(90) = 8 microg/ml). SM-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, with MIC(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The therapeutic efficacy of SM-216601 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by S. aureus, E. faecium, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. Thus, SM-216601 is a promising candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2003)].
AB  - From October 2003 to September 2004, we collected the specimen from 399 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 12 institutions in Japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. Of 474 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 469 strains were examined. The breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 76, Streptococcus pneumoniae 81, Haemophilus influenzae 84, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 56, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 11, Klebsiella pneumoniae 36, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 24, etc. Of 76 S. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-susceptible S. aureus: MSSA) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) were both 38 strains (50.0%). Against MSSA, imipenem had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/mL. Against MRSA, vancomycin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/mL. Arbekacin also showed the potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 4 microg/mL. Carbapenems showed the most potent activities against S. pneumoniae and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.125-0.5 microg/mL. Cefozopran (CZOP) also had a preferable activity (MIC90:2 microg/ mL) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 4 microg/mL. In contrast, there were high-resistant strains (MIC: 128 microg/mL or more) for cefaclor (11.1%), erythromycin (43.2%), and clindamycin (40.7%). Against H. influenzae, levofloxacin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of 83 of all the strains (98.8%) at 0.063 microg/mL. Tobramycin showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) and its MIC90 was 2 microg/mL. The activity of CZOP also was preferable and its MIC90 was 4 microg/mL for the mucoid-type and 8 microg/mL for the non-mucoid type. CZOP was the most potent activities against K. pneumoniae and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.125 microg/mL. Also, all the agents generally showed potent activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis and the MIC90 of them were 4 microg/mL or less. The approximately half the number (54.1%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. Bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for 46.1% and 30.6% of all the respiratory infection, respectively. The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were S. aureus (18.6%) and H. influenzae (18.1%). In contrast, S. aureus (16.9%) and S. pneumoniae (14.9%) were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. Before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were S. pneumoniae (20.6%) and H. influenzae (21.5%). The bacteria relatively frequently isolated from the patients treated with cephems or macrolides were P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus was relatively frequently isolated from the patients treated with quinolones.
TI  - [Surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to panipenem between 2000 and 2003].
AB  - For the post-marketing surveillance of panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP, Carbenin),  MICs of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including PAPM against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over Japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. In the first surveillance from June 2000 to March 2001, 1,356 isolates of 28 species were tested, 1,221 isolates of the same 28 species were tested in the second surveillance from April 2001 to March 2002, and 1,403 isolates of the same 28 species were tested in the third surveillance from April 2002 to March 2003. No remarkable changes in the activity of PAPM were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. The activity of PAPM in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before Carbenin was launched. This result suggests that PAPM still maintains potent activity. In these surveillances spanning three years, the incidence rates of resistance in various species were as follows (2000.6-2001.3 --> 2001.4-2002.3 --> 2002.4-2003.3): methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (39.3% --> 43.9% --> 47.3%), penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (48.9% --> 44.2% --> 25.7%), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP, 13.8% --> 26.3% --> 43.2%), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (0.9% --> 0% --> 1.4%), ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 1.3% --> 3.1%), beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae (19.2% --> 8.9% --> 42.9%), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR, 22.1% --> 30.7% --> 33.0%), and metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.0% --> 4.4% --> 1.0%). PAPM showed the most potent activity among tested drugs against PRSP, whose incidence rate increased notably. BLNAR, whose incidence rates also increased, exhibited low susceptibility to all tested drugs and metallo-beta-lactamase-producing P. aeruginosa also exhibited high resistance. The findings of this surveillance indicate that it is necessary to pay careful attention to the trends of resistant bacteria such as PRSP, BLNAR, and metallo-beta-lactamase producing strains.
TI  - Prevalence of etiologic bacteria and beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis at Phramongkutklao Hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To date, there is an increasing trend of prescribing antibiotics that cover beta-lactamase-producing bacteria as the first line drug for sinusitis patients in Thailand This practice dose not only increases the treatment cost but might also induce resistance to antimicrobial agents. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of the pathogenic bacteria in acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis as well as the prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The maxillary aspiration fluid specimens of 52 acute and chronic sinusitis patients at Phramongkutklao Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand during May 2002-May 2003, were collected. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were performed and the beta-lactamase activities of isolated bacteria were determined. RESULTS: Of 58 specimens, 44 (75.9%) and 14 (24.1%) specimens were collected from acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis patients, respectively. Of 44 specimens of acute maxillary sinusitis, the predominant isolates were Haemophilus influenzae (13, 29.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (4, 9%), Streptococcus viridan (4, 9%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4, 9%). 6 (13.6%) of them were beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. Of 14 specimens of chronic maxillary sinusitis, the predominant isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3, 16.6%), Staphylococcus spp (3, 17.5%) and Streptococcus spp. (2, 11.6%). 1 (7.1%) Haemophilus influenza isolate from this group was beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. The percentage of anaerobe was 8.9%, 23.3% for acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis, respectively. CONCLUSION: The present study was indicated that the common organisms in acute maxillary sinusitis were Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus viridians which were similar to a previous study. But the authors found an increased prevalence of anaerobe bacteria in acute maxillary sinusitis and also found beta-lactamase-producing bacteria, 21.4% Hemophilus influenzae less than the previous studies (which found beta-lactamase-producing bacteria around 50% to 70%). The authors found 23.3% anaerobe bacteria in the chronic maxillary sinusitis, less than the previous studies, and the authors also found 8.9% anaerobe in acute maxillary sinusitis.
TI  - Respiratory tract infection caused by bacteria (non-Mycobacterium) and their antibiogram in HIV-positive patients.
AB  - Abstract. This study was undertaken from 1995-2000 to investigate the cause of respiratory tract infection among 481 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. The positive rate of bacterial pathogens was 38.46%. Pseudomonas aeruginosa appeared to be the most common pathogen (32.97%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (18.92%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.81 %), Haemophilus influenzae (7.57%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (5.95%). P. aeruginosa was sensitive to netilmycin, amikacin, imipenem, meropenem, cefoperazone/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, and gentamicin (67-84%). S. aureus was sensitive to vancomycin and teicoplanin (100%).
TI  - A facile synthesis of the GalNAcbeta1-->4Gal target sequence of respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The carbohydrate sequence, GalNAcbeta1-->4Gal, is the target for the adhesion of  several respiratory pathogens. The sequence was prepared in an optimized synthesis in forms that allow conjugation to scaffolds or surfaces.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against 6792 Gram-negative and Gram-positive clinical isolates from the global Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program, 2004).
AB  - Tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity against many common pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. To determine the activity of tigecycline against a broad range of pathogens from diverse populations and geographic areas, the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program) commenced in 2003. This study evaluated the activity of tigecycline and commonly used antimicrobials against 6792 clinical isolates from 40 study centers in 11 countries. Tigecycline was the most active agent tested against Gram-positive facultative species including multidrug-resistant strains. MIC90 results (microg/mL) for tigecycline against Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.12, 0.12, 0.25, and 0.25 microg/mL, respectively. Tigecycline was active against Enterobacteriaceae with an MIC90 of 1 microg/mL. Haemophilus influenzae was very susceptible to tigecycline with an MIC90 of only 0.25 microg/mL. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the least susceptible organism tested against tigecycline. Tigecycline appears to be a promising new glycylcycline agent for the treatment of many types of pathogens with varying resistance phenotypes.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of tigecycline tested against organisms causing community-acquired respiratory tract infection and nosocomial pneumonia.
AB  - Emerging antimicrobial resistance among respiratory tract pathogens has created a critical need for development of new antimicrobial agents that are not affected by the commonly occurring genetic resistance mechanisms. Tigecycline, a novel broad-spectrum parenteral glycylcycline, has been shown to be active against many of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, atypical, and anaerobic organisms, including strains highly resistant to commonly prescribed antimicrobials and was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating infections of skin and skin structures, and for intra-abdominal infections. In this study, tigecycline spectrum and potency were evaluated against a global collection of pathogens (2000-2004) recovered from community-acquired respiratory infections (7580 strains) or from hospitalized patients with pneumonia (3183 strains). Among community-acquired infections, the ranking pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae (52.9%; 21% ampicillin-resistant), Streptococcus pneumoniae (39.2%; 23.7% penicillin-nonsusceptible), and Moraxella catarrhalis (7.9%). Tigecycline displayed potent activity by inhibiting 100% of the 3 species at clinically achievable concentrations (2, 1, and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively). The 10 most prevalent pathogens producing 94.3% of pneumonias in hospitalized patients were Staphylococcus aureus (48.5% of strains; 49.4% oxacillin-resistant), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.6%), Klebsiella spp. (5.6%), S. pneumoniae (4.6%), Acinetobacter spp. (4.5%), Enterobacter spp. (4.0%), Escherichia coli (3.8%), Serratia marcescens (2.5%), Enterococcus spp. (2.3%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.8%), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (1.1%). At a concentration of 4 microg/mL, tigecycline inhibited >96% of these pathogens (exception, P. aeruginosa). S. aureus was readily inhibited by tigecycline (MIC50 and MIC90, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively) with all strains inhibited at < or =1 microg/mL. Streptococci recovered from hospitalized patients (beta-hemolytic and S. pneumoniae) were also very susceptible to tigecycline with the highest MIC being 0.12 microg/mL. All E. coli (including 13.3% with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [ESBL] phenotype) were inhibited by < or =1 microg/mL, and all Klebsiella (25.8% ESBL phenotype) and Enterobacter spp. plus 97.0% of Serratia spp. were inhibited by < or =4 microg/mL. Tigecycline was also active against Acinetobacter spp. and S. maltophilia strains (MIC50 and MIC90, 1 and 4 microg/mL, respectively). Further clinical studies should consider the role that tigecycline may play in the therapy for severe respiratory tract infections, both of nosocomial and community origin.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against 3989 Gram-negative and Gram-positive clinical isolates from the United States Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program; 2004).
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program) determined the in vitro activity of tigecycline over a large population of organisms from geographically diverse sites. Tigecycline was compared to amikacin, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, imipenem, cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, minocycline, piperacillin/tazobactam, linezolid, penicillin, and vancomycin against 3989 commonly encountered clinical Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens collected from sites in the United States during 2004. The tigecycline activity was equivalent to imipenem against Enterobacteriaceae. Tigecycline inhibited extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and AmpC phenotypes at MIC90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration) of < or =2 microg/mL. In vitro results for tigecycline were similar to other broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents against nonfermenters with MIC90 results of 2 microg/mL against Acinetobacter spp. and >16 microg/mL against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Tigecycline demonstrated potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.25 microg/mL) and enterococci (MIC90, 0.12 microg/mL) regardless of methicillin or vancomycin susceptibility. Tigecycline MIC values were unaffected by penicillin nonsusceptibility and beta-lactamase production among fastidious respiratory pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae [MIC90, 0.5 microg/mL] and Haemophilus influenzae [MIC90, 0.25 microg/mL]). Tigecycline offers excellent activity against most of the commonly encountered nosocomial and community-acquired bacterial pathogens.
TI  - The antibiotic treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia admitted to the critical care unit.
AB  - Community-acquired pneumonias (CAP) are still caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis. Legionella and Chlamydia pneumoniae have been defined as important atypical pathogens causing CAP. Klebsiella causes CAP primarily in patients with chronic alcoholism or in chronic care facilities. Normal hosts do not present with "unusual pathogens'' e.g., Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The clinical severity of a bacterial pneumonia has important prognostic implications and predicts admission to intensive care units, duration of therapy, and complications. The factors that determine the severity of a CAP are less related to the pathogen than the underlying cardiopulmonary status of the patient as well as the patient's humoral immunity. Relatively avirulent pathogens may result in severe CAP in patients with diminished/absent splenic function or significant cardiopulmonary disease. A critical concept is to appreciate that the selection of antimicrobial therapy is not dependent on co-morbidities since the antimicrobial therapy is directed against the pathogen and not the co-morbidities. Therefore the treatment of CAP, whether moderate or severe is with the same antibiotic at the same dose. Many antibiotic regimens are equally efficacious in the treatment of CAP. The most cost effective optimal regimen covers both typical and atypical pathogens, e.g., levofloxacin, and is currently the preferred antibiotic approach to moderate or severe CAP in the CCU.
TI  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa: role in the pathogenesis of the CF lung lesion.
AB  - Lung disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with  cystic fibrosis (CF), with P. aeruginosa the main pulmonary infectious agent. Although CF patients can become infected with other microorganisms (such as Burkholderia cepacia complex, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical mycobacteria), P. aeruginosa predominates, eventually infecting approximately 80% of patients. Once established, P. aeruginosa infection usually persists until death. The interaction between the CF host and this opportunistic pathogen is unique and most likely directly contributes to the classical end-stage pathology of CF lung disease. However, the extent to which this constitutes success by the pathogen or failure by the host, or both, is yet to be determined. Many important questions remain regarding host susceptibility, the role of both innate and adaptive immune defenses, bacterial infectivity and transmission, and pathogen virulence factors. Here, we discuss some recent advances toward understanding this complex interaction between host and pathogen and how the interplay influences the CF lung lesion.
TI  - The role of biofilms in airway disease.
AB  - Biofilms are defined as collections of microorganisms attached to a surface and embedded in a matrix. This attached state is the primary mode of microbial growth in the environment and within the body. However, biofilms represent a significant clinical concern because they are recalcitrant to antimicrobial agents. This is particularly troublesome in the respiratory tract where biofilms clearly complicate traditional therapies. This review focuses on the biology, development, and antimicrobial resistance properties of biofilms formed by three significant respiratory tract pathogens; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae. Recent research has begun to shed light on the molecular events governing biofilm formation and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms with these organisms. A deeper understanding of these concepts will be necessary for the development of rational strategies to control biofilms in the future.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of CS-023 (RO4908463), a novel parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - CS-023 (RO4908463, formerly R-115685) is a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem with 5-substituted pyrrolidin-3-ylthio groups, including an amidine moiety at the C-2 position. Its antibacterial activity was tested against 1,214 clinical isolates of 32 species and was compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, amikacin, and levofloxacin. CS-023 exhibited a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CS-023 showed the most potent activity among the compounds tested against P. aeruginosa and MRSA, with MICs at which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited of 4 microg/ml and 8 microg/ml, respectively. CS-023 was stable against hydrolysis by the beta-lactamases from Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris. CS-023 also showed potent activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli. The in vivo efficacy of CS-023 was evaluated with a murine systemic infection model induced by 13 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens and a lung infection model induced by 2 strains of PRSP (serotypes 6 and 19). Against the systemic infections with PRSP, MRSA, and P. aeruginosa and the lung infections, the efficacy of CS-023 was comparable to those of imipenem/cilastatin and vancomycin (tested against lung infections only) and superior to those of meropenem, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime (tested against P. aeruginosa infections only). These results suggest that CS-023 has potential for the treatment of nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and -negative pathogens, including MRSA and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory therapy in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Inflammation plays a major role in the pathophysiology of lung disease in CF. This response is probably triggered primarily as a reaction to the inability of the affected lung to resist the invasion of the most common bacterial pathogens seen in this disease, namely, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Debate continues as to whether there may or may not be a pre-inflammation of the lungs as part of the basic functional defect of CFTR. The anti-inflammatory treatment modalities most tested to date are: oral corticosteroids, effective but associated with significant long-term side effects, inhaled corticosteroids, so far not proven to be effective probably because of difficulty with absorption through the viscid surface secretions of the lung and ibuprofen, potentially effective but inhibited by the need to monitor drug levels invasively and potential gastrointestinal side effects. The most promising newcomer is macrolide antibiotics such as azithromycin acting as a long-term anti-inflammatory agent with an excellent safety profile.
TI  - Peptides selected for binding to a virulent strain of Haemophilus influenzae by phage display are bactericidal.
AB  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is an obligate parasite of the oropharynx of humans, in whom it commonly causes mucosal infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, and bronchitis. We used a subtractive phage display approach to affinity select for peptides binding to the cell surface of a novel invasive NTHi strain R2866 (also called Int1). Over half of the selected phage peptides tested were bactericidal toward R2866 in a dose-dependent manner. Five of the clones encoded the same peptide sequence (KQRTSIRATEGCLPS; clone hi3/17), while the remaining four clones encoded unique peptides. All of the bactericidal phage peptides but one were cationic and had similar physical-chemical properties. Clone hi3/17 possessed a similar level of activity toward a panel of clinical NTHi isolates and H. influenzae type b strains but lacked bactericidal activity toward gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica) bacteria. These data indicate that peptides binding to bacterial surface structures isolated by phage display may prove of value in developing new antibiotics.
TI  - Investigation of the susceptibility trends in Japan to fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial agents in a nationwide collection of clinical isolates: a longitudinal analysis from 1994 to 2002.
AB  - The susceptibilities of clinical isolates to fluoroquinolones (FQs) and other antimicrobial agents were surveyed to obtain an accurate understanding of the trends in incidence and antimicrobial resistance. The samples were collected from across Japan, biennially, between 1994 and 2002 and a defined level of resistance to FQ determined. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae exhibited stable and high rates of susceptibility to FQ over the period examined. For methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus the rate of resistance to FQ was 80%-90%, markedly higher than that of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. The rate of FQ-resistant Escherichia coli increased rapidly to approximately 10% for samples after 2000. Of 696 E. coli isolates collected in 2002, 13 produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), with 6 of 13 ESBL-producing isolates being FQ-resistant. No FQ resistance in clinical isolates of Salmonella spp. was detected in any of the surveys. The rate of FQ resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from urinary tract and respiratory tract infections was 40%-60% and 15%-25%, respectively.
TI  - Microbiology and antimicrobial management of sinusitis.
AB  - Sinusitis generally develops as a complication of viral or allergic inflammation  of the upper respiratory tract. The bacterial pathogens in acute sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, while anaerobic bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus are predominant in chronic sinusitis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has emerged as a potential pathogen in immunocompromised patients and in those who have nasal tubes or catheters, or are intubated. Many of these organisms recovered from sinusitis became resistant to penicillins either through the production of beta-lactamase (H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. aureus, Fusobacterium spp., and Prevotella spp) or through changes in the penicillin-binding protein (S. pneumoniae). The pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria is expressed directly through their ability to cause infections, and indirectly through the production of betalactamase. The indirect pathogenicity is conveyed not only by surviving penicillin therapy, but also by 'shielding' penicillin-susceptible pathogens from the drug. The direct and indirect virulent characteristics of these bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections. The antimicrobials that are the most effective in management of acute sinusitis are amoxycillin-clavulanate (given in a high dose), the newer quinolones (gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin) and the second generation cephalosporins (cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefprozil or cefdinir). The antimicrobials that are the most effective in management of chronic sinusitis are amoxycillinclavulanate, clindamycin and the combination of metronidazole and a penicillin.
TI  - Guide to selection of fluoroquinolones in patients with lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Newer fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin and gemifloxacin have several attributes that make them excellent choices for the therapy of lower respiratory tract infections. In particular, they have excellent intrinsic activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and the atypical respiratory pathogens. Fluoroquinolones may be used as monotherapy to treat high-risk patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and for patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalisation, but not admission to intensive care. Overall, the newer fluoroquinolones often achieve clinical cure rates in > or =90% of these patients. However, rates may be lower in hospital-acquired pneumonia, and this infection should be treated on the basis of anticipated organisms and evaluation of risk factors for specific pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this setting, an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone may be used in combination with an antipseudomonalbeta-lactam. Concerns are now being raised about the widespread use, and possibly misuse, of fluoroquinolones and the emergence of resistance among S. pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. A number of pharmacokinetic parameters such as the peak concentration of the antibacterial after a dose (C(max)), and the 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC24) and their relationship to pharmacodynamic parameters such as the minimum inhibitory and the mutant prevention concentrations (MIC and MPC, respectively) have been proposed to predict the effect of fluoroquinolones on bacterial killing and the emergence of resistance. Higher C(max)/MIC or AUC24/MIC and C(max)/MPC or AUC24/MPC ratios, either as a result of dose administration or the susceptibility of the organism, may lead to a better clinical outcome and decrease the emergence of resistance, respectively. Pharmacokinetic profiles that are optimised to target low-level resistant minor subpopulations of bacteria that often exist in infections may help preserve fluoroquinolones as a class. To this end, optimising the AUC24/MPC or C(max)/MPC ratios is important, particularly against S. pneumoniae, in the setting of lower respiratory tract infections. Agents such as moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin with high ratios against this organism are preferred, and agents such as ciprofloxacin with low ratios should be avoided. For agents such as levofloxacin and gatifloxacin, with intermediate ratios against S. pneumoniae, it may be worthwhile considering alternative dose administration strategies, such as using higher dosages, to eradicate low-level resistant variants. This must, of course, be balanced against the potential of toxicity. Innovative approaches to the use of fluoroquinolones are worth testing in further in vitro experiments as well as in clinical trials.
TI  - Diagnosis of partially treated culture-negative bacterial meningitis using 16S rRNA universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestion.
AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from patients with partially treated and culture-negative meningitis was subjected to PCR using 16S rDNA universal primers followed by restriction endonuclease digestion. In all, 43 patients and 7 controls were enrolled in this study. Twenty-one meningitic samples were positive by PCR. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was the causative agent in seven cases followed by Haemophilus influenzae (four), Streptococcus pneumoniae (two), Listeria monocytogenes (one), Escherichia coli (one), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (one) and Staphylococcus aureus (one). Only two meningitic CSF samples were culture-positive. In this study, PCR using bacterial 16S rDNA specific universal primers was found to be superior to conventional methods in the diagnosis of partially treated meningitis.
TI  - Treatment of acute exacerbation of severe-to-very severe COPD with azithromycin in patients vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Sixty-five consecutive eligible adult patients, who were treated as outpatients for stable severe-to-very severe COPD, were enrolled in the study. All of them received 23-valent pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine intramuscularly. Patients were seen monthly, as well as whenever they had symptoms suggestive of an exacerbation, at our outpatient clinic. Eighteen out of 65 patients suffered from acute exacerbation (AECOPD). Three of these patients presented two episodes of AECOPD. Patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD received azithromycin 500 mg/day once daily for 3 days and a short course of oral prednisolone 25 mg/die. In 16 cases, a single species was isolated, while in the remaining 5 cases at least two species were recovered. Clinical cure or improvement at the end of therapy (3-5 days post-therapy) was reported in 17 episodes of AECOPD with no relapse at the late post-therapy (10-14 days after the completion of treatment). Bacteriologic eradication or presumptive eradication rates at the end of therapy were 86% (24 out of 28 isolates). Azithromycin eradicated all isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, H. parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella spp. isolated at baseline. Eradication of Sta aureus occurred in 1 of 3 isolates whereas azithromycin was unable to eradicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Our data seem to indicate that pneumococcal vaccination reduces the possibility that an AECOPD is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. This finding allows the use of antibiotics such as azithromycin, which, otherwise, should be avoided because of resistances.
TI  - Comparative in vitro antimicrobial activity of a new carbapenem, doripenem: tentative disc diffusion criteria and quality control.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the spectrum of activity of doripenem and to propose tentative MIC and disc diffusion breakpoints. METHODS: The in vitro susceptibilities of 2137 bacterial isolates, representing 28 different species, to doripenem, imipenem and meropenem were determined by the NCCLS broth microdilution and disc diffusion testing methods. RESULTS: The doripenem MIC(50)s/(90)s were (in mg/L) for Enterobacteriaceae, 0.06/0.25; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 0.25/1; Haemophilus influenzae, 0.12/0.5; streptococci, 0.016/0.5 and for staphylococci, 0.06/4. Like other carbapenems tested, doripenem MIC(50)s/(90)s were >32/>32 and 0.5/32 mg/L for the enterococci and non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli (excluding P. aeruginosa), respectively. Against members of the Enterobacteriaceae and H. influenzae, doripenem was generally more active than imipenem and the same as or slightly less active than meropenem. Values for the non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli excluding P. aeruginosa were comparable for all three carbapenems. Doripenem MICs increased with increasing resistance to methicillin (staphylococci), penicillin (streptococci) and strains that were beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (Haemophilus). Doripenem exhibits excellent activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. The NCCLS disc diffusion test was performed simultaneously on all organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Assuming the MIC susceptible breakpoints for doripenem are < or =1 mg/L for the streptococci and < or =2 mg/L for all other genera, then disc diffusion zone diameter breakpoints can be proposed. In addition, MIC and/or disc diffusion quality control ranges of doripenem were determined for 10 ATCC reference strains.
TI  - Microbiologic determinants of exacerbation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The culture of bronchial secretions from the lower airway has been reported to be positive for potentially pathogenic microorganisms (PPMs) in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but the determinants and effects of this bacterial load in the airway are not established. METHODS: To determine the bronchial microbial pattern in COPD and its relationship with exacerbation, we pooled analysis of crude data from studies that used protected specimen brush sampling, with age, sex, smoking, lung function, and microbiologic features of the lower airway as independent variables and exacerbation as the outcome, using logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: Of 337 study participants, 70 were healthy, 181 had stable COPD, and 86 had exacerbated COPD. Differences in the microbial characteristics in the participating laboratories were not statistically significant. A cutoff point of 10(2) colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter or greater for the identification of abnormal positive culture results for PPMs was defined using the 95th percentile in the pooled analysis of healthy individuals. Bronchial colonization of 10(2) CFU/mL or greater by PPMs was found in 53 patients with stable COPD (29%) and in 46 patients with exacerbated COPD (54%) (P<.001, chi(2) test), with a predominance of Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Higher microbial loads were associated with exacerbation and showed a statistically significant dose-response relationship after adjustment for covariates (odds ratio, 3.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.47-8.90), but P aeruginosa persisted as a statistically significant risk factor after adjustment for microbial load (odds ratio, 11.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-105.82). CONCLUSIONS: One quarter of the patients with COPD are colonized by PPMs during their stable periods. Exacerbation is associated with the overgrowth of PPMs and with the appearance of P aeruginosa in the lower airway, which is associated with exacerbation symptoms independent of load.
TI  - Childhood parapneumonic pleural effusion in Enugu.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review the epidemiological pattern and clinical features, management and outcome of childhood parapneumonic pleural effusion in Enugu. METHODS: The records of the children with diagnosis of pleural effusion admitted at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu between January 1995 and February 2001 were reviewed. RESULTS: Forty out of forty two patients reviewed were analysed. There were 20 males, and 20 females (ratio of 1: 1), with age range of 3 months to 156 months (13 years) and the mean age of 4.99 years. The presenting symptoms were fever in 40 patients (100% ), cough in 38 (97.40% ), dyspnea in 36 (90.00% ), breathlessness in 27 (67.5% ), while, the most common physical sign was pallor. Thirty six children had diagnostic thoracocentesis. Twenty four (55.81% ) yielded pus, out of which, 10 grew organisms on culture; Streptococcus Pneumonia in 3, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, coliforms in 2, Haemophilus influenzae in 1, Proteus mirabilis in 1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 1. Nine patients received ampicillin/cloxacillin combination alone; 31 received ampicillin/cloxacillin with other antibiotics, including anti- tuberculous drugs in four children. Thirty-five of the children had thoracotomy, and one later had thoracotomy and decortication. Thirty-seven (92.5% ) were discharged home on recovery. The average admission duration was 24 days. Mortality rate was 7.50%. CONCLUSIONS: In this review, there appears to be an evolving change in epidemiological pattern in comparison with the previous study from this center. There is need to improve on the diagnostic procedure and treatment modalities in order to establish definite criteria for antibiotic use and surgical intervention.
TI  - Sputum bacteriology in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD in Hong Kong.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To study the demographics and sputum microbiology of patients admitted to a teaching hospital with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). DESIGN: A retrospective study. SETTING: A tertiary university hospital in Hong Kong. PATIENTS: All episodes of AECOPD, patient demographics, length of stay, sputum culture and radiological results admitted in the first half of the year 2000 were retrieved from hospital records. RESULTS: There were 329 patients with 418 episodes of AECOPD without concomitant pneumonia. The age of the patients was 74.4+/-8.3 years. The acute hospital length of stay for an episode of AECOPD was 7.3+/-6.5 days. Haemophilus influenzae was the commonest organism found in sputum (23.1%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (4.0%). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was found in 1.1% of the admissions. Presence of organisms in sputum had no association with the hospital length of stay and intensive care unit admissions. In patients whose FEV1 was >50% of predicted values, there was a higher chance of positive sputum growth of H. influenzae than those with FEV1 <50% (16/44 vs. 31/162 episodes, respectively, P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: H. influenzae was the commonest bacterium isolated in sputum in patients with AECOPD. In areas endemic of tuberculosis, it is advisable to use fluoroquinolones for AECOPD with caution.
TI  - Large scale in vivo synthesis of globotriose and globotetraose by high cell density culture of metabolically engineered Escherichia coli.
AB  - Large amounts of globotriose (Galalpha-4Galbeta-4Glc) are shown to be produced by the high cell density culture of an Escherichia coli strain over-expressing the Neisseria meningitidis lgtC gene for alpha-1,4-Gal transferase. The strain which was devoid of both alpha and beta galactosidase activity was fed with glycerol as the energy and carbon source and with lactose as precursor for globotriose synthesis. After complete exhaustion of lactose, globotriose could serve as an alternative acceptor for LgtC and the formation of a series of polygalactosylated compounds was observed. The system was extended to the synthesis of globotetraose (GalNAcbeta-3Galalpha-4Galbeta-4Glc) by overexpressing two additional genes: lgtD from Haemophilus influenzae Rd which encodes a beta-1,3-GalNAc transferase and wbpP from Pseudomonas aeruginosa which encodes a UDP-GalNAc C4 epimerase. Globotetraose could also be produced from exogenous globotriose which was shown to be actively taken up by the cells.
TI  - Otomycoses of candidal origin in eastern Slovakia.
AB  - Mycological analysis of swabs and scraping samples from the external ear canals of 40 patients with clinically diagnosed otomycosis (10 neonates, 30 adults) revealed the presence of fungi as etiological agents. They were investigated microscopically using 20 % potassium hydroxide, and by cultivation on Sabouraud's glucose agar. The Candida species were identified using the germ-tube test, micromorphology observations of colonies on rice agar, and particularly by the commercial kit AUXAcolor. The following Candida species were identified in the aural material examined: C. albicans (n = 21; 52.5 %), C. parapsilosis (11; 27.5), C. tropicalis (3; 7.5), C. krusei (3; 7.5), C. guilliermondii (2; 5.0). The above yeasts were present in samples together with Staphylococcus epidermidis (31), S. aureus (16), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (14), Neisseria spp. (14), Proteus mirabilis (3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Escherichia coli (1) and Haemophilus influenzae (1). The most frequent predisposing factors for otomycosis were swimming in public pools and/or bath, spa and diabetes mellitus.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates from patients with cystic fibrosis].
AB  - We studied the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated from sputum from patients with cystic fibrosis in our hospital during 2001 and 2002. The most frequently isolated microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (59.89%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (49.45%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.9%) and Haemophilus influenzae (3.8%). The rate of methicillin-resistant S. aureus was 18%, and no strains with low susceptibility to glycopeptides were found. Carbapenems showed the highest activity against P. aeruginosa, although this did not reach 100%.
TI  - Corneal ulcers in two children wearing paragon corneal refractive therapy lenses.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To report the development of corneal ulcers in two children wearing Paragon Corneal Refractive Therapy (CRT) lenses. METHODS: Two case reports of children who developed corneal ulcers when fit with Paragon CRT contact lenses, which were worn nightly, are discussed. Each patient presented with a bacterial corneal ulcer after wearing CRT contact lenses for less than 6 months. In the first patient, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified as the causative organism. In the second patient, Haemophilus influenza was cultured from the ulcer. RESULTS: Both patients were treated with intensive, fortified antibiotics with rapid resolution of the corneal ulcers and preservation of vision. No surgical intervention was required. CONCLUSIONS: Paragon CRT lenses have been approved for use in patients of all ages. When used in children, these lenses may present unique problems. The absolute incidence of bacterial corneal ulcers in patients with CRT lenses are unknown. Severe caution should be used before prescribing CRT lenses for children and informed consent should include potential sight-threatening corneal ulcers.
TI  - Antimicrobial therapy in community-acquired pneumonia among emergency patients in a university hospital in Japan.
AB  - As antimicrobial therapy for pneumonia has not been well established in Japan, this study was designed to obtain a more definitive standard for antimicrobial treatment of this condition. Two hundred and thirty-one emergency patients admitted to Kyorin University Hospital between January 1998 and December 2000 were retrospectively analyzed in respect to their age, underlying disease, causative organism, and primary treatment with antimicrobial agent. Furthermore, the severity and prognosis were analyzed for those patients who had not responded to initial treatment with antimicrobial agents. The majority of the patients were elderly (over 65 years old; mean overall age 66.7 +/- 15.2 years) and had severe pneumonia; underlying diseases were recognized at a high rate in patients with severe pneumonia (P < 0.05) and in those classified as elderly (P < 0.0001). The most common underlying conditions in elderly patients were respiratory, cardiovascular (P < 0.01), and cerebrovascular (P < 0.05) diseases. The most common causative organisms were Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. In patients with severe pneumonia, S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified as the most common causative organisms. Complications associated with antimicrobial treatment were observed in those patients with K. pneumoniae isolates who also had severe pneumonia and were frequently treated with penicillin. Furthermore, increased mortality rates were observed in patients not responding well to the initial treatment with antimicrobial agents. Thus, the selection of appropriate initial antimicrobial agents is an important factor affecting the prognosis of patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - Bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity of levofloxacin against clinical isolates from cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  
TI  - Non-steroidal anti inflammatory agents decrease bacterial colonisation of contact lenses and prevent adhesion to human corneal epithelial cells.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), salicylic acid, sodium diclofenac and ketorolac for inhibition of bacterial colonization of contact lenses (CL) and human corneal epithelial cells (HCE). METHODS: CLs pre-colonised with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae were exposed overnight to NSAIDs and the number of viable bacteria on the CLs were calculated. Cytotoxicity of NSAIDs to HCE cells was evaluated with the MTT assay. Viable counts were used to measure the adhesion of P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis to HCE cells in the presence of the least cytotoxic NSAID. RESULTS: All NSAIDs significantly decreased bacterial colonization of CLs in a dose-dependent manner. Salicylic acid (100 mM) completely inhibited colonisation of all species tested and was the least cytotoxic. Salicylic acid also prevented adhesion of P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis to HCE (60% and 58% inhibition at 60 mM at 2 hours). CONCLUSIONS: Salicylic acid demonstrated potential as a compound for incorporation into anti-bacterial strategies to prevent bacterial contamination of contact lenses. This study highlighted the potential for NSAIDs as anti-bacterial agents and indicates that this class of compound should be investigated for other suitable candidates.
TI  - In vitro activities of tigecycline against clinical isolates from Shanghai, China.
AB  - To evaluate the in vitro activity of tigecycline, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of tigecycline against 1,201 strains of recent clinical isolates from 10 hospitals in Shanghai, China were determined and compared with selected comparators. Results showed that tigecycline had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. It was highly active against Gram-positive cocci, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp., penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Tigecycline also had good activity against most strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. However, it was poorly active against Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Tigecycline was highly active against anaerobic Gram-positive cocci such as Peptococcus spp. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was significantly better than that of minocycline and tetracycline. It was as active as or slightly more active than vancomycin and teicoplanin in the activity against resistant aerobic Gram-positive cocci. Tigecycline was bactericidal against all Gram-positive cocci tested except Enterococcus spp. Inoculum size but not pH of medium or concentration of human serum in broth had significant effect on the in vitro activity of tigecycline. Aged media (48-72 hours after preparation) used in the test and specific resistance problem in China may have some effects on MIC values of tigecycline.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Achillea clavennae essential oil against respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - The essential oil of Achillea clavennae was investigated for its antibacterial activity against some respiratory tract pathogens. Maximum activity was observed against Klebsiella pneumoniae and penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The oil also exhibited strong activity against Gram (-) Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gram (+) Streptococcus pyogenes was the most resistant to the oil.
TI  - Transferable antibiotic resistance elements in Haemophilus influenzae share a common evolutionary origin with a diverse family of syntenic genomic islands.
AB  - Transferable antibiotic resistance in Haemophilus influenzae was first detected in the early 1970s. After this, resistance spread rapidly worldwide and was shown to be transferred by a large 40- to 60-kb conjugative element. Bioinformatics analysis of the complete sequence of a typical H. influenzae conjugative resistance element, ICEHin1056, revealed the shared evolutionary origin of this element. ICEHin1056 has homology to 20 contiguous sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database. Systematic comparison of these homologous sequences resulted in identification of a conserved syntenic genomic island consisting of up to 33 core genes in 16 beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria. These diverse genomic islands shared a common evolutionary origin, insert into tRNA genes, and have diverged widely, with G+C contents ranging from 40 to 70% and amino acid homologies as low as 20 to 25% for shared core genes. These core genes are likely to account for the conjugative transfer of the genomic islands and may even encode autonomous replication. Accessory gene clusters were nestled among the core genes and encode the following diverse major attributes: antibiotic, metal, and antiseptic resistance; degradation of chemicals; type IV secretion systems; two-component signaling systems; Vi antigen capsule synthesis; toxin production; and a wide range of metabolic functions. These related genomic islands include the following well-characterized structures: SPI-7, found in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi; PAP1 or pKLC102, found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and the clc element, found in Pseudomonas sp. strain B13. This is the first report of a diverse family of related syntenic genomic islands with a deep evolutionary origin, and our findings challenge the view that genomic islands consist only of independently evolving modules.
TI  - [Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance: VIRA study 2004].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of the study was to know the current situation of the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the main multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the VIRA study carried out in 2001. METHODS: The 40 participating hospitals sent a total of 1,425 microorganisms isolated in February 2004, distributed as follows: penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (139), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (289), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (158), ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (89) and Enterococcus faecalis (2), ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (85), ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli (346), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (187), and Acinetobacter baumannii (130). The hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. Sensitivity was determined by the broth microdilution method. RESULTS: The number of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci fell significantly (p < 0.0001) compared with the previous study (from 59.8% to 30.2%). Global methicillin-resistance in S. aureus was 31.2%, which represents a significant increase (p < 0.001) compared with the year 2001 (24.8%). 11.3% of the E. coli strains were extended-spectrum beta -lactamase-producers and came from 24 hospitals. One P. aeruginosa isolate gave a positive result in the E-test MBL assay, suggesting the presence of metallo-beta -lactamases. The strains of imipenem-resistant A. baumannii presented cross-resistance with several antibiotics. CONCLUSION: These results show how the multi-resistant bacteria included in the study represent a growing problem in our hospitals. This emphasizes the importance of resistance surveillance systems and the correct use of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16SrDNA oligonucleotide array].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. However conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. On the basis of special gene sequence, PCR provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. But it is difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic agents. Oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of target genes. The objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the PCR product of 16SrDNA using a pair of universal primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: By comparison and analysis of the 16SrDNA sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. A pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. The probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of PCR using the universal primers. RESULTS: The universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Neisseria meningitides, Citrobacter freundii, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human DNA as control. The results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could not hybridize with other bacteria. The lowest concentration of DNA (product of PCR) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. The results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. The results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. From the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system, which contains amplification of the segment of 16rDNA from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of PCR products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial properties of aqueous garlic extract against multidrug-resistant bacteria and Candida species from Nigeria.
AB  - The antimicrobial effects of aqueous garlic extract (AGE) against 133 multidrug-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial isolates, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., and Proteus spp., and against 10 Candida spp. were studied. Antibacterial activity of AGE by well-diffusion and macrobroth dilution method was characterized by inhibition zones of 20.2-22.7 mm for gram-positives and 19.8-24.5 mm for gram-negatives and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranges of 15.6-48.3 mg/mL and 22.9-37.2 mg/mL, respectively. With the exception of P. aeruginosa, the observed disparity in MIC values at 24 and 48 hours was not significant (P >.05) in these isolates. The anticandidal effect of AGE resulted in a growth inhibition zone of 27.4 +/- 3.7 mm with no significant difference (P >.05) in MIC values at 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Minimum fungicidal concentrations were found to be 14.9 and 15.5 mg/mL, respectively, at these incubation periods. Further analysis revealed the antimicrobial efficacy of AGE to be dose and time dependent, producing five distinct time-kill profiles among the isolates tested. The results of this study support the use of garlic in health products and herbal remedies in Nigeria.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2002)].
AB  - From October 2002 to September 2003, we collected the specimen from 476 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 16 institutions in Japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. Of 584 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 578 strains were examined. The breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 77, Streptococcus pneumoniae 103, Haemophilus influenzae 95, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 61, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 23, Klebsiella pneumoniae 36, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 29, etc. Of 77 S. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of MIC of oxacillin (MPIPC) [methicillin-susceptible S. aureus: MSSA] was 34 strains (44.2%) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) was 43 strains (55.8%). Against MSSA, imipenem (IPM) and minocycline (MINO) had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25 microg/ml. Although clindamycin (CLDM) and aminoglycosides also had the potent activity, the resistant strains against those agents were detected. Cefotiam (CTM) inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/ml without the low sensitive strains. Against MRSA, vancomycin (VCM) showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. Arbekacin (ABK) also showed the relatively potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 4 microg/ml. Carbapenems showed the most potent activities against S. pneumoniae and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25-0.5 microg/ml. Cefozopran (CZOP) also had a preferable activity (MIC90: 1 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. In contrast, the resistant strains for cefaclor (CCL), erythromycin (EM), CLDM, and tetracycline (TC) were detected in 50.5%, 76.7%, 50.5%, and 80.6% of all the strains, respectively. Against H. influenzae, LVFX showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of 92 of all the strains (96.8%) at 0.063 microg/ml. Tobramycin (TOB) showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was good and its MIC90 against mucoid and non-mucoid strains was 8 and 16 microg/ml, respectively. CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) were the most potent against K. pneumoniae with 0.125 microg/ml of MIC90. Also, all the agents generally showed potent activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis and the MIC90 of all drugs were 4 microg/ml or less. The approximately half the number (47.5%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. As for the incidence by the diseases, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest, being noted in 35.7 and 33.8% of all the patients, respectively. The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were S. pneumoniae (22.6%). In contrast, S. aureus (16.6%) and P. aeruginosa (13.7%) were relatively frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. Before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from all the patients were H. influenzae (24.5%) and S. pneumoniae (24.2%). In comparison of the isolated bacteria by pretreatment agents, P. aeruginosa was relatively frequently isolated from the patients pretreated with cephems or macrolides and H. influenzae was relatively frequently isolated from the patients pretreated with penicillins.
TI  - Characterization of three new competence-regulated operons in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae is one of a growing number of bacteria in which the natural ability to uptake exogenous DNA for potential genomic transformation has been recognized. To date, several operons involved in transformation in this organism have been described. These operons are characterized by a conserved 22-bp regulatory element upstream of the first gene and are induced coincident with transfer from rich to nutrient-depleted media. The previously identified operons comprised genes encoding proteins that include members of the type II secretion system and type IV pili, shown to be essential for transformation in other bacteria, and other proteins previously identified as required for transformation in H. influenzae. In the present study, three novel competence operons were identified by comparative genomics and transcriptional analysis. These operons have been further characterized by construction of null mutants and examination of the resulting transformation phenotypes. The putative protein encoded by the HI0366 gene was shown to be essential for DNA uptake, but not binding, and is homologous to a protein shown to be required for pilus biogenesis and twitching motility in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. An insertion in HI0939 abolished both DNA binding and uptake. The predicted product of this gene shares characteristics with PulJ, a pseudopilin involved in pullulanase export in Klebsiella oxytoca.
TI  - Microbiological identification in cystic fibrosis patients with CFTR I1234V mutation.
AB  - Recurrent and chronic bacterial pulmonary infection is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF). Over 6 months, 72 sputa or oropharyngeal samples were examined from 36 Arab Bedouin CF patients attending Hamad General Hospital, Doha, Qatar. More than 100 pathogens were isolated, mostly Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Unusual pathogens included Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acaligenes xylosoxidans and Mycobacterium abscessus. It is concluded that microbiological biodiversity in the lower airways of CF patients continues to be underestimated and that CF patients harbouring mucoid strains of P. aeruginosa are at a higher risk of acquiring more unusual organisms and probably have a worse prognosis.
TI  - [Isolation rate of gram negative microflora and its sensitivity to antibiotics in hemoblastosis patients].
AB  - A total of 67 patients with blood system diseases and infectious complications were examined. During the period of the examination 139 microorganisms were isolated. Of these gram negative microorganisms constituted 51%, gram positive microorganisms--34.8% and fungal flora--14.2%. Most frequently the following gram negative microorganisms were isolated from the patients: Pseudomonas sp. (including P. aeruginosa), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae. All isolated microorganisms retained sensitivity to imipenem, with the exception of individual strains of Pseudomonas sp.; the latter exhibited sensitivity to amicacin and ceftazidim. Cefotaxime was active with respect to 75% of K. pneumoniae strains and all E. coli strains, ciprofloxacin was active with respect to 43% of E. coli strains, 80% of K. pneumoniae strains and 83.4% of Pseudomonas sp. strains, cefepim was active with respect to 85.7% of Pseudomonas sp. strains and all E. coli strains, ceftazidim was active with respect to all Pseudomonas sp. and E. coli strains. 75% of K. pneumoniae strains, 77.8% of Pseudomonas sp. strains and 86% of E. coli strains retained sensitivity to amicacin. 25% of K. pneumoniae strains required testing for ESBL production.
TI  - Sensitivity of the BacT/ALERT FA-medium for detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in pre-incubated blood cultures and its temperature-dependence.
AB  - The BacT/ALERT FA-medium was evaluated to detect Pseudomonas aeruginosa in pre-incubated blood samples. As published previously its predecessor the BacT/ALERT FAN-medium failed to detect P. aeruginosa in delayed entry samples. It is now reported that FA-medium tolerates a longer pre-incubation period at 36 degrees C, i.e. 8 h, before detection of P. aeruginosa fails in experimentally inoculated blood cultures. In clinical blood samples the frequency of false-negative results concerning P. aeruginosa was reduced from 46.9 % (FAN-medium) to 9.1 % (FA-medium). If media inoculated with P. aeruginosa are pre-incubated at room temperature for 24 h, false-negative results are not observed. Various micro-organisms (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida glabrata) were recognized after pre-incubation at room temperature with similar sensitivity compared to pre-incubation at 36 degrees C. It is concluded that FA-medium detects P. aeruginosa in delayed entry samples with increased sensitivity and pre-incubation at room temperature is superior to pre-incubation at 36 degrees C.
TI  - Investigating the antimicrobial activity of natural honey and its effects on the  pathogenic bacterial infections of surgical wounds and conjunctiva.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of 10-100% (wt/vol) concentrations of new honey, stored  honey, heated honey, ultraviolet-exposed honey, and heated stored honey were tested against common human pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Entrobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella dysenteriae, Klebsiella sp., Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus hemolyticus group B, and Candida albicans. Antimicrobial activity of honey was tested in acidic, neutral, or alkaline media. These were compared with similar concentrations of glucose in nutrient broth. Surgical wounds were made on the dorsum of mice and infected with S. aureus or Klebsiella sp. The wounds were treated with local application of honey four times a day or appropriate antibiotics and compared with control values. Bacterial conjunctivitis due to E. coli, Proteus sp., S. aureus, Klebsiella sp., and P. aeruginosa was induced in rats. Conjunctival application of honey four times a day or appropriate antibiotics was used for treatment and compared with control values. Growth of all the isolates was completely inhibited by 30-100% honey concentrations. The most sensitive microbes were E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and H. influenzae. Glucose showed less antimicrobial activity than honey, and many microbes showed positive culture even in 100% glucose. Heating to 80 degrees C for 1 hour decreased antimicrobial activity of both new and stored honey. Storage of honey for 5 years decreased its antimicrobial activity, while ultraviolet light exposure increased its activity against some of the microorganisms. Antimicrobial activity of honey was stronger in acidic media than in neutral or alkaline media. Single doses of honey used to prepare the 60% concentration in nutrient broth were bacteriocidal for P. aeruginosa and bacteriostatic for S. aureus and Klebsiella sp. during certain periods. Local application of raw honey on infected wounds reduced redness, swelling, time for complete resolution of lesion, and time for eradication of bacterial infection due to S. aureus or Klebsiella sp. Its potency was comparable to that of local antibiotics. Honey application into infective conjunctivitis reduced redness, swelling, pus discharge, and time for eradication of bacterial infections due to all the isolates tested.
TI  - Diffuse panbronchiolitis.
AB  - Diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) is an idiopathic inflammatory disease, largely restricted to Japan, that is characterized by progressive suppurative and obstructive airway disease, which, if left untreated, progresses to bronchiectasis, respiratory failure, and death. The lesion was first described in the early 1960s. In 1969 the name diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) was proposed to distinguish it from chronic bronchitis. Diffuse refers to the distribution of the lesions throughout both lungs, and pan refers to the involvement of inflammation in all layers of the respiratory bronchioles. Its distinctive imaging and histologic features, the coexisting sinusitis, and the isolation of Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum should enhance disease recognition. Neutrophils and T-lymphocytes, particularly CD8- cells, together with cytokines IL-8 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 are believed to play key roles in the development of this disease. Significant improvement in the prognosis of this potentially fatal disease has been reported after the use of long-term therapy with macrolide antibiotics, the effect of which is attributed to an anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory action.
TI  - The value of a CT-guided fine needle aspirate in infants with lung abscess.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the range of pathogens isolated from a lung abscess in infants less than one year of age. To assess the role of direct culture from the abscess. METHODS: The two index cases were managed in 2002. An institution-based review was conducted of all infants up to one year of age diagnosed with a lung abscess between 1989 and 2002. Data sources were hospital's disease index and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Audit database using ICD9 and ICD10 diagnostic codes for 'lung abscess'. RESULTS: Five infants, under the age of one year, were treated for a lung abscess. In the one case where the abscess was left-sided it was associated with a congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung. Pathogens were isolated following direct culture of the abscess in four cases. In three cases a single pathogen was isolated: pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae. In one case a mixture of escherichia coli, streptococcus milleri and an anaerobe, propionibacteria, were cultured. Antibiotic therapy was directed at the identified pathogen(s) in all four cases. There was no mortality or recurrence. CONCLUSION: Predisposing factors for a lung abscess in infancy include prematurity, assisted ventilation, congenital lung anomaly and aspiration. Given the range of potential pathogens, direct culture by CT-guided fine needle aspiration is recommended to direct appropriate intravenous medical therapy provided the abscess is located peripherally.
TI  - Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry for glycoscreening in biomedical research.
AB  - Application of capillary electrophoresis (CE) in combination with mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem MS to glycoscreening in biomedical projects is highlighted. In the first part recent CE-MS experiments by sheath liquid CE and multiple stage MS are reported. Neutral and negatively charged N-glycan mixtures from ribonuclease B and fetuin, high-mannose type N-glycoforms, oligosaccharides from lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Haemophilus influenzae, polysaccharides of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were analyzed. A particular emphasis is devoted to the applicability of novel off- and on-line CE-MS and tandem MS methods for screening of proteoglycan-derived oligosaccharides, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as hyaluronates from Streptococcus agalactiae, chondroitin/dermatan sulfates (CS/DS) from bovine aorta and human skin fibroblast decorin, and heparin/heparan sulfate (HS) from porcine and bovine mucosa. The performance of CE-MS/MS for identification of glycoforms in glycopeptides and glycoproteins is illustrated by experiments performed on complex mixtures from urine of patients suffering from a hereditary N-acetylhexosaminidase deficiency (Schindler's disease) and urine of patients suffering from cancer cachexia. For determination of glycosylation patterns in glycoproteins like enzymes and antibodies by CE/MS, both CE-matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and CE-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS were functional. Finally, the potential of CE-ESI-MS strategy in glycolipid analysis is demonstrated for gangliosides from bovine brain for which particular CE buffer conditions are required.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated in major hospitals in Nagano prefecture].
AB  - We determined the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of various antimicrobial agents against 140 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 131 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 178 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from respiratory organs in 28 affiliated hospitals in Nagano prefecture between December 2002 and February 2003. The results of this report were as followed: 1. All 140 strains of S. pneumoniae were classified into 3 groups; penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP) (47.1%), penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP) (43.6%) and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) (9.3%). 2. Carbapenems and glycopeptide (vancomycin) had highly potent antimicrobial activity against PISP and PRSP like PSSP. However, some of PISP or PRSP isolates were resistant to cephalosporins and a fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin). 3. All 131 strains ofH. Influenzae were also classified into three groups; ampicillin sensitive H. influenzae (73.3%), beta-lactamase producing ampicillin resistant H. influenzae (BLPAR) (8.4%) and beta-lactamase negative ampicillin resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR) (18.3%). 4. Carbapenems and a fluoroquinolone had highly potent antimicrobial activity against BLPAR and BLNAR. However, there were clear differences among 4 carbapenems for the antimicrobial activity. Ceftriaxone (CTRX) was the most active among cepharosporins in this study. 5. The rate of P. aeruginosa isolates resistant to carbapenems, a fluoroquinolone and aminoglycosides were about 11 to approximately 16%, 15% and 0.6 to approximately 8%, respectively. None of the strains was resistant to all 3 antimicrobial classes, but 3 strains were resistant to combination of 2 classes. 6. The MIC50 and MIC90 values of various antibiotics against S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa were different in all 4 regions. In conclusion, the antimicrobial surveillance programs are important for guiding empiric therapy and for focusing interventional control of antimicrobial resistance in regions and hospitals.
TI  - Doripenem (S-4661), a novel carbapenem: comparative activity against contemporary pathogens including bactericidal action and preliminary in vitro methods evaluations.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the potency of doripenem, a broad-spectrum carbapenem  characterized by a wider spectrum of activity combining antimicrobial and bactericidal features of imipenem and meropenem. METHODS: This parenteral compound was studied against recent clinical isolates (2001-2002) from a worldwide organism collection. A total of 902 strains were susceptibility tested by reference methods against doripenem and six to 28 comparators including ertapenem, imipenem and meropenem. The organisms tested included: Enterobacteriaceae (281 strains), Acinetobacter spp. (33), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (35), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (36), other non-fermenters (22), Haemophilus influenzae (61), Moraxella catarrhalis (33), oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci (39), enterococci (84), streptococci (163), various anaerobes (98), and other Gram-positive species such as Corynebacterium and Bacillus spp. (17). RESULTS: Against Enterobacteriaceae, the average doripenem MIC90 was 0.03 mg/L (range, < or =0.015-0.25 mg/L). Doripenem was two- to 16-fold more potent than imipenem and comparable to ertapenem and meropenem; all doripenem MIC values with enteric bacilli were < or =4 mg/L. Doripenem was active against Aeromonas (MIC50, 0.03 mg/L), Bacillus spp. (MIC50, 0.03 mg/L) and all tested anaerobic species (MIC range, < or =0.015-4 mg/L), but was less active against S. maltophilia (MIC90, >32 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecium (MIC90, >32 mg/L) among the enterococcal species. Time-dependent bactericidal action was observed for doripenem and broth MIC results were slightly greater when compared to agar MIC results. In pilot testing, the optimal doripenem disc concentration was 10 microg, identical to standardized reagents for other clinically available carbapenems. CONCLUSIONS: Doripenem appears to be a potent carbapenem with a spectrum resembling currently marketed antipseudomonal carbapenems, but with greater activity when tested against some non-fermentative bacillary strains. Continued evaluation of doripenem against isolates resistant to other beta-lactams appears to be warranted.
TI  - Bronchiectasis: not an orphan disease in the East.
AB  - Bronchiectasis is a common disease in the developing world. While the aetiology of bronchiectasis is diverse, many patients suffer from idiopathic disease. Although the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis is poorly understood, there are three distinct pathogenic elements, namely infection, inflammation and enzymatic actions. These interact to perpetuate airway destruction in many cases. There are four patient stereotypes: rapidly progressive, slowly progressive, indolent disease and haemoptysis-predominant. The diagnosis of bronchiectasis is best made with high resolution computed tomography, which should be followed by delineation of aetiology and evaluation of disease severity. Management of bronchiectasis is unsatisfactory and there are no disease-modifying drugs or treatment guidelines. Specific therapy to correct an underlying defect should be instituted whenever possible, although established disease often continues to deteriorate relentlessly. Treatment with prolonged, high-dose antibiotics is useful for exacerbations and probably also for some severely affected patients with frequent exacerbations who habour Pseudomonas aeruginosa in their airways. Commencement of long-term nebulised aminoglycoside, elective in-patient intravenous antibiotic therapy, long-term oral antibiotic or low-dose macrolide therapy requires special considerations. Inhaled corticosteroid therapy reduces chemokine expression in bronchiectasis in vivo, and may be useful for some patients. For severely affected patients, the use of non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation with supplementary oxygen sometimes helps. The lack of enthusiasm about bronchiectasis has already resulted in a lack of research in the treatment of this frustrating disease, and such research needs to be encouraged.
TI  - Rates of antimicrobial resistance among common bacterial pathogens causing respiratory, blood, urine, and skin and soft tissue infections in pediatric patients.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance patterns among the principal bacterial pathogens from infections of the respiratory tract, blood, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract of pediatric patients from the USA, Canada, Germany, France, and Italy were studied using the The Surveillance Network (TSN) database. Among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from respiratory tract infections, the prevalence of high-level penicillin resistance (MIC>/=2 microg/ml) ranged from 1.1 (Italy) to 36.2% (USA); erythromycin resistance was higher, ranging from 13.4 (Germany) to 63.8% (France). The prevalence of beta-lactamase-positive Haemophilus influenzae among isolates from lower respiratory tract infections ranged from <10 (Italy and Germany) to 38.4% (USA). Among isolates from blood and skin and soft tissue infections, the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ranged from 7.2% (Canada and Germany) to 27.3% (Italy). The prevalence of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae with putative extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among isolates from blood, urinary tract, and skin and soft tissue infections ranged from 0 (Germany and France) to 29.6% (Italy). With the exception of pseudomonal infections or infections with MRSA, amoxicillin-clavulanate retained moderate activity, whilst ceftriaxone and cefepime were the most effective broad-spectrum injectable agents. Meropenem was the most effective agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with <5% resistance. Low levels of resistance, along with acceptable safety profiles and the availability of convenient oral formulations, continue to support the use of ceftriaxone, cefepime, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and meropenem as viable options for the treatment of infections in pediatric patients.
TI  - [Isolation-frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated in regional core hospitals in the Nagaoka district of Niigata Prefecture (changes for 3 years)].
AB  - We measured MICs of various antimicrobial agents against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated in the Nagaoka district of Niigata Prefecture in 2000 (March-May), 2001 (January-May), and 2002 (March-May). S. pneumoniae: Fifty-six strains were isolated in 2000, 119 strains in 2001, and 88 strains in 2002. In 2000, 2001, and 2002, 24 strains (42.9%), 58 strains (48.7%), and 40 strains (45.5%), respectively, were penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP), and 4 strains (7.1%), 12 strains (10.1%), and 7 strains (8.0%), respectively, were penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP). Carbapenems had the most excellent antimicrobial activity, followed by penicillin G, against penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP), PISP, and PRSP. H. influenzae: Seventy-six strains were isolated in 2000, 154 strains in 2001, and 91 strains in 2002. In 2000, 2001, and 2002, 6 strains (7.9%), 8 strains (5.2%), and 7 strains (7.7%), respectively, were beta-lactamase-producing ampicillin (ABPC)-resistant strains (MIC > or = 2 micrograms/ml), showing no increase, and 14 strains (18.4%), 70 strains (45.5%), and 31 strains (34.1%), respectively, were beta-lactamase-non-producing ABPC-resistant strains (MIC > or = 2 micrograms/ml), showing a slight increase. Ceftriaxon, meropenem (MEPM), and levofloxacin had excellent antimicrobial activity against these resistant strains. P. aeruginosa: In 2000, 2001, and 2002, 135, 74, and 91 strains, respectively, were isolated, and 14 strains (10.4%), 17 strains (23.0%), and 24 strains (26.4%), respectively, were imipenem-resistant (MIC > or = 16 micrograms/ml), showing a slight increase. MEPM, biapenem, and ciprofloxacin had excellent antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2002].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 899 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1500 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 158 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 28 medical institutions during 2002 was measured. The results were as follows; 1. MEPM was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae. MIC90 of MEPM against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the lowest of the drugs tested. MEPM showed low cross-resistant rate against both imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa. MEPM was active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). 2. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in Escherichia coli and 1.9% (2 strains) in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Carbapenems including MEPM were active against these ESBL strains. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem; at present, 7 years after available for commercial use.
TI  - Clinical analysis of bronchiectasis in Taiwanese children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical features and etiology of bronchiectasis have rarely been described in non-Caucasian populations, of whom the prevalence of cystic fibrosis is low. In this report, we studied the clinical features of bronchiectasis in Taiwanese children. METHODS: Using a retrospective chart review, 29 cases of bronchiectasis were diagnosed from 1991 through 2001. For each case, the diagnosis was confirmed using high-resolution computed tomography. Medical records were analyzed for demographic data, clinical presentation, spirometric data, and microbial isolation. Radiographic findings were reviewed, and possible causes of bronchiectasis were also identified. RESULTS: There were 17 girls and 12 boys enrolled. Persistent cough, daily sputum production, and hemoptysis were common presenting symptoms. Crackles and wheezing were the most frequent findings during the physical examination. Previous lower airway infection, asthma, and primary immunodeficiency were the most common, but 31.0% of the cases had unknown causes. Dependent lobes were involved more frequently. Simultaneous sinusitis was noted in 70.6% of the cases. Spirometry showed mild airway obstruction in most of the cases. Most specimens (52.2%) from lower airway secretions yielded bacterial pathogens, most commonly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Continuing post-infectious inflammatory changes remains the most important cause of bronchiectasis in a non-Caucasian pediatric population in Northern Taiwan in the 1990s. More than two thirds of these patients had underlying predisposing factors including asthma, immunodeficiency, and swallowing dysfunction. Chronic productive purulent respiratory secretions and persistent crackles should raise the possibility of bronchiectasis in children even in Taiwan where the incidence of cystic fibrosis is low.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of three new quinolones and azithromycin against  aerobic pathogens causing respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In our study the in vitro susceptibility of common pathogens that cause respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections was tested against two newer fluorquinolones (moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin) as well as levofloxacin and azithromycin. METHODS: 50 isolates each of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae isolated from the respiratory tract and from wounds were tested for their susceptibility to moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and azithromycin. RESULTS: Moxifloxacin proved to be the most active substance against the tested gram-positive pathogens. Gatifloxacin was the most active against P. aeruginosa. Moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin proved to be comparably active against the clinical isolates of E. coli and H. influenzae. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin display excellent activity against respiratory pathogens as well as nosocomial pathogens causing abdominal wound infections. When treating infections caused by P. aeruginosa the earlier fluorquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin are the substances of choice.
TI  - Effect of moxifloxacin on bacterial pathogenicity factors in comparison with amoxicillin, clarithromycin and ceftriaxone.
AB  - Moxifloxacin is a recent fluoroquinolone with an antibacterial spectrum encompassing both aerobic Gram-negative and Gram-positive strains, as well as anaerobic bacteria. In this study the activity of moxifloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and effects of subinhibitory concentrations on bacterial morphology and adhesion properties were compared with those of amoxicillin, clarithromycin and ceftriaxone. The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens was equal to or better than that of comparators. Subinhibitory concentrations of moxifloxacin significantly affected bacterial morphology of S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa, leading to formation of spherical forms and filaments. Moreover, bacterial adhesion to buccal cells and fibroblasts was reduced after treatment with 1/4 and 1/8 X MIC of moxifloxacin. In conclusion, subinhibitory concentrations of moxifloxacin remarkably interfere with some bacterial pathogenic factors, thereby contributing to its antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Algorithm for the identification of bacterial pathogens in positive blood cultures by real-time LightCycler polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with sequence-specific probes.
AB  - We developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for rapid detection of the most common and clinically relevant bacteria in positive blood culture bottles, including Staphylococcus spp., S. epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus spp. (including differentiation of E. faecalis and E. faecium), Streptococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp., Bacteroides spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. A total of 507 positive blood cultures were investigated according to a specific PCR algorithm based on the microscopic result of the blood culture, and the PCR results were compared to the culture results. Apart from-cross reactions between E. coli and Chryseomonas luteola and Enterococcus faecium and E. durans, the PCR assay correctly identified all bacteria in the blood cultures and did not show any false-positive results. Regarding blood cultures positive with a single species of bacteria (n = 474), 98.3% of all bacteria were correctly detected by the PCR algorithm within a few hours. However, in mixed infections, the sensitivity was lower. The PCR algorithm is well suited for rapid identification of the most common bacteria in positive blood cultures.
TI  - [Observational study investigating the use of levofloxacin in ICU patients].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is little information on the use of levofloxacin, a new quinolone, in ICU patients. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the criteria for the use of levofloxacin (indications, forms of prescription, doses, and routes of administration) and to study tolerance in patients admitted to the ICU. Method. Prospective, observational study performed from October 2000 to November 2001 in 35 ICUs and including the first 15 patients receiving levofloxacin as monotherapy or combined treatment. Descriptive data are expressed as mean and percentage. Statistical significance was set at P < .05. RESULTS: A total of 543 indications for treatment with levofloxacin were analyzed. The patients were 70.7% men, with a mean (SD) age of 60.2 (16.7) years, mean APACHE II score of 18.9 (7.9), and a medical underlying disease in 79.2% of cases. The ICU mortality rate was 24.1%. A total of 60% of patients required mechanical ventilation and 44.3% needed inotropic drug treatment. Levofloxacin was predominantly prescribed for treating community-acquired infections (67.8%), mainly in the respiratory tract (88.1%). An etiological diagnosis was established in only 55.6% of cases. The most common pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (12.7%), Haemophilus influenzae (9.1%), Escherichia coli (7.4%), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (7.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.9%), and Legionella pneumophila (4.7%). In 87.1% of indications, levofloxacin was prescribed as empirical treatment. Susceptibility of the isolated pathogens to this antibiotic was confirmed in 32.2% of cases. The initial dose was 500 mg/24 h in 48.5% of indications and 500 mg/12 h in 48.3%. Combined treatment was given in 49.7% of cases. In 32.2% of cases, parenteral administration of levofloxacin was changed to oral route. Adverse events probably or possibly associated with levofloxacin occurred in only 12.5% of patients and mainly included increased ALT/ALS levels (4.4%), diarrhea (2.3%), and heart rhythm alterations (2.1%). CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the profile of critically ill patients receiving levofloxacin and the different forms of its use in the ICU.
TI  - Etiological agents of lower respiratory tract infections in Japanese children.
AB  - To investigate the etiology of pediatric community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis, we conducted a prospective, population-based study covering the total population < 15 years of age in 16 municipalities in Hokkaido, Japan, during the period of April 2000 to March 2001. Chest radiographs were available for all cases (n = 921; 398 as pneumonia and 523 as bronchitis) and paired sera for serologic assays were available for more than half of the cases. The following specimens were also collected: nasopharyngeal swabs for viral, bacteriological, mycoplasmal and chlamydial studies, blood for serology and blood culture. The children were then followed-up on days 3, 7 and 14. Specific infecting organisms were identified in a total of 853 (92.6%) out of 921 patients (398 cases of pneumonia and 523 cases of bronchitis) including 205 with mixed infection as follows: Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 252 (274%) patients; respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, 188 (20.4%); influenza A virus, 110 (11.9%); Streptococcus pneumoniae, 95 (10.3%); Haemophilus influenzae, 90 (9.8%); Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 35 (3.8%); Staphylococcus aureus, 29 (3.1%); adenovirus, 27 (2.9%); Moraxella catarrhalis, 12 (1.3%); Pseudomonas aeruginosa , 7 (0.8%); Chlamydia pneumoniae, 6 (0.7%); and other agents, 2 (0.2%). Mycoplasma infections were seen even in patients less than 5 years and RS and influenza A virus infections in patients more than 5 years of age. The importance of M. pneumoniae and RS virus in the etiology of lower respiratory infections in Japanese children was confirmed.
TI  - Hospital-acquired pneumonia in general wards of a Japanese tertiary hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is an important nosocomial disorder  because both its mortality and morbidity are high. The Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS) has proposed a new guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of HAP. Clinical investigations of HAP were conducted to assess the current status of HAP in accordance with this guideline. METHODOLOGY: Inpatients who developed HAP in the Second Department of Internal Medicine, Nagasaki University Hospital, a tertiary hospital in Japan, were evaluated. The incidence of HAP was 1.86% (59 cases in 3176 admissions) from 1996 to 2000. In particular, the severity rating of HAP for 46 patients in accordance with the JRS guidelines, was assessed. RESULTS: The mortality rate was 6.5% at this hospital, which is less than that reported by other investigators in the field. The frequency of bacteria isolated from clinical specimens was as follows: Haemophilus influenzae (20%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.7%), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (13.3%). Response rates were stratified by first-line medications and the results were as follows: penicillins (33.3%), third-generation cephems (44.4%), and carbapenems (66.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results presented here, the severity rating proposed in this guideline for HAP appears reasonable, as the response rate for the first-line antibiotic was better in Group II than in Groups III and IV. It will be important to analyse 'clinical outcome' in accordance with this guideline.
TI  - Microbiology of early CF lung disease.
AB  - Recent bronchoscopy studies using assays to measure inflammation and molecular typing techniques have facilitated an increased understanding of the early events that occur within the lungs of young children with cystic fibrosis and provided additional insights into the natural history of lung disease in children. In 2000, the US CF National Patient Registry data showed that among 1000 infants <2 years of age, the first bacterial pathogens detected are Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the prevalence of these pathogens in these young infants are 19%, 42%, and 29%, respectively. In addition, 7% harbour Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and <1% harbour Burkholderia cepacia complex. Several investigators have performed bronchoscopy studies on young infants to further examine the natural history of lung disease. In one such study of 40 CF infants, 65%, 63% and 70% of children at 1, 2, and 3 years of age harboured at least one CF pathogen. H. influenzae was most common (38%) in infants at 1 year of age, and S. aureus was most common in 2 (37%) and 3 (36%) year olds. P. aeruginosa increased from 18% at 1 year of age to 33% at 3 years of age and was usually present in high numbers, i.e., > or =10(5) CFU/ml of BAL fluid. Investigators have studied the microbiology of young CF infants using specimens derived from the upper airway (deep throat) compared with the lower airway (broncheoalveolar lavage specimens) to determine if the upper airway is predictive of pathogens in the lower airway. In general, these studies have shown that a negative oropharyngeal culture indicated that isolation of P. aeruginosa from the lower airway was unlikely, but a positive culture did not predict lower airway infection. Similar findings were noted for H. influenzae and S. aureus.
TI  - New developments in antibacterial choice for lower respiratory tract infections in elderly patients.
AB  - Elderly patients are at increased risk of developing lower respiratory tract infections compared with younger patients. In this population, pneumonia is a serious illness with high rates of hospitalisation and mortality, especially in patients requiring admission to intensive care units (ICUs). A wide range of pathogens may be involved depending on different settings of acquisition and patient's health status. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial isolate in community-acquired pneumonia, followed by Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and atypical pathogens such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. However, elderly patients with comorbid illness, who have been recently hospitalised or are residing in a nursing home, may develop severe pneumonia caused by multidrug resistant staphylococci or pneumococci, and enteric Gram-negative bacilli, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, anaerobes may be involved in aspiration pneumonia. Timely and appropriate empiric treatment is required in order to enhance the likelihood of a good clinical outcome, prevent the spread of antibacterial resistance and reduce the economic impact of pneumonia. International guidelines recommend that elderly outpatients and inpatients (not in ICU) should be treated for the most common bacterial pathogens and the possibility of atypical pathogens. The algorithm for therapy is to use either a selected beta-lactam combined with a macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin), or to use monotherapy with a new anti-pneumococcal quinolone, such as levofloxacin, gatifloxacin or moxifloxacin. Oral (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefuroxime axetil) and intravenous (sulbactam/ampicillin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) beta-lactams are agents of choice in outpatients and inpatients, respectively. For patients with severe pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia, the specific algorithm is to use either a macrolide or a quinolone in combination with other agents; the nature and the number of which depends on the presence of risk factors for specific pathogens. Despite these recommendations, clinical resolution of pneumonia in the elderly is often delayed with respect to younger patients, suggesting that optimisation of antibacterial therapy is needed. Recently, some new classes of antibacterials, such as ketolides, oxazolidinones and streptogramins, have been developed for the treatment of multidrug resistant Gram-positive infections. However, the efficacy and safety of these agents in the elderly is yet to be clarified. Treatment guidelines should be modified on the basis of local bacteriology and resistance patterns, while dosage and/or administration route of each antibacterial should be optimised on the basis of new insights on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters and drug interactions. These strategies should be able to reduce the occurrence of risk factors for a poor clinical outcome, hospitalisation and death.
TI  - Bacteriology of mastoid subperiosteal abscess in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Subperiosteal abscess (SA) is the most frequent complication of acute  mastoiditis (AM). Of pathogens cultured from the external auditory canal or middle ear during myringotomy, 15% may be different from microorganisms isolated from the SA. We suggest, therefore, that only cultures obtained from the abscess cavity can truly reflect the bacteriology of this complication of AM. The purpose of our study was to analyze the infectious agents which cause SA and mastoid cortex erosion in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The medical records of 35 children who underwent mastoidectomy for SA between May 1984 and April 2002 were evaluated. RESULTS: Mastoid cortex erosion was found at surgery in 72.7% of abscesses Purulent discharge was obtained from the SA cavity in 28 cases. The commonest pathogens isolated in these cases, as well as in 18 cases of mastoid cortex erosion, were Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Hemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Sterile culture was found in 25% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Mastoid SA is a unilateral disease that can recur. Early administration of anti-Staphylococcus medications should be considered for patients with SA as a complication of AM.
TI  - Increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Korea: KONSAR study in 2001.
AB  - The 5th year KONSAR surveillance in 2001 was based on routine test data at 30 participating hospitals. It was of particular interest to find a trend in the resistances of enterococci to vancomycin, of Enterobacteriaceae to the 3rd generation cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone, and of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacters to carbapenem. Resistance rates of Gram-positive cocci were: 70% of Staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin; 88% and 16% of Enterococcus faecium to ampicillin and vancomycin, respectively. Seventy-two percent of pneumococci were nonsusceptible to penicillin. The resistance rates of Enterobacteriaceae were: Escherichia coli, 28% to fluoroquinolone; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 27% to ceftazidime, and 20% to cefoxitin; and Enterobacter cloacae, > or =40% to cefotaxime and ceftazidime. The resistance rates of P. aeruginosa were 21% to ceftazidime, 17% to imipenem, and those of the acinetobacters were > or =61% to ceftazidime, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolone and cotrimoxazole. Thirty-five percent of non-typhoidal salmonellae were ampicillin resistant, and 66% of Haemophilus influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. Notable changes over the 1997-2001 period were: increases in vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, and amikacin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant acinetobacters. With the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria, nationwide surveillance has become more important for optimal patient management, for the control of nosocomial infection, and for the conservation of the newer antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Epidemiology of nosocomial pneumonia in infants after cardiac surgery.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pattern of nosocomial pneumonia (NP) in infants in a pediatric surgical ICU after cardiac surgery may differ from that seen in adult ICUs. STUDY OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of NP in infants after cardiac surgery and, secondarily, to describe the changes of the distribution and antibiotic resistance of the pathogen during the last 3 years. METHODS: Data were collected between June 1999 and June 2002 from 311 consecutive infants who underwent open-heart surgery in our hospital. We retrospectively analyzed the distribution and antibiotic resistance pattern of all the pathogenic microbial isolates cultured from lower respiratory tract aspirations. RESULTS: Of 311 infants, 67 patients (21.5%) acquired NP after cardiac surgery. The incidence of NP was more frequently associated with complex congenital heart defect (CHD) compared to simple CHD (43% vs 15.9%, chi(2) = 22.47, p < 0.0001). The proportion of late-onset NP was higher in patients with complex CHD (chi(2) = 6.02, p = 0.014). A total of 79 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated. Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) were the most frequent isolates (68 isolates, 86.1%), followed by fungi (6 isolates, 7.6%) and Gram-positive cocci (5 isolates, 6.3%). The main GNB were Acinetobacter baumanii (11 isolates, 13.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 isolates, 12.7%); other commonly seen GNB were Flavobacterium meningosepticum (7 isolates, 8.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7 isolates, 8.9%), Escherichia coli (6 isolates, 7.6%), and Xanthomonas maltophilia (5 isolates, 6.2%). The most commonly seen Gram-positive cocci were Staphylococcus aureus (2 isolates, 2.5%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 isolates, 2.5%). The frequent fungi were Candida albicans (5 isolates, 6.3%). Most GNB were sensitive to cefoperazone-sulbactum, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, amikacin. The bacteria producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases were mainly from K pneumoniae and E coli; the susceptibility of ESBL-producing strains to imipenem was 100%. There were one case of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) and 1 case of methicillin-resistant S epidermidis; their susceptibility to vancomycin, gentamycin, and ciprofloxacin were 100%. From 1999 to 2002 in infants with NP after open-heart surgery, there was a trend of increasing frequency of multiresistant GNB such as A baumanii, P aeruginosa, and K pneumoniae. However, no remarkable changes of distribution were found in Gram-positive cocci and fungi in the 3-year period. Early onset episodes of NP were frequently caused by Haemophilus influenzae, methicillin-sensitive S aureus, and other susceptible Enterobacteriaceae. Conversely, in patients who acquired late-onset NP, P aeruginosa, A baumannii, other multiresistant GNB, MRSA, and fungi were the predominant organisms. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of pathogens and their antibiotic-resistance patterns in NP in infants after cardiac surgery had not shown an increasing prevalence of Gram-positive pathogens as reported by several adult ICUs. GNB still remained the most common pathogens during the last 3 years in our hospital. There was a trend of increasing antibiotic resistance in these isolates.
TI  - In vitro activity of BAL9141 against clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of BAL9141 against 150 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria were determined and compared to those of cefepime and ceftriaxone. BAL9141 exhibited comparable activity to cefepime and ceftriaxone against Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase nonproducing Enterobacter cloacae, and comparable activity to cefepime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - [Suppurative middle ear infection as a complication after tympanostomy tube placement].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Suppurative otitis media after tympanostomy tube placement is the most frequent complication of this surgical intervention. Otorrhea that occurs in the first two weeks following tube placement is called early, late otorrhea occurs at least two weeks following placement. Early otorrhea is usually a result of either an infection that already existed when the tube was placed, or contamination of the external auditory canal during operation. Late otorrhea is mostly a result of upper respiratory tract infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our investigation was performed at the ENT Department, Mother and Child Health Care Institute in Belgrade. The research included children treated for secretory or recurrent otitis media. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We have examined 411 children implanted with 796 tympanostomy tubes in the last three years. We investigated changes within two weeks after operation. Suppuration was recorded with 81 children (19.7%). Staphylococcus aureus was established in 33 (40.7%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 26 (32%), Haemophilus influenzae in 12 (15%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae in 10 (12.3%) cases. All children were treated with antibiotic ear drops according to the antibiogram for a period of 7 days. Full recovery was achieved after treatment with Ciprofloxacin drops in 67%, Neomycin in 18% and Gentamycin in 9% of cases. In other cases a combination of drops and oral antibiotics was used. CONCLUSION: In cases of suppurative otitis media after implantation of tympanostomy tubes, the secret should be treated with suction and after that antibiotic drops should be applied during 5 to 7 days. If suppuration is persistent, drops should be used with oral antibiotics.
TI  - Optimizing treatment outcomes in severe community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a life-threatening condition that requires intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Clinical presentation is characterized by the presence of respiratory failure, severe sepsis, or septic shock. Severe CAP accounts for approximately 5-35% of hospital-treated cases of pneumonia with the majority of patients having underlying comorbidities. The most common pathogens associated with this disease are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Gram-negative enteric rods. Microbial investigation is probably helpful in the individual case but is likely to be more useful for defining local antimicrobial policies. The early and rapid initiation of empiric antimicrobial treatment is critical for a favorable outcome. It should include intravenous beta-lactam along with either a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone. Modifications of this basic regimen should be considered in the presence of distinct comorbid conditions and risk factors for specific pathogens. Other promising nonantimicrobial new therapies are currently being investigated. The assessment of severity of CAP helps physicians to identify patients who could be managed safely in an ambulatory setting. It may also play a crucial role in decisions about length of hospital stay and time of switching to oral antimicrobial therapy in different groups at risk. The most important adverse prognostic factors include advancing age, male sex, poor health of patient, acute respiratory failure, severe sepsis, septic shock, progressive radiographic course, bacteremia, signs of disease progression within the first 48-72 hours, and the presence of several different pathogens such as S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative enteric bacilli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, some important topics of severity assessment remain controversial, including the definition of severe CAP. Prediction rules for complications or death from CAP, although far from perfect, should identify the majority of patients with severe CAP and be used to support decision-making by the physician. They may also contribute to the evaluation of processes and outcomes of care for patients with CAP.
TI  - Pseudomonal infections in patients with COPD: epidemiology and management.
AB  - COPD is a common disease with increasing prevalence. The chronic course of the disease is characterized by acute exacerbations that cause significant worsening of symptoms. Bacterial infections play a dominant role in approximately half of the episodes of acute exacerbations of COPD. The importance of pseudomonal infection in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD stems from its relatively high prevalence in specific subgroups of these patients, and particularly its unique therapeutic ramifications. The colonization rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with COPD in a stable condition is low.A review of a large number of clinical series of unselected outpatients with acute exacerbations of COPD revealed that P. aeruginosa was isolated from the patients' sputum at an average rate of 4%. This rate increased significantly in COPD patients with advanced airflow obstruction, in whom the rate of sputum isolates of P. aeruginosa reached 8-13% of all episodes of acute exacerbations of COPD. However, the great majority of bacteria isolated in these patients were not P. aeruginosa, but the three classic bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The subgroup of patients, with acute exacerbations of COPD, with the highest rate of P. aeruginosa infection, which approaches 18% of the episodes, is mechanically ventilated patients. However, even in this subgroup the great majority of bacteria isolated are the above-mentioned three classic pathogens. In light of these epidemiologic data and other important considerations, and in order to achieve optimal antibacterial coverage for the common infectious etiologies, empiric antibacterial therapy should be instituted as follows. Patients with acute exacerbations of COPD with advanced airflow obstruction (FEV(1) <50% of predicted under stable conditions) should receive once daily oral therapy with one of the newer fluoroquinolones, i.e. levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, or gemifloxacin for 5-10 days. Patients with severe acute exacerbations of COPD who are receiving mechanical ventilation should receive amikacin in addition to one of the intravenous preparations of the newer fluoroquinolones or monotherapy with cefepime, a carbapenem or piperacillin/tazobactam. In both subgroups it is recommended that sputum cultures be performed before initiation of therapy so that the results can guide further therapy.
TI  - Treatment of experimental bacterial keratitis with topical trovafloxacin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic role of trovafloxacin mesylate, a newer-generation fluoroquinolone with an expanded spectrum of activity, in the treatment of experimental bacterial keratitis. METHODS: Susceptibility studies were performed on various strains of ocular isolates to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of trovafloxacin compared with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, using the E-test method. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed by a single topical administration of trovafloxacin to rabbit eyes with either an intact or denuded corneal epithelium. Aqueous humor, vitreous, and corneal concentrations of trovafloxacin were determined at different time points. Experimental bacterial keratitis studies were performed in rabbit eyes. Three identical studies were conducted using Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therapy groups included 0.5% trovafloxacin, 0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. After 12 hours of drops administration, corneas were excised, homogenized, and serially plated. The main outcome measure was quantitative bacteriologic analysis for residual colony-forming units. RESULTS: In vitro susceptibility study findings indicated that the MIC of trovafloxacin was significantly lower than the MIC of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, lower than the MIC of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and intermediate between ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for P. aeruginosa. Pharmacokinetic studies showed a significant concentration of trovafloxacin in the treated corneas, especially in eyes with a denuded epithelium. All serum samples had undetectable trovafloxacin concentrations. Experimental keratitis studies showed a statistically significant decrease of colony-forming units in trovafloxacin-treated eyes in the S. aureus model and a similar decrease in the S pneumoniae and P aeruginosa models. CONCLUSIONS: Topical 0.5% trovafloxacin proved to be an effective ocular medication for the therapy of gram-positive and gram-negative keratitis. Clinical Relevance Trovafloxacin may provide an excellent therapeutic alternative in bacterial keratitis.
TI  - Mucosal immunization against respiratory bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Bacterial respiratory diseases remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. The young and the elderly are particularly susceptible to the pathogens that cause these diseases. Therapeutic approaches remain dependent upon antibiotics contributing to the persistent increases in antibiotic resistance. The main causes of respiratory disease discussed in this review are Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Bordatella pertussis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All these organisms initiate disease at the mucosal surface of the respiratory tract and thus the efficacy of the host's response to infection needs to be optimal at this site. Vaccines available for diseases caused by many of these pathogens have limitations in accessibility or efficacy, highlighting the need for improvements in approaches and products. The most significant challenges in both therapy and prevention of disease induced by bacteria in the respiratory tract remain the development of non-injectable vaccines and delivery systems/immunization regimens that improve mucosal immunity.
TI  - The role of the methylene blue and toluidine blue monomers and dimers in the photoinactivation of bacteria.
AB  - The interactions between the phenothiazine dyes, methylene blue (MB) and toluidine blue (TB), and bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were studied spectrophotometrically. This demonstrated that a metachromatic reaction took place between the dyes and bacteria. Furthermore, bacteria induced additional dimerization of MB and TB. The effective dimerization constants of MB and TB were evaluated in the presence of each bacterial strain at a concentration of 10(8) CFU/ml. The analysis of the effective dimerization constants for MB and TB in the presence of bacteria indicated that the ability to form dimers was greater for TB than for MB. Gram-negative bacteria induced the dye dimerization more intensely than gram-positive bacteria. There was a correlation between the ability of each dye to form dimers in the presence of bacteria and the relative photobactericidal efficacy of each dye against these bacteria. These results provide evidence confirming the essential role of the dye dimers in bacterial photodamage.
TI  - Topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension is superior to ofloxacin otic solution in the treatment of children with acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension compared with ofloxacin otic solution in the treatment of acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes (AOMT) in pediatric patients. METHODS: This multicenter, prospective, randomized, observer-masked, parallel-group study was conducted at 39 sites in 599 children aged >or=6 months to 12 years with an AOMT episode of <or=3 weeks' duration. The mean age of patients was 2.5 years (standard deviation: 2.37 years). Patients received either ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% otic suspension 4 drops twice daily for 7 days or ofloxacin 0.3% otic solution 5 drops twice daily for 10 days. Clinical signs and symptoms of AOMT were evaluated at clinic visits on days 1 (baseline), 3 (on therapy), 11 (end of therapy), and 18 (test of cure). A patient diary was used to measure time to cessation of otorrhea. Principal pretherapy pathogens included Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.7%), Haemophilus influenzae (12.4%), S epidermidis (10.2%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (4.1%). RESULTS: Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone is superior to ofloxacin for clinical cure (90% vs 78%) and microbiologic success (92% vs 81.8%) at the test-of-cure visit, produces fewer treatment failures (4.4% vs 14.1%), and results in a shorter median time to cessation of otorrhea (4 days vs 6 days). Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone treatment is also superior to improvement in clinical response by visit, absence of otorrhea by visit, and reduction of otorrhea volume by visit. Both topical otic preparations are safe and well tolerated in pediatric patients. No change in speech recognition threshold or decrease in hearing from baseline, based on audiometric testing, was noted with either regimen. CONCLUSION: Topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone treatment is superior to topical ofloxacin in the treatment of AOMT.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. Changes in CZOP susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Serratia liquefaciens, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter Iwoffii, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Bacteroides fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas. CZOP preserved its antibacterial activity against M. (B.) catarrhalis (MIC90: 4 micrograms/mL) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against H. influenzae (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli was preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), and imipenem (IPM). The MIC90 of CZOP against K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/mL, respectively. The MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. aerogenes was preferable (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activities of CZOP against S. marcescens and S. liquefaciens were relatively potent (MIC90: 0.5 and 0.25 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of CPR, CFPM, and carumonam. CZOP preserved comparable antibacterial activity to CPR against C. freundii and C. koseri (MIC90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/mL). The MIC90 of CZOP against P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, and M. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/mL, respectively. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Providencia spp. was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. aeruginosa was the most potent (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) among the test agents and comparable to those CFPM, IPM, and MEPM. CZOP had low activity against P. fluorescens and P. putida (MIC90: 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against A. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR and CFPM (MIC90: 32 micrograms/mL) and against A. lwoffii was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). Most of the test agents including CZOP had low antibacterial activity against B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, and B. fragilis group. The MIC90 of CZOP against Prevotella/Porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/mL. Bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. In non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and CFPM, CAZ, CPR, or IPM was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. In conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. cloacae possible decreased, but against other Gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2001)].
AB  - From October 2001 to September 2002, we collected the specimen from 370 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 16 institutions in Japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of the isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics and patients' characteristics. Of 458 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 456 strains were investigated. The breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 69, Streptococcus pneumoniae 72, Haemophilus influenzae 85, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 44, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 13, Klebsiella pneumoniae 32, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 32, and others. Of 69 S. aureus strains, those with 4 micrograms/mL or more of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) occupied 43.5%. Vancomycin and arbekacin showed the most potent activities against MRSA as observed in 2000. The frequency of S. pneumoniae exhibiting low sensitivity to penicillin (penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae: PISP + penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae: PRSP) was 59.7% and both rates of PISP and PRSP were the highest after 1992. Carbapenems had strong activities against S. pneumoniae. Especially, panipenem and imipenem inhibited the growth of all 72 strains at 0.125 and 0.5 microgram/mL, respectively. Generally, all drugs had strong activities against H. influenzae with MIC90s of 16 micrograms/mL or less. The drug that had the strongest activity against H. influenzae was levofloxacin, which inhibited the growth of 80 of the 85 strains at 0.063 microgram/mL. Against P. aeruginosa mucoid strain, meropenem had a strong activity with MIC90 of 0.5 microgram/mL while, against non-mucoid strain, tobramycin had a strong activity with MIC90 of 2 micrograms/mL. K. pneumoniae showed good susceptibilities to all drugs except ampicillin and minocycline, and the MIC90s were 4 micrograms/mL or less. Particularly, cefmenoxime, cefpirome, and imipenem had the strongest activity (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL), and cefozopran had a strong activity, inhibiting the growth of all strains at 0.25 microgram/mL. Also, all drugs generally had strong activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis. MIC90s of all drugs were 4 micrograms/mL or less. The drug that had the strongest activity was minocycline and levofloxacin inhibiting all 32 strains at 0.063 microgram/mL. Most of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older, accounting for approximately a half of the total (40.5%). As for the incidence by the diseases, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest, being noted in 39.2% and 37.3% of all the patients, respectively. The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were S. aureus (19.3%) and S. pneumoniae (19.9%). In contrast, H. influenzae (22.0%) were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. Before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were S. pneumoniae (20.8%) and H. influenzae (21.5%). S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae decreased after the initiation of drug administration while S. aureus increased. The isolation frequency of P. aeruginosa was higher after than before the initiation of drug administration. The bacteria were frequently isolated from the patients who had already treated with cephems were S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. From the patients who had already treated with macrolides, S. pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated while S. aureus was the most frequently isolated from the patients pre-treated with quinolones.
TI  - [Activities of antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 medical institutions during 2000 in Japan].
AB  - A survey was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 Japanese medical institutions in 2000. A total of 25 antimicrobial agents were used, comprising 4 fluoroquinolones, 13 beta-lactams, minocycline, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, azithromycin, gentamicin, amikacin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and vancomycin. A high resistance rate of over 85% against fluoroquinolones was exhibited by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecium. Isolates showing resistance to fluoroquinolones among methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from UTI accounted for 30-60%. However, many of the common pathogens were still susceptible to fluoroquinolones, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Moraxella catarrhalis, the Enterobacteriaceae family, and Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant isolates). About 85% of P. aeruginosa isolated from RTI were susceptible to fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, this survey of sensitivity to antimicrobial agents clearly indicated trend for increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones among MRSA, Enterococci, and P. aeruginosa isolated from UTI, although fluoroquinolones are still effective against other organisms and P. aeruginosa from RTI as has been demonstrated in previous studies.
TI  - [Administration of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].
AB  - We have to consider the exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD) may be caused not only by infection, but also by acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, or other cardiopulmonary complications. Because it is characteristic that the exacerbation of COPD is often recurensive, the most important thing is the administration during stable status. Approximately 40% of pathogens of the acute infectious exacerbation of COPD are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Echelisia coli. Also, approximately 15% is exacerbated by atypical pathogens such as Chlamydia pneumoniae and approximately 30% is by viral infection. We should contemplate the possibility of pathogens according to the statistics, when we choose antibiotics empirically.
TI  - Microbial mimics are major targets of crossreactivity with human pyruvate dehydrogenase in primary biliary cirrhosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Previous studies on patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) have shown extensive cross-reactivity between the dominant B- and T-cell epitopes of human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex-E2 (PDC-E2), and microbial mimics. Such observations have suggested microbial infection as having a role in the induction of anti-mitochondrial antibodies, through a mechanism of molecular mimicry. However the biological significance of these cross-reactivities is questionable, because PDC-E2 is so highly conserved among various species. METHODS: Interrogating protein databases, ten non-PDC-E2 microbial sequences with high degree of similarity to PDC-E2(212-226) were found in Escherichia coli (6), Helicobacter pylori, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Cytomegalovirus, and Haemophilus influenzae. We report on a study testing reactivity and competitive cross-reactivity against these respective peptides, and in some cases the parent protein, using sera from 55 patients with PBC, compared to reactivity of 190 pathological and 28 healthy controls. RESULTS: Cross-reactivity to E. coli mimics was commonly seen in PBC, and in a subset of pathological controls except where there was no evidence of urinary tract infection and correlated with anti-mitochondrial reactivity. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli/PDC-E2 cross-reactive immunity characterizes primary biliary cirrhosis; the large number of E. coli immunogenic mimics may account for the dominance of the major PDC-E2 autoepitope.
TI  - [Antibacterial therapy outside of Pseudomonas aeruginosa].
AB  - Hemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus (SA) are the predominant pathogens in infants with cystic fibrosis (CF). SA was the major cause of death in the pre-antibiotic era. The reason of the association of SA in CF is unclear. SA causes early damage of the respiratory tract and paves the way for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). Based of this hypothesis, some centers use prophylactic antibiotics, but their efficacy is not proved and may favor growth of PA. Treatment of exacerbations is mandatory. Oral antibiotics are preferred in most cases, although few controlled clinical studies have been reported. Emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains appeared during the recent years. Treatment of MRSA is difficult, patients segregation is discussed.
TI  - Argentinean collaborative multicenter study on the in vitro comparative activity  of piperacillin-tazobactam against selected bacterial isolates recovered from hospitalized patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of piperacillin-tazobactam and several antibacterial drugs  commonly used in Argentinean hospitals for the treatment of severe infections was determined against selected but consecutively isolated strains from clinical specimens recovered from hospitalized patients at 17 different hospitals from 9 Argentinean cities from different geographic areas during the period November 2001-March 2002. Out of 418 Enterobacteriaceae included in the Study 84% were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. ESBLs putative producers were isolated at an extremely high rate since among those isolates obtained from patients with hospital acquired infections 56% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 32% of Proteus mirabilis and 25% Escherichia coli were phenotypically considered as ESBLs producers Notably P.mirabilis is not considered by for screening for ESBL producers. ESBLs producers were 100% susceptible to imipenem and 70% were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam whereas more than 50% were resistant to levofloxacin. The isolates considered as amp C beta lactamase putative producers showed 99% susceptibility to carbapenems while 26.7% were resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam and 38.4% to levofloxacin. Noteworthy only 4% of the Enterobacteriaceae isolates were resistant to amikacin. Piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (MIC(90): 128 microg/ml; 78% susceptibility) but showed poor activity against Acinetobacter spp (MIC(90):>256 microg/ml; 21.7% susceptibility). Only 41.7% Acinetobacter spp isolates were susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam inhibited 100% of Haemophilus influenzae isolates (MIC(90) < 0.25 microg/ml) but only 16.6% of them were ampicillin resistant. The activity of piperacillin-tazobactam against oxacillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus or coagulase negative staphylococci was excellent (MIC(90) 2 microg/ml; 100% susceptibility). Out of 150 enterococci 12 isolates (8%) were identified as E.faecium and only three isolates (2%), 2 E.faecium and 1 E.faecalis were vancomycin resistant. All the enterococci isolates were susceptible to linezolid. Piperacillin-tazobactam showed excellent activity (MIC(90) 2 microg/ml; 92% susceptibility). Regarding pneumococci all the isolates showed MICs of 16 microg/ml for piperacillin-tazobactam. Among 34 viridans group streptococci only 67% were penicillin susceptible and 85.2% ceftriaxone susceptible whereas piperacillin-tazobactam was very active (MIC(90) 4 microg/ml).Piperacillin-tazobactam is therefore a very interesting antibacterial drug to be used, preferably in combination (IE: amikacin-vancomycin) for the empiric treatment of severe infections occurring in hospitalized patients in Argentina. Caution must be taken for infections due to ESBL producers considering that the inoculum effect MICs can affect MIC values.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. A total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabillis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobactor baumannii, Acinetobactor lwoffii, Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lwoffii throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in antibacterial activities of CZOP against B. cepacia, and H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis in Southern Israel: a twelve year retrospective study (1990 through 2001).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute mastoiditis is a serious complication of acute otitis media (AOM) and has been increasingly reported in the last decade. OBJECTIVES: To report the experience accumulated with acute mastoiditis at the Soroka University Medical Center, Beer-Sheva, Israel, in a period of increasing antimicrobial resistance with Streptococcus pneumoniae. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the records of all children with acute mastoiditis hospitalized from 1990 through 2001. Acute mastoiditis was diagnosed when one or more of the physical signs of mastoiditis (swelling, erythema, tenderness of the retroauricular area and anteroinferior displacement of the auricle) were diagnosed in the presence of concomitant or recent (< or =4 weeks) AOM. RESULTS: One hundred sixteen episodes of acute mastoiditis occurred in 101 children age 2 months to 14 years (median, 25 months; 19% <1 year old). The average yearly incidence was 6.1 cases per 100 000 population <14 years old, with a significant increase in the number of cases during the study period. Acute mastoiditis was the first evidence of AOM in 10 (10%) patients. Fever >38 degrees C and >15,000 WBC/mm3 were present in 67 and 43% of cases, respectively. Irritability, retroauricular swelling, redness and protrusion of the auricle occurred more commonly in patients <3 years old (79, 90, 84 and 76% vs. 28, 42, 45 and 30%, respectively, in patients > or =3 years old; P < 0.002). Computed tomography scans were performed in 54 of 116 (47%) cases and revealed bone destruction in 38 (70%). Periosteal abscess and lateral sinus vein thrombosis were diagnosed in 8 and 2 patients, respectively. Simple mastoidectomy was done in 32 of 116 (28%) cases, after no response to intravenous antibiotics was observed; ventilation tubes were inserted in 12 patients. Cultures were obtained at admission in 83 (72%) episodes (71 by tympanocentesis and 12 from ear discharges). Overall 43 pathogens were isolated: 34 at admission; 14 at surgery; and 5 at both occasions. The most commonly isolated organisms were S. pneumoniae (14 of 43, 33%; 4 penicillin-nonsusceptible), Streptococcus pyogenes (11 of 43, 26%), nontypable Haemophilus influenzae (6 of 43, 14%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5 of 43, 12%) and Escherichia coli (4 of 43, 9%). All S. pneumoniae organisms were isolated between 1996 and 2001. CONCLUSIONS: (1) The incidence of acute mastoiditis in children in Southern Israel is greater than that reported in the literature; (2) a significant increase in the number of cases was recorded during the study period; (3) the clinical picture of acute mastoiditis was more severe in infants and young children; (4) the pathogen distribution in acute mastoiditis differs from that of AOM with significantly higher rates of S. pyogenes and lower rates of nontypable H. influenzae recovery; (5) penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae played only a minor role in the etiology of acute mastoiditis in Southern Israel.
TI  - [Comparative in vitro activity of garenoxacin (BMS-284756). Sentry program, Spain (1999-2000)].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the in vitro activity of the new des-fluoro quinolone,  garenoxacin (BMS-284756), compared to activities of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and gatifloxacin in clinical isolates recovered over 1999 and 2000 within the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program. METHODS: Quinolone-MICs were performed using the standard NCCLS microdilution technique in 2599 isolates recovered from Hospital Ramon y Cajal (Madrid), Virgen Macarena (Sevilla), and Bellvitge (Barcelona). RESULTS: The modal MIC range value exhibited by garenoxacin ( < or = 0.03-0.12 mg/L) for Enterobacteriaceae was similar to that of the other quinolones tested. A total of 70% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to garenoxacin and 85% to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. Garenoxacin exhibited the highest activity in Staphylococcus aureus, including both methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates, with MIC90 values of < or = 0.03 and 2 mg/L, respectively. All Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to garenoxacin, regardless of their penicillin susceptibility status; in terms of MIC90, garenoxacin was 16 times more active than ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and 4-8 times more active than gatifloxacin. All 6 ciprofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae strains showed garenoxacin MIC values ranging from < or = 0.03 to 0.5 mg/L. In Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, garenoxacin displayed excellent in vitro activity (MIC < or = 0.06 mg/L), similar to that of the other quinolones tested. CONCLUSIONS: Garenoxacin activity was similar to the activity of other quinolones in Enterobacteriaceae, but was lower in P. aeruginosa. Garenoxacin activity was clearly higher than that of other quinolones in gram-positive isolates, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus and S. pneumoniae with reduced penicillin susceptibility.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial potency and spectrum of ABT-492, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - ABT-492 demonstrated potent antibacterial activity against most quinolone-susceptible pathogens. The rank order of potency was ABT-492 > trovafloxacin > levofloxacin > ciprofloxacin against quinolone-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci. ABT-492 had activity comparable to those of trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin against seven species of quinolone-susceptible members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, although it was less active than the comparators against Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. The activity of ABT-492 was greater than those of the comparators against fastidious gram-negative species, including Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Legionella spp. and against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Helicobacter pylori. ABT-492 was as active as trovafloxacin against Chlamydia trachomatis, indicating good intracellular penetration and antibacterial activity. In particular, ABT-492 was more active than trovafloxacin and levofloxacin against multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin and macrolides, and H. influenzae, including beta-lactam-resistant strains. It retained greater in vitro activity than the comparators against S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae strains resistant to other quinolones due to amino acid alterations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions of the target topoisomerases. ABT-492 was a potent inhibitor of bacterial topoisomerases, and unlike the comparators, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV from either Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli were almost equally sensitive to ABT-492. The profile of ABT-492 suggested that it may be a useful agent for the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections, as well as infections of the urinary tract, bloodstream, and skin and skin structure and nosocomial lung infections.
TI  - Molecular typing of the bacterial flora in sputum of cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - Despite recent advances in therapy, lower airway infections remain the major cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Bacterial colonisation of the lower airways in CF is limited to a few bacterial species, commonly Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae. Burkholderia cepacia colonisation is much rarer, but it has been thought to be associated with more advanced lung disease and increased mortality. A rapid characterisation of the bacterial flora in sputum of CF patients is of great importance for proper treatment. The aim of this study was to establish bacterial profiles and to identify pathogenic bacteria in respiratory specimens by means of molecular methods including temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) and DNA sequencing of PCR amplicons derived from 16S rDNA variable V3 and V6 regions. Sputa of 13 CF patients (7 males/6 females, age 19-59 years) collected at the Stockholm CF centre were analysed. TTGE revealed the presence of complex bacterial profiles in all samples. The V3 and V6 PCR amplicons were cloned and sequenced by real-time DNA Pyrosequencing. DNA from Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively, was identified together with sequences from normal oral cavity flora. The results were in reasonable agreement with those obtained by conventional bacterial culture, considering that only known CF pathogens are included in routine reports. However, the methodology seems too elaborate to be introduced into daily routine
TI  - Contemporary re-evaluation of the activity and spectrum of grepafloxacin tested against isolates in the United States.
AB  - Grepafloxacin potency and spectrum of activity were re-evaluated against contemporary pathogens collected from clinical infections in 2001-2002. A total of 995 isolates were tested for grepafloxacin by the reference agar dilution method and these results were compared to those of 25 other antimicrobial agents. Grepafloxacin activity remained comparable to that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae (MIC(90), 0.03-2 microg/ml; 0.0-7.7% resistance rates). For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, grepafloxacin was active against ciprofloxacin-susceptible (MIC(90), 2 microg/ml), but not against ciprofloxacin-resistant (MIC(90), >8 microg/ml) isolates. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, grepafloxacin susceptibility rate was 91.4%, equal to that of levofloxacin. None of the fluoroquinolones showed reasonable activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Gatifloxacin and grepafloxacin had the same MIC(90) against beta-hemolytic streptococci (0.25 microg/ml) and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.25 microg/ml). Grepafloxacin and other fluoroquinolone activities were not influenced by penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae. Grepafloxacin was very active against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC(90), 0.03 microg/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC(90), 0.03 microg/ml) and Legionella spp. (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/ml). These results on recently isolated organisms indicate that grepafloxacin has a sustained potency and spectrum against most clinically important and indicated pathogens.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of 4903 bacterial isolates to gemifloxacin--an advanced fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against over 4900 bacterial isolates was determined by microbroth dilution with interpretation in accordance with NCCLS guidelines. Susceptibility results were compared with those for ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Gemifloxacin and the other fluoroquinolones were not affected by either beta-lactamase production or penicillin-resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae. The MIC90 values for gemifloxacin were: S. pneumoniae 0.063 mg/l; Haemophilus influenzae 0.016 mg/l; Moraxella catarrhalis 0.008 mg/l, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus 0.063 mg/l; methicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pyogenes 0.031 mg/l; Enterobacteriaceae 0.031-0.16 mg/l; Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 mg/l; Neisseria meningitidis 0.008 mg/l. The MIC90 for gemifloxacin was lower than those for the other quinolones tested against S. pneumoniae (ciprofloxacin 2-4 mg/l, gatifloxacin 0.5 mg/l, levofloxacin 1-2 mg/l, moxifloxacin 0.25 mg/l). This study confirms the enhanced potent activity of gemifloxacin against Gram-positive pathogens, its broad-spectrum, Gram-negative activity and indicates that gemifloxacin is likely to have an important role in treating patients with Gram-positive and/or Gram-negative infections.
TI  - Bacterial diversity in cases of lung infection in cystic fibrosis patients: 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) length heterogeneity PCR and 16S rDNA terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism profiling.
AB  - The leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients stems from repeated bacterial respiratory infections. Many bacterial species have been cultured from CF specimens and so are associated with lung disease. Despite this, much remains to be determined. In the present study, we characterized without prior cultivation the total bacterial community present in specimens taken from adult CF patients, extracting DNA directly from 14 bronchoscopy or sputum samples. Bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA (rRNA) gene PCR products were amplified from extracted nucleic acids, with analyses by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), length heterogeneity PCR (LH-PCR), and sequencing of individual cloned PCR products to characterize these communities. Using the same loading of PCR products, 12 distinct T-RFLP profiles were identified that had between 3 and 32 T-RFLP bands. Nine distinct LH-PCR profiles were identified containing between one and four bands. T-RFLP bands were detected in certain samples at positions that corresponded to pathogens cultured from CF samples, e.g., Burkholderia cepacia and Haemophilus influenzae. In every sample studied, one T-RFLP band was identified that corresponded to that produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A total of 103 16S rRNA gene clones were examined from five patients. P. aeruginosa was the most commonly identified species (59% of clones). Stenotrophomonas species were also common, with eight other (typically anaerobic) bacterial species identified within the remaining 17 clones. In conclusion, T-RFLP analysis coupled with 16S rRNA gene sequencing is a powerful means of analyzing the composition and diversity of the bacterial community in specimens sampled from CF patients.
TI  - Reduction of potential respiratory pathogens by oral hygienic treatment in patients undergoing endotracheal anesthesia.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of mechanical and chemical prophylactic oral cleansing treatments for reducing potential respiratory pathogens existing in the oral cavity. METHODS: Thirty-two patients scheduled to undergo oral and maxillofacial surgery that required endotracheal anesthesia were randomly allocated to one of the two groups, the oral cleansing group (n = 16) or the noncleansing group (n = 16). Culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods were used to detect and enumerate pathogens. Oral cleansing was carried out with an electric toothbrush capable of automatically supplying and aspirating povidone-iodine solution before surgery, followed by rinsing twice a day after surgery. Cephazolin (3 g x day(-1)) was given to all patients for 5 days after surgery. RESULTS: The PCR detection rates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Porphyromonas gingivalis in gargle samples before treatment were 87.5%, 68.8%, 53.1%, and 40.6%, respectively. Oral cleansing reduced the detection rates and numbers of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus species, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. In contrast, there was no significant reduction of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus species, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or P. aeruginosa in subjects who underwent systemic cephazolin administration without oral cleansing. CONCLUSION: The combination of mechanical and chemical oral cleansing resulted in a significant reduction of potential respiratory pathogens in the oral cavity.
TI  - Levofloxacin pharmacokinetics in ESRD and removal by the cellulose acetate high performance-210 hemodialyzer.
AB  - BACKGROUND: No published data are available describing the pharmacokinetics of intravenous levofloxacin in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Objectives of this study are to determine the pharmacokinetics and dialytic clearance of levofloxacin and develop dosing strategies in these patients. METHODS: Eight noninfected subjects receiving long-term thrice-weekly hemodialysis, with no measurable residual renal function, were administered intravenous levofloxacin, 250 mg, over 1 hour after a scheduled hemodialysis session. Blood samples were collected serially during the interdialytic period, during the next intradialytic period, and immediately after the next hemodialysis session. Serum concentrations of levofloxacin were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Differential equations describing a 2-compartment open-infusion pharmacokinetic model were fit to each individual subject's serum concentration-time data by iterative nonlinear weighted least-squares regression analysis using Adapt II (Biomedical Simulations Resource, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA). Ratios of maximum serum concentration (C(max)) to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were calculated for common respiratory pathogens by using MIC for 90% of isolates (MIC90) data from published studies. RESULTS: All subjects completed the study, and no adverse events were reported. Median systemic clearance, volume of distribution at steady state, elimination half-life, and C(max) were 37.0 mL/min (range, 12.8 to 42.7 mL/min), 103.3 L (range, 39.8 to 139.3 L), 34.4 hours (range, 28.4 to 39.3 hours), and 5.2 microg/mL (range, 4.1 to 11.3 microg/mL), respectively. Median dialytic clearance and levofloxacin reduction ratios were 84.4 mL/min (range, 61.8 to 107.6 mL/min) and 0.244 (range, 0.181 to 0.412), respectively. Median C(max)-MIC90 ratios were 10 or greater for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, approximately 5 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, and less than 1 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: The administration of levofloxacin to patients with ESRD as 500 mg initially, followed by 250 mg every 48 hours, will provide adequate C(max)-MIC ratios after the first and subsequent doses for most patients with respiratory tract infections caused by organisms with levofloxacin MICs of 1 microg/mL or less.
TI  - [Surveillance on drug resistance of gram-negative bacilli isolated from hospital  acquired infections and community acquired infections (2000 - 2001)].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the resistance rates of gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with hospital acquired infections (HAI) or community acquired infections (CAI) in the 34 study wards of 13 hospitals located at different areas in China. METHODS: 1596 strains of gram-negative bacilli from the 2401 pathogenic strains isolated from 13 hospitals 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 were collected for susceptibility test using international standard two-fold agar dilution method. According to the criteria of guidelines of NCCLS (2001), MIC(50) and MIC(90) were detected for antibacterial activity of antimicrobial agents and R%, I%, and S%, were calculated to show the resistant, intermediate and susceptible rates of bacteria to the compounds tested. RESULTS: 15 species of gram-negative pathogens were isolated and most of them could be isolated from both CAI and HAI patients. The resistance rates of isolates, especially Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia spp. and Acinetobacter spp. from HAI were higher than those of CAI. The carbopenems were the most active compounds tested against Enterobacteriaceae. Cefoperozone/sulbactam and cefprime demonstrated excellent activity against most of Gram-negative bacilli. Most of the Gram-negative bacilli were still rather susceptible to cefatazidime, a third generation cephalosporin, with a susceptibility rate of 70% to 100%. Fluoroquinolones showed strong and broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative bacilli, but more than 50% of Escherichia coli strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones, and the susceptible rates to fluoroquinolones of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae had decreased. CONCLUSION: (1) The results obtained in the two surveillance-years, 2000 - 2001 and 1998 - 1999, were similar in the bacterial resistance pattern and the trend of rising of resistant rates for some Gram-negative pathogens. (2) The resistance rates of isolates from HAI patients were higher than those of CAI.
TI  - [Bacterial infections in patients infected by HIV].
AB  - Individuals infected by the human immuno deficiency are more prone to suffering certain bacterial infections in the course of their clinical evolution. The agents involved in these infections are: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp and Campylobacter spp, which occasion an increase in morbidity and mortality. With a lower frequency, but with an equal morbidity and mortality, infections have been found caused by Rhodococcus equi, Nocardia spp and Bartonella spp. Even though all of them account for a selective impairment of immunodeficiency in one way or another, their incidence varies. Other factors such as degree of immuno suppression, habits, social and geographic living environment could be important. In general, there is a lack of chemoprophylactic strategies for their prevention. Early diagnosis and correct treatment could have important advantages for the quality of life and survival of these patients
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates by E test.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against several gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates was tested by E test. We found that the MIC(50) and MIC(90) values against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae family except Serratia were <0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (MIC range 0.006-32 mg/l) based on the in vitro susceptibility data. The susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more than 85% for Escherichia coli, citrobacter, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae, although Serratia and Acinetobacter exhibited more or less similar susceptibility rates (about 80%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance to fluoroquinolones (MIC(90) >32 mg/l) and decreased bactericidal rates (<65%) to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Respiratory pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible (100%) to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. The ineffectiveness of fluoroquinolones for treating coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated by poor in vitro susceptibility rates with levofloxacin (52%) and moxifloxacin (57%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrated significantly decreased bactericidal rates to levofloxacin (21%), while the in vitro susceptibility to moxifloxacin was higher (66%) than that to levofloxacin. We propose that the beneficial effect of inclusion of any of these three fluoroquinolones in treating Enterococcus infections is marginal, as demonstrated by significantly reduced susceptibility rates (<32%). These data demonstrate the utility of fluoroquinoles to treat several gram-negative bacterial infections (with the exception of Acinetobacter and P. aeruginosa), as well as S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae.
TI  - Bacterial infections in patients requiring admission for an acute exacerbation of COPD; a 1-year prospective study.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency of respiratory bacterial infections in hospitalized patients, admitted with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), to identify the responsible pathogens by sputum culture and to assess patient characteristics in relation to sputum culture results. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated clinical data and sputum culture results of 171 patients, admitted to the pulmonology department of the University Hospital Maastricht with an acute exacerbation of COPD from 1st January 1999 until 31st December 1999. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients (50%) had positive sputum cultures, indicating the presence of bacterial infection. Pathogens most frequently isolated were: Haemophilus influenzae (45%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (27%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15%). Patients with more severely compromised lung function had a higher incidence of bacterial infections (P = 0.026). There were no significant differences in age, lung function parameters, blood gas results and length of hospital stay between patients with and without bacterial infection. There were no correlations between the type of bacteria isolated and clinical characteristics. CONCLUSION: Incidence of bacterial infection during acute exacerbations of COPD is about 50%. Patients with and without bacterial infection are not different in clinical characteristics or in outcome parameters. Patients with lower FEV1 have a higher incidence of bacterial infections, but there is no difference in the type of bacterial infection. In the future, the pathogenic role of bacterial infection in exacerbations of COPD should be further investigated, especially the role of bacterial infection in relation to local and systemic inflammation.
TI  - A prospective study of infections in lung cancer patients admitted to the hospital.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the type of infections occurring in hospitalized patients with lung cancer. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Department of internal medicine in a cancer hospital. PATIENTS: All patients with lung cancer who were hospitalized for any cause and who acquired infections at the time of admission or during the hospital stay between January 1997 and February 2001. INTERVENTIONS: None. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-five patients with lung cancer had 435 episodes of fever and/or microbiologically or otherwise documented infection. Two hundred eighteen patients (79.3%) presented with non-small cell lung carcinoma, while 49 patients (17.8%) had small cell lung cancer. The majority of the infections occurred in the tracheobronchial tree (56%). There were 38 episodes of bacteremia or fungemia, and the primary site of infection was identified in 18 cases (47%). Microbiologically documented infections accounted for 61% of the infectious episodes, and included a total of 312 microorganisms. The most frequent pathogens were Gram-negative bacteria (64%), followed by Gram-positive bacteria (25%) and fungi (8%). The predominant Gram-negative bacteria were Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Enterococcus faecalis essentially represented the Gram-positive bacteria. No multiresistant bacteria were observed. Bacteria were susceptible to most of the antibiotics classically administered for their treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The predominant site of infection in patients with lung cancer is the tracheobronchial tree, with S pneumoniae, S aureus, H influenzae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and M catarrhalis as the principal pathogens.
TI  - [Epidemiological survey of bacteria isolated from the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients].
AB  - With the aim of characterizing the evolution of the epidemiological profile of respiratory bacterial infections of patients having Cystic Fibrosis (CF), the authors conducted a retrospective analysis about it's incidence and prevalence in 78 CF patients followed at the CF Specialized Centre, Paediatric Department, Santa Maria Hospital, Lisbon, during a 5 years period (1995-1999). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated bacteria during the first three years of the study (60-73%), being surpassed by Staphylococcus aureus. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa always remained the principal agent of chronic colonization (44-59%), with a peak of beginning between 0 and 5 years (34%). A significative increase of the prevalence of intermitent and chronic colonization with Staphylococcus aureus was verified during this five years (48% to 83% and 32% to 54%). The prevalence of isolations of Meticillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus and of Burkholderia cepacia almost duplicated during this period. The taxes of isolation and chronic colonization with Alcaligenes xylosoxidans raised sharply beyond 1997 (from 3% and 0% in 1996 to 7% and 5% in 1997 and 10% and 7% in 1999). Chronic colonization with Haemophilus influenzae kept a median prevalence of 22%, in spite of an increase in isolations (from 42% to 61%). Fifty five per cent of the patients were chronically colonized by two or more agents. In view of these results, the authors discuss the therapeutic schemes and the measures to limit cross-infection which have been being advocated for CF patients in our centre.
TI  - Prevalence of pathogens in cystic fibrosis patients in Bahia, Brazil.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recurrent respiratory infections account for most of the morbidity  and mortality of cystic fibrosis patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The objective was to determine the prevalence of pathogens isolated from lower respiratory tract secretions in cystic fibrosis patients. In this descriptive observational study, data from 69 patients was collected from medical records. RESULTS: The microorganisms that were identified included 36.2 P. aeruginosa, 28.9% S. Aureus, 4.3% K. pneumoniae, 1.5% H. influenzae, 1.5% E. coli, 1.5% S. maltoophilia, and in 27.5% the flora was normal. The prevalence of P. aeruginosa was 83% in patients under two years of age, demonstrating early colonization. CONCLUSION: P. aeruginosa and S. aureus were the most prevalent pathogens; there was also early infection/colonization by P. aeruginosa. This information will contribute to improved therapeutic measures for patients of the Bahia Cystic Fibrosis Reference Center.
TI  - Dynamics of bacterial colonisation in the respiratory tract of patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Mutations in the human genome may result in altered phenotypes. The cystic fibrosis (CF) patient, for instance, suffers from an aberrant composition of the epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract. In this particular case, a single point mutation in the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator (CFTR) gene results in major physiological changes resulting in ecological changes that generate a niche particularly attractive to a selected set of microbial pathogens. We here present a review on the dynamics of the bacterial populations inhabiting the CF lung. Studies focusing on Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa will be summarised and discussed, whereas the technology used for microbial characterisation will be shortly highlighted. Emphasis, however, will be on those studies that assessed the genetic diversity among clinical isolates that were obtained over prolonged periods of time, enabling the distinction between persistent colonisation versus frequent re-infection by the selected pathogens. Evolutionary adaptation of pathogens to the CF lung is a common theme in many of these studies.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravenous levofloxacin in patients with early-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin and the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic appropriateness of its total body exposure in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) treated for early-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with intravenous levofloxacin 500mg twice daily. DESIGN: Prospective non-blinded pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study. PARTICIPANTS: Ten critically ill adult patients with normal renal function. METHODS: Blood and urine samples were collected at appropriate times during a 12-hour administration interval at steady state. Levofloxacin concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Clinical and microbiological outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: Levofloxacin pharmacokinetics were only partially comparable with those obtained from literature data for healthy volunteers. Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(tau)) over the 12-hour dosage interval was about 30-40% lower than in healthy volunteers (33.90 vs 49.60 mg. h/L). The reduced exposure may be due to a greater clearance of levofloxacin (0.204 vs 0.145 L/h/kg [3.40 vs 2.42 mL/min/kg]), leading to a shorter elimination half-life (5.2 vs 7.6 hours). Cumulative urinary excretion during the 12-hour dosage interval confirmed the greater excretion of unchanged drug in these patients compared with healthy subjects (76% vs 68%). Coadministered drugs used to treat underlying diseases (dopamine, furosemide, mannitol) may at least partially account for this enhanced elimination in critically ill patients. Intravenous levofloxacin 500mg twice daily ensured a median C(max)/MIC (maximum plasma concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration) ratio of 102 and a median 24-hour AUC/MIC ratio of 930 SIT(-1). h (inverse serum inhibitory titre integrated over time) against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. The overall success rate of the assessable cases was 75% (6/8). Bacterial eradication was obtained in all of the assessable cases (8/8), but a superinfection (Acinetobacter anitratus,Pseudomonas aeruginosa) occurred in three cases. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the suitability of intravenous levofloxacin 500mg twice daily in the treatment of early-onset VAP in ICU patients with normal renal function. Levofloxacin may represent a valid alternative to non-pseudomonal beta-lactams or aminoglycosides in the empirical treatment of early-onset VAP. However, further larger studies are warranted to investigate its efficacy.
TI  - Pathogenesis of posttraumatic empyema: the impact of pneumonia on pleural space infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thoracic empyema may result either from primary pneumonic sources or  intraabdominal sources of infection that seed the pleural space secondarily. In patients with thoracostomy tubes, empyema may result when blood in the pleural space becomes contaminated during tube insertion. To elucidate the cause of posttraumatic empyema, preoperative bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)/sputum cultures obtained from patients with posttraumatic empyema were compared with cultures obtained at the time of decortication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of trauma patients who developed empyema and underwent either video-assisted thoracoscopy or thoracotomy with decortication following blunt or penetrating trauma. At our level I trauma center, we studied all empyema cases diagnosed from November, 1998 to July, 2001. Data collection included patient demographics, injuries sustained, preoperative BAL/sputum cultures, and culture data obtained at the time of decortication. All BAL/sputum cultures were performed no more than 5 days prior to decortication. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients (26 blunt/11 penetrating) were identified. No patients had concurrent intra-abdominal sources of infection. All patients had at least one chest tube placed prior to decortication. Preoperative respiratory cultures (BAL/sputum) were obtained in 34 patients. The most common organisms isolated were Staphylococcus aureus in six patients (18%) and Hemophilus influenzae in six patients (18%). Intraoperative cultures were obtained in all 37 patients, with the most common organism being S. aureus isolated in 22 patients (60%). Interestingly, a correlation between preoperative BAL/sputum and intraoperative cultures was found in only seven of the 34 patients (21%) who had concomitant respiratory and pleural cultures. Cultures positive for S. aureus were isolated from five patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae from one patient, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from one patient. CONCLUSION: Little correlation existed between preoperative BAL/sputum cultures and intraoperative cultures in this series of patients with posttraumatic empyema. This suggests that the causation is most often not a parapneumonic process. Furthermore, since S. aureus was the most common organism recovered from empyema, the source was more likely from inoculation of the pleural space by the injury itself or by tube thoracostomy.
TI  - Pathogen of occurrence and susceptibility patterns associated with pneumonia in hospitalized patients in North America: results of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Study (2000).
AB  - Antimicrobial selection for patients diagnosed with pneumonia is a major therapeutic challenge and dilemma to the clinical practitioner. In the community setting, patients usually receive empiric oral therapy based upon multiple patient risk factors and locally prevalent pathogen susceptibilities. For patients admitted to the hospital with pneumonia, or who acquire pneumonia while in the hospital, therapy can be initially empiric and then become directed once culture and susceptibility results are known. The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program since 1997, has monitored pathogen frequency and antimicrobial susceptibilities in hospitalized patients with pneumonia in North America. In this Study 2,712 pathogens were studied from 30 medical centers (25 in the United States and 5 in Canada). Over 30 species of organisms were recovered with Staphylococcus aureus comprising 28.0% of all isolates and with four other species (Pseudomonas aeruginosa 20.0%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 9.1%, Klebsiella spp. 7.5% and Haemophilus influenzae 7.3%) constituted 71.9% of isolates submitted. Methicillin (oxacillin)-resistant S. aureus accounted for 43.7% of all S. aureus isolates. Antimicrobials demonstrating significant (>80%) activity against S. aureus were: chloramphenicol (81.6%), tetracycline (91.4%), rifampin (96.4%) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (99.7%); and no isolate was resistant to glycopeptides or linezolid. North American isolates of P. aeruginosa were most susceptible to amikacin (93.7%) > tobramycin (90.2%) > meropenem (89.1%) > imipenem = piperacillin/tazobactam (85.6%) > piperacillin (82.1%) > cefepime (80.5%). Overall, 32.1% of S. pneumoniae were penicillin non-susceptible while erythromycin susceptibility was only 74.8%. Fluoroquinolones and recent generation cephalosporins retained excellent activity (gatifloxacin [99.2%] > levofloxacin = cefepime [98.8%] > ceftriaxone [97.2%]) against S. pneumoniae. Klebsiella spp. were 100.0% susceptible to the carbapenems (meropenem and imipenem) but extended spectrum beta-lactamases were detected at a rate of 5.4%. The beta-lactamase-positive rate in H. influenzae was 28.6% in North America (71.4% ampicillin-susceptible). The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program continues to identify important North American patterns of pathogen frequency and resistance. Additionally, the provision of multi-year longitudinal data and associated reports allow for comparisons, which function as critical tools for effective patient management and antimicrobial interventions.
TI  - Comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent North American clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the US and Canada between 1997 and 1999. Based upon Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many Gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. Against Enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general, displayed weak activity with only Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae including Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.
TI  - [Current epidemiological and clinical features meningitis in a northern Italian area]
AB  - Objectives: To study etiological, epidemiological and clinical features of 97 cases of acute meningitis. Methods: Ninety-seven cases of acute meningitis were examined in adult HIV-negative patients admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of the Azienda Ospedale-Universita S. Anna in Ferrara. Demographic, etiological, epidemiological and clinical data were analyzed. Results: All cases were divided into two groups according to the macroscopic aspect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): purulent CSF (50 cases) or non-purulent CSF (47 cases). Purulent CSF meningitis more frequently affected male patients (64% vs 47%) and older patients (average 52 vs 44 years). The main epidemiological features in both groups were underlying bacterial diseases (i.e. otomastoiditis and/or sinusitis in 50% of pneumococcal meningitis) and iatrogenic immunodeficiency. From a clinical point of view the following alterations in the state of consciousness (stupor, confusion and coma) were most frequently found in purulent meningitis. The following non purulent forms of meningitis were diagnosed: 5 tubercular, 3 viral infections, 2 by Listeria monocytogenes, 1 by Entoameba histolytica, 1 by Cryptococcus neoformans and 35 (74,4%) unknown causes. Purulent meningitis were: 20 (40%) Streptococcus pneumoniae, 10 Neisseria meningitidis, 3 Staphylococcus aureus, 2 Escherichia coli, 1 Haemophilus influenzae and 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 13 cases were unidentified. From 1989 to 1993 and from 1994-98 both groups of meningitis increased; respectively from 17 to 30 cases for non-purulent meningitis and from 18 to 32 cases for purulent meningitis. Meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae increased from 27.7% to 46.8% during the period 1994-98. Conclusions: The study shows the high incidence of pneumococcal meningitis, during 1994-98, because a large number of patients with sinusitis and otomastoiditis were observed. The incidence of meningococcal meningitis appears stable. These data confirm the importance of timely diagnosis and correct therapy for such infections with reserved prognosis.
TI  - [The impact of antibiotic use on hospital-acquired pneumonia: data of etiology tests].
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate most common pathogens isolated from the hospital-acquired pneumonia patients bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in Kaunas University of Medicine Hospital according to the previous antibiotic use and to estimate pathogens antibacterial susceptibility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Results of 87 hospital-acquired pneumonia patients bronchoalveolar lavage fluid quantitative cultures were analyzed. Microorganisms isolated in clinically significant amount were considered as the etiological agents and included into analysis. Susceptibility was tested using the standard methods. Previously untreated patients were considered if the antibacterials were not administered at all or were used less than for 24 hours. RESULTS: H. influenzae isolation in significant amount rates were higher in previously untreated patients group comparing to previously treated (29.2%. (n=14) and 5.1% (n=2), respectively, p<0.05). Non-fermenters (P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp.) isolation rates were higher in those previously treated comparing to untreated patients - (31.0% (n=13) and 4.2% (n=2), respectively, p<0.05). All H. influenzae strains were susceptible to ampicillin and cefuroxime. 22.2-44.4% of P. aeruginosa strains were resistant to ceftazidime, amikacin and ciprofloxacin. Estimated Acinetobacter spp. resistance to ciprofloxacin and gentamycin was 83.3% and to ampicillin/sulbactam - 16.7%. All methicillin-susceptible S.aureus were also susceptible to gentamycin and fucidin and methicillin resistant to rifampicin and vancomycin. CONCLUSIONS: Previous antibiotic treatment has an impact on pneumonia etiology testing. H. influenzae strains are more common isolated hospital-acquired pneumonia etiologic agents in previously untreated patients. The low antibacterial resistance was found enabling the use of aminopenicillins for treatment if H. influenzae infection suggested. The use of antibacterials increases non-fermenters isolation rates and combined antipseudomonal treatment is reasonable in these patients.

TI  - Current status of bacterial resistance in the otolaryngology field: results from  the Second Nationwide Survey in Japan.
AB  - The study reported here was a nationwide assessment of otitis media (466 patients with acute suppurative otitis media and 476 with chronic suppurative otitis media), sinusitis (447 with acute sinusitis and 426 with chronic sinusitis), acute tonsillitis (724 patients), and peritonsillar abscess (141 patients) performed between November 1998 and March 1999. Eighty university hospitals, 79 affiliated hospitals, and 103 general practitioners participated. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA) comprised 15.6% of the 786 isolated strains of S. aureus. MRSA was frequently detected in patients with suppurative otitis media, but was uncommon in those with acute tonsillitis or peritonsillar abscess, and it was more common in those who had already been treated than in those who had not, with a significant difference between the groups. Vancomycin (VCM) showed the highest antimicrobial activity against MRSA and no VCM resistance was detected. Penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae(PSSP), penicillin-intermediate-resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) accounted for 49.6%, 28.5%, and 21.9% of the 228 isolated strains of S. pneumoniae, respectively. PISP and PRSP were frequently detected in children aged 5 years or younger. beta-Lactamase was produced by 96 of the 100 strains (96%) of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. The 281 strains of Haemophilus influenzae isolated consisted of 199 beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-sensitive (BLNASe) strains (70.8%), 65 beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) strains (23.1%), and 17 beta-lactamase-producing strains (6.0%). BLNAR strains were frequently detected in pretreated patients. Of these 281 strains of H. influenzae, 214 had nontypable capsules. In conclusion, the major bacterial species showed resistance to beta-lactams, indicating that care should be taken when selecting an appropriate antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Bacterial aetiology of non-resolving otitis media in South African children.
AB  - Little is known of the aetiology, serotypes or susceptibility of the pathogens causing non-resolving otitis media in children receiving care from specialists in private practice in developed or in developing countries. Increased access to antibiotics in the community amongst children receiving such private care in South Africa may be anticipated to lead to levels of resistance similar to those found in countries with similar models of private practice, such as the United States. This study was conducted to determine the aetiology of non-resolving otitis media in South African children receiving private care and to determine the antimicrobial resistance patterns and serotypes of the bacterial isolates. Middle-ear fluid was cultured from 173 children aged two months to seven years with non-resolving acute otitis media accompanied by persistent pain or fever who were referred to otorhinolaryngologists for drainage of middle-ear fluid within 14 days of the start of symptoms. While 92 per cent of the children had recently received antibiotics and 54 per cent were currently receiving them, bacteria were isolated from 47 children (27 per cent). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen (35), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (nine), Staphylococcus aureus (six), Moraxella catarrhalis (two), Streptococcus pyogenes (two) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (one). Two isolates were identified in each of eight children. Antimicrobial resistance to one or more antibiotics was found in 33/35 (94 per cent) of the pneumococci isolated, with resistance to penicillin in 86 per cent, resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in 54 per cent and to erythromycin and clindamycin in 69 per cent and 57 per cent, respectively. The pneumococcal serotypes found were 19F (28 per cent), 14 (26 per cent), 23F (23 per cent), 6B (nine per cent), 19A (87 per cent), and four (three per cent). Children with a bacterial pathogen isolated were younger (mean age of 17 months) than children from whom no bacteria were isolated (mean age of 23 months; p = 0.03). Isolation of a pneumococcus was also significantly associated with younger age (mean = 16 months versus 22 months, p = 0.03), the presence of fever (OR = 2.15, p = 0.049), and having one or more prior episodes of otitis media within the six months before tympanocentesis (OR = 7.72, p = 0.03). Almost all pneumococci isolated from non-resolving acute otitis media in this community are antibiotic-resistant and should be considered especially in young children who have failed previous therapy and who have non-resolving pain or fever.
TI  - Lactoperoxidase and human airway host defense.
AB  - The lactoperoxidase (LPO) antibiotic system is a well-characterized component of  mammary and salivary gland secretions. Because LPO has been shown to function in ovine airways, human airway tissue and secretions were examined for the presence of LPO and its substrate, the anion thiocyanate (SCN-). In addition, human airway secretions were tested for LPO-mediated antibacterial activity, and LPO's activity was assessed against some human airway pathogens. The data showed that normal human airway secretions contained LPO enzyme activity (0.65 +/- 0.09 microg/mg secreted protein; n = 17), and Western blots of secretions demonstrated bands of the expected sizes for LPO. LPO mRNA was detected in trachea by sequencing PCR-amplified cDNA. SCN-, LPO's substrate, was present in undiluted airway secretions at concentrations sufficient for LPO catalysis (0.46 +/- 0.19 mM; n = 8), and diluted secretions contained antibacterial activity with LPO-like properties. Immunocytochemistry localized LPO to submucosal glands in human bronchi. Finally, as expected based on the known antibacterial spectrum of the LPO system, airway secretions showed LPO-dependent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, the airway LPO system was shown to be effective against Burkholderia cepacia and Haemophilus influenzae. Thus, a functional LPO system exists in human airways and may contribute to airway host defense against infection.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of panipenem against clinical isolates in 2000 and 2001].
AB  - As the post-marketing surveillance of panipenem/betamipron (Carbenin), MICs of panipenem (PAPM) against 1355 clinical isolates of 28 species from 15 medical institutions all over Japan from June 2000 to March 2001 were measured using the broth microdilution method approved by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and compared with those of parenteral carbapenem antibacterials, imipenem (IPM) and meropenem (MEPM), and parenteral cephem antibacterials, cefozopran, cefepime, and sulbactam/cefoperazone. The activity of PAPM was comparable to that of IPM against almost all species tested. Compared with MEPM, PAPM was more active against Gram-positive bacteria and Bacteroides spp., and less active against Gram-negative bacteria. Compared with the parenteral cephems, PAPM was more active against most of species tested and its MIC ranges were narrower than those of the cephems as were those of other carbapenems. In this surveillance study, the incidence of resistance in various species were as follows: 39.3% for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 47.3% for penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP), 15.1% for penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), 0.9% for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli, 3.4% for ESBL producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, 19.2% for beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae, 24.0% for beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) H. influenzae, and 1.0% for metallo-beta-lactamase producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against these resistant strains, carbapenems including PAPM showed generally more potent activity than cephems. It was noted that PAPM showed the most potent activity against PISP and PRSP, which showed high incidence of 62.4% totally, among tested drugs. Metallo-beta-lactamase producing P. aeruginosa exhibited high resistance and BLNAR H. influenzae also exhibited low susceptibility against all tested drugs. But no remarkable change in the activity of PAPM against other species was observed in this study compared with that in the studies before the marketing of Carbenin. Furthermore, it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant strains such as PRSP, metallo-beta-lactamase producing bacteria, and BLNAR H. influenzae.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of gatifloxacin against various fresh clinical isolates in 2002].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of gatifloxacin (GFLX) and other antibacterial drugs against various fresh clinical strains (800 isolates) isolated from specimens of patients in 2002 were compared. GFLX was more active than levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. For these isolates, clarithromycin and azithromycin were less active (MIC90; > 16- > 64 micrograms/mL), GFLX was more active than cefdinir. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter species, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, three quinolones including GFLX were potently active (MIC90; < or = 0.06-0.5 microgram/mL). Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from urinary tract infections were resistant to three quinolones including GFLX (MIC90; 32-64 micrograms/mL), however P. aeruginosa isolated from respiratory and otolaryngological infections were more susceptible (MIC90; 0.5-2 micrograms/mL). Quinolones were less active against Neisseria gonorrhoeae as compared with the cephem antibiotics tested, but GFLX was the most active against N. gonorrhoeae among the quinolones tested. In this study, we investigated activity of GFLX against fresh clinical strains isolated early in 2002, GFLX is widely and potently active against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae and various Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase productivity of recent clinical  isolates during the period between December 1999 and February 2000].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testings of 24 antimicrobial agents against 605 clinical strains belonging to 10 species were carried out according to the micro-broth dilution method of NCCLS M7-A4. The productivity of beta-lactamase was also determined against them isolated at 8 medical facilities in Nagano prefecture, Japan during the period between December 1999 and February 2000. When applied the nitrocefin method, beta-lactamase productivity was demonstrated to be positive for 89.2% of 74 S. aureus, 4.3% of 94 H. influenzae, and 100% of 69 M. (B.) catarrhalis isolates. On the other hand, when used the acidometry method, penicillinase/cephalosporinase were found to be positive for 21.2%/9.6% of 52 E. coli, 29.0%/3.2% of 31 K. pneumoniae, 53.2%/100% of 47 E. cloacae, 0%/11.1% of 99 S. marcescens, and 25.9%/55.6% of 54 P. aeruginosa isolates, respectively. Among the beta-lactamase-producers including P. aeruginosa isolates, only 2 E. coli isolates were found to be ESBL-producers. Besides, 9.6% (9/94) of H. influenzae isolates were proved to be BLNAR strains.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and prevalence of beta-lactamase producing clinical isolates in southern Kyushu. The results of collaborative study from 1999 to 2000].
AB  - The positivity of beta-lactamase and antimicrobial susceptibility were determined in a total of 1,358 clinical isolates at 15 hospitals and clinics in four prefectures in southern Kyushu (Okinawa, Miyazaki, Kagoshima and Kumamoto) during the period from December 1999 to February 2000. The isolates collected comprised of 176 strains of S. aureus, 203 of H. influenzae, 102 of M. catarrhalis, 206 of E. coli, 153 of K. pneumoniae, 99 of E. cloacae, 95 of S. marcescens, 201 of P. aeruginosa, 79 of E. faecalis, and 44 of E. faecium. The frequency of CPDX resistance among E. coli in particular varied geographically, and was found to be higher in Kumamoto and Kagoshima. The strains of K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae resistant to common antimicrobial agents were particularly found in Kagoshima, and one strain of IPM-resistant E. cloacae was isolated in Miyazaki. Also, the geographical difference in the frequency of LVFX resistance among the isolates of E. cloacae was noted, the results indicating the higher prevalence in Okinawa and Kagoshima. Resistant isolates of P. aeruginosa were less common in Kagoshima, and four isolates of P. aeruginosa from Miyazaki were found to be resistant to CAZ and IPM. None of the isolates of S. aureus and Enterococcus spp. was resistant to VCM or TEIC at all. The isolates of E. faecalis resistant at high-level GM (500 micrograms/ml) and SM (1,000 micrograms/ml) were found in 27.8% and 22.8%, and those of E. faecium were 6.8% and 38.6%, respectively. Overall, the ratio of MRSA among S. aureus was 67.6%, and three isolates were resistant to ABK with no less than 8 micrograms/ml of MIC. The frequency of BLNAR (beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin resistant) among H. influenzae isolated in Okinawa was markedly higher (isolation ratio, 37.9%) when compared with other prefectures, and the isolates of BLPACR (beta-lactamase-positive, AMPC/CVA resistant) were found only in Okinawa with a ratio of 41.6%. A total of 18 strains of ESBL defined by the NCCLS criteria (M100-S11) were isolated, eight strains of K. pneumoniae and 10 strains of E. coli. Of 18 isolates of ESBL, 13 were from Kagoshima and the remaining five were from Kumamoto.
TI  - [Drug sensitivity and beta-lactamase producibility of various types of bacteria clinically isolated during the period from December 1999 to February 2000].
AB  - beta-Lactamase activity and drug sensitivity were measured in 744 strains from 8  species of bacteria isolated at medical institutions in Chikugo District of Fukuoka Prefecture during the period from December 1999 to February 2000. Nitrocefin test revealed that beta-lactamase was positive in 48% of S. aureus, 7% of H. influenzae, and 92% of M. catarrhalis, and acidometry revealed that penicillinase/cephalosporinase were positive in 13%/14% of E. coli, 22%/8% of K. pneumoniae, 47%/97% of E. cloacae, 3%/65% of S. marcescens, and 10%/36% of P. aeruginosa. Based on the assessment of the MIC values of various types of antibacterial drugs for beta-lactamase-producing strains, there were 11 strains (1 strain of K. pneumonia, 6 strains of E. cloacae, and 4 strains of P. aeruginosa) of class-B beta-lactamase-producing bacteria out of a total of 496 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The results of PCR analysis suggested that 1 strain of K. pneumonia, 1 strain of E. cloacae, and 4 strains of P. aeruginosa produced metallo-beta-lactamase. There was no strain (E. coli and K. pneumoniae) of ESBL-producing bacteria. BLNAR strains, on the other hand, were found in 9% (9/100) of H. influenzae.
TI  - [Beta-lactamase activity and susceptibilities to antibiotics among some species of bacteria isolated from medical institution between December 1999 and February 2000].
AB  - We studied the beta-lactamase activity and susceptibilities to antibiotics in 604 strains among 10 species of bacteria isolated from 10 medical institutions in Tottori and Shimane Prefectures between December 1999 and February 2000. beta-Lactamase activity was measured by the nitrocefin test and penicillinase/cephalosporinase activities were measured by acidometry. beta-Lactamase activity was detected in 72.1% of S. aureus, 18.8% of H. influenzae, and 96.3% of M. catarrhalis. Penicillinase/cephalosporinase activities were detected in 17.8%/22.2% of E. coli, 9.7%/0.0% of K. pneumoniae, 18.6%/95.3% of E. cloacae, 12.7%/79.4% of S. marcescens, and 7.1%/31.8% of P. aeruginosa. Three of 72 strains (4.2%) of K. pneumoniae and 5 of 90 strains (5.6%) of E. coli were assessed as ESBL-producing bacteria using the NCCLS proposed screening method based on routine susceptibility testing results. BLNAR were detected in 13 of 69 strains (18.8%) of H. influenzae.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase types among clinical isolates during January and February 2000 in the Kinki area of Japan].
AB  - We studied antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase types among clinical isolates in the Kinki area of Japan. Eight hundreds isolates of eight organisms were collected by seven medical institutions during January and February 2000. The rates of beta-lactamase producing by using the chromogenic nitrocephin test were 68.0% against Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 6.0% against Haemophilus influenzae isolates, 98.0% against Moraxella catarrhalis isolates. The rate of beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae was 4.0% (4 out of 100). The result of beta-lactamase producing by using the acid-metric method were as follows the penicillinase and cephalosporinase: 27.0% and 37.0% against Escherichia coli isolates, 37.0% and 1.0% against Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 21.8% and 100% against Enterobacter cloacae isolates, 24.2% and 96.0% against Serratia marcescens isolates, 7.0% and 22.0% against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. We identified beta-lactamase type of each isolate detected by polymerase chain reaction: SHV-derived extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBLs) (1 isolate of E. coli and 1 isolate of K. pneumoniae), CTX-M-1-derived ESBLs (1 isolate of K. pneumoniae, 1 of E. cloacae and 4 of S. marcescens), and IMP-1-derived metallo beta-lactamases (2 isolates of S. marcescens).
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase producibility of bacteria clinically isolated during the period from December 1999 to February 2000].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase producibility were tested in 848  clinical strains collected at 8 hospitals in Kanagawa prefecture during the period from December 1999 to February 2000. Positive rates of beta-lactamase used the nitrocefin method (Cefinase) were 21.9% of Staphylococcus aureus, 10.0% of Haemophilus influenzae, and 99.0% of Moraxella catarrhalis. Furthermore, on the acidometric method (P/Case test) penicillinase (PCase), cephalosporinase (CEPase), and both of PCase and CEPase were found to be positive in 19.0%, 16.0%, and 16.0% for Escherichia coli, 6.2/0/3.1% for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0/66.3/26.5% for Enterobacter cloacae, 2.8/57.7/15.5% for Serratia marcescens, and 4.0/15.0/22.0% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. Based on the assessment of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antibacterial agents among beta-lactamase producing strains, there were 5 strains (4 strains of K. pneumoniae and 1 strain of E. coli) that may be ESBLs producing bacteria out of a total of 466 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. During this process, 1 strain of class-B beta-lactamase-producing E. cloacae was isolated. MRSA were found in 79.2% of S. aureus, and BLNAR were found in 8.9% of H. influenzae.
TI  - [beta-lactamase-producing activity and antimicrobial susceptibility of major pathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples. Japan beta-lactamase Research Group].
AB  - beta-Lactamase production and susceptibility to an assortment of antimicrobial agents were examined in 9,483 strains of organisms isolated from clinical materials obtained from inpatients and outpatients at 104 institutions throughout Japan from December 1999 to February 2000. The organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, 1,369 strains, including 847 methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains; Enterococcus faecalis, 735 strains; Enterococcus faecium, 302 strains; Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, 730 strains; Haemophilus influenzae, 1,142 strains; Escherichia coli, 1,276 strains; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1,058 strains; Enterobacter cloacae, 772 strains; Serratia marcescens, 847 strains; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1,252 strains. The 23 antimicrobial agents used were ampicillin, sulbactam/ampicillin, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin, oxacillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotiam, cefmetazole, cefoperazone, sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpodoxime, imipenem, gentamicin, arbekacin, clarithromycin, minocycline, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and levofloxacin. Antimicrobial agents appropriate for each organism were used. Among S. aureus strains, 61.9% were MRSA, and 62.3% were positive for beta-lactamase. Among the MRSA strains, none was resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin, and only 3% were resistant to arbekacin. There was no vancomycin resistance in the Enterococcus strains. Only 0.1% of E. faecalis strains were ampicillin-resistant. Among the M. catarrhalis strains, 97.5% produced beta-lactamase, while among the H. influenzae strains, 8.5% produced beta-lactamase and 14.5% were beta-lactamase-negative and ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR). Among the Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa strains, there were 20 (E. coli; 7/1,276, K. pneumoniae; 13/1,058) that produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), and 11 that produced class B beta-lactamases. Multiple drug resistance was advanced in every species, and organisms resistant to 7 or more common antimicrobial agents were isolated. The best combination of antimicrobial agent and beta-lactamase inhibitor was sulbactam/cefoperazone. Sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefepime, and imipenem still have excellent antimicrobial activity. Rates of resistance to each antimicrobial agent differed more among institutions than among geographical regions.

AB  
TI  - Biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine in bacteria.
AB  - Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the major membrane-forming phospholipid in eukaryotes and can be synthesized by either of two pathways, the methylation pathway or the CDP-choline pathway. Many prokaryotes lack PC, but it can be found in significant amounts in membranes of rather diverse bacteria and based on genomic data, we estimate that more than 10% of all bacteria possess PC. Enzymatic methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine via the methylation pathway was thought to be the only biosynthetic pathway to yield PC in bacteria. However, a choline-dependent pathway for PC biosynthesis has been discovered in Sinorhizobium meliloti. In this pathway, PC synthase, condenses choline directly with CDP-diacylglyceride to form PC in one step. A number of symbiotic (Rhizobium leguminosarum, Mesorhizobium loti) and pathogenic (Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Brucella melitensis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Borrelia burgdorferi and Legionella pneumophila) bacteria seem to possess the PC synthase pathway and we suggest that the respective eukaryotic host functions as the provider of choline for this pathway. Pathogens entering their hosts through epithelia (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae) require phosphocholine substitutions on their cell surface components that are biosynthetically also derived from choline supplied by the host. However, the incorporation of choline in these latter cases proceeds via choline phosphate and CDP-choline as intermediates. The occurrence of two intermediates in prokaryotes usually found as intermediates in the eukaryotic CDP-choline pathway for PC biosynthesis raises the question whether some bacteria might form PC via a CDP-choline pathway.
TI  - Acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  - The parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. The most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp.), Fusobacterium spp., and Peptostreptococcus spp. Streptococcus spp. (including S. pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including Escherichia coli) have also been reported. Gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. Organisms less frequently found are Arachnia, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and Eikenella corrodens. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. Therapy includes maintenance of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. Once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. The choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. Maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.
TI  - Development of novel antibacterial peptides that kill resistant isolates.
AB  - The rapid emergence of bacterial strains that are resistant to current antibiotics requires the development of novel types of antimicrobial compounds. Proline-rich cationic antibacterial peptides such as pyrrhocoricin kill responsive bacteria by binding to the 70 kDa heat shock protein DnaK and inhibiting protein folding. We designed and synthesized multiply protected dimeric analogs of pyrrhocoricin and optimized the in vitro antibacterial efficacy assays for peptide antibiotics. Pyrrhocoricin and the designed dimers killed beta-lactam, tetracycline- or aminoglycoside-resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis in the submicromolar or low micromolar concentration range. One of the peptides also killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The designed dimers showed improved stability in mammalian sera compared to the native analog. In a murine H. influenzae lung infection model, a single dose of a dimeric pyrrhocoricin analog reduced the bacteria in the bronchoalveolar lavage when delivered intranasally. The solid-phase synthesis was optimized for large-scale laboratory preparations.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2000)].
AB  - From October 2000 to September 2001, we collected the specimen from 410 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 16 institutions in Japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various anti-bacterial agents and antibiotics and patients' characteristics. Of 499 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 493 strains were investigated. The breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 78, Streptococcus pneumoniae 73, Haemophilus infiuenzae 99, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 64, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 14, Klebsiella pneumoniae 25, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 21, etc. Of 78 S. aureus strains, those with 4 micrograms/ml or more of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) occupied 53.8%. Vancomycin and arbekacin had the most potent activities against MRSA as observed in 1999. The frequency of S. pneumoniae exhibiting low sensitivity to penicillin (penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae: PISP + penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae: PRSP) was 38.4% being consistent with that in 1999 (34.7%). PRSP accounted for 11.0% of the total, being more than that in 1999 (3.0%). Carbapenems had strong activities against S. pneumoniae. Especially, panipenem inhibited the growth of all 73 strains at 0.125 microgram/ml. Generally, all drugs had strong activities against H. influenzae with MIC80s of 8 micrograms/ml or less. The drug that had the strongest activity against H. infiuenzae was levofloxacin, which inhibited the growth of 94 of the 99 strains at 0.063 microgram/ml. Tobramycin had a strong activity against P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) with MIC80 of 1 microgram/ml. The mucoid strain was little isolated (14 strains) but the susceptibilities to all drugs were better than the non-mucoid strain. K. pneumoniae showed good susceptibilities to all drugs except ampicillin and the MIC80S were 2 micrograms/ml or less. Particularly, cefpirome, cefozopran, and levofloxacin had strong bactericidal activities against K. pneumoniae with MIC80s of 0.125 microgram/ml, and cefotiam, second-generation cephems, also had a favorable activity being MIC80 of 0.25 microgram/ml. Also, all drugs generally had strong activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis. MIC80s of all drugs were 2 micrograms/ml or less. The drug having the strongest activity was imipenem and levofloxacin inhibiting all 21 strains at 0.063 microgram/ml. Most of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older, accounting for approximately a half of the total (44.4%). As for the incidence by the diseases, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest, being noted in 38.0% and 31.7% of all the patients, respectively. The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were S. aureus (18.3%) and S. pneumoniae (16.1%). In contrast, H. infiuenzae (20.4%) and P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid: 16.7%) were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. Before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from all the patients were S. pneumoniae (24.3%) and H. infiuenzae (26.7%). The frequency of isolated S. pneumoniae tended to decrease with the increase in the number of administration days while that of isolated H. infiuenzae did not. The frequency of isolated P. aeruginosa tended to increase with the duration of administration. The isolated bacteria were comparable between the patients already treated with penicillins and cephems. In the patients treated with aminoglycosides, macrolides, and quinolones, P. aeruginosa was most frequently isolated (33.3 to 40.0%).
TI  - Microbiological testing and outcome of patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: The study documents the impact of microbiological investigations on therapeutic decisions and outcome in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP). DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. SETTING: ICUs in two teaching Spanish hospitals. PATIENTS: Two hundred four consecutive patients admitted to intensive care with SCAP. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: One hundred six patients required intubation, while 98 other patients did not (81 of these patients were managed with noninvasive mechanical ventilation). The microbiologic diagnosis was established in 57.3% of patients. The most common pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Haemophilus influenzae. Pseudomonas (6.6.% vs 1.0%, p < 0.05) and Legionella (15.1% vs 7.1%, p < 0.05) were more frequently documented in intubated patients. Overall mortality was 23.5% (44.3% in intubated patients), with S pneumoniae (n = 7), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 7), and L pneumophila (n = 5) being the most common lethal pathogens. Bacteriological investigation led to changes in antibiotic prescription in 41.6% of patients, including 11 patients (5%) in whom initial treatment was ineffective against the microbial isolates. The most frequent reason for changes was simplification of therapy in 65 episodes (31.8%). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that microbiological testing is fully justified in patients with SCAP, because identifying the causative agent and adjusting treatment both impact on patient outcome. Our findings suggest that intubated patients should be empirically treated for Pseudomonas and Legionella while awaiting bacteriology results.
TI  - [Microbiology and cystic fibrosis].
AB  - The respiratory infections are the rule in sick persons of cystic fibrosis. After the colonization in one's early childhood by Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae, it is established the colonization produced by the mucous strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the principal etiogenic of this illness, that can become to isolate in more than 95% of sick persons at three years old. That's why the etiogenic factors of this bacterium are studied, as they are toxins, pigments, enzymes, and principally the alginate, hydrocarbonated polymer responsible of the mucous substance that covers these characteristic strains of cystic fibrosis sick persons. All these components are regulated by a complex genome, the biggest until noe sequenced in bacterium, and that explains the importance of the microorganism and its natural resistance or acquired to environmental alterations and to antibiotics and disinfectants. In the evolution of the clinic chart, it can appear others gramnegative bacteriums (among it emphasizes Burkholderia cepacia and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia), mycobacterium and even fungus; all that would explain the chronification of lung charts and the difficulty of these sick persons treatment.
TI  - Evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The newly developed Rapid Lumi Eiken/IS60 (RL/IS60) system automatically determines MICs by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. The present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. Sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with MICs determined by the reference microdilution method. When the MICs of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (QC) strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the RL/IS60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the QC limits proposed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The system was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, P. aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the RL/IS60 system and the reference microdilution method. Our results suggest that the RL/IS60 system provides rapid and reliable MICs of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as QC strains.
TI  - [Isolation frequency of Burkholderia cepacia from cystic fibrosis patients].
AB  - Microorganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae frequently cause colonization and infection in airways of patients with cystic fibrosis. Burkholderia cepacia has also been isolated in patients with cystic fibrosis since 1980. In this study, we aimed to determine the colonization rate of B. cepacia in 286 sputum samples obtained from 129 cystic fibrosis patients. Selective media for B. cepacia were used besides the routine microbiological media in order to increase the isolation rate. The colonies were identified by biochemical tests and the antibiotic susceptibilities of the strains were determined by disc diffusion method. Pathogenic bacteria (S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae) were isolated in 52 of 129 patients (40%) and 66 of 286 sputum samples (23%). In addition 2 B. cepacia strains were isolated from two different patients (1.55%). B. cepacia is now being considered as a pathogen isolated from sputum samples of patients with cystic fibrosis with an increasing frequency and causing severe clinical features. According to these results it can be concluded that, the use of selective media for B. cepacia isolation, should be taken into consideration especially by the clinical microbiology laboratories collaborating with the cystic fibrosis centers.
TI  - In vitro activity of ertapenem against common clinical isolates in relation to human pharmacokinetics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ertapenem against bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with moderate to severe complicated intra-abdominal, complicated skin/skin structure, acute pelvic, or complicated urinary tract infection or community acquired pneumonia was compared to ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and related to known plasma concentrations of the three agents. Ertapenem was more potent against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) than ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and was more potent and more active than both of these agents against Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes. Piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against enterococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (n=1088), Streptococcus pyogenes (n=37), Streptococcus agalactiae (n=48), MSSA (n=187), Haemophilus influenzae (n=59), and Moraxella catarrhalis (n=9) were susceptible to ertapenem; < 1% of 1284 anaerobes and only 1 of 113 Streptococcus pneumoniae (a penicillin-resistant isolate) were resistant to ertapenem. The MIC value at which 90% of all Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci, MSSA, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and anaerobes were inhibited (MIC90) was < or = 1 microg/ml and below the mean plasma concentration of total ertapenem following a 1 g intravenous infusion for at least 24 hours, i.e., the entire recommended dosing interval, and below the free drug concentration for at least 8 h.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute and chronic sphenoid sinusitis.
AB  - Aspirates of 16 acutely infected and 7 chronically infected sphenoid sinuses were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 29 isolates were recovered from the 16 cases of acute sphenoid sinusitis (1.8 per specimen): 22 aerobic and facultative (1.4 per specimen), and 7 anaerobic (0.4 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in 10 specimens (62%), anaerobes alone were isolated in 3 (19%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were recovered in 3 (19%). The predominant aerobic and facultative species were Staphylococcus aureus (9 isolates), Streptococcus spp (9), and Haemophilus influenzae (2). A total of 28 isolates were recovered from the 7 cases of chronic sphenoid sinusitis (4.0 per specimen): 11 aerobic and facultative (1.6 per specimen) and 17 anaerobic (2.4 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in I instance (14%), anaerobes alone in 3 instances (43%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes in 3 instances (43%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 1 each). The predominant anaerobes included Peptostreptococcus spp (4 isolates), Prevotella spp (5), and Fusobacterium spp (4). These findings illustrate the unique microbiology of acute and chronic sphenoid sinusitis.
TI  - Sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin B was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees C with five inocula of 14 bacteria. Two yeasts (Candida spp) and one Aspergillus were also tested. Contaminated media were then inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a Bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. Changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened daily by visual inspection. The sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. RESULTS: Organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria irrespective of the starting inoculums: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Haemophilus influenzae. For micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal only (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida kruzei, Aspergillus fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (SD 13.8, range 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
TI  - Bacteria classification using Cyranose 320 electronic nose.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An electronic nose (e-nose), the Cyrano Sciences' Cyranose 320, comprising an array of thirty-two polymer carbon black composite sensors has been used to identify six species of bacteria responsible for eye infections when present at a range of concentrations in saline solutions. Readings were taken from the headspace of the samples by manually introducing the portable e-nose system into a sterile glass containing a fixed volume of bacteria in suspension. Gathered data were a very complex mixture of different chemical compounds. METHOD: Linear Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method was able to classify four classes of bacteria out of six classes though in reality other two classes were not better evident from PCA analysis and we got 74% classification accuracy from PCA. An innovative data clustering approach was investigated for these bacteria data by combining the 3-dimensional scatter plot, Fuzzy C Means (FCM) and Self Organizing Map (SOM) network. Using these three data clustering algorithms simultaneously better 'classification' of six eye bacteria classes were represented. Then three supervised classifiers, namely Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Probabilistic Neural network (PNN) and Radial basis function network (RBF), were used to classify the six bacteria classes. RESULTS: A [6 x 1] SOM network gave 96% accuracy for bacteria classification which was best accuracy. A comparative evaluation of the classifiers was conducted for this application. The best results suggest that we are able to predict six classes of bacteria with up to 98% accuracy with the application of the RBF network. CONCLUSION: This type of bacteria data analysis and feature extraction is very difficult. But we can conclude that this combined use of three nonlinear methods can solve the feature extraction problem with very complex data and enhance the performance of Cyranose 320.
TI  - [Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance: VIRA Study].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Resistance to antimicrobial drugs has increased in recent years. The aim of this multicenter study was to determine the current situation in Spain regarding the resistance patterns of the most common infectious agents to antimicrobial drugs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total 1,475 strains isolated in 38 hospitals in October 2001 were studied. These included 294 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 149 clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), 96 Enterococcus faecium, 1 ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, 204 penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, 361 ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli, 160 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 110 Acinetobacter baumannii. Sensitivity to various antibiotics was studied by a broth microdilution method. Additionally, an epidemiologic survey was conducted in the participating hospitals to determine the incidence of these multi-drug resistant microorganisms. RESULTS: Overall incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli and MRSA strains was 24% in both cases. The pneumococci were resistant to several antibiotics. Telithromycin showed excellent activity against all the pneumococci, including those resistant to macrolides. Most MRSA isolates were resistant to quinolones and macrolides. All the staphylococci were susceptible to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Only 50% of A. baumannii strains were susceptible to imipenem. CONCLUSION: The results of this study evidence increasing multi-drug resistance among various microorganisms, such as MRSA, CNS, ampicillin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, and underline the need for surveillance programs to gain information on this significant therapeutic problem.
TI  - Cefditoren, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefditoren pivoxil, an oral third-generation cephalosporin, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in September 2001. It has been used in Japan for several years. The greatest therapeutic potential of cefditoren appears to be its activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms causing respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections, such as Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefditoren is also effective against methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Nevertheless, cefditoren has no activity against atypical pathogens, including Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella sp. Moreover, cefditoren does not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Bacteroides fragilis. In virtually all studies, cefditoren has compared favorably against other orally administered antibiotics used against the most commonly isolated respiratory tract pathogens. Its side effect profile includes diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and dyspepsia. Cefditoren is indicated for treatment of mild-to-moderate acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pharyngitis-tonsillitis, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by susceptible strains of organisms in adults and adolescents (> or = 12 yrs of age). Based on its reported antimicrobial activity, cefditoren has potential for empiric management of most commonly encountered respiratory tract infections. Additional studies will further define its role in clinical practice.
TI  - Terminal glycosylation in cystic fibrosis (CF): a review emphasizing the airway epithelial cell.
AB  - Altered terminal glycosylation, with increased fucosylation and decreased sialylation is a hallmark of the cystic fibrosis (CF) glycosylation phenotype. Oligosaccharides purified from the surface membrane glycoconjugates of CF airway epithelial cells have the Lewis x, selectin ligand in terminal positions. This review is focused on the investigations of the glycoconjugates of the CF airway epithelial cell surface. Two of the major bacterial pathogens in CF, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae, have binding proteins which recognize fucose in alpha-1,3 linkage and asialoglycoconjugates. Therefore, consideration has been given to the possibility that the altered terminal glycosylation of airway epithelial glycoproteins in CF contributes to both the chronic infection and the robust, but ineffective, inflammatory response in the CF lung. Since the glycosylation phenotype of CF airway epithelial cells have been modulated by the expression of wtCFTR, the hypotheses which have been proposed to relate altered function of CFTR to the regulation of the glycosyltransferases are discussed. Understanding the effects of mutant CFTR on glycosylation may provide further insight into the regulation of glycoconjugate processing as well as new approaches to the therapy of CF.
TI  - [In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of pazufloxacin mesilate, a new injectable quinolone].
AB  - We investigated the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of pazufloxacin mesilate (PZFX mesilate), a new injectable quinolone, and obtained the following results. 1) The MIC50 and MIC90 values of PZFX against clinically isolated Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, ranged from 0.0125 to 12.5 micrograms/ml and 0.025 to 100 micrograms/ml, respectively. PZFX showed broad spectrum activity. The antibacterial activities of PZFX against quinolone-susceptible, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, extended spectrum beta-lactamase possessing Klebsiella pneumoniae and imipenem/cilastatine (IPM/CS)-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa were superior to those of ceftazidime (CAZ), ceftriaxone, IPM/CS, meropenem and panipenem/betamipron. 2) PZFX showed superior bactericidal activity against S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa to those of CAZ and IPM/CS after treatment for 15 minutes at the drug concentration equivalent to that in human serum at clinical dose to be continued for 15 minutes. 3) CAZ and IPM/CS had no bactericidal activity at the 16 times of MIC against P. aeruginosa in human polymorphonuclear leucocytes, while PZFX exhibited potent bactericidal activity in a dose-dependent manner against such bacteria. 4) PZFX inhibited both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV from S. aureus at nearly the same level. PZFX showed poor inhibitory activity against topoisomerase II from human placenta and showed high selectivity to bacterial topoisomerase. 5) PZFX mesilate showed superior therapeutic activity to that of CAZ with following infection model caused by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa or each; systemic infection with cyclophosphamide-treated mice, systemic infection in mice with high challenge doses, CMC pouch infection in rat, and calculus infection in rat bladder. 6) Intravenous administration of PZFX with high plasma concentration just after administration, showed more excellent therapeutic effect against the rat intraperitoneal infection, than p.o. and s.c. administration.
TI  - Intravitreal penetration of cefepime after systemic administration to humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) into the vitreous after single-dose intravenous administration to human subjects. METHODS: Thirty phakic patients about to undergo vitreous surgery received 1 g (group 1, 15 patients) or 2 g cefepime (group 2, 15 patients) in a single intravenous injection before surgery. The indications for vitreous surgery were retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (24 patients), retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tear (4 patients), macular hole (1 patient) and intraocular foreign body (1 patient). Samples of vitreous and serum were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 h after injection. Three patients were used for each sampling time and for 1 g and 2 g of cefepime. Samples were assayed for cefepime concentrations with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: All the patients had detectable cefepime in their vitreous and serum measurable by HPLC. The level of cefepime in the vitreous peaked at 2 h and reached a minimum at 12 h after intravenous injection in both groups. A mean peak vitreous level of cefepime was 1.91 +/- 0.13 microg/ml in group 1 and 2.86 +/- 0.37 microg/ml in group 2. The level of cefepime in the vitreous at 12 h after injection was 0.89 +/- 0.14 microg/ml in group 1 and 0.97 +/- 0.30 microg/ml in group 2. CONCLUSION: The vitreous level of cefepime after intravenous injection was below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC(90)) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was over the MIC(90) against Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterobacter spp.

TI  - Relationship between bacterial colonisation and the frequency, character, and severity of COPD exacerbations.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are prone  to frequent exacerbations which are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Stable COPD patients often have lower airway bacterial colonisation which may be an important stimulus to airway inflammation and thereby modulate exacerbation frequency. METHODS: Twenty nine patients with COPD (21 men, 16 current smokers) of mean (SD) age 65.9 (7.84) years, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) 1.06 (0.41) l, FEV(1) % predicted 38.7 (15.2)%, FEV(1)/FVC 43.7 (14.1)%, inhaled steroid dosage 1.20 (0.66) mg/day completed daily diary cards for symptoms and peak flow over 18 months. Exacerbation frequency rates were determined from diary card data. Induced sputum was obtained from patients in the stable state, quantitative bacterial culture was performed, and cytokine levels were measured. RESULTS: Fifteen of the 29 patients (51.7%) were colonised by a possible pathogen: Haemophilus influenzae (53.3%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (33.3%), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (20%), Branhamella catarrhalis (20%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20%). The presence of lower airway bacterial colonisation in the stable state was related to exacerbation frequency (p=0.023). Patients colonised by H influenzae in the stable state reported more symptoms and increased sputum purulence at exacerbation than those not colonised. The median (IQR) symptom count at exacerbation in those colonised by H influenzae was 2.00 (2.00-2.65) compared with 2.00 (1.00-2.00) in those not colonised (p=0.03). The occurrence of increased sputum purulence at exacerbation per patient was 0.92 (0.56-1.00) in those colonised with H influenzae and 0.33 (0.00-0.60) in those not colonised (p=0.02). Sputum interleukin (IL)-8 levels correlated with the total bacterial count (rho=0.459, p=0.02). CONCLUSION: Lower airway bacterial colonisation in the stable state modulates the character and frequency of COPD exacerbations.
TI  - [Evaluation of the Rapid Lumi 'Eiken' using chemiluminescent assay for rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing].
AB  - One hundred ninety eight clinical isolates, including Enterobacteriaceae (70 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20 strains), Acinetobacter baumannii (10 strains), staphylococci (50 strains), enterococci (20 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 strains) and Haemophilus influenzae (13 strains) were tested for their antimicrobial susceptibilities by using the Rapid Lumi 'Eiken' (RL). As a reference method, broth microdilution method according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards was used. Then, each MIC obtained by both of these methods was compared. In order to improve the discrepancy between MICs obtained by both methods, modification of the RL method was studied. All MICs using the RL method were obtained with an incubation period of 4 hours. The essential agreement (to within one twofold dilution) between MICs obtained by both methods was 82%. The false susceptible in the RL method test results (very major error) and the false resistant in the RL tests (major error) were 0.9% and 2.3%, respectively. The agreement of interpretive category (that is, when the categories obtained by both methods are in perfect agreement) was 89%. Proteus spp. and A. baumannii showed low essential agreements, 59% and 46% respectively. The differences were resulted from the RL method's MICs being higher than the reference method. In order to improve the difference between both methods, the RL method's procedure was modified in the inoculum size (10(6) CFU/mL to 10(5) CFU/mL), the menadione concentration (5 mg/L to 25 mg/L) and the interpretive criteria for Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii. As the results of the modification, the essential agreement in Proteus spp. and A. baumannii increased to 82% and 81%, respectively, and there was no significant change in the other species of Enterobacteriaceae. In the case of the modified RL method to Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii, the essential agreement, the very major error, the major error and the agreement of interpretive category of all 198 strains were 87%, 1.4%, 1.5% and 90%, respectively. In conclusion, with only 4-hour incubation period, the RL method based on chemiluminescent assay gave reliable susceptibility testing among the most clinically important bacteria. Although several tests showed low essential agreement, it was possible to improve by use of the modified RL method. The Rapid Lumi 'Eiken' will provide useful information for choosing the most effective antibiotic for primary treatment to bacterial infections.
TI  - [Community-acquired pneumonia--from medical technologist].
AB  - The main causative microorganisms of Community-acquired pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Especially the causative microorganisms affecting whole body basic disease, persons of advanced age, and alcoholic patients are Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida spp., Cryptococcus spp., Aspergillus spp., Pneumocystis carinii and anaerobic bacteria. Other microorganisms involved in epidemic disease, action condition (travel around hot springs etc.) and pet breeding environments are Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pnumophila, Chlamydia spp., respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and adeno virus. We suggest methods of advancing the microscopic and microbiological examination and report, and quickly obtaining clinical information and extracting the clinical specimen. We also describe the inspection method for a case "Legionella pneumonia" that was discussed during this symposium.
TI  - New strains of bacteria and exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of bacterial pathogens in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is controversial. In older studies, the rates of isolation of bacterial pathogens from sputum were the same during acute exacerbations and during stable disease. However, these studies did not differentiate among strains within a bacterial species and therefore could not detect changes in strains over time. We hypothesized that the acquisition of a new strain of a pathogenic bacterial species is associated with exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study in which clinical information and sputum samples for culture were collected monthly and during exacerbations from 81 outpatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Molecular typing of sputum isolates of nonencapsulated Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was performed. RESULTS: Over a period of 56 months, the 81 patients made a total of 1975 clinic visits, 374 of which were made during exacerbations (mean, 2.1 per patient per year). On the basis of molecular typing, an exacerbation was diagnosed at 33.0 percent of the clinic visits that involved isolation of a new strain of a bacterial pathogen, as compared with 15.4 percent of visits at which no new strain was isolated (P<0.001; relative risk of an exacerbation, 2.15; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.83 to 2.53). Isolation of a new strain of H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, or S. pneumoniae was associated with a significantly increased risk of an exacerbation. CONCLUSIONS: The association between an exacerbation and the isolation of a new strain of a bacterial pathogen supports the causative role of bacteria in exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
TI  - Single-tube, nested PCR for the diagnosis of human brucellosis in Kuwait.
AB  - The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offers a sensitive and specific way of detecting microbial DNA in clinical samples. The aims of the present study were to develop an assay, based on a single-tube, nested PCR, for identifying Brucella in samples of human blood and then to explore the use of this test in diagnosis. The primers chosen were derived from IS711, the insertion sequence gene found in all species of Brucella. The assay amplified a 52-bp final product which was detected colorimetrically. The PCR was sensitive and specific, giving positive reactions with 14 strains of Brucella from five species. The lower limit of detection in vitro was 30 organisms. There were no false-positive reactions either with a range of bacteria known to evoke serological cross-reactions with Brucella (Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli K12) or with organisms producing similar clinical syndromes (Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Salmonella typhi). The results of a preliminary field trial of the assay in Kuwait indicate that the assay may be a valuable technique in the diagnosis of human brucellosis, meriting further study with larger numbers of cases. All 28 subjects with brucellosis (diagnosed on the basis of typical clinical features and confirmed by positive serology and, in three cases, by positive blood cultures) were PCR-positive whereas 28 healthy controls and 28 patients with febrile illness attributable to infections other than brucellosis were PCR-negative.
TI  - Influence on outcome of ventilator-associated pneumonia in multiple trauma patients with head trauma treated with selected digestive decontamination.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ventilator-associated pneumonia is said to be associated with an increased mortality or a prolonged intensive care unit stay. In multiple trauma, the use of selective digestive decontamination has been reported to decrease morbidity and mortality associated with pneumonia. We performed a study to evaluate the attributable morbidity and mortality of ventilator-associated pneumonia in multiple trauma patients with head trauma treated with selective digestive decontamination. DESIGN: Prospective, matched-paired, case-control study. SETTING: Intensive care unit at a tertiary university hospital. PATIENTS: During a 6-yr period, 324 consecutive multiple trauma patients with head trauma requiring mechanical ventilation for >48 hrs were prospectively followed for the development of VAP. Case-control matching criteria were as follows: 1) age difference within 5 yrs, 2) Glasgow coma scale within five categories, 3) injury severity score within 5 points, 4) APACHE II score within 5 points, 5) ventilation of control patients for at least as long as the cases. The selective digestive decontamination regimen was used in all patients (cases and controls): polymixin E, gentamicin, and amphotericin B. Systemic cefazolin (1 g three times a day) was given for the first 3 days of intensive care unit stay. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Analysis was performed on 58 pairs that were matched with 100% of success The most common isolates recovered were Staphylococcus aureus (39%) and Haemophilus influenzae (22%). High-risk pathogens were rarely isolated: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), Acinetobacter species (8.6%), and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (6.7%). The duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit stay were increased in case patients (11.6 +/- 1.7 and 22.7 +/- 2.9 days, respectively) compared with control patients (9.4 +/- 1.3 and 16.8 +/- 2.9 days, respectively; p <.0006). Mortality was similar in both case (17%) and control (24%) patients. CONCLUSION: Ventilator-associated pneumonia did not seem to increase mortality of multiple trauma patients with head trauma who received selective digestive decontamination. Whether or not this conclusion applied to trauma patients not receiving selective digestive decontamination should be evaluated in further studies.
TI  - Bacteriologic findings associated with chronic bacterial maxillary sinusitis in adults.
AB  - An open-label, multicenter study was performed to assess bacteriologic findings associated with chronic bacterial maxillary sinusitis in adults. Seventy aerobic (52.2%) and 64 anaerobic (47.8%) pathogens were recovered from clinically evaluable patients at baseline (before therapy). The most commonly isolated anaerobes were Prevotella species (31.1%), anaerobic streptococci (21.9%), and Fusobacterium species (15.6%). The aerobes most frequently recovered included Streptococcus species (21.4%), Haemophilus influenzae (15.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.7%), and Staphylococcus aureus and Moraxella catarrhalis (10.0% each). Recurrences of signs or symptoms of bacterial maxillary sinusitis associated with anaerobes were twice as frequent as were those associated with aerobes when counts of anaerobes were > or =10(3) cfu/mL. A pathogenic role for Granulicatella species in cases of chronic sinusitis was documented for the first time.
TI  - Regulation of riboflavin biosynthesis and transport genes in bacteria by transcriptional and translational attenuation.
AB  - The riboflavin biosynthesis in bacteria was analyzed using comparative analysis of genes, operons and regulatory elements. A model for regulation based on formation of alternative RNA structures involving the RFN elements is suggested. In Gram-positive bacteria including actinomycetes, Thermotoga, Thermus and Deinococcus, the riboflavin metabolism and transport genes are predicted to be regulated by transcriptional attenuation, whereas in most Gram-negative bacteria, the riboflavin biosynthesis genes seem to be regulated on the level of translation initiation. Several new candidate riboflavin transporters were identified (impX in Desulfitobacterium halfniense and Fusobacterium nucleatum; pnuX in several actinomycetes, including some Corynebacterium species and Strepto myces coelicolor; rfnT in Rhizobiaceae). Traces of a number of likely horizontal transfer events were found: the complete riboflavin operon with the upstream regulatory element was transferred to Haemophilus influenzae and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae from some Gram-positive bacterium; non-regulated riboflavin operon in Pyrococcus furiousus was likely transferred from Thermotoga; and the RFN element was inserted into the riboflavin operon of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from some other Pseudomonas species, where it had regulated the ribH2 gene.
TI  - Randomized, double-blind study of prulifloxacin versus ciprofloxacin in patients  with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently the role of bacteria in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) as well as antibiotic treatment with selected drugs, especially fluoroquinolones, have been better defined. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety in patients with AECB of prulifloxacin in comparison with ciprofloxacin. METHODS: AECB was defined according to the guidelines for the evaluation of new anti-infective drugs for the treatment of respiratory tract infections (1992). 235 patients took part in the trial; 117 (88 males and 29 females, mean age 64.8 years) received 600 mg prulifloxacin once daily and 118 (91 males and 27 females, mean age 64.5 years) 500 mg ciprofloxacin twice a day, for a duration of 10 days. The study design was randomized, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy. Efficacy evaluations were performed by comparing pretreatment and posttreatment assessments. The clinical response was determined by 4-point rating scores on cough, dyspnea, and expectoration (volume and appearance). The microbiological response was assessed on sputum specimen. RESULTS: Clinical success was observed in 84.7 and 85% of patients in the prulifloxacin and ciprofloxacin groups, respectively. The 95% confidence interval proved the equivalence of treatments. Both drugs successfully eradicated the most commonly isolated strains, including Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both treatments were well tolerated. Adverse drug reactions were always of mild or moderate intensity. CONCLUSION: The study showed that a 10-day course of prulifloxacin is as effective and safe as ciprofloxacin in the treatment of patients with AECB.
TI  - Expression and purification of aspartate beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase from infectious microorganisms.
AB  - l-Aspartate-beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ASA DH) lies at the first branch point in the aspartate metabolic pathway that leads to the formation of the amino acids lysine, isoleucine, methionine, and threonine in most plants, bacteria, and fungi. Since the aspartate pathway is not found in humans, but is necessary for bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, the enzymes in this pathway are potential targets for the development of new antibiotics. The asd gene that encodes for ASA DH has been obtained from several infectious organisms and ligated into a pET expression vector. ASA DHs from Haemophilus influenza, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio cholerae were expressed as soluble proteins in Escherichia coli, while ASA DH from Helicobacter pylori was obtained primarily as inclusion bodies. The V. cholerae genome contains two asd genes. Both enzymes have been expressed and purified, and each displays significant ASA DH activity. The purification of highly active ASA DH from each of these organisms has been achieved for the first time, in greater than 95% purity and high overall yield. Kinetic parameters have been determined for each purified enzyme, and the values have been compared to those of E. coli ASA DH.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems. Thirty-two species 2,697 strains of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), Escherichia coli (n = 250), Citrobacter freundii (n = 153), Citrobacter koseri (n = 97), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), Serratia marcescens (n = 153), Proteus mirabillis (n = 103), Proteus vulgaris (n = 77), Morganella morganii (n = 141), Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii; n = 154), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), Pseudomonas putida (n = 49), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), Acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), Acinetobactor Iwoffii (n = 30), Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola; n = 124). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lowffii throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in the antibacterial activity of CZOP against H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - Potency and antimicrobial spectrum update for piperacillin/tazobactam (2000): emphasis on its activity against resistant organism populations and generally untested species causing community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and several comparison broad-spectrum compounds was assessed against recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria from geographically diverse medical centers in Europe, North and Latin America participating in various surveillance programs in 2000. Several organisms were characterized for phenotypic expression of various resistant determinants such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or amp C cephalosporinase hyperproduction, and vancomycin resistance in enterococci (VRE). Piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity (MIC50) against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus spp. (0.12-0.5 microg/ml), Bacillus spp. (0.5 microg/ml), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (>4 microg/ml), and Corynebacterium spp. (2 microg/ml; not including C. jeikeium) with susceptibility rates of 100.0, 91.7, 85.7 and 81.8%, respectively. Piperacillin/tazobactam inhibited all Streptococcus spp. strains at < or = 16 microg/ml, including penicillin-resistant strains many of which were co-resistant to erythromycin (90%) and other beta-lactams. A specific breakpoint for these streptococci when testing piperacillin/tazobactam appears needed to prevent false-resistant reports using penicillin as a class representative. The carbapenems among beta-lactams were the most active agents against the ESBL-producing species of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and those strains which hyper-express amp C enzymes including Citrobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. Piperacillin/tazobactam only exhibited modest activity against the "amp C resistance group" strains (68.8% susceptible or intermediate, MIC < or = 64 microg/ml). Piperacillin/tazobactam (MIC50, 8 microg/ml; 79.5% susceptible) was the most active agent tested against multi-drug resistant isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against sampled Haemophilus influenzae (39.2% ampicillin-resistant), piperacillin/tazobactam (MIC(90,) < or = 0.06 microg/ml), ceftriaxone and ceftazidime inhibited 100.0% of the isolates at < or = 0.25 microg/ml. These in vitro surveillance results from the year 2000 on three continents, demonstrated a sustained potent activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against selected problematic nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. The potential importance of these findings is that this beta-lactamase inhibitor combination can be used an empiric treatment of serious infections in hospital environments where resistance has emerged, as well as covering nearly all isolates of fastidious respiratory tract pathogens acquired in the community setting.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of new generation of antibacterial antibiotics against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Antibiotic susceptibility of ten bacteria i.e. Neisseria catarrhalis, Salmonella  typhi, S. enteritidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas fluorescence, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli to twenty antibiotics i.e. cefpirom (30 mcg), ceftriaxone (30 mcg), erythromycin (15 mcg), doxycycline (30 mcg) lomefloxacin (10 mcg), sisomicin (30 mcg), vancomycin (30 mcg), augmentin (30 mcg), ampicillin (30 mcg), cotrimoxazole (25 mcg), cefotaxime (30 mcg), Chloramphenicol (30 mcg), cephalexin (30 mcg), tetracycline (30 mcg), ciprofloxacin (5 mcg), nitrofurantoin (300 mcg), nalidixic acid (30 mcg), pefloxacin (10 mcg), norfloxacin and ofloxacin (5 mcg) was studied to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of recently introduced second and third generation antibiotics. All the test strains were sensitive to pefloxacin, erythromycin, augmentin and chloramphenicol. Maximum resistance to cefpirom excluding E. coli and S. typhi and co-trimoxazole except S. typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed, occasional resistance was seen against ceftriaxone, vancomycin and cefotaxime.
TI  - Prevention of respiratory infections by povidone-iodine gargle.
AB  - Bacterial attachment to host cells is the initial step in the pathogenesis of infection. Our studies and those of others also showed that there is a significant correlation between the attachment of bacteria to human pharyngeal epithelial cells and the occurrence of respiratory tract infections. We identified the receptor on human pharyngeal epithelial cells which mediate binding of Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. In an attempt to prevent occurrence of infections, the effects of povidone-iodine gargling on the incidence of respiratory infections were investigated. The subjects included a total of 23 adult patients, both males and females, with chronic respiratory diseases showing repeated infections. Patients were asked to gargle more than 4 times/day with povidone-iodine gargle over extended periods of time, i.e. from several months up to over 2 years. The incidence of episodes of acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory infections decreased significantly when compared with that before use of povidone-iodine gargle. Episodes of infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) and H. influenzae were reduced by about 50%. Results of this study suggest that povidone-iodine gargle is effective in providing a significant reduction in the incidence of acute exacerbations of chronic respiratory disease. We assume that the colonized bacteria were destroyed and thus infection could not occur. Therefore, povidone-iodine gargle may be used in these patients as a preventive therapy. Further studies are needed to find out the mechanism of action of this drug for the prevention of respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute and chronic frontal sinusitis.
AB  - Aspirates of 15 acutely and 13 chronically infected frontal sinuses were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 20 isolates (1.3 per specimen) were recovered from the 15 cases of acute frontal sinusitis, 16 aerobic and facultative isolates (1.1 per specimen) and 4 anaerobic isolates (0.3 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in 13 specimens (87%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were recovered in 2 (13%). The predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were Haemophilus influenzae (6), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), and Moraxella catarrhalis (3). A total of 32 isolates were recovered from the 13 cases (2.5 per patient) of chronic frontal sinusitis, 12 aerobic and facultative isolates (0.9 per specimen) and 20 anaerobic isolates (1.5 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms only were recovered in 3 instances (23%), anaerobes only in 7 instances (54%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 3 instances (23%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were gram-negative bacilli (H influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The predominant anaerobes included Prevotella species (8), Peptostreptococcus species (6), and Fusobacterium species (4). These findings illustrate the microbiologic features of acute and chronic frontal sinusitis.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. Changes in CZOP susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), Escherichia coli (n = 276), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 93), Serratia marcescens (n = 172), Serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), Citrobacter freundii (n = 177), Citrobacter koseri (n = 70), Proteus mirabilis (n = 113), Proteus vulgaris (n = 89), Morganella morganii (n = 116), Providencia spp. (n = 41), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), Pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), Pseudomonas putida (n = 63), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), Acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and Prevotella/Porphyromonas (n = 173). An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, and S. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against M.(B.) catarrhalis, C. koseri, and P. aeruginosa was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, and P. mirabilis increased year by year. The increase in MIC90 of CZOP against E. aerogenes and P. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. In contract, the susceptibility of E. cloacae to CZOP was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to CZOP. MIC90 of CZOP against C. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. Additionally, MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. fluorescens, P. putida, B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, B. fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. Changes in MIC90 of CZOP against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.
TI  - [The study of the frequency and features of bacteria isolated in patients with non-tuberculosis respiratory disorders admitted in "M. Nasta" Institute in the first trimester 2001].
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the spectrum of bacteria isolated in patients with non-TB respiratory disorders, in order to find the frequency of germs isolated globally and in each of the 6 clinical syndromes: suppurations, chronic obstructive diseases exacerbations (COPD, bronchial asthma), pneumopathies, post-TB syndromes, tumors and interstitial lung diseases. We found the greatest global frequency in anaerobes (35%). This is in concordance with the high frequency of broncho-pulmonary suppurations (51% of the cases studied). In second place comes Ps. aeruginosa (18%), followed by Str. Pneumoniae (16%), H. influenzae (11%) and Klebsiella pn. (10%). Considering the germs identified in the various clinical syndromes, we found a high frequency of anaerobes associated to suppurations (51%), interstitial lung diseases (43%) and tumors (37%), while Ps. aeruginosa is first in post-TB syndromes (50%) and COPD exacerbations (21%), equal to H. influenzae. In pneumonias, Str. Pneumoniae was most frequently isolated (38%) followed by H. influenzae (25%). The susceptibility testing of strains of Klebsiella and Ps. aeruginosa revealed the increasing tendency to resistance to broad spectrum antibiotics, especially for Ps. aeruginosa, with consecutive difficulties in finding the appropriate treatment.
TI  - Pseudomonas pericarditis in an immunocompetent newborn: unusual presentation with review of the literature.
AB  - Acute purulent pericarditis is a rare entity in the neonatal age group. The most  common isolated organisms are Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other organisms, like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, have been seldom implicated with only one case of Pseudomonas pericarditis reported in the neonatal period. The prognosis is often considered very poor in this age group. This article describes Pseudomonas pericarditis in a 1-week-old immunocompetent female newborn who was successfully managed with combined medical and surgical therapy.
TI  - Lung infections associated with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - While originally characterized as a collection of related syndromes, cystic fibrosis (CF) is now recognized as a single disease whose diverse symptoms stem from the wide tissue distribution of the gene product that is defective in CF, the ion channel and regulator, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Defective CFTR protein impacts the function of the pancreas and alters the consistency of mucosal secretions. The latter of these effects probably plays an important role in the defective resistance of CF patients to many pathogens. As the modalities of CF research have changed over the decades from empirical histological studies to include biophysical measurements of CFTR function, the clinical management of this disease has similarly evolved to effectively address the ever-changing spectrum of CF-related infectious diseases. These factors have led to the successful management of many CF-related infections with the notable exception of chronic lung infection with the gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The virulence of P. aeruginosa stems from multiple bacterial attributes, including antibiotic resistance, the ability to utilize quorum-sensing signals to form biofilms, the destructive potential of a multitude of its microbial toxins, and the ability to acquire a mucoid phenotype, which renders this microbe resistant to both the innate and acquired immunologic defenses of the host.
TI  - Surgical treatment in bronchiectasis: analysis of 166 patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchiectasis is usually caused by pulmonary infections and bronchial obstruction. It is still a serious problem in developing countries as our country. We reviewed the morbidity and mortality rates and outcome of surgical treatment for bronchiectasis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1990 and 2000, 166 patients (92 female and 74 male patients) underwent pulmonary resection for bronchiectasis. The mean age was 34.1 years (range, 7-70 years). Mean duration of symptoms was 5.7 years. RESULTS: Symptoms were copious amount of purulent sputum in 135 patients, expectoration of foul-smelling sputum in 109, hemoptysis in 35 and cough in all patients. The indication for pulmonary resection was failure of medical therapy in 158 patients, massive hemoptysis in five and lung abscess in three. The disease was bilateral in six patients and mainly confined to the lower lobe in 127. One hundred and twenty patients had a lobectomy, 13 had a pneumonectomy, 21 had a segmentectomy and a combination of these approaches in 18. Operative morbidity and mortality were seen in 18 (10.5%) and in three (1.7%) patients, respectively. Follow-up was complete in 148 patients with a mean of 4.2 years. Overall, 111 patients were asymptomatic after surgical treatment, symptoms were improved in 31, and unchanged or worse in six. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of bronchiectasis is more effective in patient with localized disease. It is satisfactory with acceptable ratio of morbidity and mortality.
TI  - The genome of bacteriophage phiKZ of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Bacteriophage phiKZ is a giant virus that efficiently infects Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains pathogenic to human and, therefore, it is attractive for phage therapy. We present here the complete phiKZ genome sequence and a preliminary analysis of its genome structure. The 280,334 bp genome is a linear, circularly permutated and terminally redundant, A+T-rich double-stranded DNA molecule. The phiKZ DNA has no detectable sequence homology to other viruses and microorganisms, and it does not contain NotI, PstI, SacI, SmaI, XhoI, and XmaIII endonuclease restriction sites. The genome has 306 open reading frames (ORFs) varying in size from 50 to 2237 amino acid residues. According to the orientation of transcription, ORFs are apparently organized into clusters and most have a clockwise direction. The phiKZ genome also encodes six tRNAs specific for Met (AUG), Asn (AAC), Asp (GAC), Leu (TTA), Thr (ACA), and Pro (CCA). A putative promoter sequence containing a TATATTAC block was identified. Most potential stem-loop transcription terminators contain the tetranucleotide UUCG loops. Some genes may be assigned as phage-encoded RNA polymerase subunits. Only 59 phiKZ gene products exhibit similarity to proteins of known function from a diversity of organisms. Most of these conserved gene products, such as dihydrofolate reductase, ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase, thymidylate synthase, thymidylate kinase, and deoxycytidine triphosphate deaminase are involved in nucleotide metabolism. However, no virus-encoded DNA polymerase, DNA replication-associated proteins, or single-stranded DNA-binding protein were found based on amino acid homology, and they may therefore be strongly divergent from known homologous proteins. Fifteen phiKZ gene products show homology to proteins of pathogenic organisms, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria sp., Rickettsia prowazakeri, and Vibrio cholerae that must be considered before using this phage as a therapeutic agent. The phiKZ coat contains at least 40 polypeptides, and several proteins are cleaved during virus assembly in a way similar to phage T4. Eleven phiKZ-encoded polypeptides are related to proteins of other bacteriphages that infect a variety of hosts. Among these are four gene products that contain a putative intron-encoded endonuclease harboring the H-N-H motif common to many double-stranded DNA phages. These observations provide evidence that phages infecting diverse hosts have had access to a common genetic pool. However, limited homology on the DNA and protein levels indicates that bacteriophage phiKZ represents an evolutionary distinctive branch of the Myoviridae family.
TI  - Clinical, laboratory findings and microbiologic characterization of bronchiectasis in Thai patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to characterize the clinical features, underlying disease states, laboratory findings and microbiological characterization of bronchiectasis in Thai patients. METHODOLOGY: For a 2-year period all consecutive patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis at Phramongkutklao Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, were recruited. Data including history, physical examination, underlying disease and laboratory studies were carefully reviewed and recorded. RESULTS: Fifty patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis were enrolled. Their mean age was 58 years. The most common background aetiology was tuberculosis. Six per cent of the patients were diagnosed as having diffuse panbronchiolitis. Normal chest radiographs were found in 10%. The common organisms isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20%), Haemophilus influenzae (14%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (6%). Non-tuberculous mycobacteria which included Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium chelonae were found in 6%. CONCLUSION: We report the characteristics of bronchiectasis in Thai patients. The most common identifiable aetiology was tuberculosis.
TI  - Structural biology of bacterial iron uptake systems.
AB  - Numerous bacterial proteins are involved in microbial iron uptake and transport and considerable variation has been found in the uptake schemes used by different bacterial species. However, whether extracting iron from host proteins such as transferrin, lactoferrin or hemoglobin or importing low molecular weight iron-chelating compounds such as heme, citrate or siderophores, Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria typically employ a specific outer membrane receptor, a periplasmic binding protein and two inner membrane associated proteins: a transporter coupled with an ATP-hydrolyzing protein. Often, studies have shown that proteins with similar function but little amino acid sequence homology are structurally related. Elucidation of the structures of the Escherichia coli outer membrane siderophore transport proteins FepA and FhuA have provided the first insights into the conformational changes required for ligand transport through the bacterial outer membrane. The variations between the structures of the prototypical periplasmic ferric binding protein FbpA from Neisseria and Haemophilus influenzae and the unusual E coli periplasmic siderophore binding protein FhuD reveal that the different periplasmic ligand binding proteins exercise distinct mechanisms for ligand binding and release. The structure of the hemophore HasA from Serratia marcescens shows how heme may be extracted and utilized by the bacteria. Other biochemical evidence also shows that the proteins that provide energy for iron transport at the outer membrane, such as the TonB-ExbB-ExbD system, are structurally very similar across bacterial species. Likewise, the iron-sensitive gene regulatory protein Fur is found in most bacteria. To date, no structural information is available for Fur, but the structure for the related protein DxtR has been determined. Together, these three-dimensional structures complement our knowledge of iron transport systems from other pathogenic bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which has a number of homologous iron uptake proteins. More importantly, the current structures for iron transport proteins provide rational starting points for design of novel antimicrobial agents.
TI  - The characterization of bacterial isolates from acute otitis media in Ile-Ife, southwestern Nigeria.
AB  - The incidence of acute otitis media (AOM) in a comprehensive healthcare setting was investigated in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Out of the 617 children examined, 53 (11.64 per cent) suffered from the condition based on the criteria used. Staphylococci constituted the predominant organisms associated with the condition with Staphylococcus aureus (25.0 per cent) being the most frequent single microbe recovered from the subjects. This was followed by Proteus mirabilis (16.2 per cent), Staphylococcus sp. (8.8 per cent), Streptococcus pneumoniae (8.8 per cent), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae (7.4 per cent each). Most isolates tested were multiply resistant to the antibiotics commonly employed in treating infections caused by these organisms. The study highlights the prevalence of multi-resistant organisms amongst the subjects and recommends prompt therapeutic intervention to avert ineffectiveness of antibiotics when used in treating infections caused by these organisms in the community.
TI  - Infections in patients requiring ventilation in intensive care: application of a  new classification.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To classify infections according to the carrier state determined by surveillance cultures of throat and rectum, rather than by the traditional criterion of the time of onset after admission. METHODS: An observational cohort study of 3 months' duration was performed in a mixed medical---surgical intensive care unit (ICU) in a district general hospital of a subset of patients requiring mechanical ventilation for 3 days. Surveillance cultures from throat and rectum were obtained on admission to the ICU and then twice weekly to distinguish carriage of potentially pathogenic microorganisms (PPM) brought in by the patient from microorganisms acquired during the ICU stay. RESULTS: Out of the total population of 104 patients, 21 patients were enrolled over 3 months. Eight patients (38%) developed 12 infections, half of which were of primary endogenous pathogenesis and caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa carried by the patients on admission. The remaining six were of secondary endogenous pathogenesis and caused by Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa acquired in the unit. CONCLUSIONS: Traditional classifications of hospital infection are challenged. If the traditional 48-h cut-off point was used, then 9 of 12 cases (75%) of infection would have been classified as nosocomial, whereas using the method based on the carrier state, 50% of all infections were caused by microorganisms carried by the patient on admission to the ICU. Moreover, we believe that the distinction between primary endogenous, secondary endogenous and exogenous is valid because these three types of infection each require different control methods.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of DQ-113, a potent quinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of DQ-113, formerly D61-1113, was compared with those  of antibacterial agents currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited (MIC90s) of DQ-113 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.03, 0.008, 0.03, and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. Moreover, DQ-113 showed the most potent activity against ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, with a MIC90 of 0.25microg/ml. DQ-113 inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains, and Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.06 microg/ml, and DQ-113 was more active than the other quinolones tested against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium with MIC90s of 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively. Against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, DQ-113 showed the highest activity among the reference compounds, with a MIC range from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml. DQ-113 also showed a potent activity against Haemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains (MIC90, 0.015 microg/ml), and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.03 microg/ml). The activity of DQ-113 was roughly comparable to that of levofloxacin against all species of ENTEROBACTERIACEAE: The MICs of DQ-113 against ofloxacin-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa ranged from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml, which were four times higher than those of ciprofloxacin. From these results, DQ-113 showed the most potent activity against gram-positive pathogens among antibacterial agents tested.
TI  - [Current therapeutical management, new antibiotics and treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in bacterial ENT-infections].
AB  - In bacterial infections of the sinuses and the middle ear Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus are most frequently isolated, whereas in tonsillopharyngitis Streptococcus pyogenes is the most important pathogen. S. aureus is found in up to 40 % in acute and chronic sinusitis and causes severe complications in otitis media, therefore antibiotics used as empirical initial treatment should also be effective against this pathogen. To decrease duration of illness and to avoid serious complications antibiotic treatment of bacterial ENT-infections is necessary. The new ketolides and the third and fourth generation quinolones are very effective and the second generation cephalosporins like cefuroxime axetil have proven excellent clinical and bacteriological efficacy in numerous clinical trials combined with an excellent resistance pattern over the years. Efficacy of short course therapy (5 days) in sinusitis and tonsillopharyngitis has been proven in clinical trials and is cost saving. In more severe infections treated in hospital sequential i. v./oral therapy offers pharmaco-economical benefits. Both regimen demonstrate cost savings while maintaining high clinical efficacy. In more severe infections like otitis externa diffusa, otitis externa maligna, otitis media chronica and perichondritis Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a dangerous pathogen that has to be covered by initial antibiotic treatment. Ciprofloxacin and Ceftazidime are widely used and effective. Ciprofloxacin resistance has increased, while Ceftazidime susceptibility is unchanged (> 90 %). A dose reduction study with ceftazidime in severe ENT-infections showed equivocal efficacy between 3 x 1 g and 3 x 2 g daily that offers a cost benefit of 50 %.
TI  - [Tympanostomy tube otorrhea: microbiological epidemiology, pathogen susceptibility to local antibiotics and bactericidal power of the rifamycin-olfloxacin combination].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We studied the microbiological epidemiology of tympanostomy tube otorrhea, rifamycin and ofloxacin sensitivity of pathogens isolated from these otorrheas, and the bactericidal power of the rifamycine-ofloxacin combination. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted in 1997 with cultures of otorrhea aspirates, in vitro study of pathogen resistance to rifamycin and ofloxacin, bacteriocidal study of the rifamycin-ofloxacin combination. RESULTS: One hundred eight aspirates were obtained from 98 children (mean age 5 years). Ten aspirates were sterile, 32 had more than one pathogen. The more frequent pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) (n=35), Staphylococcus aureus (Sa) (n=27), Haemophilus influenae (Hi) (n=12) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) (n=9). All Hi, all Sp, 86.3% of the Sa (MIC(90) 0.25 mg/l) and none of the Pa were rifamycin sensitive. All Hi, 97.7% of the Pa (MIC(90) 0.5 mg/l), 73,1% of the Sa (MIC(90) 0.24 mg/l) and none of the Sp were ofloxacin sensitive. The rifamycin-ofloxacin combination led to a 4 log CFU/ml decrease in 6 hours for Sp, and in 24 hours for Pa, Hi and Sa. CONCLUSION: The rifamycin-ofloxacin combination is bactericidal for bacteria causing tympanostomy tube otorrhea. Otic drops with this combination should be considered as the first line treatment for such otorrhea.
TI  - Molecular analyses of the natural transformation machinery and identification of  pilus structures in the extremely thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus strain HB27.
AB  - Thermus thermophilus HB27, an extremely thermophilic bacterium, exhibits high competence for natural transformation. To identify genes of the natural transformation machinery of T. thermophilus HB27, we performed homology searches in the partially completed T. thermophilus genomic sequence for conserved competence genes. These analyses resulted in the detection of 28 open reading frames (ORFs) exhibiting significant similarities to known competence proteins of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Disruption of 15 selected potential competence genes led to the identification of 8 noncompetent mutants and one transformation-deficient mutant with a 100-fold reduced transformation frequency. One competence protein is similar to DprA of Haemophilus influenzae, seven are similar to type IV pilus proteins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PilM, PilN, PilO, PilQ, PilF, PilC, PilD), and another deduced protein (PilW) is similar to a protein of unknown function in Deinococcus radiodurans R1. Analysis of the piliation phenotype of T. thermophilus HB27 revealed the presence of single pilus structures on the surface of the wild-type cells, whereas the noncompetent pil mutants of Thermus, with the exception of the pilF mutant, were devoid of pilus structures. These results suggest that pili and natural transformation in T. thermophilus HB27 are functionally linked.
TI  - [A clinical study of bacterial infection in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of bacteriologic characteristics and bacterial infection in small airway disease. METHODS: Fiberoptic bronchoscopy and ultrathin fiberoptic bronchoscopy were performed on outpatients with COPD and chronic bronchitis both during stable stage and acute exacerbation. Samples were obtained from both large and small airways by protective specimen brush, and bacteria were cultured quantitatively. RESULTS: The positive rates for pathogens in patients with COPD and chronic bronchitis during acute exacerbation were 26.6% (8/30) and 23.5% (5/17) respectively. Major pathogens in acute COPD include Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All of the pathogens were present in large airways, with 2 strains present in small airways concurrently. The positive rates for pathogens in stable COPD and chronic bronchitis were 24.0% (6/24) and 11.7% (2/17) respectively. Major pathogens found in stable COPD include Staphylococcus epidermis, Micrococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The bacteria were less than 10 x 10(3) cfu/ml, present mainly in large airways. There was no significant difference in the extent of small airway diseases between COPD with bacterial infection and that without bacterial infection (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial infection is not a major pathogenic factor in stable COPD. There is no direct cause-and-effect relationship between bacterial infection and the extent of small airway diseases in patients with COPD.
TI  - Cefditoren pivoxil.
AB  - Cefditoren pivoxil is an orally absorbed prodrug that is rapidly hydrolysed by intestinal esterases to the microbiologically active cephalosporin cefditoren. Cefditoren has a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including common respiratory and skin pathogens. Cefditoren has shown excellent in vitro activity against the Gram-positive pathogens penicillin-susceptible and -intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Cefditoren was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Of the important Gram-negative pathogens, cefditoren had potent antibacterial effects against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefditoren does not have antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa or atypical respiratory pathogens and has only variable activity against anaerobes. In healthy volunteers, single doses of cefditoren pivoxil 200 and 400mg achieved maximal plasma concentrations of 2.6 to 3.1 mg/L and 3.8 to 4.6 mg/L, respectively. Cefditoren penetrates rapidly into bronchopulmonary and tonsillar tissue as well as inflammatory and noninflammatory blister fluid. In two, randomised, double-blind trials involving patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB), cefditoren 200 and 400mg twice daily for 10 days produced clinical cure rates of 88 to 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. Clinical cure rates in patients with AECB were similar to those of either clarithromycin 500mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily. In patients with streptococcal pharyngitis, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200mg twice daily produced clinical cure rates of 94% at 4 to 7 days after treatment, which were similar to those observed for phenoxymethylpenicillin potassium 250 mg four times daily. In uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200 or 400mg twice daily produced the same clinical cure rate of 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. These cefditoren pivoxil dosage regimens were as effective as a 10-day course of either cefadroxil 500 mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily in treating uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, including those caused by S. aureus and S. pyogenes. The most common adverse events associated with therapeutic doses of cefditoren pivoxil are diarrhoea, nausea, headache, abdominal pain and vaginal candidiasis.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of carbapenem antibiotics against respiratory pathogens isolated between 1999 and 2000.
AB  - We investigated the antibacterial activity of 12 antibiotics, inclusive of four carbapenems, against 167 strains of respiratory pathogens isolated between 1999 and 2000. Thirty strains of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 28 strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 11 strains of penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP), 29 strains of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), 30 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 14 strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, and 25 strains of Haemophilus influenzae were examined. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs)50/90 (microg/ml) of imipenem, panipenem, meropenem, and biapenem against the clinical isolates obtained between 1999 and 2000 were: 0.06/0.25, 0.12/0.25, 0.12/0.25, and 0.12/0.25, respectively, against MSSA; 16/32, 16/32, 16/32, and 8/32 against MRSA; < or = 0.015/0.06, < or = 0.015/0.03, 0.03/0.12, and < or = 0.015/0.06 against PSSP; 0.12/0.25, 0.03/0.06, 0.25/0.5, and 0.12/0.25 against PRSP; 1/8, 2/8, 0.5/2, and 2/16 against P. aeruginosa; 0.06/0.06, 0.03/0.06, < or = 0.015/0.06, and 0.06/0.12 against M. catarrhalis; and 1/4, 1/4, 0.12/0.25, and 2/4 against H. influenzae. A comparison of the antibacterial activity of the four carbapenems with that found in our previous studies showed no significant difference in the susceptibility of clinical isolates, except for a slight decrease in the susceptibility of MSSA. Carbapenems have remained effective for severe infections. The MIC data showed that imipenem and panipenem were more active than meropenem and biapenem against gram-positive bacteria, and that meropenem and biapenem were more active than imipenem and panipenem against gram-negative bacteria. As only meropenem had an MIC90 below the breakpoint of pneumonia against all species except MRSA, meropenem was considered to be the most potent of the four carbapenems studied.
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem and four other antibiotics against 554 clinical strains obtained from Beijing in 1999.
AB  - In 1999, a surveillance study was initiated in a hospital in Beijing to monitor the potency and spectrum of five extended-spectrum beta-lactam antimicrobial agents (meropenem, imipenem, cefepime, ceftazidime, and cefoperazone/sulbactam) tested against 554 strains of bacteria. Five groups of organisms were tested by the E-test method, with results validated by concurrent quality control strain analysis. Results were tabulated, and 100% of quality assurance tests (16/16 tests) were within ranges recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Of the five beta-lactam drugs tested, meropenem and imipenem were the most active against all isolates tested. Overall, the rank order of activity of the five agents was: meropenem (94.6% susceptible) > imipenem (90.1%) > cefepime (77.6%), cefoperazone/sulbactam (77.5%), ceftazidime (76.6%). Ninety-five percent of Enterobacter were to meropenem, while 82% were susceptible to imipenem. Meropenem was more active than imipenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of meropenem was eightfold lower than that of imipenem. Meropenem had excellent activity against Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial activities of cefpiramide and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against 440 clinical isolates in China.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefpiramide was compared with those of 15  other broad-spectrum cephalosporins. A total of 440 clinical strains of bacteria, including 9 bacterial species, were isolated from our hospital in 1998. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefpiramide and five other antibiotics were determined for each species, using the agar-dilution method. The MIC of cefpiramide for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae was higher than those of three other third-generation cephalosporins, (ie, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone). Fifty-one percent (26/51) of Enterobacter cloacae isolates were resistant to cefpiramide. Cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime had greater activity against E. cloacae (resistance, 3.9% and 19.6%, respectively) than cefpiramide. Cefpiramide was more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (resistance rates, 12%) than cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, and cefepime. Cefpiramide-resistant P. aeruginosa strains were resistant to ceftazidime, but 27% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were susceptible to cefpiramide; 15.3% of cefpiramide-resistant S. maltophilia strains were also susceptible to ceftazidime, but 50% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were still susceptible to cefpiramide. Cefoperazone/sulbactam was the most active agent against Acinetobacter baumannii, showing a resistance rate of 2%. Ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, and cefpiramide were the second most active agents, and about 50% of the tested strains were susceptible to these three antibiotics. Cefpiramide had an activity comparable to that of all tested beta-lactams against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 2 microg/ml). Against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, cefpiramide had good activity, with an MIC90 concentration at which 90% of the strain was inhibited of 1 microg/ml and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. These results indicated that cefpiramide was more active against glucose non-fermenting bacteria than against Enterobacteriaceae, and was very active against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylo-coccus aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. Thus, cefpiramide may be a good choice of drug for the treatment of patients with infections with glucose non-fermenting bacteria and community acquired infections.
TI  - Causative bacteria of respiratory tract infections in Kuwait by quantitative culture of sputum.
AB  - To determine the bacterial etiology of lower respiratory tract infections in Kuwait, we performed quantitative culture of sputum and measured the susceptibilities of the isolated bacteria against different antibiotics. A total of 140 sputum samples were collected for a period of 14 months for the study. Single and multiple pathogens as a cause of infection were isolated from 55 and 15 samples, respectively. A total of 53.8% of Streptococcus pneumoniae were penicillin-resistant and 52% and 57% of Hemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were beta-lactamase positive, respectively. We concluded that the major pathogens of respiratory tract infections in Kuwait were H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and there was an increased resistance among the isolated bacteria against commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of carbapenem antibiotics against respiratory pathogens isolated in recent years.
AB  - We investigated the antibacterial activity of 12 antibiotics, including 4 carbapenems, against 200 strains of respiratory pathogens isolated in 1997, and compared the results with those obtained in 1993. The strains examined were 38 strains of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 32 strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 22 strains of penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP), 10 strains of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), 53 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 19 strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, and 26 strains of Haemophilus influenzae. In 1993, 100 strains were examined. The minimal inhibitory concentration data of the present study showed that imipenem and panipenem were more active than the other agents against gram-positive bacteria, and that meropenem and biapenem were more active than the other agents against gram-negative bacteria. By comparing these results with those obtained in 1993, it was found that increase of resistance to carbapenem antibiotics was not observed against all the strains tested in this study. Thus, it can be stated that carbapenem antibiotics retain their position as the drug of first choice for severe infections.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and penetration rate into sputum of gatifloxacin, a novel 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, and its therapeutic efficacy in respiratory infections.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin against clinical isolates of  pathogenic bacteria was evaluated. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of gatifloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and rifampicin against 20 strains each of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18 strains of Enterobacter cloacae, 15 strains each of Streptococcus Pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis, 12 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 18 strains of Mycobacterium intracellulare, and 22 strains each of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium were determined. The minimum inhibitory concentrations90's of gatifloxacin against the above species were 0.12, 8, <==0.06, 0.5, 2, 2, <==0.06, 0.39, 0.05, 0.013, 2, 0.5, and 4 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. Gatifloxacin was four times as active as ofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and as active as ofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gatifloxacin was as active as tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae. The antimycobacterial activity of gatifloxacin was similar to that of sparfloxacin. Five patients with chronic respiratory infections and one patient with acute pneumonia received 100-400 mg/day of gatifloxacin orally for 5-12 days (mean, 8.17 days). The clinical effects were excellent in one patient and good in five. One strain of Haemophilus influenzae was eradicated and one strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa persisted after therapy. Adverse reactions were mild and improved after completion of therapy. In one patient with chronic bronchitis, the maximum sputum concentrations 2-4 h after oral administration of 150 mg of gatifloxacin on days 1 and 6 were 0.88 and 1.45 &mgr;g/ml, respectively, and in serum the values were 0.84 and 1.24 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. Thus it was found that gatifloxacin possesses potent activity against respiratory pathogens (including Mycobacteriaceae), and shows good penetration rate into sputum, and that it can be used as the drug of first choice in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Assessment of BMS284756 MIC and 5-microg disk diffusion quality control studies tested against seven American type culture collection strains.
AB  - BMS284756 is a novel des-fluoro(6)-quinolone with antimicrobial activity similar  to recently developed fluorinated quinolones. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the appropriate disk diffusion and MIC quality control (QC) ranges for BMS284756 when used against commonly tested QC strains (M23-A2). The BMS284756 5-microg disk content was tested against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Hemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. In addition, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and S. aureus ATCC 29213 were evaluated by the broth microdilution method. Seven laboratories tested 2 disk lots on 3 agar media or 3-4 broth lots over a 10 day period. A total of 420 zone diameter values and 210 or 280 MIC values per organism were generated. The following disk diffusion and MIC QC ranges were suggested for BMS284756 and the seven QC strains: E. coli ATCC 25922 (28-35 mm/0.004-0.016 microg/mL), E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (0.03-0.25 microg/mL), S. aureus ATCC 25923 (30-36 mm), S. aureus ATCC 29213 (0.004-0.016 microg/mL), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (19-25 mm/0.5-2 microg/mL), H. influenzae ATCC 49247 (33-41 mm/0.002-0.008 microg/mL), S. pneumoniae ATCC (26-33 mm/0.016-0.06 microg/mL). The proportion of participant results observed within the proposed ranges was 97.4-98.8% and 94.6-100% for the disk diffusion and MIC tests, respectively.
TI  - Ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  - Ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) 2 and 3. Ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with MIC90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus spp., Clostridium perfringens, Fusobacterium spp. Peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic Streptococcus spp. Ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short PAE of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the Gram-positive strains but no PAE against Gram-negative strains. In an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. In comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. The protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. Cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. Given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Acinetobacter spp. For pathogens with a MIC of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated T > MIC will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a MIC of 1 mg/l 31%. For anaerobic bacteria with MIC values between 1-2 mg/l, the T > MIC may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. However, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.
TI  - [Pathogenetic study on bronchopulmonary infections in 1,416 patients by transtracheal aspiration method].
AB  - We have performed transtracheal aspiration (TTA) in 1,416 patients, who were suspected to have bronchopulmonary infection, in order to collect non-contaminated specimens directly from the lower airway. The overall isolation rates in 1,416 TTA were 68.7% for any microorganisms. Aerobes had a high incidence but many kinds of microorganisms were associated with bronchopulmonary infections. Haemophilus influenzae was the major pathogen in patients with acute bronchitis. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most important pathogen and mycoplasma was often isolated in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Major pathogens of nosocomial pneumonia consisted of alpha-streptococcus spp., anaerobes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Anaerobes were isolated from transtracheal aspirates in 20 of 33 episodes of lung abscesses. H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa were the main persistent pathogens and H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and anaerobes were important exacerbated pathogens in patients with chronic lower respiratory tract infection. S. pneumoniae was isolated more from TTA than expectorated sputa. Oropharyngeal flora bacteria were easily isolated in the culture of expectorated sputa. We assessed the final diagnosis or causative factor in 443 patients whom no microorganism was isolated from transtracheal aspirates. The final diagnosis was infectious diseases in 52 patients (11.7%) and non-infectious diseases in 80 patients (18.1%), respectively. The causative factor was unsuited TTA sample in 81 patients (18.3%), preceding antimicrobial chemotherapy in 95 patients (21.4%) and unknown in 135 patients (30.5%), respectively. The pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary infections is complex and various microorganisms are associated with pathogens of bronchopulmonary infections. Therefore, we should accurately diagnose the pathogens in patients with bronchopulmonary infections. TTA is one of the useful methods that we can accurately detect the respiratory pathogens.
TI  - A study on community acquired pneumonia in adults requiring hospital admission in Penang.
AB  - A study was carried out to determine the pattern of microbiological organisms causing community acquired pneumonia in adult patients admitted to Penang Hospital between November 1999 and August 2000. Altogether, 98 patients (64 males, 34 females) with a mean age (+/- S.D.) of 55.9 (+/- 19.0) (range 15 to 87) years were included in the study. Causative organisms were identified in 42 patients (42.9%). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was the commonest pathogen being identified in 15.3% of cases, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.1%) and Staphylococcus aureus (5.1%). Streptococcus pneumoniae and Acinetobacter spp accounted for 3 cases each (3.1%) and Haemophilus influenzae, non-haemolytic Streptococcus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp and Pseudomonas spp for 1 case each (1.0%). Four patients (4.1%) had dual infections and no case of legionella pneumonia was found in this series.
TI  - [Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchial colonization/infection].
AB  - BACTERIAL FLORA IN THE SUBGLOTTAL AIRWAYS: In healthy non-smoking subjects, the subglottal airways are sterile. Inversely, bacteria are often isolated from the sublottal airways in patients with obstructive or non-obstructive chronic bronchitis, both during and between acute exacerbations. The significance of this bacterial colonization/infection, its natural history, and its impact on the course of chronic lung disease is poorly understood. BETWEEN EXACERBATIONS: 30 to 40% of all patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in a stable situation without recent antibiotic therapy harbor potential pathogens in their intra-thoracic airways. The prevalence of Gram-negative bacilli increases in the more severe forms. This estimation is possibly biased due to the involuntary inclusion of patients with bronchial dilatation, since bronchectasia involves a high prevalence of bronchial colonization/infection. DURING EXACERBATIONS: The prevalence of bronchial colonization/infection by potential pathogens is to the order of 30-50%, irrespective of the bacteria isolated from endobronchial samples made during or between exacerbations. About half of the exacerbations would not be related to bacterial infection, but to viral infection. The other identified causes of exacerbations are: occupational or accidental exposure, co-morbidity (chronic sinus infection, chronic pharyngeal discharge, left ventricular failure, non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity). INFLAMMATION: Inflammation of the bronchial mucosa is a constant feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The biological and histocytological features are distinctive from those observed in asthma. Polynuclear activation appears to play an important role in polynuclear infiltration of the mucosa, amplified during bacterial colonization.
TI  - Frequency of isolation and antimicrobial resistance of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria from patients in intensive care units of 25 European university hospitals participating in the European arm of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program 1997-1998.
AB  - A total of 3,981 isolates from patients treated at intensive care units were collected in 25 European university hospitals during 1997 and 1998 as part of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. Overall, the most important species isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. Thirty-nine percent of all Staphylococcus aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. All Staphylococcus aureus isolates were fully susceptible to linezolid and vancomycin. Moreover, all CNS isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and minocycline. All Enterococcus faecalis isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, and 99% of these isolates were also susceptible to ampicillin. The antimicrobial agents most effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, and cefepime, with 87, 85, 84, and 83% of isolates being susceptible, respectively. Escherichia coli isolates were fully susceptible to carbapenems, and at least 99% of these isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefepime, and amikacin. The Enterobacter spp. were also highly susceptible to carbapenems, amikacin, and cefepime, with 99, 97, and 96% of isolates being susceptible, respectively. Haemophilus influenzae was susceptible to most of the antibiotics tested. Only 68% of the pneumococcal isolates were fully susceptible to penicillin, yet 100% were susceptible to a number of fluoroquinolones and vancomycin. There are still sufficient treatment options for patients infected with the most important bacterial species involved in infections in intensive care units. However, the situation for patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections is critical.
TI  - P-113D, an antimicrobial peptide active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, retains activity in the presence of sputum from cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are a source of novel agents that could be useful for treatment of the chronic lung infections that afflict cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Efficacy depends on antimicrobial activity against the major pathogens of CF patients, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae, in the environment of the CF patient's airway. We describe the in vitro efficacies of derivatives of histatins, which are histidine-rich peptides produced by the salivary glands of humans and higher primates. P-113, a peptide containing 12 of the 24 amino acid residues of the parent molecule, histatin 5, retained full antibacterial activity and had a good spectrum of activity in vitro against the prominent pathogens of CF patients. However, P-113 was not active in the presence of purulent sputum from CF patients. In contrast, P-113D, the mirror-image peptide with the amino acid residues in the D configuration, was stable in sputum, was as active as P-113 against pathogens of CF patients in the absence of sputum and retained significant activity in the presence of sputum from CF patients. Recombinant human DNase, which effectively liquefies sputum, enhanced the activity of P-113D in undiluted sputum against both exogenous (added) bacteria and endogenous bacteria. Because of its properties, P-113D shows potential as an inhalant in chronic suppressive therapy for CF patients.
TI  - Influence of macrolide antibiotics on promotion of resistance in the oral flora of children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The long elimination half-life of azithromycin allows subinhibitory serum and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) concentrations over a period of several weeks post treatment, which may have an impact on the emergence of macrolide resistance. In this prospective, open-label, randomized study, four macrolides and the azalide azithromycin were studied for their likelihood to promote resistance in the oral flora of children with respiratory tract infections. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children were randomly assigned to receive azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin and josamycin. Throat swabs were obtained prior to treatment and weekly for 6 weeks. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for resistant strains were assessed by E-test and National Committee for Clinical laboratory Standards (NCClS) broth microdilution. RESULTS: One week post treatment, up to 90% of children harbored macrolide-resistant strains in their oral flora. Except for azithromycin, the percentage of patients colonized by resistant organisms decreased to a rate of 17% for clarithromycin (10/60), erythromycin (2/12) and josamycin (2/12) and 33% for roxithromycin (4/12) after 6 weeks. In the azithromycin group, 85% (51/60) of patients were colonized by macrolide-resistant organisms after 6 weeks, 11.6% (7/60) of children suffered from reinfection. CONCLUSION: Azithromycin therapy appears to put selective pressure on the infective and native flora of children, promoting the carriage of macrolide-resistant strains.
TI  - Cefditoren in vitro activity and spectrum: a review of international studies using reference methods.
AB  - Cefditoren, a broad-spectrum orally administered cephalosporin ester, has documented in vitro efficacy against many Gram-positive and -negative pathogens and stability against clinically important beta-lactamases. We have reviewed the microbiology and the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic literature regarding the spectrum and potency of this newer agent against the major etiologic agents of community-acquired respiratory infection, (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis), as well as the Enterobacteriaceae and non-enteric Gram-negative bacilli, staphylococci, and other aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci. The level of cefditoren activity against S. pneumoniae (MIC(90,) 0.5 microg/mL) was superior to all marketed oral cephalosporins and at least equal to amoxicillin +/- clavulanate. H. influenzae (MIC(90,) 0.016-0.03 microg/mL) and M. catarrhalis (MIC(90,) 0.06-0.5 microg/mL) were also very susceptible to cefditoren. In contrast to cefixime and ceftibuten, cefditoren was active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC(90,) < or = 1 microg/mL) at a level comparable to cefuroxime axetil, cefaclor or cefprozil. Enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and most anaerobes (Gram-negative) were not cefditoren-susceptible, but most Enterobacteriaceae, beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci were highly susceptible. Furthermore, an overview of key in vitro susceptibility testing methods and issues including disk diffusion testing and Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) method accuracy, interpretive criteria, and pharmacodynamic considerations for the selection of a breakpoint concentration are provided. The rapid bactericidal nature of the antibacterial activity of cefditoren, its post antibiotic effect, penicillin binding protein targets, and extent of beta-lactamase stability are all favorable qualities. In conclusion, this orally administered (BID) beta-lactam possesses promise for use against commonly isolated problematic respiratory tract pathogens such as penicillin-non-susceptible pneumococci and beta-lactamase-positive M. catarrhalis or H. influenzae. Success in the clinical trials will further define the role of cefditoren in this era of emerging resistant bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Pathogens in the middle ear effusion of children with persistent otitis media: implications of drug resistance and complications.
AB  - Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common disease for which pediatricians prescribe antimicrobial agents. Middle ear fluid were collected from 243 children with AOM that failed to respond to a previous course of antimicrobial therapy and who had then received myringotomy from September 1997 through August 1999. Bacterial cultures were done and antimicrobial susceptibilities were analyzed. Streptococcus pneumoniae (21.8%) was the most common causative organism, followed by Haemophilus influenzae (10.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (7%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.8%), while Moraxella catarrhalis (0.7%) and group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (0.2%) were rarely isolated. In patients whose condition failed to improve after a course of antibiotic treatment, drug resistance became a serious problem. Fourteen percent of the patients in this series had complications, which included recurrent AOM, persistent middle ear effusion necessitating ventilation tube insertion, hearing impairment, mastoiditis, meningitis, chronic otitis media, brain abscess, and sepsis. Possible risk factors such as young age, male sex, underlying diseases, and a culture of S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae were not significantly associated with an increased incidence of complications. More stringent diagnosis and the correct choice of antibiotic treatment combined with the introduction of potential virus and bacterial vaccines are promising ways to reduce the morbidity of AOM in children.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of ertapenem (MK-0826), a long-acting carbapenem, tested against selected resistant strains.
AB  - Ertapenem (MK-0826) is a novel, long-acting parenteral carbapenem. The purpose of this in vitro study was to test ertapenem's activity against a collection of multiply-resistant strains of gram-positive and -negative bacteria isolated from locations worldwide, and to examine its bactericidal activity and ability to act in a synergistic manner in combination with other antimicrobial agents. Ertapenem was active against a variety of gram-negative pathogens, with particular potency noted for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC90s < or =0.015-0.5 microg/mL) including extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. Less ertapenem activity was seen against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, especially ceftazidime-resistant strains (MIC50 16 microg/mL). Except for enterococci, ertapenem was active against most gram-positive species, including beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC90 0.03 microg/mL; 100% susceptible), viridans group streptococci (MIC90 2 microg/mL; 98.1% susceptible), and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 < or =0.015 microg/mL; 100% susceptible). Ertapenem was also very potent against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 0.25 microg/mL; 100% susceptible). Bactericidal action was observed versus staphylococci, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae, and at least an additive effect was detected against the majority of the strains tested when ertapenem was combined with ciprofloxacin or gentamicin. These results from testing 902 organisms indicate that ertapenem appears to be a promising broad-spectrum carbapenem with a possible role against some emerging resistant species.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a gene encoding an immunosuppressive factor from  Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is a pathogen of localized juvenile periodontitis and adult periodontitis. Immunomodulating activity is generally thought to be important in colonization by such pathogenic bacteria. Among the proteins possessing these activities, a 14 kDa immunosuppressive factor of A. actinomycetemcomitans has been reported by Kurita-Ochiai and Ochiai (Infect Immun 64: 50-54, 1996). To evaluate this factor, we cloned and characterized the gene encoding it. The immunosuppressive factor was screened from a genomic library of A. actinomycetemcomitans using an oligonucleotide probe based on the amino acid sequence of the factor. The clone obtained, pHI13, contained a 1.5 kbp fragment. The immunosuppressive factor located in its center. Southern blot analysis showed that this factor is common among A. actinomycetemcomitans strains. The open reading frame consisted of 324 bp coding for 107 amino acid residues. The relative molecular mass of the deduced amino acid sequence was calculated to be 11,595. BLAST analysis indicated that the amino acid sequence is highly homologous with those of thioredoxins from Haemophilus influenzae (76.6%), Neisseria meningitidis (67.3%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (59.3%). These results suggest that the 14 kDa immunosuppressive factor characterized in this study is a thioredoxin.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1999)].
AB  - From October 1999 to September 2000, we collected the specimen from 430 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 17 institutions in Japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics and patients' characteristics. Of 515 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 506 strains were investigated. The breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 78, Streptococcus pneumoniae 101, Haemophilus influenzae 104, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 58, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 11, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 41, Klebsiella pneumoniae 18, etc. Of 78 S. aureus strains, those with 4 micrograms/ml or above of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) occupied 57.7%. Vancomycin and arbekacin showed the most potent activities against MRSA without detection of ABK-resistant strain (MIC: 64 micrograms/ml) and decrease of VCM-sensitive strains those were found in 1998. The frequency of S. pneumoniae exhibiting low sensitivity to penicillin (penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae: PISP + penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae: PRSP) decreased to 34.7% from 46.0% in 1998. The frequency of PRSP was 3.0%, being the least number after 1991. Carbapenems showed strong activities against S. pneumoniae. Especially, panipenem inhibited the growth of all 101 strains with MIC of 0.063 microgram/ml. Generally, all drugs showed strong activities against H. influenzae with MIC80s of 4 micrograms/ml or below. MICs of ofloxacin ranged between 0.063 microgram/ml and 4 micrograms/ml in 1998, however, those were 0.125 microgram/ml or below in all H. influenzae in 1999 showing the strongest activity. Tobramycin and ciprofloxacin showed strong activities against P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) with MIC80s of 1 microgram/ml. Number of isolated P. aeruginosa (mucoid) was little as 11, however, the susceptibilities to all drugs were better than P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid). K. pneumoniae showed good susceptibilities to all drugs except for ampicillin with decreasing of low-sensitive strains compared to those detected in 1998. Also, all drugs generally showed strong activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis. MIC80s of all drugs were 2 micrograms/ml or below. The drug which showed the strongest activity was imipenem inhibiting all 41 strains with MIC of 0.063 microgram/ml. On the patients' characteristics, the number of patients aged 80 years or older who had been increased was decreased in 1999 in the distribution by age. The percentage of the elderly patients aged 70 years or older was 47.0%, which occupied almost a half number of the total patients as in the last year. As for the incidence by disease, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest. They were noted in 37.9% and 30.5% of the patients, respectively. In 1999, bronchial asthma was frequently observed as compared in recent years. It was noted in about 10% of the patients which is the same % as in bronchiectasis. We examined the number of strains from these patients with infections before and after administration of antibiotics. In patients with bacterial pneumonia, the number of isolated strains was almost the same between those before and after administration. However, in patients with chronic bronchitis, the number of strains remarkably decreased to less than the half of the total after administration of antibiotics in the last year, but it decreased to 2/3 of the total in 1999. On the administration of antibiotics and isolated bacteria by the day of administration, the bacteria which were isolated more before administration were H. influenzae in 28.4%, S. pneumoniae in 25.7%, M. (B.) catarrhalis in 12.0% and S. aureus in 10.6%. The frequency of S. aureus after administration over 15 days was almost the same as that before administration, but the frequency of P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) was 36.8% which was higher than that before administration. The frequency of isolated S. pneumoniae was decreased after administration and none of them was isolated after completion of administration. However, that of H. influenzae was decreased to 7.1% after administration within 3 days, and many H. influenzae were isolated after completion of administration as 21.4%.
TI  - Community-acquired pneumonia in patients requiring hospitalization.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the microbial aetiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in patients requiring hospitalization. METHODOLOGY: A prospective study of consecutive non-immunocompromised patients aged 12 years and above admitted with CAP from August 1997 to May 1999 was undertaken. RESULTS: Of 127 patients hospitalized for CAP, an aetiological diagnosis was achieved in 53 cases (41.7%). Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated pathogen and caused 10.2% of all the cases, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.5%), Haemophilus influenzae (5.5%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (3.9%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.9%). Gram-negative bacilli were significantly more frequently identified in patients aged 60 years or older and in patients with comorbid illnesses. Twelve of 13 patients who died from CAP had other comorbid illnesses compared to 63 of 114 patients who survived (P = 0.014). Three of eight bacteraemic patients died compared with 10 of 119 non-bacteraemic patients (P = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: The microbiology of CAP in patients requiring hospitalization in Malaysia appears to be different from that in Western countries. Gram-negative bacilli were more frequently isolated in older patients and in those with comorbidity. Mortality from CAP is more likely in patients with comorbidity and in those who are bacteraemic.
TI  - Comparison of the methylene blue and toluidine blue photobactericidal efficacy against gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Studies on the photobactericidal efficacy of methylene  blue (MB) and toluidine blue (TB) have shown inconsistent results in the literature. This study evaluated the bactericidal efficacy of MB and TB against different bacteria under light and dark conditions to determine the most effective bactericidal dye. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in saline were treated in dark and red laser light conditions in the presence of each dye using an argon pumped-dye and a diode laser emitting light at 630 and 664 nm, respectively. The effect of dye concentration, dark incubation time, the fluence and intensity of laser light on the destruction of different bacteria were compared. RESULTS: Both dyes eradicated all examined bacteria under laser light. The complete photodestruction of microorganisms was reached at TB concentrations of 1.5-7-fold less than that of MB. CONCLUSION: TB exhibits a greater bactericidal activity than MB against most bacteria in dark and light conditions. Mostly, these results are consistent with their respective dye partition coefficients.
TI  - Regulation of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in gamma-proteobacteria.
AB  - Computational comparative techniques were applied to analysis of the aromatic amino acid regulons in gamma-proteobacteria. This resulted in characterization of the TrpR and TyrR regulons in the genomes of Yersinia pestis, Haemophilus influenzae, Vibrio cholerae and other bacteria and identification of new members of the PhhR regulon in the genome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Candidate attenuators were constructed for all studied genomes, including the trpBA operon of the very distantly related bacterium Chlamidia trachomatis. The pheA attenuator of Y. pestis is an integration site for the insertion element IS-200. It was shown that the triplication of the DAHP-synthase genes occurred prior to the divergence of families Enterobacteriaceae, Vibrionaceae and Alteromonadaceae. The candidate allosteric control site of the DAHP-syntheases was identified. This site is deteriorated in AroH of Buchnera sp. APS. The known DAHP-synthase of Bordetella pertussis is likely to be feedback-inhibited by phenylalanine, and the DAHP-synthase of Corynebacterium glutamicum could be inhibited by tyrosine. Overall, the most extensive regulation was observed in Escherichia coli, whereas the regulation in other genomes seems to be less developed. At the extreme, the tryptophan production in the aphid endosymbiont Buchnera sp. APS is free from transcriptional, attenuation, and allosteric control.
TI  - Factors associated with poor pulmonary function: cross-sectional analysis of data from the ERCF. European Epidemiologic Registry of Cystic Fibrosis.
AB  - The European Epidemiologic Registry of Cystic Fibrosis began collecting longitudinal data on European cystic fibrosis patients in 1994. A cross-sectional analysis was performed to identify the factors associated with low values of % predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) upon patient enrollment. Data from 7,010 patients aged > or =6 yrs were included. Clinical conditions, microbiological isolates and medications reported at enrollment or within the following 180 days were analysed for age-specific associations. Factors associated with FEV1 that were lower by >10% of pred values were: lower weight for age percentiles, haemoptysis, pneumothorax, pulmonary symptoms at presentation, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, oral corticosteroids, nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs, dornase alfa, oxygen and assisted ventilation and, in patients >12 yrs old only, use of airway clearance techniques, inhaled bronchodilators, oral nutritional supplements, pancreatic enzymes and insulin or oral hypoglycaemics. Slightly impaired lung function (5-10%) was associated with: diabetes (> or = 18-yrs-old), gastro-oesophageal reflux, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, asthma-like symptoms, portal hypertension, Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp. Sex, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus were not associated with impaired pulmonary status. Regular exercise (especially in older patients) and nasal polyposis were associated with slightly better FEV1. The results confirm those of previous studies and suggest selective prescribing in sicker patients.
TI  - Regulation of matrilysin expression in airway epithelial cells by Pseudomonas aeruginosa flagellin.
AB  - Matrilysin (matrix metalloproteinase-7) is expressed by mucosal epithelia throughout the body and functions in host defense by activating murine intestinal alpha-defensins. In normal adult human lung, matrilysin is expressed at low levels in the airway epithelium, but is markedly up-regulated in cystic fibrosis (CF). Because CF lungs support a heavy bacterial load, we assessed if relevant CF pathogens regulate matrilysin expression in human lung epithelial cells. Indeed, acute infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (but not Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, or Klebsiella pneumoniae) induced the expression of matrilysin in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells. Increased matrilysin mRNA levels were detectable at 3 h post-infection and peaked at a 25-fold induction between 6 and 8 h. Both P. aeruginosa CF isolates and laboratory strains induced matrilysin expression to similar levels. Flagellin, the monomeric precursor of bacterial flagella, was identified as the inductive factor released by P. aeruginosa that regulated matrilysin expression. In addition, flagellin-null mutants failed to stimulate matrilysin expression in cultured cells or in lungs infected in vivo. These data show that P. aeruginosa (and specifically flagellin) potently stimulates matrilysin expression in lung epithelial cells and may mediate the overexpression of this proteinase in CF lungs.
TI  - Multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents for the ten most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Amikacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance to ss-lactam antibiotics. Only 1% of the Escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. This rate was higher for other Enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for P. aeruginosa. The cross-resistance of oxacillin with other antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. Penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. Cross-resistance was only a minor problem in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - [Profile of bacterial isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility: Multicenter study using a one-day cut-off].
AB  - The frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates from the largest clinical samples collected in 19 Spanish hospitals were studied. A total of 523 strains were identified and grouped by sample. Blood stream: Staphylococcus coagulase-negative (41%) and Escherichia coli (19.7%); oxacillin resistance occurred in 44% of coagulase-negative strains, strains which were also resistant to nonbetalactam agents. All antimicrobial agents tested had good activity against E. coli, with the exception of penicillins (25 to 33% susceptible). Urine: E. coli (59.1%) and Enterococcus faecalis (15%); aminoglycosides and third generation cephalosporins were the most active compounds against E. coli, whereas penicillins and cotrimoxazole were the least active. E. faecalis isolates showed low rates of resistance to the antibiotics tested and no glycopeptide-resistant strains were detected. Skin and soft tissues: Staphylococcus aureus (24.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.7.%); oxacillin resistance occurred in 15.8% of S. aureus strains and co-resistance to nonbetalactam agents was frequently observed among these strains. Ceftazidime susceptibility was elevated among P. aeruginosa (76.9%) and the most active agents were aminoglycosides (100% susceptibility). Lower respiratory tract: P. aeruginosa (21.4%) and Haemophilus influenzae (15.5%). Aminoglycosides (88.8 to 94.4%) and ceftazidime (72%) presented the highest susceptibility rates in P. aeruginosa. All the agents tested were very active against H. influenzae (89% susceptibility). Among Gram-positive cocci, no vancomycin and/or teicoplanin-resistant strains were detected.
TI  - [Comparison of types and drug sensitivity of bacteria isolated from sputum and bronchoscopic material. Analysis of results from routine diagnostic tests from 1995-1997].
AB  - Proper identification of the organism and determination of their sensitivity to antimicrobial agents, is the most important part of the management of patients with symptoms of respiratory system infections. In the case of pulmonary infections, the utility of sputum for diagnosing the cause of lower respiratory tract infections seems to be limited. In the patients receiving antibiotics, there is a high rate of colonization of the upper respiratory tract that may lead to the overgrowth of one or an other pathogen, making it more abundant in the upper than an lower respiratory tract. Also, the patients may be unable to provide adequate lower-respiratory-tract samples. For these reason, more invasive procedures have been recommended. These include bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sampling. The purpose of our study was to determine the value of sputum and BAL fluid on the basis of profile bacteria and their drug sensitivity isolated from the patients treated in Nat. Res. Inst. Tuber. and Lung Diseases in Warsaw during period of 3 years (1995-1997). On the basis of analysis of 5926 sputum samples and 3534 bronchoscopic materials we have found that the bacterial pathogens species and drug resistant pattern were similar in sputum samples as in materials of bronchoscopic procedures. The same bacterial species and numbers Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were predominant in both type of clinical materials with near the same frequency.
TI  - Acute otitis media in Brazilian children: analysis of microbiology and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - Between 1990 and 1995, a total of 300 children, ages 2 months to 5 years, received diagnoses of acute otitis media (AOM) in a hospital emergency room in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and were recruited for this study. The investigation was undertaken, first, to identify microorganisms and antimicrobial susceptibilities of pathogens from AOM in Brazilian children; next, to ascertain, by comparison, whether the isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae have the same serotypes as those included in the new conjugated heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine; and last, to determine whether additional and/or different serotypes are needed in the vaccine to ensure an immunogenic response against pneumococcal pathogens for the indigenous children in this study. Microorganisms were isolated from ear fluid of 192 patients (64%). The 5 most prevalent pathogens were S pneumoniae (48 isolates; 16%), Haemophilus influenzae (21 isolates; 7%), Moraxella catarhalis (15 isolates; 5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6 isolates; 2%), and Staphylococcus aureus (3 isolates; 1%). These 5 represented 93 of the 192 total isolates. Resistance to antibiotics was found in the 3 primary pathogens. No high-level resistance of S pneumoniae to penicillin was found; instead, there was high-level resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Ten serotypes of S pneumoniae were isolated: 6B, 9V, 11A, 16, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23A, 23B, and 23F. Only 5 of the 10 serotypes isolated were included in the conjugated heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine. Therefore, the other 5 serotypes (24 of 48 strains) should be considered in selecting antigens for the new vaccine.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Production of N-acyl homoserine lactones by gram-negative bacteria isolated from  contact lens wearers.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the production of N-acyl-homoserine  lactone (AHL) signal molecules in ocular gram-negative bacteria. A total of 91 ocular strains isolated from contact lens adverse response patients and asymptomatic subjects were used in the study. These included Acinetobacter, Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The biosensor strains Chromobacterium violaceum mutant CV026 and Agrobacterium tumefaciens A136 were used for detection of AHL signal molecules. The majority of A. hydrophila, P. aeruginosa, and S. liquefaciens strains produced more than one AHL molecule. Serratia marcescens strains were AHL positive only under detection of A136. The rest of the test species did not show any AHL production under the current detection system. These findings indicate that AHL-mediated quorum-sensing systems are present in some of the ocular bacteria, and the different signal molecules may be involved with the quorum-sensing pathway in the other bacterial species.
TI  - Changing antibiotic sensitivity patterns at a university hospital, 1992 through 1999.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms is of great concern in the medical community. Antibiotic sensitivity patterns were studied at a large university hospital. METHODS: From 1992 through 1999, susceptibility testing was done and results recorded for all isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus sp, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Eshcherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Microbiologic and sensitivity data were reviewed and compiled. RESULTS: Over the 8-year period, several common bacterial pathogens declined in susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents. Most notable were the decreased sensitivities of S pneumoniae to penicillin (96% to 63%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus to oxacillin (50% to 38%), and P aeruginosa to aminoglycosides [(gentamicin (85% to 64%), tobramycin (96% to 83%), amikacin (92% to 74%)] and ciprofloxacin (85% to 69%). CONCLUSIONS: These decreased antibiotic sensitivities reflect increased bacterial selection pressure as a result of widespread antibiotic use. A combined approach involving infection-control specialists, infectious disease physicians, and hospital administrators is necessary to address this increasingly difficult problem.
TI  - Late endophthalmitis associated with glaucoma drainage implants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the clinical course of a series of patients who had late endophthalmitis develop after glaucoma drainage implant (GDI) surgery. DESIGN: Noncomparative, interventional, consecutive case series. PARTICIPANTS: Four patients were identified with late endophthalmitis associated with Baerveldt glaucoma implants. METHODS: The medical records of all patients with endophthalmitis associated with a GDI treated at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute or University of Florida between January 1, 1987 and December 31, 1999 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with culture-positive endophthalmitis diagnosed more than 1 month after GDI surgery were included in this series. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity and intraocular pressure (IOP). RESULTS: Late endophthalmitis associated with Baerveldt glaucoma implants developed 7 weeks to 2 years postoperatively. Exposure of the GDI tube was present in all cases. The implant was removed in three of four patients. Visual acuity worsened from preinfection level in two of four cases. IOP was controlled at last follow-up in all patients, although replacement of the explanted GDI was required in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Late endophthalmitis may occur after GDI surgery. Exposure of the GDI tube seems to represent a major risk factor for these infections. To prevent this potentially devastating complication, we recommend prophylactic surgical revision with a patch graft in all cases in which there is an exposed GDI tube.
TI  - Evaluation of spontaneous contamination of ocular medications.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to evaluate whether single-dose ophthalmic preparations in 0.5-ml containers can safely be used within 24 h after the first opening, eigth different sterile ocular medications containing timolol, jaluronic acid, diclofenac, ketotifen, pilocarpine, formocortal, formocortal-gentamycin, and tetryzoline-feniramine (Farmigea, Italy) were opened and tested for spontaneous bacterial contamination after exposure to air. METHODS: Samples (10 microl) were collected from exposed ophthalmic preparations after 0, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h. RESULTS: No viable microorganisms were detected during and at the end of the evaluation period. In order to assess whether the resident or pathogenic ocular bacterial population due to repeated handling might contaminate the medications, about 10(5) cells of different species (Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus spp., Corynebacterium spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria spp., Acinetobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans) were added to the containers and incubated at 37 degrees C or at room temperature. Samples were collected and the number of viable bacteria was estimated. The antibacterial effect of the ophthalmic compounds varied depending on the species considered. Tetryzoline-feniramine, pilocarpine, ketotifen and formocortal-gentamycin exhibited a frank bactericidal activity (<100 survivors after 18-24 h of exposure) against the great majority of the species tested. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the risk of spontaneous contamination of ophthalmic preparations after their first opening is low, and that all preparations tested exhibit an aspecific antibacterial activity. As a consequence, the safe usage of these ocular medications could be extended from the recommended 3 h to at least 24 h after the first usage.
TI  - Resolution of infectious parameters after antimicrobial therapy in patients with  ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - Although recommended durations of antimicrobial therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) range from 7 to 21 d, these are not based on prospective studies and little is known about the resolution of symptoms after start of antibiotics. Resolution of these symptoms was investigated in 27 patients. VAP was diagnosed on clinical, radiographic, and microbiological criteria, including quantitative cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage. All patients received appropriate antibiotic therapy. Highest temperatures, leukocyte counts, Pa(O(2))/FI(O(2)) ratios, and semiquantitative cultures of endotracheal aspirates were recorded from start of therapy until Day 14. Resolution was defined as the first day that these parameters fulfilled the following definition: temperature < or = 38 degrees C, leukocytes < or = 10 x 10(9)/L, Pa(O(2))/FI(O(2)) ratio > or = 25 kPa, and no or +1 of bacterial growth of etiologic pathogens in cultures of endotracheal aspirate. VAP was caused by Enterobacteriaceae (n = 14), P. aeruginosa (n = 7), S. aureus (n = 6), H. influenzae (n = 3), and S. pneumoniae (n = 1). H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were eradicated from tracheal aspirates, whereas Enterobacteriaceae, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa persisted, despite in vitro susceptibility to antibiotics administered. Significant improvements were observed for all clinical parameters, most apparently within the first 6 d after start of antibiotics. Newly acquired colonization, especially with P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae, occurred in the second week of therapy. Six patients developed a recurrent episode of VAP, four of them with P. aeruginosa. Clinical responses to therapy for VAP occur within the first 6 d of therapy, endotracheal colonization with Gram-negative bacteria persists despite susceptibility to therapy, and acquired colonization usually occurs in the second week of therapy and frequently precedes a recurrent episode.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia in a surgical intensive care unit: epidemiology,  etiology and comparison of three bronchoscopic methods for microbiological specimen sampling.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VAP) is a important intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired infection in mechanically ventilated patients. Early and correct diagnosis of VAP is difficult but is an urgent challenge for an optimal antibiotic treatment. The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence and microbiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia and to compare three quantitative bronchoscopic methods for diagnosis. METHODS: A prospective, open, epidemiological clinical study was performed in a surgical ICU. In a prospective study, 279 patients admitted to a 14-bed surgical ICU during a 1-year period were evaluated with regard to VAP. Three quantitative culture bronchoscopic techniques for identifying the etiological agent were compared [bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), protected specimen brush (PSB) and bronchoscopic tracheobronchial secretion (TBS)]. RESULTS: Among 103 long-term ventilated patients, 49 (48%) developed one or more VAPs (a total of 60 VAPs). The incidence was 24 VAPs per 100 ventilated patients or 23 VAPs per 1000 ventilator days. BAL, PSB and TBS with quantitative measurements were equivalent in identifying the bacterial etiology. The VAP was caused predominantly by Staphylococcus aureus in 38% of cases, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 10%, Haemophilus influenzae in 10% and Klebsiella sp. in 9%. We did not find an increased mortality rate in patients undergoing long-term ventilation who acquired VAP in comparison with patients without VAP. CONCLUSION: For the identification of the microbiological etiology of VAP, one of three available bronchoscopic methods analysed by quantitative measurements is sufficient. In our study, quantitative bronchoscopic tracheal secretion analysis was very promising. Before accepting this method as a standard technique, other studies will have to confirm our results.
TI  - [Epidemiology and antibiotic therapy in nosocomial pneumonia].
AB  - Nosocomial pneumonia occurs in 0.5 to 1.5% of all hospitalized patients and in 10 to 30% of those under artificial ventilation. The main causal agents are Staphylococcus aureus and resistant Gram-negative bacilli, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In case of early onset (before the fifth day), Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and susceptible enterobacteria predominate. These infections are associated with overmortality, particularly in patients with P. aeruginosa pneumonia, severe respiratory failure, shock syndrome or given a poorly adapted antibiotic regimen. Management of patients with nosocomial pneumonia depends on the clinical presentation and prior bacteriology data often leading to empiric antibiotic prescription. Published guidelines, for example those recommended by the American Thoracic Society, can also be used to adapt the antibiotic therapy as a function of the severity of the clinical situation, the patient's comorbidities, and the date of onset. This type of strategy remains to be evaluated. It would be advisable to base therapeutic management on reliable microbiological data allowing selection of patients requiring antibiotics and treatment based on culture results. Currently a two-drug regimen is recommended for nosocomial pneumonia due to P. aeruginosa or particularly resistant strains.
TI  - [Hospital acquired pneumonia--analysis of frequency and etiology in Polish hospitals in 1998].
AB  - Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is one of the most frequently occurring hospital infections in the world. This study describes the incidence of HAP in Poland, as well as the specific risk factors leading to this type of infection in Polish hospitals; including those of patient age, length of hospitalization, and use of mechanical ventilation. The epidemiology of HAP as well as treatment resistance of various causal organisms was studied. Data for this study was acquired from the Registry of Hospital-acquired Infectious Diseases for the year 1998. Out of 329,608 hospital-acquired infections in all patients except newborns, 920 were found to be HAP. This study showed that of every 1000 hospital admissions three patients developed HAP (0.3%). Death occurred in 260 of 920 HAP cases or 30%; and HAP found to be the direct cause of death in 66 of the 260 cases (25%). The greatest incidence of HAP was found to occur in patients older than 75 years, was directly related to the length of hospital stay, and was higher in patients on mechanical ventilation longer than 10 days. The most frequently isolated causal agents were the Gram-negative rods (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp.), and Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were found in only 2% and 4% of cases, respectively, and thus were the least likely causes of HAP in this population. It was found that the percentage of methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus was very high (55% to 60%); vancomycin-resistant enterococci were only found in patients who did not undergo surgery. The isolated strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed marked resistance to chinolones (58-76%) and to imipen (approximately 20%). In the Enterobacteriaceae family, Klebsiella sp. was found to be resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (56-73%) and Enterobacter sp. resistant in 55% to 81% of the isolates.
TI  - Effect of different antibacterial agents and surfactant protein-A (SP-A) on adherence of some respiratory pathogens to bronchial epithelial cells.
AB  - Some antibiotics at sub-inhibitory concentrations are able to alter bacterial surface structures and modulate adhesiveness by affecting the expression of microbial adhesins. An important mechanism of pulmonary defence against pathogens is SP-A, one of the proteins of the alveolar surfactant having opsonizing activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect that sub-inhibitory concentrations of different antibiotics and physiological concentrations of SP-A (1 and 5 microg/ml) could exert on the adherence of respiratory pathogens to the bronchial epithelial cell line, WI26VA4. Cefdinir and clarithromycin showed high efficacy, mainly at 1/2 MIC, in reducing the adherence of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae strains to values lower or equal to 50% of the control; sparfloxacin showed the same effect on S. aureus and S. pneumoniae but teicoplanin only on S. pneumoniae. Other similar results were observed with netilmicin on Klebsiella pneumoniae (40%) and with cefepime and ciprofloxacin on Pseudomonas aeruginosa (60%). Clarithromycin reduced the adherence of K. pneumoniae to 80% although it is not active against this strain. Adherence of the test strains was not modified by SP-A alone or in combination with any of the antibiotics used.
TI  - [Clinical analysis of patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization classified by age group].
AB  - We classified 1017 patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization experienced in Kawasaki Medical School Kawasaki Hospital during the past 15 years into five age groups (< or = 54 years old, 55-64 years old, 65-74 years old, 75-84 years old, > or = 85 years old). With particular emphasis on the elderly patients, we then compared the clinical and microbiological findings in the five groups. The results were as follows; (1) Half of patients in the over 85 years old group were bed-ridden. (2) The proportion receiving antibiotics before hospitalization decreased with age. (3) There were striking atypical pneumonic symptoms, such as dyspnea and consciousness disturbance in the two age groups over 75 years old. (4) Hypotension (shock) increased with age. (5) Markers of nutritional conditions, such as serum protein, albumin, cholinesterase, and hypoxia remarkably increased in the two age groups over 75 years old. (6) There were no significant differences in the isolation rate of etiological microorganisms. (7) The number of polymicrobial agents in the < or = 54 years old group was lower than that in the other age groups. (8) Mycoplasma pneumoniae was most significantly higher in < or = 54 years old group, Haemophilus influenzae in patients 55-64 years old, and Streptococcus pneumoniae in both 65-74 and 75-84 years old groups. (9) The isolation rate of MSSA, gram-negative bacilli such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respiratory viruses increased with age. (10) The amount of sepsis increased with age. (11) The prognosis was poor in the two groups over 75 years old because the mortality rate (over 10%) was higher that for the other age groups.
TI  - Effect of some fractions of alveolar surfactant (phospholipids and SP-A) on the bactericidal activity of different antimicrobials against some respiratory pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of physiologic concentrations, at alveolar level, of some fractions of pulmonary surfactant (phospholipids and SP-A) on the bactericidal activity of different antimicrobials against some respiratory pathogens. METHODS: The antimicrobial agents cefdinir, sparfloxacin, clarithromycin, teicoplanin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, netilmicin and tobramycin, depending on their specific activity, were investigated against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Killing curves were carried out with antimicrobials at 0.5 and 2 MIC, SP-A at 1 and 5 mg/L and phospholipids at 50 mg/L. RESULTS: Time-kill experiments showed that while SP-A never modified the activity of antimicrobials, phospholipids exerted, in some cases, a weak antagonistic effect. Among antibacterials and pathogens investigated, phospholipids were able to decrease the rate of killing of cefepime and ciprofloxacin only on P. aeruginosa, both at 0.5 and at 2 MIC, with an increase of about 1 log in CFU. The combination of SP-A and phospholipids never modified the effect observed in the presence of lipids alone. CONCLUSIONS: The paucity of data only allow us to observe that the examined antibiotics do not have substantially reduced activity against respiratory pathogens studied in the presence of physiologic concentrations of some fractions of surfactant. Cefepime alone already exerted a small effect, and ciprofloxacin at 2 MIC, even in the presence of phospholipids, retained its bactericidal activity.
TI  - Absence of bacterial colonization of the airways after therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy without stenting.
AB  - Following airway stenting, bacterial colonization of the airways with potentially pathogenic micro-organisms occurs within 4 weeks after treatment in the majority of patients. The objective of this study was to prospectively investigate whether nonstenting therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy (using laser, cryotherapy, mechanical dilatation or debridement) is followed by airway colonization or infection. Protected specimen brush sampling of the central airways and quantitative culture were performed immediately prior to, and 4 weeks after nonstenting therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy in 20 consecutive patients with central airway lesions. Prior to therapeutic bronchoscopy, airway colonization/infection was present in nine of 20 (45%) patients. In these nine patients, 10 different potential pathogens were identified: Streptococcus pneumoniae (four cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (three), Haemophilus influenzae (two), and Serratia marcescens (one). Eight of these nine patients had a history of postobstructive infections, of which three were currently being treated with antibiotics. Four weeks following therapeutic bronchoscopy, airway colonization/infection was present in five of 20 (25%) patients, each of whom had airway colonization/infection prior to bronchoscopy. In three of these five patients, the same organisms were found 4 weeks after bronchoscopy as at baseline bronchoscopy. In two of five patients new organisms were identified: one case of Streptococcus viridans and one case of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, both considered to be nonpathogens. In four of nine patients with airway colonization/infection prior to bronchoscopy, the airways were clear of micro-organisms after the procedure. The authors conclude that: 1) nonstenting therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy is not complicated by airway colonization or infection by new potential pathogens; and 2) therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy led to clearing of airway colonization/infection in almost half of the patients studied.
TI  - The microbiology of chronic rhinosinusitis: results of a community surveillance study.
AB  - In view of the rapidly changing patterns of antibiotic resistance, community surveillance studies are providing important information to help guide practitioners in making their choice of antibiotics. For this community surveillance study, we performed a retrospective chart review of nasal and sinus culture data obtained from 83 patients with typical symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis who visited a community otolaryngologist in Rochester, New York. Pathogens were isolated in 59 of these patients (71%). The most common were coagulase-negative staphylococci (31% of isolates). Among the other isolated pathogens were Hemophilus influenzae (25%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (12%), Moraxella catarrhalis (10%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (5%), and Staphylococcus aureus (3%). Approximately 39% of the coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates were resistant to penicillin. Some 20% of the H influenzae isolates were beta-lactamase-positive, and 14% of all isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics. Approximately 12% of the 83 patients cultured positive for multiple organisms. Our findings provide important surveillance information about the resistance patterns of pathogens in our area. Although the prevalence of beta-lactamase-positive H influenzae that we observed was consistent with those of other reports, we found a lower prevalence of polymicrobial flora. Our findings suggest that culture- and sensitivity-directed therapy should be effective in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis.
TI  - Etiology of severe pneumonia in the very elderly.
AB  - The etiology of severe pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation in the very elderly has been imprecise because of lack of comprehensive studies and low yield of diagnostic approach. Overall, 104 patients 75 yr of age and older with severe pneumonia were studied prospectively at two university-affiliated hospitals. Microbial investigation included blood culture, serology, pleural fluid, and bronchoalveolar secretions. Streptococcus pneumoniae (14%), gram-negative enteric bacilli (14%), Legionella sp. (9%), Hemophilus influenzae (7%), and Staphylococcus aureus (7%) were the predominant pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Staphylococcus aureus (29%), gram-negative enteric bacilli (15%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (9%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%) accounted for most isolates of nursing home-acquired pneumonia (NHAP). The case fatality rate was 55% (53% for CAP and 57% for NHAP; p > 0.5). Activity of Daily Living (ADL) Index, pulmonary, endocrine and central nervous system (CNS) comorbidities were associated with distinct microbial etiology. By multivariate analysis, hospital mortality was associated independently with 24-h urine output (odds ratio [OR], 5.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5 to 7.9; p < 0.001), septic shock (OR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.9 to 8.9; p = 0.0059), radiographic multilobar involvement (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.8 to 15.6; p = 0.02), and inadequate antimicrobial therapy (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.4 to 23.9; p = 0.034). Further studies should focus on identifying effective antimicrobial regimens in randomized trials.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of 41 antimicrobials tested against over 2773 bacterial isolates from hospitalized patients with pneumonia: I--results from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (North America, 1998).
AB  - Pneumonia is the second most frequent cause of nosocomial infection, and hospitalization frequently is needed for community-acquired pneumonia. Knowledge of causative pathogens through periodic surveillance, and their prevailing antimicrobial susceptibility patterns becomes paramount in choosing appropriate empiric therapy. The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, tracks pathogen distribution worldwide since 1997 and documents emerging resistance to a wide range of antimicrobial agents. During the respiratory disease season in 1998, each of 30 medical centers (25 in the United States [US], and five in Canada [CAN]) contributed 100 consecutive isolates obtained from hospitalized patients with suspected pneumonia. The 2773 organisms, processed by the monitor consisted of a total of 35 species, with Staphylococcus aureus comprising 25.6% of all isolates and five other species (Pseudomonas aeruginosa 18.7%, Haemophilus influenzae 9.4%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 7.8%, Klebsiella spp. 7.0%, and Enterobacter spp. 6.7%) making up almost 50% of the total. In the US, pneumococci (8.5%) were more prevalent than in CAN (4.1%; p = 0.001). The US isolates of S. pneumoniae were variably susceptible to penicillin (76.8%), with non-susceptible strains demonstrating greater levels of cross resistance to macrolides (31.8%), cefepime (9.0%) and cefotaxime (6.8%), but remaining susceptible to gatifloxacin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were generally ampicillin-resistant, 40.4-44.4% and 93.7-95.7%, respectively. P. aeruginosa remained very susceptible to amikacin (91.3-93.8%) > tobramycin > meropenem > piperacillin/tazobactam > gentamicin > piperacillin > cefepime (80.0-81.8%). Extended spectrum beta-lactamase phenotypes among the Klebsiella spp. were isolated from five medical centers in the US and were 4.8-6.0% overall; a rate similar to the previous year. Among the US isolates of Enterobacter spp., only 77.6% and 79.6% were susceptible to ceftazidime and cefotaxime, respectively, but >90% were inhibited by cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. Isolates from CAN were generally more susceptible, except for Pseudomonas isolates, where resistance to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones and imipenem was greater. The SENTRY Program results outline important national differences in the frequencies of pathogen occurrence, but more importantly, identify unstable patterns of resistance to available antimicrobial drugs, and serves as a reference for results of other local, national or international investigations.
TI  - Risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill trauma patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill trauma patients. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The trauma intensive care unit (ICU) of a 1500-bed tertiary-care hospital. PATIENTS: All critically ill trauma patients (n = 103) admitted consecutively between November 1995 and October 1996. INTERVENTIONS: A comparison of data recorded at the time of ICU admission and during the clinical evolution in patients with (n = 23) and without (n = 80) nosocomial pneumonia was made. Data referred mainly to possible risk factors were recorded; they also included factors related to pneumonia etiology and evolutive factors. Predictors of nosocomial pneumonia were assessed by logistic regression analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The presence of significant growth on quantitative cultures of the protected specimen brush (> or = 103 colony forming units/mL) was required to accept pneumonia as microbiologically proven, as well as the concurrence of a cohort of clinical and radiologic signs. Twenty-three (22.3%) patients developed nosocomial pneumonia. The mean age of these patients was 41.7 yrs; 18 of them (78.3%) were men. The microorganisms isolated in significant concentrations were Acinetobacter baumanii (ten cases), Staphylococcus aureus (11 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (five cases), Haemophilus influenzae (two cases), and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus spp., Enterobacter spp., coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus intermedius (one case each one). Risk factors for pneumonia by univariate analysis included nasogastric tube; continuous enteral feeding; prolonged mechanical ventilation (>1 day); use of H2-receptor antagonist, sucralfate, muscle relaxants, corticosteroids, barbiturates, and inotropic agents; positive end-expiratory pressure; intense sedation; re-intubation; tracheotomy; urgent brain computed tomography (CT) scan; craniotomy; iatrogenic event; and hyperventilation. The mortality rate was 43.5% (10 of 23) in the nosocomial pneumonia group and 18.8% in patients without nosocomial pneumonia (p =.02). Also, the mean stay in the ICU, the therapeutic charge (measured with total and mean punctuation of the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System) and the complications, infectious and noninfectious, of the clinical evolution were significantly more frequent in patients with nosocomial pneumonia than in those without pneumonia (p <.05). In the multivariate analysis, continuous enteral feeding, craniotomy, prolonged mechanical ventilation (>24 hrs), use of positive end-expiratory pressure, and corticotherapy were independent predictors of nosocomial pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that factors related to the patient's clinical course, rather than variables registered on the first days of ICU admission, are those that would exert an influence on the development of nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill trauma patients. In this way, from our point of view, in our study the main risk factors are the use of prolonged mechanical ventilation (>4 hrs) and positive end-expiratory pressure. At the same time, we can conclude that the reduction of this infection incidence could decrease the mean stay in the ICU, the therapeutic charge, and the prognosis in terms of mortality and morbidity.
TI  - Acute exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)--microbial patterns and risk factors.
AB  - Around 25% of patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) show some evidence of tracheobronchial colonization. It is, however, probable that the vast majority of patients become colonized at some time during the course of the disease. A variety of factors including current smoking and viral infections predispose to bacterial colonization and subsequently acute exacerbations. In fact, infectious aetiologies account for around 50-75% of acute COPD exacerbations. Bacterial pathogens are present in around 50% of patients, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae being the most frequently encountered pathogens. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and probably also Gram-negative enteric bacilli are more frequently found in patients with more severe airflow limitation. Viral infections are present in around 10-20%, with Influenzavirus representing the most frequent viral pathogen. Only recently, evidence for infection by Chlamydia pneumoniae has been found in 5-20% of patients. Predictors of distinct aetiologies have only infrequently been studied so far. Thus, it currently remains difficult to make adequate predictions on clinical grounds in the individual patient. Nevertheless, we would advocate to tentatively stratify the initial antimicrobial treatment according to the severity of the acute exacerbation episode and the presence of individual risk factors. The validation of such an approach may result in significant progress in our understanding of the role of infection and infectious agents in different subgroups of patients with acute exacerbations.
TI  - Intravenous followed by oral ofloxacin in the treatment of community acquired lower respiratory tract infections in adults requiring hospitalisation.
AB  - Forty patients were treated with ofloxacin for community acquired lower respiratory tract infections. Eighteen pathogens were isolated in sputum; Streptococcus pneumoniae (4) and Haemophilus influenzae (4) were the most common, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (3), Klebsiella spp. (2), Staphylococcus anreus (2), Pseudomonas spp. (2), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). Ofloxacin 200 mg every 12 hours was administered for an average of 3.7 days intravenously followed by 5.4 days orally. Response to therapy was judged to be cure in 38 (95%; 95% C.I., 85%-95%) patients, failure in one (2.5%) and "indeterminate" in one (2.5%).
TI  - Efficacy of ofloxacin and other otic preparations for acute otitis media in patients with tympanostomy tubes.
AB  - Otorrhea occurs in 21 to 50% of all children with tympanostomy tubes in the United States. More than 1 million children annually undergo tubomyringotomy, constituting placement of more than 2 million tympanostomy tubes each year. The organisms typically responsible for otorrhea are the same as those that cause otitis media in very young children, including Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Drainage from tympanostomy tubes in older children involves organisms that colonize the external auditory canal, the most common being Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Ofloxacin (Floxin otic), a newer fluoroquinalone antibiotic, has several advantages over other agents available for the treatment of otorrhea caused by acute otitis media in patients with tympanostomy tubes. The twice daily dosing regimen encourages better patient adherence to therapy, which is likely to improve treatment efficacy. Ofloxacin has not been associated with ototoxicity in animal models or in children participating in the clinical trials. It provides coverages for a wide range of pathogens, including Pseudomonas sp., and is indicated for use in children > or =1 year old and currently approved for patients > or =12 years with chronic suppurative otitis media. Ofloxacin applied topically in children with tympanostomy tubes in place and purulent otorrhea is as efficacious as oral amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) therapy. Other currently available therapeutic options are discussed.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of topical ofloxacin and other ototopical agents.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ototopical agents are extensively used for otitis externa (OE), acute otitis media identified by otorrhea in patients who have tympanostomy tubes (AOM-TT) and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). The quinolones have particular value as ototopical agents because of the broad spectrum of antibacterial activity of importance in otic diseases and the high concentrations of antibacterial activity at the site of infection. METHODS: A survey of literature on in vitro activity and microbiologic efficacy in clinical trials of quinolone otic products for OE, AOM-TT and CSOM. RESULTS: OE: Floxin otic and Cortisporin TC otic suspension were equally effective in eradicating the three major pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus. CSOM: Ofloxacin otic was effective in an open label trial in uniform eradication of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter spp. AOM-TT: Ofloxacin otic and amoxicillin/clavulanate (by mouth) were equivalent clinically; rates of eradication of initial pathogens were similar for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, but ofloxacin otic was superior in eradication of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa CONCLUSIONS: In each of the studies of OE, CSOM and AOM-TT, ofloxacin otic solution was effective in eradicating the bacterial pathogen from the site of infection: equivalent to Cortisporin for children with OE; superior to amoxicillin/clavulanate for patients with AOM-TT who had acute drainage; and effective in eradicating bacterial pathogens from the external canal of patients with CSOM.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis--the antibiotic era: a multicenter study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical course and identify the causative organisms  of acute mastoiditis in a community where most of the patients who develop acute otitis media are treated with antibiotics. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective review of a series of 223 consecutive cases of acute mastoiditis. SETTING: Nine secondary or tertiary academic or non-academic referral centers. RESULTS: Prior to the diagnosis of acute mastoiditis, 121 of the patients (54.3%) had been receiving oral antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media for periods ranging from 1 to 21 days (mean 5.3 days). Samples for bacterial culture were obtained from 152 patients. Cultures were negative in 60 patients. The organisms isolated in the 92 positive cultures were: Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 patients), Streptococcus pyogenes (14 patients), Staphylococcus aureus (13 patients), Staphylococcus coagulase negative (three patients), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (eight patients), Haemophilus influenzae (four patients), Proteus mirabilis (two patients), Escherichia coli (two patients), Klebsiella pneumoniae (one patient), Enterobacter (one patient), Acinetobacter (one patient), anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (one patient), and fungi (two patients). Ten patients had mixed flora. Sixteen patients presented with complications (cerebellar abscess, perisinus empyema, subdural abscess or empyema, extradural abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, lateral sinus thrombosis, bacterial meningitis, labyrinthitis, petrositis, or facial nerve palsy). CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic treatment cannot be considered an absolute safeguard against the development of acute mastoiditis. Early myringotomy for acute otitis media seems to decrease the incidence of complications. The distribution of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis differs from that in acute otitis media. Intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis are not rare. Because of the diversity of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis and the growing resistance of bacteria to the various antibiotics, all means to obtain a sample for culture prior to antibiotic treatment, including general anesthesia.
TI  - Changes in strategies for optimal antibacterial therapy in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Aggressive antibiotic therapy of bacterial airway infection is one of the main reasons for the dramatic increase in life expectancy over the last few decades. Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae are the predominant pathogens in younger patients, but the choice of antibiotic therapy against these pathogens remains highly controversial. There is general agreement that patients with pulmonary exacerbations should be treated and many cystic fibrosis (CF) centres will also try to eradicate bacteria in the absence of symptoms. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy, with anti-staphylococcal medications started at the time of diagnosis, is advocated by some groups but its positive effect remains unproven. In fact, recent studies have suggested that continuous prophylactic treatment with anti-staphylococcal antibiotics may increase the risk of early colonisation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa is the main pathogen in older children with CF. While chronic airway infection with mucoid P. aeruginosa is considered irreversible, both the combination of oral ciprofloxacin with inhaled colistin and inhaled tobramycin alone has been used successfully in the early phase of colonisation. In patients chronically infected with P. aeruginosa, standard treatment of pulmonary exacerbations consists of intravenous combination therapy for 2-3 weeks. Controversy exists whether this treatment should be performed routinely every 3 months or only in the presence of a pulmonary exacerbation. Inhaled antibiotics such as tobramycin have been shown to improve lung function and reduce sputum density of P. aeruginosa, but both the optimal dose and the duration of therapy are unclear at the present time.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae stimulates ICAM-1 expression on respiratory epithelial cells.
AB  - Epithelial cells interact directly with bacteria in the environment and play a critical role in airway defense against microbial pathogens. In this study, we examined the response of respiratory epithelial cells to infection with nontypable Haemophilus influenzae. Using an in vitro cell culture model, we found that epithelial cell monolayers released significant quantities of IL-8 and expressed increased levels of ICAM-1 mRNA and surface protein in response to H. influenzae. In contrast, levels of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and MHC class I were not significantly affected, suggesting preferential activation of a specific subset of epithelial genes directed toward defense against bacteria. Induction of ICAM-1 required direct bacterial interaction with the epithelial cell surface and was not reproduced by purified H. influenzae lipooligosaccharide. Consistent with a functional role for this response, induction of ICAM-1 by H. influenzae mediated increased neutrophil adherence to the epithelial cell surface. Furthermore, in an in vivo murine model of airway infection with H. influenzae, increased epithelial cell ICAM-1 expression coincided with increased chemokine levels and neutrophil recruitment in the airway. These results indicate that ICAM-1 expression on human respiratory epithelial cells is induced by epithelial cell interaction with H. influenzae and suggest that an ICAM-1-dependent mechanism can mediate neutrophil adherence to these cells independent of inflammatory mediator release by other cell types. Direct induction of specific epithelial cell genes (such as ICAM-1 and IL-8) by bacterial infection may allow for rapid and efficient innate defense in the airway.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis dry extract.
AB  - In this study the antibacterial and antifungal properties of propolis, a natural  product of bees, have been investigated against different pathogens. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined according to NCCLS standards on 320 strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Time-kill curves were assessed for susceptible microorganisms, testing 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 x MIC for propolis, by counting viable bacteria after 0, 3, 6, 24 hours and viable yeasts after 0, 3, 6, 24 and 48 hours. Propolis showed good antimicrobial activity against most of the isolates, particularly S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, but not against Enterobacteriaceae. Time-kill curves demonstrated bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal activity of propolis, the latter being evident only at high concentrations.
TI  - Detection of bacterial virulence genes by subtractive hybridization: identification of capsular polysaccharide of Burkholderia pseudomallei as a major virulence determinant.
AB  - Burkholderia pseudomallei, the etiologic agent of melioidosis, is responsible for a broad spectrum of illnesses in humans and animals particularly in Southeast Asia and northern Australia, where it is endemic. Burkholderia thailandensis is a nonpathogenic environmental organism closely related to B. pseudomallei. Subtractive hybridization was carried out between these two species to identify genes encoding virulence determinants in B. pseudomallei. Screening of the subtraction library revealed A-T-rich DNA sequences unique to B. pseudomallei, suggesting they may have been acquired by horizontal transfer. One of the subtraction clones, pDD1015, encoded a protein with homology to a glycosyltransferase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This gene was insertionally inactivated in wild-type B. pseudomallei to create SR1015. It was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoelectron microscopy that the inactivated gene was involved in the production of a major surface polysaccharide. The 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) for wild-type B. pseudomallei is <10 CFU; the LD(50) for SR1015 was determined to be 3.5 x 10(5) CFU, similar to that of B. thailandensis (6.8 x 10(5) CFU). DNA sequencing of the region flanking the glycosyltransferase gene revealed open reading frames similar to capsular polysaccharide genes in Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Neisseria meningitidis. In addition, DNA from Burkholderia mallei and Burkholderia stabilis hybridized to a glycosyltransferase fragment probe, and a capsular structure was identified on the surface of B. stabilis via immunoelectron microscopy. Thus, the combination of PCR-based subtractive hybridization, insertional inactivation, and animal virulence studies has facilitated the identification of an important virulence determinant in B. pseudomallei.
TI  - Genotype analysis and phenotypic manifestations of children with intermediate sweat chloride test results.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common inherited diseases among whites. Since the cloning of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, a number of studies have focused on associations between the genotype and phenotype in CF. This had led to the progressive identification of new groups of patients, including those who have mild lung disease and those who have normal sweat chloride values (< 60 mEq/L). The aim of the present work was to provide information on the genotype and the phenotypic characteristics of children with intermediate-range sweat chloride test results. PATIENTS AND RESULTS: We focused on children referred to the pulmonary department for various types of pulmonary disease and who had several sweat chloride test results with median values in the range of 40 to 60 mEq/L. Twenty-four patients over a 10-year period were enrolled (mean age, 4.8 years). Respiratory manifestations at initial evaluation included recurrent bronchitis, wheezing, chronic cough, and pneumonia. The duration of the follow-up ranged from 0.5 to 10.5 years. Sputum cultures revealed the presence of Haemophilus influenzae (10 children), Staphylococcus aureus (4 children), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3 children). Pancreatic insufficiency was found in two patients. Analysis of the entire coding sequence allowed identification of 16 known mutations in CFTR gene. Fifteen chromosomes (31.2%) carried a mutation in CFTR gene and one allele carried two mutations. Three patients were homozygous or double heterozygous (DeltaF508/DeltaF508, DeltaF508/3849 + 10 kb C-->T, S1235R/G551D). The 5-thymidine allele was identified in four children. CONCLUSION: These results indicate an higher frequency of CFTR gene mutations in patients with borderline sweat chloride test results, compared to data reported in the general population. They lead to the recommendations for complete pulmonary and GI investigations in this group of patients, as well as assiduous care and medical follow-up.
TI  - Microbial Pathogens Associated With Cystic Fibrosis: Special Focus on Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common inherited lethal disease among Caucasians. The disease is characterized by a high sodium sweat concentration, malabsorption, malnutrition, and chronic bronchopulmonary infection. Although CF is a multisystem disorder it is the deterioration of lung function, due mainly to bacterial colonization, that is the major determinant contributing to the high morbidity and mortality of affected patients. A relatively large variety of microbial species can be recovered from the CF sputum but it is widely accepted that Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Burkholderia cepacia are the most important organisms causing infection in CF patients. Among these, P.aruginosa is the most prevalent pathogen responsible for much of the severe chronic lung infection. Antibiotic therapy aimed at clearing or reducing, the bacterial load in the CF lung, even though temporary, increases the longevity of patients and is one of the mainstays in treatment the disease.
TI  - Comparative In Vitro Activities of Moxifloxacin (Bay 12-8039) and Other Antimicrobial Agents Against Respiratory Tract Pathogens in Brazil.
AB  - Clinical isolates of respiratory tract pathogens were susceptibility tested against six different antimicrobial agents. The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of levofloxacin, cefaclor, amoxicillin-clavulanate acid, azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 111 isolates, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and other species isolated from respiratory tract infections. All isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin, except for two isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa which showed intermediate-resistance (MIC=6microg/mL), and one isolate of Escherichia coli which showed resistance (MIC>32microg/mL). Only moxifloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were active against 100% of S. pneumoniae isolates at the suceptible breakpoint (MIC90, 0.25 microg/mL and 0.064 microg/mL respectively). The rank order of the activity among this group of drugs against S. pneumoniae was as follows (% of susceptibility): moxifloxacin = amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (100%) > levofloxacin (97%) > cefaclor (71%) > trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (54%) > azithromycin (53%). Except for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, all antimicrobial agents were 100% active against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. The fluoroquinolones, moxifloxacin and levofloxacin, were the most potent compounds against these pathogens (MIC(90) 0.032 0.19 microg/mL). These in vitro susceptibility testing data of moxifloxacin support the view that this fluoroquinolone will have an important therapeutic role in the treatment of respiratory tract diseases.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We investigated activity of piperacillin (PIPC) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. The following results were obtained: 1. PIPC had its MIC90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in Gram-positive bacteria (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis) and showed its MIC of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible PRSP strains out of 38 isolates of S. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. PIPC showed favorable antibacterial activities as its MIC90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae), except for P. mirabilis in which its MIC90 was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of P. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as PIPC, ABPC, CTM and CZOP. 3. PIPC had its MIC90 of > 128 micrograms/ml in Bacteroides fragilis. From these results, PIPC was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when 20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of piperacillin for several resistant strains from respiratory infections--in reference to MRSA, PRSP, BLNAR and P. aeruginosa].
AB  - We investigated antibacterial activities of piperacillin (PIPC) for several resistant strains of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections from 1998 to 1999 in comparison with reference drugs and obtained the following results: 1. The majority of methicillin resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) showed high resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics including PIPC. 2. MIC90 of PIPC was 1 and 4 micrograms/ml for penicillin intermediate and penicillin resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP/PRSP), respectively. 3. MIC90 of PIPC was 0.25 microgram/ml for beta-lactamase negative ampicillin resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae (BLNAR), showing higher antibacterial activity than the reference drugs. 4. PIPC exhibited the MICs of 8 micrograms/ml or less in 19 out of 40 IPM resistant (MIC > or = 16 micrograms/ml) strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. From these results, PIPC is proved to possess extremely favorable antibacterial activities for BLNAR, and it was suggested that PIPC might be a drug of choice even for PISP/PRSP and IPM resistant strains of P. aeruginosa.
TI  - A review of antimicrobial resistance in Canada.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is a global concern. Over the past 10 years, considerable efforts and resources have been expended to detect, monitor, and understand at the basic level the many different facets of emerging and increasing resistance. This review summarizes our current understanding of bacterial antimicrobial resistance issues in Canada with particular emphasis given to the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, future concerns and programs for ongoing surveillance are discussed.
TI  - Gatifloxacin: a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - Gatifloxacin is a new 8-methoxy-fluoroquinoline antimicrobial agent. It has enhanced activity against Gram-positive and atypical agents, while retaining broad-spectrum antiGram-negative activity. For example, the MIC(90) values for respiratory tract pathogens are < or = 0.5 microg/ml for organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (regardless of penicillin susceptibility), Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive or negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive or negative), Legionella species, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic Streptococci (macrolide sensitive or resistant), Neisseria species, most Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, Pasteurella species, Vibrio species and Yersinia enterocolitica. For methicillin-resistant S. aureus, ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Providencia species, Serratia species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli, the MIC(90) are elevated. Gatifloxacin is bactericidal and exhibits a post-antibiotic effect against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The standard dose is 400 mg once daily and is available in both oral and iv. formulation. Gatifloxacin appears to have a low propensity for the selection of resistant mutants. Clinical trial data supports the use of gatifloxacin for treatment of patients with respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin and soft tissue infections. The side effect profile for gatifloxacin is similar to that with other agents.
TI  - Risk factors for sternal wound and other infections in pediatric cardiac surgery  patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to determine the incidence, pathogens and risk factors associated with development of sternal wound and other infections in children undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed for all cardiac surgeries performed on children <18 years of age at Upstate Medical University at Syracuse between January, 1996, and June, 1998. For evaluation of risk factors for sternal wound infection, only patients undergoing sternotomy are included in the analysis: those with infection are compared with those without for preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative risk factors. RESULTS: Sternal wound infection developed in 10 of 202 (5%) children after median sternotomy. Superficial sternal wound infection developed in 6 (3%) children, and 4 (2%) had deep infection. Children with sternal wound infection had lower age, higher American Society of Anesthesiologist score, longer preoperative stay, longer period of ventilation and inotropic support, longer intensive care unit and total postoperative hospital stays and increased leukocyte band cell counts preoperatively and on Postoperative Day 1 than those without sternal infection. Causative agents for sternal wound infection were Staphylococcus aureus (6), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1) and Haemophilus influenzae non-type b (1). In addition 32 bacterial infections occurred at nonsurgical sites after 28 procedures. Infections included pneumonia, urinary tract infection and bacteremia. Longer bypass time and longer operation time were two additional risk factors for nonwound infection. CONCLUSION: Infections continue to be a significant cause of morbidity in cardiac surgery patients. Knowledge of risk factors for infection could be useful in preventive and treatment strategies for these high-risk groups.
TI  - The clinical features of severe community-acquired pneumonia presenting as septic shock. Norasept II Study Investigators.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this article was to determine the outcome, clinical and prognostic features, and microbiology of a large group of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) presenting in septic shock. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The placebo limb of the Norasept II database was examined. Data were collected on patients in septic shock with a diagnosis of CAP who presented to a participating site from home. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-eight patients met the study criteria. The 28-day survival was 53%. One hundred and four pathogens were isolated from 77 (52%) patients with 24 (16%) patients having polymicrobial infections. The most common pathogen was Streptococcus pneumoniae (19%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (18%), Haemophilus influenzae (14%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). Infection with P aeruginosa or Acinetobacter species carried a very high mortality (82%). The only clinical variables recorded in the database that could identify patients with pseudomonas or acinetobacter infection was a history of alcohol abuse. Comorbidities were present in 74% of patients, involving predominantly the cardiorespiratory system. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated APACHE II score and serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) concentration to be significant independent predictors of mortality. Patients with pseudomonas or acinetobacter infection had significantly higher IL-6 levels and significantly lower tumor necrosis factor alpha levels when compared with the rest of the cohort of patients. CONCLUSION: A diverse spectrum of both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens were implicated in patients with CAP presenting in septic shock, necessitating broad spectrum empiric antimicrobial coverage. This coverage should include antipseudomonal activity, particularly in alcoholic patients. Severity of illness (APACHE II score) and IL-6 levels were important prognostic factors. Infection with P aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species carried a very high mortality.
TI  - Association between airway bacterial load and markers of airway inflammation in patients with stable chronic bronchitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: Viable bacteria are often isolated from airway secretions in clinically  stable patients with chronic bronchitis. We hypothesized that the number of organisms and bacterial species might be important modulators of airway inflammation. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We performed quantitative sputum cultures in 160 stable patients [55 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and normal serum alpha(1)-antitrypsin levels, 62 with COPD and severe alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency (PiZ), and 43 with idiopathic bronchiectasis]. The results were related to several indicators of the mechanisms and severity of airway inflammation. RESULTS: Airway bacterial load correlated with sputum myeloperoxidase level, an indirect measure of neutrophil activation and number (r = 0.50, P<0. 001); sputum neutrophil chemoattractants [interleukin-8 level (r = 0. 68, P<0.001) and leukotriene B4 level (r = 0.53, P<0.001)]; sputum leukocyte elastase activity (r = 0.55, P<0.001); and albumin leakage from serum to sputum (r = 0.26, P<0.01). Markers of inflammation increased at bacterial loads of 10(6) to 10(7) colony-forming units per milliliter, and increased progressively with increasing bacterial load. For example, the median (interquartile range) sputum myeloperoxidase level was 0.3 U/mL (0.1 to 0.5 U/mL) for patients who were not colonized or who had mixed normal oropharyngeal flora alone; 0.5 U/mL (0.2 to 0.7 U/mL) for patients with 10(5) to 10(6) colony-forming units per milliliter (P = 0.07); 0.5 U/mL (0.3 to 1.2 U/mL) for patients with 10(6) to 10(7) colony-forming units per milliliter (P<0.01); 0.7 U/mL (0.3 to 1.2 U/mL) for patients with 10(7) to 10(8) colony-forming units per milliliter (P <0.005); and 2.4 U/mL (0.7 to 4.8 U/mL) for patients with 10(8) or greater colony-forming units per milliliter (P<0.0001). The bacterial species influenced airway inflammation; for example, sputum myeloperoxidase activity was greater (P<0.005) in patients colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa [median 32 U/mL (interquartile range, 20 to 65 U/mL)] than those colonized with nontypeable Hemophilus influenzae [4 U/mL (2 to 31 U/mL)], which in turn was greater (P = 0.01) than among those colonized with Moraxella catarrhalis [1.1 U/mL (0.6 to 1.8 U/mL)]. We did not find a relation between bacterial load and lung function. CONCLUSIONS: The bacterial load and species contribute to airway inflammation in patients with stable chronic bronchitis. Further studies are required to determine the consequences of bacterial colonization on patient morbidity and decline in lung function.
TI  - Genetic footprinting with mariner-based transposition in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The complete DNA sequence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa provides an opportunity to apply functional genomics to a major human pathogen. A comparative genomics approach combined with genetic footprinting was used as a strategy to identify genes required for viability in P. aeruginosa. Use of a highly efficient in vivo mariner transposition system in P. aeruginosa facilitated the analysis of candidate genes of this class. We have developed a rapid and efficient allelic exchange system by using the I-SceI homing endonuclease in conjunction with in vitro mariner mutagenesis to generate mutants within targeted regions of the P. aeruginosa chromosome for genetic footprinting analyses. This technique for generating transposon insertion mutants should be widely applicable to other organisms that are not naturally transformable or may lack well developed in vivo transposition systems. We tested this system with three genes in P. aeruginosa that have putative essential homologs in Haemophilus influenzae. We show that one of three H. influenzae essential gene homologs is needed for growth in P. aeruginosa, validating the practicality of this comparative genomics strategy to identify essential genes in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Results of antimicrobial susceptibilities of strains clinically isolated at 8 institutions in Hiroshima City to major oral antimicrobial drugs, mainly new quinolone drugs. Hiroshima Levofloxacin Susceptibility Surveillance Group].
AB  - To evaluate the resistance for major oral antimicrobial agents, mainly new quinolones, we carried out a drug susceptibility surveillance of 3,050 strains of 11 microbial species clinically isolated at 8 institutions such as general hospitals and examination centers in Hiroshima city. 10 antimicrobial agents were used: 3 new quinolone drugs, 5 beta-lactam drugs, minocycline and clarithromycin. Among Gram-positive bacteria, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecalis showed low susceptibility to the new quinolone drugs, while methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive to these drugs. Among Gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed high resistance for the new quinolone drugs, but enteric bacteria and Haemophilus influenzae did not show marked resistance, maintaining almost good sensitivity to these drugs. To reduce the appearance of resistant bacteria, appropriate antimicrobial agents should be selected. Drug susceptibility surveillance in the community will be also important in the future.
TI  - [Activities of antimicrobial agents against 5,180 clinical isolates obtained from 26 medical institutions during 1998 in Japan. Levofloxacin--Surveillance Group].
AB  - The surveillance study was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin) and other 20 antimicrobial agents against 5,180 clinical isolates obtained from 26 medical institutions during 1998 in Japan. The resistance to fluoroquinolones was remarkable in Enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from UTI. However, many of the common pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin-resistant isolates, methicillin-susceptible Stahylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, the family of Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae including ampicillin-resistant isolates have been kept to be susceptible to fluoroquinolones. About 90% of P. aeruginosa isolates from RTI were susceptible to fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that fluoroquinolones are useful in the treatment of various bacterial infections including respiratory infections.
TI  - Concentrations of single-dose meropenem (1 g iv) in bronchoalveolar lavage and epithelial lining fluid.
AB  - The concentrations of meropenem were measured in plasma, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) 0.5-8 h after the administration of a single 1 g iv dose of meropenem. Thirty-five patients undergoing bronchoscopy were studied. Mean concentrations in plasma, BAL and ELF, respectively, measured by high performance liquid chromatography, were as follows: 0.5 h: 25. 96, 0.14, 5.04 mg/L; 1 h: 14.98, 0.09, 7.07 mg/L; 2 h: 12.01, 0.06, 3.86 mg/L; 4 h: 2.51, 0.04, 2.20 mg/L; 6 h: 0.57, 0, 0.59 mg/L; 8 h: 0.29, 0, 0 mg/L. Throughout the 2 h following infusion, concentrations in ELF exceeded the MIC90 for all nosocomial and community-acquired respiratory pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.05 mg/L), Haemophilus influenzae (0.16 mg/L) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.86 mg/L). These results support the clinical efficacy of meropenem in the treatment of a wide range of pulmonary infections.
TI  - In vitro pharmacodynamics of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against common ocular pathogens.
AB  - PURPOSE: Time-kill curve methodology was used to assess the pharmacodynamics of two fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, against six strains representing the most common ocular pathogens: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Haemophilus influenzae. METHODS: For time-kill studies, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin solutions were prepared at concentrations of 0.5 x, 1.0 x, 2.0 x, and 3.0 x the MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) for each respective strain. Inocula were prepared by diluting overnight cultures to final concentrations of 10(2), 10(3), 10(4), and 10(5) cfu (colony-forming units)/mL in each antibiotic solution. Growth controls were included. Viability counts of antibiotic-containing and control bacterial suspensions were performed at 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 minutes. RESULTS: In general, the kill rates of ofloxacin at 1.0 x, 2.0 x, and 3.0 x the MIC were significantly faster than the kill rates of ciprofloxacin by approximately 30 minutes, regardless of the bacterial concentration tested. At 0.5 x MIC, the kill kinetics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were similar, regardless of the strain tested. At 1.0 x MIC, ofloxacin achieved 99.9% killing of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus within 30 minutes, and S. epidermidis and S. marcescens within 90 minutes. Overall, the kill kinetics of both quinolones for H. influenzae were similar, while neither quinolone achieved 99.9% killing of S. pneumoniae, regardless of the antibiotic concentration tested. CONCLUSION: Time-kill curve analyses in the present study demonstrate that ofloxacin achieved killing of the majority of ocular pathogens tested at rates equivalent to or faster than that of ciprofloxacin. Both fluoroquinolones were more effective against nonencapsulated bacteria than against encapsulated bacteria.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1998)].
AB  - The bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout Japan, since 1981. Ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and analyzed some characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. Results obtained from these investigations are discussed. In these 18 institutions around the entire Japan, 532 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 438 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from October in 1998 to September in 1999. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 85 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 100 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 96 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 75 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 6 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 38 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, 26 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the susceptibilities of 517 strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. S. aureus strains for which MICs of oxacillin (MPIPC) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) accounted for 60.0%. Vancomycin (VCM) and arbekacin (ABK) showed the most potent activities against MRSA. But one of MRSA showed resistance to ABK with the MIC of 64 micrograms/ml. The sensitive strains of MRSA to VCM have decreased. The frequency of penicillin (PC)-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP) + PC-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) have increased in 46.0% for 1998 comparatively from 30.9% of 1997's. But PRSP decreased, and PISP increased into 39.0% of 1998 years from 19.8% of 1997's. Panipenem (PAPM), imipenem (IPM) and faropenem (FRPM) showed the most potent activities against S. pneumoniae with MIC80s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Against H. influenzae and M. (B.) catarrhalis, almost all the drugs showed good activities. The sensitive strains of them against ceftazidime (CAZ) decreased in 1997, but those have increased in 1998. Inversely, the susceptibility of them against cefotiam (CTM) had been higher in 1997, but those have been lower in 1998. Tobramycin (TOB) showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and nonmucoid strains). All drugs except ampicillin (ABPC) were active against K. pneumoniae. A quite few of K. pneumoniae showed low susceptibilities. Also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. The examination of age distribution indicated that the proportion of patients with ages over 70 years was 48.6% of all the patients showing a slight increase in every year. About the proportion of diagnosed diseases as follows: Bacterial pneumonia was the most frequent with 40.2%. The ratio of it has increased slightly, and the increased rate was 10% in patients with ages over 70 years compared with the results in 1997. Chronic bronchitis have decreased slightly with 27.6% in 1998. Number of strains isolated from patients before administration of antibiotics were more than those after administration of them in chronic bronchitis, but these were almost same number in bacterial pneumonia. Administration of antibiotics has changed the results of the frequency of isolation of bacterial species. Bacterial isolations before administration of antibiotics were as follows: S. pneumoniae 26.7%, H. influenzae 23.8%, S. aureus 13.3% and M. (B.) catarrhalis 10.8%. The frequencies of S. aureus decreased after antibiotics administration over 15 days, but the frequencies of P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) was not affected. The frequencies of P. aeruginosa was 45.5% after administration over 15 days. The frequencies of S. pneumoniae decreased upon administration of antibiotics, these were only 4.5% over 15 days. The frequencies of H. (
TI  - [Antibiotic therapy in cystic fibrosis. II Antibiotic strategy].
AB  - Antibiotherapy is one of the main treatments of cystic fibrosis, contributing to  a better nutritional and respiratory status and a prolonged survival. The choice of antibiotics depends on quantitative and qualitative analysis of sputum, bacteria resistance phenotypes and severity of infection. Haemophilus influenzae infection can be treated orally with the association of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid or a cephalosporin. Staphylococcus aureus generally remains sensitive to usual antibiotics; in case of a methicillin-resistant strain, an oral bitherapy or a parenteral cure can be proposed. Treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is different in case of first colonization or chronic infection: in first colonization, parenteral antibiotherapy (beta-lactams-aminoglycosids) followed by inhaled antibiotherapy may eradicate the bacteria; in chronic infections, exacerbations require parenteral bi-antibiotherapy (beta-lactams or quinolons and aminoglycosids) for 15 to 21 days, inhaled antibiotics between the cures being useful to decrease the number of exacerbation. A careful monitoring of antibiotherapy is necessary because of possible induction of bacterial resistance, nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of aminosids and allergy to beta-lactams.
TI  - [Clinical features and etiology of community-acquired pneumonia at a general hospital between 1994 and 1997].
AB  - To characterize the clinical features and etiology of recently encountered cases  of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), we carried out a hospital-based retrospective study of 120 episodes of CAP (115 patients) at Tagami Hospital, Nagasaki City between 1994 and 1997. We identified the causative pathogens in 55 episodes (50 patients) by sputum Gram stain and quantitative culture, for a determination rate of 45.8%. Streptococcus pneumoniae (17 episodes) and Haemophilus influenzae (15 episodes) were the primary causative organisms. It is noteworthy that two major nosocomial pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa; 5 episodes) and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; 2 episodes), were also identified as causative agents of CAP. These two pathogens were isolated from patients with severe underlying diseases and patients who had been repeatedly hospitalized. The incidence of CAP due to P. aeruginosa and MRSA is increasing because patients with respiratory colonization by these nosocomial pathogens are often followed up on an outpatient basis.
TI  - Respiratory tract pathogens isolated from patients hospitalized with suspected pneumonia: frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (United States and Canada, 1997).
AB  - Thirty-seven sentinel hospitals (29 in the United States [US]; eight in Canada) collected bacterial isolates from hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of pneumonia. The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of these pathogens were determined to more than 60 agents (40 reported) using the reference broth microdilution method described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The five most frequently recorded species among the 2757 isolates collected during the study were (no. tested/%): Staphylococcus aureus (632/22.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (498/18. 1%), Haemophilus influenzae (284/10.3%), Klebsiella spp. (240/8.7%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (213/7.7%). There was a significant difference in the susceptibility to antimicrobials between the US and Canada for S. aureus to oxacillin (50.1% versus 93.8% susceptible, respectively), gentamicin (78.7% versus 97.8%), and fluoroquinolones (49.5 to 53.0% versus 89.8 to 94.9%). Amikacin (92. 8% susceptible) was the most active antimicrobial agent against P. aeruginosa, and meropenem was the most potent beta-lactam. Against H. influenzae, most drugs retained a high level of activity, whilst against the S. pneumoniae, only the newer fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, sparfloxacin) remained highly effective in vitro. Only two antimicrobial agents (imipenem and meropenem) were >99% active against the Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp. isolated in this survey (possess extended spectrum beta-lactamases or hyperproduction of Amp C cephalosporins); cefepime (95.6-100.0% susceptible) was significantly more active than other cephalosporins tested. Clonal, epidemic outbreaks of multiply resistant strains were very rare in monitored hospitals. In conclusion, important differences exist between the US and Canada in the susceptibility patterns of some respiratory tract pathogens to commonly used antimicrobial agents with Canadian strains generally being more susceptible to currently available antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Respiratory pathogen colonization of the dental plaque of institutionalized elders.
AB  - Although it has been established that aspiration of pharyngeal bacteria is the major route of infection in the development of nosocomial pneumonia, colonization of the pharyngeal mucosa by respiratory pathogens has been shown to be a transient phenomenon. It has been suggested that the dental plaque may constitute an additional, possibly more stable, reservoir of respiratory pathogens. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of oral colonization by potential respiratory pathogens in a group of elderly (mean age = 75.9 yrs) chronic-care-facility residents (n = 28) and a group of age-, gender-, and race-matched outpatient control subjects (n = 30), with specific attention to plaque present on tooth, denture, and oral mucosal surfaces. Plaque scores on teeth and dentures were significantly higher in the chronic-care-facility (CCF) subjects than in the dental outpatient control (DOC) subjects (PII 2.3 vs. 1.2 and denture plaque 1.4 vs. 0.3). While no subjects in the DOC group were found to be colonized with respiratory pathogens (> 1.0% of the cultivable aerobic flora), 14.3% (4/28) of the CCF subjects were found to be colonized. Oral colonization with respiratory pathogens in CCF subjects was associated with the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and higher plaque scores. These results suggest that deficient dental plaque control and the presence of COPD may be related to respiratory pathogen colonization of dental plaque in chronic-care-facility residents.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - [Drug-resistant bacteria in clinical situations].
AB  - There are two major categories of drug-resistant bacteria that can cause severe and intractable infections. The first includes multi drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis(MDRMT), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae(PRSP), and beta-lactamase positive or negative ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, which used to be isolated from the patients with community-acquired infection. However, these pathogens have been often isolated in recent years from patients with hospital/chronic care facilities/nursing-home mass infection. The second major category includes methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus species(VRE), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacteriaceae including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases(ESBLs) producing strain, which are mainly isolated from compromised patients with nosocomial infections. The pathogenicity of these pathogens, almost all of which are found in the normal flora of humans, is weak, but often cause nosocomial infections in compromised patients. We need, therefore, surveillance system for these pathogens, and carefully determine whether these pathogens, if isolated, are causative pathogens.
TI  - [Descriptive study of infectious ear disease in relation to summer].
AB  - A descriptive study was made of infectious ear disease (including diffuse otitis  externa, otomycosis, acute-on-chronic otitis media, and superinfection of a radical mastoidectomy cavity) in relation to changes of weather and habits in summer. During the months of June, July, and August 1996, 179 patients were evaluated in the emergency room of the Alicante General University Hospital, Spain. Average patient age at presentation was 30.52 (+/- 20.08) years and 56% were men. The most frequent disease was diffuse otitis externa (78%) followed by acute-on-chronic otitis media (12%), otomycosis (8%), and superinfection of a radical mastoidectomy cavity (2%). The most frequently involved microorganisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa in diffuse otitis externa, Aspergillus niger and Candida in otomycosis, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus in acute-on-chronic otitis media. Patients were treated by cleaning detritus and secretions, usually followed by topical antibiotics for a maximum period of one week.
TI  - Stimulation of bacterial adherence by neutrophil defensins varies among bacterial species but not among host cell types.
AB  - Adherence of Haemophilus influenzae to bronchial epithelial cells is enhanced by  neutrophil defensins, which are released from activated neutrophils during inflammation [Gorter et al. (1998) J. Infect. Dis. 178, 1067-1078]. In this study, we showed that the adherence of H. influenzae to various epithelial, fibroblast-like and endothelial cell types was significantly enhanced by defensins (20 microg ml(-1)). Defensins stimulated also the adherence of Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis and nonencapsulated Streptococcus pneumoniae to the NCI-H292 cell line. In contrast, defensins did not affect the adherence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, encapsulated S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. These results suggest that the defensin-enhanced adherence might support the adherence and possibly persistence of the selected bacterial species using the respiratory tract as port of entry.
TI  - Bacterial pneumonia in hospitalized patients with HIV infection: the Pulmonary Complications, ICU Support, and Prognostic Factors of Hospitalized Patients with HIV (PIP) Study.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To describe the causative organisms and factors associated with bacterial pneumonia and to assess its impact on the outcome of hospitalized patients with HIV. DESIGN: Prospective, observational. SETTING: A university-affiliated medical center. METHODS: We included 1,225 consecutive hospital admissions, from April 1995 through March 1998, of 599 adults with HIV. We collected data on APACHE II (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II) score, leukocyte and CD4+ lymphocyte counts, length of hospital stay, ICU admission rate, and case-fatality rate. Chest radiographs and laboratory results were reviewed. The presence of bacterial pneumonia was noted. RESULTS: Bacterial pneumonia was diagnosed in 111 hospitalizations (9%): 80 (72%) were community-acquired infections. The CD4+ lymphocyte count was lower (median, 38 vs 66/microL, p = 0.0027), APACHE II score higher (17 vs 13, p < 0. 0001), length of hospital stay longer (median, 6 vs 4), and ICU admission (28% vs 9%) and case-fatality rates (21% vs 4%) higher in patients with bacterial pneumonia compared with those without bacterial pneumonia. The most common pathogen was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (32 admissions), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (22 admissions), Staphylococcus aureus (16 admissions), and Haemophilus influenzae (11 admissions). Thirty-three (30%) of the pneumonias were bacteremic. Bacteremia was more common in pneumococcal than in pseudomonal pneumonia (95% vs 9%, p < 0.0001). Compared with patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, patients with pseudomonal pneumonia had lower leukocyte and CD4+ lymphocyte counts, longer hospital stay, and similar case-fatality rate. CONCLUSIONS: P aeruginosa is becoming a common cause of both community-acquired and nosocomial bacterial pneumonia in hospitalized patients with HIV, especially in those with low leukocyte and CD4+ lymphocyte counts.
TI  - Phosphorylcholine decoration of lipopolysaccharide differentiates commensal Neisseriae from pathogenic strains: identification of licA-type genes in commensal Neisseriae.
AB  - Phosphorylcholine (ChoP) is a potential candidate for a plurispecific vaccine, because it is present on surface components of many mucosal organisms, including Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, ChoP has been detected on pili of Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In this study, we demonstrate the presence of the phosphorylcholine epitope on the lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) of several species of commensal Neisseriae (Cn), a property that differentiates commensal from the pathogenic strains of Neisseriae. In an extended survey of 78 strains, we confirmed the exclusive expression of the ChoP epitope on pili of pathogenic Neisseriae. Despite the presence of pili on Cn, which are homologous to Class II pili of N. meningitidis, they did not react with anti-ChoP antibody. This observation was further supported by the fact that 14C-labelled choline was incorporated only in the LPSs of Cn. Analysis of the LPS of N. lactamica strain NL4 revealed two distinct and interconvertible molecular species of LPS with high and low levels of reactivity with anti-ChoP antibody. In addition, on/off phase variation gave rise to frequent modulation in the levels of antibody reactivity. A concurrent modulation was also observed in the binding of C-reactive protein, CRP, a ChoP-binding reactant that is implicated in bacterial clearance. Genetic analysis showed the presence of a gene in several Cn spp. with significant sequence identity to H. influenzae licA. This gene encodes choline kinase and is also involved in phase variation of the LPS-associated ChoP in H. influenzae. In contrast, licA-like genes were not identified in the pathogenic Neisseria strains tested. They are absent from N. meningitidis strain Z2491 genome database. These data suggest that the genetic basis for ChoP incorporation in Cn LPS resembles that in H. influenzae spp. and may be distinct from that generating the ChoP epitope on pili of pathogenic Neisseriae. Further, the modulation of ChoP expression on Cn LPS, and corresponding modulation of CRP binding, has the potential to confer the property of immune avoidance and thus of persistence on mucosa.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial spectrum of a new broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, gatifloxacin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial spectrum of gatifloxacin was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent than comparator quinolones against staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci (gatifloxacin MIC90s, < or =1 mg/L, except 4 mg/L against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium). Gatifloxacin was two-fold less potent than ciprofloxacin, and the same as or two-fold more potent than ofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90s, 0.06-0.5 mg/L against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae and < or =1 mg/L against Proteus/Morganella spp.). Relative to the comparator quinolones, gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent against Providencia spp., and had good potency against Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90s, 0.25-1 mg/L). Gatifloxacin and ofloxacin had similar anti-pseudomonal potency, with corresponding MIC90s of 4, 8 and 0.25 mg/L for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas stutzeri, while ciprofloxacin had two- to eight-fold more potency. The three quinolones were equipotent against Burkholderia cepacia (MIC90s, 8 mg/L), but gatifloxacin was two-fold more potent against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90, 4 mg/L). Gatifloxacin was highly potent (MIC90s, 0.03-0.06 mg/L) against Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella spp., Helicobacter pylori and had at least eight-fold better anti-chlamydial and anti-mycoplasma potency (gatifloxacin MIC90s, 0.13 mg/L). The higher quinolone MICs for ureaplasma (MIC90s, 4-8 mg/L) may be due to the acidic pH of the ureaplasma test medium, which antagonizes quinolones. Like other quinolones, gatifloxacin had poor potency against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, though it was eight- to 16-fold more potent against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MIC90, 0.25 mg/L). Of the three quinolones, only gatifloxacin had activity against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile. In summary, gatifloxacin is a broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that is more potent than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria, chlamydia, mycoplasma, mycobacteria and anaerobes.
TI  - [In vitro activities of levofloxacin and other antibiotics against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In this study, the in vitro activity of levofloxacin (LVFX) against 1,020 fresh bacterial clinical isolates was compared with the activities of a range of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin (CPFX), ampicillin (ABPC), cefaclor, cefpodoxime, methicillin and benzylpenicillin. The clinical isolates except Vibrio cholerae were collected in Japan during 1998 from patients with infectious diseases. MICs were determined using the agar dilution method according to the recommendations by the Japan Society of Chemotherapy. Some isolates of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus were resistant to fluoroquinolones, but the MIC50 of LVFX against MRSA was 6.25 micrograms/ml. LVFX was the most active against MRSA among the antibiotics tested. Most of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. LVFX showed greater activity against all streptococci strains compared with fluoroquinolones tested. In particular, all Streptococcus pneumoniae strains including PRSP were susceptible to LVFX at < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. Among Enterococcus, ABPC showed superior activity against Enterococcus faecalis but many isolates of Enterococcus species were resistant to ABPC. LVFX was more active against to these Enterococcus species compared with other fluoroquinolones. On the other hand, LVFX and CPFX showed similar activity against isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. CPFX had an MIC50/90 of 0.20, 0.39 microgram/ml and LVFX showed an MIC50/90 of 0.78, 1.56 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. LVFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.20 microgram/ml) was more active against Acinetobacter species than CPFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.39 microgram/ml). Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella (Moraxella) catarrhalis and V. cholerae were inhibited by low concentration of the fluoroquinolones tested. The MIC90 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.10 microgram/ml against above three species. Some isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Campylobacter species were moderately resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested but the MIC50 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. Among anaerobes, Propionibacterium acnes was more susceptible than Peptostreptococcus species, and the MIC90 of beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones tested were < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. In conclusion, this study, performed on large number of strains, confirmed an excellent and wide spectrum antibacterial activity of LVFX compared with the fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams tested. And our results suggest that LVFX may be useful in the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and spectrum of the new glycylcycline, GAR-936 tested against 1,203 recent clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of GAR-936, a new semisynthetic glycylcycline, was evaluated in comparison with two tetracyclines and several other antimicrobial agents. A total of 1,203 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference broth or agar dilution methods. Among the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, GAR-936 was generally two- to four-fold more active than minocycline, and two- to 16-fold more active than tetracycline. All enteric bacilli MIC90 results were < or = 4 microg/mL; the exception being Proteus mirabilis and indole-positive Proteae (> or = 8 microg/mL). GAR-936 demonstrated excellent activity against all gram-positive cocci with 90% of the penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates inhibited at 0.03 microg/ml, while the same isolates had a MIC90 of 8 and > 8 microg/mL for minocycline and tetracycline, respectively. All Enterococcus spp., including vancomycin-resistant isolates, were inhibited at 0.25 microg/mL of GAR-936 (MIC90, 0.12 or 0.25 microg/mL). Although GAR-936 (MIC50, 0.25 microg/mL) was two-fold less active than minocycline (MIC50, 0.12 microg/mL) against oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, all isolates were inhibited at < or = 0.25 microg/mL. GAR-936 demonstrated good activity against nonfermentative bacteria such as Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90, 2 microg/ml) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90, 4 microg/mL), but the compound exhibited only modest activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC50, 8 microg/mL). Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 1-2 microg/mL), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.12 microg/mL), and various Neisseria spp. (MIC90, 0.12-0.5 microg/mL) were susceptible to GAR-936. These results indicate that GAR-936 has potent in vitro activity against a wide range of clinically important pathogenic bacteria, and that several gram-positive and -negative isolates resistant to older tetracyclines and other drug classes remain susceptible to GAR-936, the newest glycylcycline candidate for clinical use.
TI  - Bacteria-mucin interaction in the upper aerodigestive tract shows striking heterogeneity: implications in otitis media, rhinosinusitis, and pneumonia.
AB  - The mucociliary system of the upper and lower respiratory tracts is a critical nonspecific pathway for the elimination of bacteria and other particulate matter. The interaction between bacteria and purified mucin of the upper and lower respiratory tracts has been a major focus of our laboratory for the past decade. We have previously demonstrated that nontypable Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis adhere to human purified nasopharyngeal mucin and human middle ear mucin by a very limited number of specific outer membrane proteins. There have been no previous studies on the interaction of Streptococcus pneumoniae and purified mucin. Such information would be of extreme importance in identifying specific mechanisms of preventing colonization of this important pathogen to nasopharyngeal mucin. Using an overlay technique of purified radiolabeled mucins of the upper and lower respiratory tracts in a solid phase assay with 4 predominant pathogens of the upper and lower respiratory tracts, we found a striking heterogeneity of bacteria-mucin interaction. The implications of these interactions in the development of otitis media, rhinosinusitis, and lower respiratory infections are briefly discussed.
TI  - Pathogenesis of lung disease in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Lung disease in cystic fibrosis is primarily due to a defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulating protein (CFTR). This results in abnormal chloride transfer across epithelial membranes causing an excessively viscid mucus lining of the airways. Bacterial invasion particularly with Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa stimulates a vigorous and excessive primarily neutrophil-driven inflammatory response throughout the lungs. Products of this inflammation not only damage incoming bacteria but also the host tissue itself. Over a period of years this chronic suppurative process results in permanent ongoing lung destruction principally manifested as bilateral bronchiectasis.
TI  - High prevalence of antibiotic resistance of common pathogenic bacteria in Taiwan. The Antibiotic Resistance Study Group of the Infectious Disease Society of the Republic of China.
AB  - We analyzed the antimicrobial susceptibilities of all clinical isolates of 14 common pathogenic bacteria recovered from patients in eight medical centers in Taiwan during 1995 and 1996. Susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial agents was tested by the disk diffusion method as recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 59.3% and 62% were oxacillin-resistant in 1995 and 1996, respectively, whereas 63.2% of the coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates during the study period were oxacillin-resistant. The rate of penicillin-resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates was 39.7% in 1995 and 53.7% in 1996. Macrolide-resistance was found in 71.4%, 42.1%, and 46.7% of S. pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans streptococci, respectively, in 1996. Less than 2% of the enterococcal isolates were vancomycin resistant, but 77% of them were gentamicin resistant. Resistance to gentamicin was also common in Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Various degrees of resistance to ampicillin, piperacillin, cephalosporins, aztreonam, and ciprofloxacin were detected in Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii. More than 55% of Haemophilus influenzae isolates were ampicillin resistant. In summary, resistance to many antimicrobial agents in various common pathogenic bacteria is very common in Taiwan. Our results implicate that antibiotic resistance in the developing countries need to be monitored closely.
TI  - [In vitro activity of biapenem (BIPM) against clinically isolated respiratory pathogens in 1996-1998].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of biapenem (BIPM), a new carbapenem antibiotic, was compared with those of imipenem (IPM), panipenem (PAPM), meropenem (MEPM), ceftazidime (CAZ) and piperacillin (PIPC) against 280 isolates of 9 respiratory pathogens. The MIC90s of biapenem (BIPM) for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae were 0.12, 32, 0.25, 0.06, 4 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. In comparison with other antibiotics, the activity of biapenem (BIPM) for P. aeruginosa was as potent as meropenem (MEPM), but for H. influenzae it was slightly less than those of other antibiotics, and for other respiratory pathogens it was as potent as those of other antibiotics. The MIC90s of biapenem (BIPM) for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens were 0.06, 1, 1, 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively, and which were equal to or somewhat lower than those of other antibiotics. Biapenem (BIPM) showed strong activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, especially P. aeruginosa in general. Based on these results, biapenem (BIPM) is seemed to be highly useful antibiotic for the treatment of respiratory infections with several organism.
TI  - Gram-negative bacillary bacteremia in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV-infected children are particularly susceptible to serious bacterial infections including Gram-negative bacillary bacteremia (GNB). However, the information available on GNB in these children is limited. METHODS: Retrospective review of hospital charts of HIV-infected children with GNB diagnosed between 1980 and 1997. The association between bacteremic episodes, degree of immunosuppression, HIV severity, medical treatment and clinical outcome was assessed. RESULTS: Of 680 HIV-infected children, 72 (10.6%) had 95 episodes of GNB. Statistical analyses were restricted to data from the first episode. The mean age (+/-SD) at diagnosis of GNB was 2.5 +/- 2.7 years (median, 1.6). The predominant organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.4%), nontyphoidal Salmonella (15.3%), Escherichia coli (15.3%) and Haemophilus influenzae (12.5%). The relative frequency, per 5-year interval, of P. aeruginosa bacteremia steadily increased from 13% during 1980 through 1984 to 56% during 1995 through 1997. There were no cases of H. influenzae bacteremia after January 1, 1990. Eighty percent of GNB developed in children with AIDS and 72.2% developed in those with severe immunosuppression. Hypogamma-globulinemia and neutropenia were present in only 4.9 and 10.4% of first episodes, respectively. The overall case-fatality rate of GNB was 43.0%, and in children younger than 12 months it was 54.2%. CONCLUSIONS: A diagnosis of AIDS and/or severe immunosuppression was associated with increased risk of GNB, especially among younger children. Because of the high mortality of GNB, a broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy that effectively covers these organisms should be promptly instituted when bacteremia is suspected in HIV-infected children.
TI  - Prospective study of community-acquired pneumonia of bacterial etiology in adults.
AB  - The aim of this study was to prospectively analyze the bacterial etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in adults in Spain. From May 1994 to February 1996, 392 episodes of CAP diagnosed in the emergency department of a 600-bed university hospital were studied. An etiological diagnosis based on noninvasive microbiological investigations was achieved in 228 cases (58%); 173 of these diagnoses were definitive and 55 probable. Streptococcus pneumoniae, which caused 23.9% of the episodes, was the predominant pathogen observed, followed by Chlamydia pneumoniae (13.5%) and Legionella pneumophila (12.5%). Other less frequent pathogens found were Haemophilus influenzae (2.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.5%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (1.3%), Coxiella burnetii (1%), Moraxella catarrhalis (2 cases), Nocardia spp. (2 cases), and Staphylococcus aureus (2 cases). Streptococcus pneumoniae was significantly more frequent in patients with underlying disease and/or age > or =60 years (28% vs. 13%, P = 0.002), while Legionella pneumophila was more frequent in patients below 60 years of age and without underlying disease (20% vs. 9%, P = 0.006). Likewise, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila were the most frequent etiologies in patients requiring admission to the intensive care unit, occurring in 29% and 26.3% of the patients, respectively. In addition to Streptococcus pneumoniae, other microorganisms such as Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella spp. should be seriously considered in adults with community-acquired pneumonia when initiating empiric treatment or ordering rapid diagnostic tests.
TI  - In vitro activities of novel trans-3,5-disubstituted pyrrolidinylthio-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The in vitro activities of the novel 1beta-methylcarbapenems J-111, 225, J-114,870, and J-114,871, which have a structurally unique side chain that consists of a trans-3,5-disubstituted 5-arylpyrrolidin-3-ylthio moiety at the C-2 position, were compared with those of reference antibiotics. Among isolates of both methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS), 90% were inhibited by J-111,347 (prototype), J-111,225, J-114,870, and J-114,871 at concentrations of 2, 4, 4, and 4 microgram/ml (MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [MIC(90)s]), respectively, indicating that these agents were 32- to 64-fold more potent than imipenem, which has an MIC(90) of 128 microgram/ml. Although these drugs were less active in vitro than vancomycin, which had MIC(90)s of 1 and 2 microgram/ml for MRSA and MRCoNS, respectively, the new carbapenems displayed better killing kinetics than vancomycin. The potent anti-MRSA activity was ascribed to the excellent affinities of the new carbapenems for penicillin-binding protein 2a of MRSA. Since the new carbapenems also exhibited good activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria including clinically important pathogens such as penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Clostridium difficile, as well as MRSA, the novel carbapenems are worthy of further evaluation.
TI  - Topical antibiotics on tracheostoma prevents exogenous colonization and infection of lower airways in children.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients requiring long-term ventilation are at high risk of lower  airway infections, generally of endogenous development. Patients on long-term ventilation, in particular via a tracheostomy, may develop tracheobronchitis or pneumonia of exogenous pathogenesis, ie, caused by microorganisms not carried in the oropharynx. The frequency of exogenous colonization or infection has previously been reported to be as high as 33%. A prospective observational cohort study of 2 years was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of topical antibiotics in the prevention of exogenous colonization or infection of the lower airways. The antibiotic combination of polymyxin E and tobramycin in a 2% paste was applied four times a day on the tracheostoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 23 children (median age, 4.1 months; range, 0 to 215 months) were enrolled in the study from September 1, 1996, until August 30, 1998. Surveillance samples of the oropharynx were obtained before tracheostomy and thereafter twice weekly. Diagnostic samples of the lower airways were taken once weekly and on clinical indication. RESULTS: Fourteen children (61%) had a total of 16 episodes of tracheal colonization or infection with 20 potentially pathogenic microorganisms. Only one child had tracheobronchitis with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae during the 2-year study. Of the 16 colonization episodes, 12 (75%) were of primary endogenous pathogenesis, ie, caused by microorganisms present in the oropharynx at the time of tracheostomy. Community microorganisms including S pneumoniae, H influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus were the predominating bacteria. Three patients acquired nosocomial bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Hafnia alvei in the oropharynx, subsequently followed by secondary colonization of the lower airways. There was one failure of the prophylaxis: one patient (4%) had exogenous colonization with Pseudomonas pickettii. CONCLUSION: Topical antibiotics applied to the tracheostoma were found to be effective in reducing the exogenous route of colonization of the lower respiratory tract, compared with clinical experience and the literature. This promising technique requires further evaluation in randomized trials.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of lidocaine in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of lidocaine in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL(f))  was investigated. Clinical respiratory isolates were added to BAL(f) suspensions containing lidocaine and to normal saline. The growth of two of four isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae was significantly reduced in the presence of lidocaine-BAL(f) compared with controls in saline. Growth of Moraxella catarrhalis isolates was reduced in normal saline when compared with BAL(f) containing lidocaine. There was no effect upon the growth of Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans isolates. The recovery of isolates of S. pneumoniae may be reduced below the critical threshold of 10(5) cfu/mL during bronchoscopy when using lidocaine as a local anaesthetic.
TI  - Specific and rapid detection by fluorescent in situ hybridization of bacteria in  clinical samples obtained from cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - We report on the rapid and specific detection of bacteria commonly isolated from  clinical specimens from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). On the basis of comparative sequence analysis, we designed oligonucleotide probes complementary to species-specific 16S rRNA regions of these microorganisms and demonstrated the specificities of the probes by hybridization of different remotely related as well as closely related reference strains. Furthermore, in a pilot project we investigated 75 sputum samples and 10 throat swab specimens from CF patients by FISH and detected Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus within these specimens. The specificity of FISH was 100% in comparison to the results of conventional microbial culture. In contrast, the sensitivity of standard laboratory cultivation was moderately higher, since the limit for microscopic detection of bacteria within sputum samples by FISH was approximately 4 x 10(5) CFU/ml of sputum (resulting in a 90% sensitivity for FISH). Moreover, we demonstrated that FISH will be useful for the rapid detection of bacteria that cause acute pulmonary exacerbations in CF patients, as demonstrated in patients with H. influenzae, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa exacerbations. Therefore, FISH is a valuable additional method for the rapid and specific detection of bacteria in clinical samples from CF patients, in particular, patients with pulmonary exacerbations.
TI  - [Osteomyelitis of the frontal bone (Pott's puffy tumor). A report of 5 patients].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frontal bone osteomyelitis is considered to be rare but it may develop intracranial complications such as subperiosteal abscess that appears as a painful fluctuated forehead tumor (Pott's puffy tumor). METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively the clinical history of those patients showing frontal swelling tumour in our Neurosurgery and Infectious Diseases Departments between July 1994 and December 1997 and whose definitive diagnosis was cranial osteomyelitis. RESULTS: We reported five cases of patients who had been submitted to a neurosurgical operation between 9 months and 27 years ago. The main clinical features were intermittent painful frontal swelling episodes (with or without fever). These episodes were self-limited or limited after short trend of antibiotics. Imaging techniques were necessary for the diagnosis and especially in order to exclude intracranial complications (such as epidural abscess found in two patients). The ascertain diagnosis is made by debriding, histological studies and cultures from the material. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in three of the patients, Haemophilus influenzae in one patient and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the other one. All patients were treated with surgery and specific antibiotic therapy during twelve weeks minimum, being definitively cured. CONCLUSIONS: It is not well know the etiopathogenic mechanism concerning this rare disease. We remark the importance of a prompt diagnosis because of the high frequency of intracranial complications as well as combined treatment: surgery and long term antibiotic therapy (not less than 8 weeks), is necessary to cure the disease.
TI  - Bacterial pneumonia.
AB  - Bacterial pneumonia is significantly more common in persons who are HIV-infected  than in the general population and is most common among injection drug users and in persons with advanced HIV disease and immunosuppression. The clinical features of bacterial pneumonia are similar to those in HIV-seronegative persons, but bacteremia is more common. When a pathogen is identified, Streptococcus pneumoniae is consistently the most common, occurring in 20% to 70% of cases. Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and other gram-negative organisms are mainly responsible for the remainder of bacterial pneumonia episodes in the United States, Central Africa, Australia, and England. In some studies, Chlamydia pneumoniae was recognized as a common cause in persons with early HIV disease, whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa is recognized as a community- and hospital-acquired lower respiratory tract pathogen in patients with severe immunosuppression. Although antimicrobial therapy is frequently empiric, it should be tailored to the severity of illness, local prevalence of infections, resistance patterns, or when an etiologic agent is identified. The treatment response is similar in patients with and without HIV infection, but bacterial pneumonia may accelerate the progression of HIV disease. Preventative measures include use of the polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine, especially early in the course of HIV infection, when it is most likely to be effective. The incidence of bacterial pneumonia is also reduced in HIV-seropositive persons who use trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
TI  - Pathogenicity of microbes associated with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Cystic fibrosis patients are exceptionally prone to colonisation by a narrow spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. Since pulmonary infection presently, and for the foreseeable future, plays such a major role in CF lung disease, we review the microbes that are classically associated with CF and the virulence, inflammatory potential and resistance mechanisms which contribute to the reduction in life expectancy for colonised CF patients.
TI  - Comparison of conventional and molecular methods for the detection of bacterial pathogens in sputum samples from cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - The nature of the micro-flora present in sputa of six different cystic fibrosis (CF) patients was assessed using routine microbiological culture and molecular methods. Bacterial genes for the small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssu rDNA) were specifically amplified from DNA extracted from the sputum samples, cloned and characterised by hybridisation and DNA sequencing. A large number of clones from six sputa were screened. Initially, oligonucleotide hybridisation was performed with five probes, specific for Gram-positives and Gram-negatives in general and the main pathogens for the CF patient (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae). For a single sputum sample, the results were fully congruent when culture and molecular methods were compared. In the other five sputa, discrepancies for S. aureus and/or H. influenzae were documented. Although S. aureus DNA and H. influenzae DNA was detected in three and four sputa, respectively, strains could not be cultured. Although the PCR approach is not capable of distinguishing viable from dead bacteria, all of the CF patients had a history of S. aureus infections, while one of the CF patients once had cultivable H. influenzae in the sputum as well. A number of clones for probe-unidentified Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacterial species were further analysed by sequencing and additional potential pathogens were identified. Although routine culture of sputum frequently points to mono-specific exacerbations, our molecular data indicate that the other CF-related pathogens appear to be persistently present as well. We conclude that routine culture for bacterial pathogens from CF sputa yields limited microbiological information since it frequently fails to identify a number of pathogenic bacterial species that are potentially present in a viable status in the lungs of these patients.
TI  - A P5 peptide that is homologous to peptide 10 of OprF from Pseudomonas aeruginosa enhances clearance of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae from acutely infected rat lung in the absence of detectable peptide-specific antibody.
AB  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is an opportunistic pathogen associated with otitis media and the exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. This study reports the vaccine potential of three peptides representing conserved regions of the NTHi P5 outer membrane protein which have been fused to a promiscuous measles virus F protein T-cell eptitope (MVF). The peptides correspond to a region in surface loop one (MVF/L1A), the central region of loop four (MVF/L4), and a C-terminal region homologous to peptide 10 of OprF from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MVF/H3). Immunization of rats with MVF/H3 was the most efficacious in significantly reducing the number of viable NTHi in both the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (74%) and lung homogenates (70%), compared to control rats. Importantly, despite significantly increased rates of clearance, immunization with MVF/H3 elicited poor antibody responses, suggesting that cell-mediated rather than humoral responses play an important role in the enhanced clearance of NTHi in this model.
TI  - Aqueous and vitreous penetration of levofloxacin after oral administration.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of levofloxacin, an optical S-(-)isomer of ofloxacin, into the aqueous and vitreous humor after oral administration. DESIGN: Randomized, clinical trial comparing tissue levels of levofloxacin after one or two doses 12 hours apart. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five patients undergoing initial vitrectomy between February 1997 and June 1997 at the UIC Eye Center. METHODS: Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and later analyzed from 45 patients after oral administration of 1 500-mg tablet (group 1, 22 patients) or 2 500-mg tablets (group 2, 23 patients) 12 hours apart before surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Aqueous, vitreous, and serum concentrations of levofloxacin (micrograms/milliliter). RESULTS: Group 1 achieved mean aqueous, vitreous, and serum levels of 0.59 +/- 0.48 microg/ml, 0.32 +/- 0.34 microg/ml, and 4.34 +/- 3.59 microg/ml, respectively. Group 2 achieved mean aqueous, vitreous, and serum levels of 1.90 +/- 0.97 microg/ml, 2.39 +/- 0.70 microg/ml, and 8.02 +/- 3.14 microg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Mean inhibitory aqueous and vitreous MIC90 levels were achieved against a majority of ocular pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae (vitreous), Bacillus cereus (vitreous), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and most gram-negative aerobic organisms except Pseudomonas aeruginosa after two doses given 12 hours apart. Mean MIC90 levels were obtained in the vitreous for a majority of pathogens responsible for traumatic, postoperative, or bleb-related endophthalmitis.
TI  - The in-vitro activity and tentative breakpoint of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against a wide range (c. 700) of recent clinical isolates, was compared with that of three other fluoroquinolones and other relevant agents. Gemifloxacin inhibited 90% of the Enterobacteriaceae strains at 0.5 mg/L or less, exceptions being Serratia spp. (MIC(90) 1 mg/L) and strains possessing a putative mechanism of resistance to fluoroquinolones. Ninety per cent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 4 mg/L. Gemifloxacin had good activity against respiratory pathogens, with 90% of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis being inhibited by 0.06 mg/L or less. Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) were highly susceptible (MIC(90) 0.06 mg/L) but MRSA less susceptible (MIC(90) 8 mg/L) to gemifloxacin. Enterococcus spp. were markedly more susceptible to the study agent than to ciprofloxacin. Gemifloxacin showed good activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC(90) 0.5 mg/L) and anaerobic cocci. A tentative in-vitro breakpoint of 0.5 mg/L was studied using a 1 microg disc content for all genera except Pseudomonas where a 5 microg disc content was employed. The false sensitivity reporting rate was 0.5% and false resistance rate was 6.0%, which was considered acceptable. In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a highly active fluoroquinolone that should prove clinically useful in the treatment of a wide range of infections. Susceptibility testing criteria have been developed that should prove robust in a clinical laboratory.
TI  - Tentative minimum inhibitory concentration and zone diameter breakpoints for moxifloxacin using BSAC criteria.
AB  - Tentative MIC and zone diameter breakpoints were determined for moxifloxacin using BSAC criteria. An MIC breakpoint of < or =1 mg/L, denoting sensitivity, is suggested for Enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci, haemophili, moraxellae, pneumococci and enterococci. For pseudomonads high and low breakpoints of 4 mg/L and 1 mg/L are suggested to allow for an intermediate category of sensitivity. A 1 microg moxifloxacin disc content is suggested for testing all of the organisms previously mentioned, except pseudomonads, for which a 5 microg disc is needed to discriminate between the intermediate and sensitive populations. Corresponding zone diameter breakpoints for a 1 microg disc are > or = 20 mm for Enterobacteriaceae and staphylococci, 18 mm for the respiratory pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis) and 15 mm for enterococci. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a 5 microg disc, three bands are suggested for interpretation, that of > or = 25 mm (sensitive), 18-24 mm (intermediate) and < or = 17 mm (resistant).
TI  - [Development of beta-lactam antibiotic resistance in gram-negative bacteria and the impact of resistance on therapy].
AB  - Bacterial resistance to antibiotic is the inevitable consequence of the utilization of antimicrobial agents all over the world, particularly in developed countries. It is particularly evident with beta-lactam agents because they are among most frequently prescribed drugs. The resistance is mainly attributable to production of various types of beta-lactamases but other mechanisms like alterations in PBP molecules or in outer membrane proteins can play a significant role. Increased resistance can be seen among fastidious gram-negative bacteria like Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis. The percentage of M. catarrhalis isolates producing beta-lactamases has increased to over 90%. Among Enterobacteriaceae E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae pose a very serious problem because of the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases which confer resistance to third generation cephalosporins. The percentage of ampicillin resistant E. coli among hospital isolates has rosen to 78% in U.S.A. nowadays. Recently, the emergence of E. coli strain resistant to combination of amoxycillin and clavulanate, due to hyperproduction of TEM-1 beta-lactamase, was observed. Inducible beta-lactamases mediate beta-lactam resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa which often develops during therapy of P. aeruginosa infections. Imipenem resistance is increasingly prevalent among P. aeruginosa isolates nowadays, but can be detected in K. pneumoniae due to the production of novel beta-lactamases and changes in outer membrane proteins.
TI  - Terminal glycosylation in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common genetic disease for which the gene was identified within the last decade. Pulmonary disease predominates in this ultimately fatal disease and current therapy only slows the progression. CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR), the gene product, is an integral membrane glycoprotein that normally functions as a chloride channel in epithelial cells. The most common mutation, deltaF508, results in mislocalization and altered glycosylation of CFTR. Altered fucosylation and sialylation are hallmarks of both membrane and secreted glycoproteins in CF and the focus here is on these investigations. Oligosaccharides from CF membrane glycoproteins have the Lewis x, selectin ligand in terminal positions. In addition, two major bacterial pathogens in CF, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae, have binding proteins, which recognize fucose in alpha1,3 linkage and asialoglycoconjugates. We speculate that the altered terminal glycosylation of airway epithelial glycoproteins in CF contributes to the chronic infection and robust inflammatory response in the CF lung. Understanding the effects of mutant CFTR on glycosylation may provide further insight into the regulation of glycoconjugate processing as well as therapy for CF.
TI  - Surfactant protein D stimulates phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by alveolar macrophages.
AB  - Surfactant protein (SP)-D is an oligomeric glycoprotein belonging to the family of collagen-like lectins known as collectins, which have previously been shown to stimulate phagocytosis and other immune cell functions. The hypothesis investigated in this study was that SP-D would stimulate the phagocytosis of an important pulmonary pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. SP-D, isolated from the lavage fluid of silica-treated rats, significantly enhanced the uptake of three of six strains of P. aeruginosa by rat alveolar macrophages as analyzed by both fluorescence and electron microscopy. SP-D had only minimal effects on phagocytosis of Haemophilus influenzae. SP-D bound to live P. aeruginosa, and binding was inhibited by chelation of calcium and by a competing saccharide, inositol. In vitro killing assays demonstrated that macrophage-mediated killing of one of the mucoid strains of P. aeruginosa was modestly enhanced by SP-D. P. aeruginosa was not measurably aggregated by SP-D either macroscopically or microscopically. Further, SP-D does not appear to act as an activation ligand because adherence of macrophages to SP-D- coated slides did not stimulate the uptake of P. aeruginosa. These findings suggest that SP-D may be important in controlling the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa in the lung.
TI  - Diagnostic accuracy of oropharyngeal cultures in infants and young children with  cystic fibrosis.
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of oropharyngeal (OP) cultures relative to simultaneous bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures in very young children with CF, and to examine the effects of bacterial density, age, and study cohort on diagnostic accuracy. Respiratory culture data were analyzed from three independent, prospective studies involving simultaneous collection of 286 OP and BAL cultures from 141 children with CF <5 years of age. For predicting any growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) from the lower airway in subjects </=18 months of age (mean age, 8 +/- 5 months), OP cultures had a sensitivity of 44% (95% CI 14%, 79%), specificity of 95% (90%, 99%), positive predictive value of 44% (14%, 79%), and negative predictive value of 95% (90%, 99%). Diagnostic accuracy was similar for Haemophilus influenzae (Hi). Specificity was significantly lower for Staphylococcus aureus (Sa). Sensitivity for all organisms improved if a positive lower airway culture was defined as >/=10(3) or >/=10(5) cfu/mL. Specificity for Pa declined significantly with increasing age. In children with CF <5 years of age, the specificity and negative predictive value of OP cultures for Pa are high, while the sensitivity and positive predictive value are poor. Thus, in this age range, a negative throat culture is helpful in "ruling out" lower airway infection with Pa. However, a positive culture does not reliably "rule in" the presence of Pa in the lower respiratory tract. These findings may have implications for study design and interpretation as well as clinical management of young children with CF.
TI  - Bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in very young Filipino infants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pneumonia, meningitis and other serious infections are leading causes  of death in developing countries. As part of a multicenter study we aimed to determine the etiology of pneumonia, meningitis and other serious infections in a cohort of Filipino infants ages 90 days or younger. METHOD: During a 2-year period, 2053 infants age 90 days or younger presenting to 1 of 3 Manila community hospitals were screened; 873 had signs or symptoms suggestive of an infectious illness, and 608 were judged to have clinical features suggestive of severe infection and had laboratory workup including blood for culture and white blood cell count, nasopharyngeal aspirate for virology, cerebrospinal fluid culture when indicated and chest radiograph. Chest radiographs were read independently by 3 radiologists without knowledge of clinical findings. RESULTS: Of the 873 enrolled infants, 81 died (91%). After exclusion of presumed contaminants, positive bacterial culture from blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid was obtained in 35 infants (5.8%; 95% confidence interval 4%, 8%), 9 of whom died. The organisms responsible for meningitis were Acinetobacter spp. (4), Streptococcus pneumoniae (2), Escherichia coli (2), Enterobacter spp. (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), Haemophilus influenzae (1) and Staphylococcus aureus (1); those responsible for the other clinical diagnoses were Salmonella spp. (6), Enterobacter spp. (3), Streptococcus pyogenes (3), other Gram-negative organisms (8), S. pneumoniae (1) and Staphylococcus aureus (2). In 685 infants examined for viral causes of their illness, 223 viruses were isolated from 219 infants (32%; 95% confidence interval 28%, 36%). Enteroviruses were the most common potential pathogens identified (22% of infants studied), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (17%), rhinovirus (10%) and adenovirus (4%). Concomitant virus identification occurred in 10 of those with positive bacterial culture (29%; 95% confidence interval, 15%, 46%), with enterovirus being found in 7 of these cases. CONCLUSION: Many young Filipino infants with life-threatening illness were evaluated in this study. Thirty-five had infections attributable to bacteria, with Salmonella spp. being the most common, followed by Gram-negative organisms. Pneumococcus was an unusual cause.
TI  - Evolution of the bacteriologic features of persistent acute otitis media compared with acute otitis media: a 15-year study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To define the epidemiologic features of persistent acute otitis media (PAOM) and modifications of these features during the past 15 years and to investigate for possible differences in bacterial resistance between acute otitis media (AOM) and PAOM. DESIGN: Retrospective patient series. SETTING: Academic tertiary care center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Persistent acute otitis media was defined as AOM lasting longer than 3 weeks despite 1 or several courses of antibiotic therapy, with the persistence of clinical and otoscopic signs of AOM. From 1982 to 1997, 475 children with PAOM were seen in our department. Every patient had 1 or several specimens of aspirations or swabs of spontaneous otorrhea (or both). Microbiologic characteristics of the isolated strains (including antibiotic susceptibility) were analyzed. Four successive series of specimens were analyzed-group 1: from October 1, 1982, to June 30, 1986 (136 patients); group 2: from January 1, 1987, to December 31, 1989 (165 patients); group 3: from January 1, 1992, to April 30, 1993 (73 patients); and group 4: from January 1, 1994, to January 31, 1997 (101 patients). During the same study periods, the bacteriologic results of patients with AOM in the same geographic region were recorded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A longitudinal comparison between the groups of patients with PAOM and a cross-comparison within each group between patients with PAOM and those with AOM. RESULTS: Obtaining repeated and multiple specimens from patients with PAOM led to a progressive decrease in the rate of sterile specimens, from 35.3% (group 1, 48 patients) to 14.9% (group 4, 15 patients) (P<.01). During this period, the prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae increased in patients with positive culture results, from 18.2% (group 1, 16 of 88 patients) to 44.2% (group 4, 38 of 86 patients) (P<.001). These strains rapidly and dramatically became resistant to penicillin (amoxicillin) (0% through 1989, 76.2% [16 of 21 patients] in 1993, and 97.4% [37 of 38 patients] in 1996) (P = .01). The overall prevalence of Haemophilus influenzae remained stable (between 31.4% [27 of 86 patients] and 45.4% [40 of 88 patients]), but the proportion of beta-lactamase-producing strains increased from 30.0% (group 1, 12 patients) to 55.6% (group 4, 15 patients) (P=.04). The prevalences of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus did not vary significantly (from 23.1% [group 2, 30 patients] to 10.7% [group 3, 6 patients] and from 10.2% [group 1, 9 patients] to 4.6% [group 4, 4 patients], respectively). Comparing data from patients with PAOM with those with AOM revealed that the increased resistance of H influenzae and, in particular, of S pneumoniae was more rapid and more marked in patients with PAOM than in those with AOM (highest rate of resistance in AOM: 36.0% [271 of 753 specimens] and 50.6% [398 of 787 specimens] for H influenzae and S pneumoniae, respectively; P<.001 for S pneumoniae). CONCLUSIONS: The increase in bacterial resistance frequently encountered during otitis media is even more marked in patients with PAOM. The identification of the organism is essential when the otitis does not resolve, especially in patients with PAOM. Obtaining repeated specimens helps to decrease the rate of sterile cultures.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - Guidelines for severe community-acquired pneumonia in the western world.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, several guidelines (ATS 1993/IDSA 1998; ERS 1998; SWAB 1998) have been issued for the initial therapy of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. In patients who fulfil the criteria for severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP), it was advised to start with a macrolide (active against Legionella spp. and Mycoplasma pneumoniae) in combination with an agent active against both pneumococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by the ATS/IDSA guidelines, while the ERS suggested starting with a second or third generation cephalosporin, in combination with either a macrolide or second generation quinolon plus or minus rifampicin. In the SWAB guidelines, no recommendations for SCAP were made. METHODS: Sixty-two cases admitted to the intensive care units of a tertiary-care university hospital with SCAP between 1992 and 1996 were studied retrospectively. The causative pathogens, clinical and laboratory characteristics of severity, antibiotic therapy and mortality were analysed. Immunocompromised patients, patients using immunosuppressive agents and patients with a malignancy were excluded. RESULTS: Indices of severe illness were widely seen and 37% developed shock while 45% required vasoactive drugs. Bilobular or multilobular abnormalities were seen in 34% of the patients. Forty-five patients (73%) required artificial respiration and 54 (87%) had an underlying disease. The overall mortality was 42%. In 41 patients (66%), a pathogen was isolated. The most frequent causes of SCAP in this study were Streptococcus pneumoniae (22 cases or 35%), Haemophilus influenzae (seven cases or 11%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (four cases or 7%), and other Enterobacteriaceae (twice in combination with pneumococci and once with H. influenzae). Legionella pneumophila was identified in three cases. In patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumococci were the most important pathogens six cases or 27%), followed by P. aeruginosa (14%) and H. influenzae (14%). CONCLUSIONS: The guidelines for the management of SCAP issued by the ATS and IDSA in 1993 are only partially adequate in the Dutch setting. Coverage of P. aeruginosa would seem useful, given the fact that isolation of this pathogen has been shown to be a predictor of mortality, but only in patients with severe COPD or structural disease of the lung, and especially in patients in whom the Gram stain reveals Gram-negative rods, as is also suggested in the revised IDSA guidelines (1998). Risk factors for P. aeruginosa could be added to the ERS guidelines. Including SCAP as a separate entity in the SWAB guidelines may be useful.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of L4-mediated autogenous control of the S10 ribosomal protein operon.
AB  - We investigated the regulation of the S10 ribosomal protein (r-protein) operon among members of the gamma subdivision of the proteobacteria, which includes Escherichia coli. In E. coli, this 11-gene operon is autogenously controlled by r-protein L4. This regulation requires specific determinants within the untranslated leader of the mRNA. Secondary structure analysis of the S10 leaders of five enterobacteria (Salmonella typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii, Yersinia enterocolitica, Serratia marcescens, and Morganella morganii) and two nonenteric members of the gamma subdivision (Haemophilus influenzae and Vibrio cholerae) shows that these foreign leaders share significant structural homology with the E. coli leader, particularly in the region which is critical for L4-mediated autogenous control in E. coli. Moreover, these heterologous leaders produce a regulatory response to L4 oversynthesis in E. coli. Our results suggest that an E. coli-like L4-mediated regulatory mechanism may operate in all of these species. However, the mechanism is not universally conserved among the gamma subdivision members, since at least one, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, does not contain the required S10 leader features, and its leader cannot provide the signals for regulation by L4 in E. coli. We speculate that L4-mediated autogenous control developed during the evolution of the gamma branch of proteobacteria.
TI  - Differences in the pathogenesis of bacteria isolated from contact-lens-induced infiltrative conditions.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the ability of gram-negative bacteria isolated from the non-infectious condition contact-lens-induced acute red eye (CLARE) and infectious microbial keratitis (MK) to infect the eyes of mice. METHODS: One cornea of BALB/c mice was scratched with a needle and 5 x 10(6) bacteria applied. Bacterial types used were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Stenotrophomonas moltophilia and Aeromonas hydrophilia. The mice were killed after 1, 4 and 24 h and examined by slit lamp, histology and microbiology. RESULTS: CLARE strains were unable to infect the mouse corneas. The eyes inoculated with the CLARE strains had low levels of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) in the stroma. All eyes that had MK contained bacteria and large numbers of PMN after 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: The development of CLARE or MK is dependent on the type of bacteria with specific bacterial types being responsible for CLARE or MK.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1997)].
AB  - The bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout Japan, since 1981. Ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and analyzed some characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. Results obtained from these investigations are discussed. In these 17 institutions around the entire Japan, 512 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 440 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from October in 1997 to September in 1998. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 100 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 81 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 85 strains of Haemophilus influenzae. 71 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 27 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 33 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, 17 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. S. aureus strains for which MICs of oxacillin (MPIPC) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) accounted for 55.0%. The frequency of the drug resistant bacteria decreased comparing to the previous year's 67.3%. Arbekacin (ABK) and vancomycin (VCM) showed the most potent activities against MRSA. Imipenem (IPM) and panipenem (PAPM) of carbapenems showed the most potent activities with MIC80S of 0.063 microgram/ml against S. pneumoniae. The frequency of penicillin (PC)-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP)+PC-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) had decreased gradually, that is, in 1995 the frequency of it was 40.3%, but that was 30.9% in 1997. Against H. influenzae and M.(B.) catarrhalis, all the drugs showed good activities. But the sensitive strains of them against ceftazidime (CAZ) had decreased in 1997, compared those in 1995 and 1996. Meropenem (MEPM), IPM and tobramycin (TOB) showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid strains). And TOB and ciprofloxacin (CPFX) showed the most potent activities against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). All drugs except ampicillin (ABPC) were more active against K. pneumoniae in 1997 than that in 1996. Also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. The examination of age distribution indicated that the proportion of patients with ages over 70 years was 45.5% of all the patients showing a slight increase year by year. About the proportion of diagnosed diseases, not so particular changes were recognized as follows: Bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the most frequent with 33.6% and 29.1%, respectively. Number of strains isolated from patients before administration of antibiotics were more than those after administration of them in chronic bronchitis, but these had reversed in bacterial pneumonia. The tendency in bacterial pneumonia had been acknowledged since 1995. The increase of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid strains) isolated after administration of antibiotics, has suggested the decrease of the susceptibility of these strains against antibiotics. Administration of antibiotics has changed the results of the frequency of isolation of bacterial species. Bacterial isolations before administration of antibiotics were as follows: S. pneumoniae 24.5%, H. influenzae 21.4%, S. aureus 18.4% and P. aeruginosa 12.2%. The frequencies of S. aureus decreased after antibiotics administration over 15 days, but the frequencies of P. aeruginosa was not affected. The frequencies of P. aeruginosa was 47.8% after administration over 15 days. From patients administered antibiotics of penicillins and cephems. S. aureus was mainly detected with 31.7-58.3%, and from patients administere
TI  - Cystic fibrosis: an inherited susceptibility to bacterial respiratory infections.
AB  - Cystic fibrosis is a severe monogenic disorder of ion transport in exocrine glands. The basic defect predisposes to chronic bacterial airway infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia. The Pseudomonas infections in cystic fibrosis are a paradigm of how versatile environmental bacteria can conquer, adapt and persist in an atypical habitat and successfully evade defence mechanisms and chemotherapy in a susceptible host. Regular chemotherapy with aerosol and systemic antipseudomonal drugs has improved the course and prognosis of the disease, and research for effective vaccines is on the way.
TI  - Etiology of community-acquired pneumonia: impact of age, comorbidity, and severity.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and the impact of age, comorbidity, and severity on microbial etiologies of such pneumonia. Overall, 395 consecutive patients with CAP were studied prospectively during a 15-mo period. Regular microbial investigation included examination of sputum, blood culture, and serology. Sampling of pleural fluid, transthoracic puncture, tracheobronchial aspiration, and protected specimen brush (PSB) sampling were performed in selected patients. The microbial etiology was determined in 182 of 395 (46%) cases, and 227 pathogens were detected. The five most frequent pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (65 patients [29%]), Haemophilus influenzae (25 patients [11%]), Influenza virus A and B (23 patients [10%]), Legionella sp. (17 patients [8%]), and Chlamydia pneumoniae (15 patients [7%]). Gram-negative enteric bacilli (GNEB) accounted for 13 cases (6%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa for 12 cases of pneumonia (5%). Patients aged < 60 yr were at risk for an "atypical" bacterial etiology (odds ratio [OR]: 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2 to 4.5), especially Mycoplasma pneumoniae (OR: 5.3; 95% CI: 1.7 to 16.8). Comorbid pulmonary, hepatic, and central nervous illnesses, as well as current cigarette smoking and alcohol abuse, were all associated with distinct etiologic patterns. Pneumonia requiring admission to the intensive care unit was independently associated with the pathogens S. pneumoniae (OR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.3 to 4.7), gram-negative enteric bacilli, and P. aeruginosa (OR: 2.5; 95% CI: 0.99 to 6.5). Clinical and radiographic features of "typical" pneumonia were neither sensitive nor specific for the differentiation of pneumococcal and nonpneumococcal etiologies. These results support a management approach based on the associations between etiology and age, comorbidity, and severity, instead of the traditional syndromic approach to CAP.
TI  - Relationship between bacterial flora in sputum and functional impairment in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. Study Group of Bacterial Infection in COPD.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To investigate the possible relationship between functional respiratory impairment measured by FEV1 and isolation of diverse pathogens in the sputum of patients with exacerbations of COPD. DESIGN: Multicenter, cross-sectional, epidemiologic study. SETTING: Pneumology units in six secondary or tertiary hospitals in Spain. PATIENTS: Ninety-one patients with acute exacerbation of COPD were included. INTERVENTIONS: A quantitative sputum culture was performed, and bacterial growth was considered significant only when the germ was isolated at concentrations > 10(6) cfu (> 10(5) for Streptococcus pneumoniae) in samples with < 10 epithelial cells and > 25 leukocytes per low magnification field (x 100). RESULTS: Germs isolated were the following: Haemophilus influenzae (20 cases; 22%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 cases; 15%), S. pneumoniae (9 cases; 10%), Moraxella catarrhalis (8 cases; 9%), other gram-negative bacteria (7 cases; 7%), and non-potentially pathogenic microorganisms (non-PPMs; 33 cases; 36%). P. aeruginosa and H. influenzae were isolated more frequently among the patients with FEV1 < 50% than among those with FEV1 > 50% (p < 0.05). All patients with P. aeruginosa in sputum had FEV1 < 1,700 mL. FEV1 < 50% was associated with a very high risk of P. aeruginosa or H. influenzae isolation: the odds ratios (ORs) are 6.62 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 123.6) and 6.85 (95% CI, 1.6 to 52.6), respectively. Furthermore, active tobacco smoking was associated with a high risk of H. influenzae isolation (OR, 8.1; 95% CI, 1.9 to 43.0). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the greatest degree of functional impairment, as measured by their FEV1, presented a higher probability of having an isolation of P. aeruginosa or H. influenzae in significant concentrations in sputum during an exacerbation. The diagnostic yield of sputum in patients with an FEV1 > 50% was low, with a predominance of non-PPMs. Low FEV1 and active tobacco smoking are data that should be considered when establishing an empiric antibiotic treatment for exacerbated COPD.
TI  - Clinical effectiveness of levofloxacin in patients with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: the relationship with in-vitro activity.
AB  - The objective of this randomized, double-blind study was to compare the clinical  efficacy of levofloxacin at two different dosages with that of cefuroxime axetil in patients with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and, in particular, to assess the impact of the susceptibility to levofloxacin on the clinical findings. In total, 124 evaluable patients were treated for 7 days with oral levofloxacin 250 mg or 500 mg od, or cefuroxime axetil 250 mg bd. Sputum cultures were monitored pre-treatment, and at 1 and 7 days after the end of treatment. The susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates was tested by agar dilution in Columbia blood agar and by disc diffusion, but all other isolates were tested solely by the disc diffusion method. A greater number of infections were eradicated by levofloxacin than by cefuroxime axetil: infections were eradicated in 68% of patients receiving the 500 mg dosage and in 63% of those taking 250 mg levofloxacin, whereas the eradication rate with the comparator drug was much lower (48%). Against all pre-treatment S. pneumoniae isolates (n = 39), the MICs of levofloxacin were between 0.25 and 2 mg/L (geometric mean 0.95 mg/L), similar to those of the post-treatment strains (n = 32; mean 1.11 mg/L). All except one of the S. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to penicillin G (MIC < or = 0.06 mg/L), and the remaining isolate was inhibited by 0.5 mg/L of penicillin G, but was fully susceptible to levofloxacin. Some pretreatment strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant to levofloxacin, but many more resistant strains were encountered afterwards. All strains of Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible to levofloxacin in the disc diffusion tests. All the antimicrobial agents used in the study were well tolerated: only two patients discontinued treatment because of adverse drug effects. The results of this study indicated that, although there were some failures in patients with S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa infections, resistance to levofloxacin did not emerge rapidly among strains of S. pneumoniae during therapy with levofloxacin, and that natural resistance among pneumococci, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis was rare.
TI  - Susceptibility to levofloxacin of clinical isolates of bacteria from intensive care and haematology/oncology patients in Switzerland: a multicentre study.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the susceptibility of clinical isolates to levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone with extended activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and other antibiotics in 12 Swiss clinical microbiology laboratories using the NCCLS disc diffusion technique. Isolates were prospectively collected from intensive care units (ICUs (59%), oncology wards (7%) and other units with haematology/oncology patients (34%) from June 1995 to March 1996. The levofloxacin breakpoints used were as recommended by the manufacturer. A total of 310 Gram-positive and 580 Gram-negative isolates from the respiratory tract (36%), skin/wounds (12%), blood (16%), urine (17%) and other sources (19%) were tested. The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin was 100% for Enterococcus spp. (38 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (13), Streptococcus pneumoniae (65), Acinetobacter spp. (11), Citrobacter diversus (6), Citrobacter freundii (17), Klebsiella oxytoca (39), Morganella morganii (16), Proteus mirabilis (20), Proteus vulgaris (23), Serratia spp. (19), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (10) and Haemophilus influenzae (41). The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin for Staphylococcus aureus (95 strains, including 2% MRSA) was 94%, coagulase-negative staphylococci (85) 65%, Enterobacter spp. (75) 99%, Escherichia coli (111) 97%, Klebsiella pneumoniae (45) 98% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (124) 87%. In conclusion, levofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone to which the most common clinical isolates in Switzerland are susceptible. The susceptibility of Enterococcus spp. and S. pneumoniae to levofloxacin was particularly remarkable. This compound appears to be a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial activity of levofloxacin against hospital isolates: a multicentre study.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the activity of the fluoroquinolone,  levofloxacin, against hospital isolates of bacteria. MICs of levofloxacin were determined for 2154 strains by agar dilution. Breakpoints for susceptibility testing were calculated using the agar diffusion technique with 5 micrograms discs. The activity of levofloxacin against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae (n = 668) was higher (MIC50/90 0.06-0.12 mg/L) than previously reported for ofloxacin. As seen with other fluoroquinolones, this activity was reduced against nalidixic acid-resistant and pefloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains (MIC 1-8 mg/L). MICs for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 104) were between 0.12 and 128 mg/L. Levofloxacin had good activity against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 12; MIC 0.06-0.25 mg/L), but the activity was reduced against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-resistant strains (n = 80; MIC 1-32 mg/L). Haemophilus influenzae (n = 70), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 47) and Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 64) were inhibited by low concentrations of levofloxacin (MICs 0.016-0.03 mg/L, 0.03-0.12 mg/L) and 0.03-0.12 mg/L, respectively). Clostridium perfringens (n = 23; MIC 0.25-1 mg/L) was more susceptible than Bacteroides fragilis (n = 60; MIC 0.5-4 mg/L). Levofloxacin showed superior activity compared with ofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (n = 107; MIC 0.03-0.5 mg/L); the resistant strains (MICs 2-32 mg/L) were usually also resistant to methicillin. Levofloxacin was less effective against enterococci (n = 105; MIC 1-32 mg/L), but streptococci (n = 192) and pneumococci (n = 129), including 58 penicillin-non-susceptible strains, were inhibited by low concentrations (MICs 0.5-2 mg/L). According to the regression curve, zone diameters were usually 20-22 mm, 17-19 mm and 15-16 mm for MICs of 1, 2 and 4 mg/L, respectively. In conclusion, this study, performed on a large number of strains, confirms the superior anti-bacterial activity of levofloxacin compared with ofloxacin, especially against pathogens isolated from respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of levofloxacin against isolates of bacteria from adult patients with community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the activity of levofloxacin in comparison with a range of antibacterial agents against recent isolates obtained consecutively from patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB) during the period 1995 to 1996. Susceptibility testing was carried out by either microdilution or the Etest, and interpreted according to NCCLS breakpoints. The activity of levofloxacin was compared with that of amoxycillin, amoxycillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime, cefixime, erythromycin, roxithromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Clinically significant numbers of bacteria were recovered from 31 CAP and 94 AECB specimens. The predominant bacterial species in the CAP specimens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (21 isolates) and Haemophilus influenzae (four isolates). The AECB isolates mainly consisted of S. pneumoniae (38%), Moraxella catarrhalis (26%), H. influenzae (19%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%). The overall percentage susceptible of the isolates for each antibiotic was: amoxycillin, 64%; amoxycillin-clavulanate, 89%; cefuroxime, 87%; cefixime, 78%; erythromycin, 85%; roxithromycin, 87%; clarithromycin, 87%; azithromycin, 85%; ofloxacin, 95%; ciprofloxacin, 95%; and levofloxacin, 97%. The activities of levofloxacin and the other agents were also compared against 40 S. pneumoniae isolates, of which 20 were penicillin-non-susceptible, recovered from CAP and AECB specimens during the period 1994 to 1996. These strains were all susceptible to levofloxacin, but only 50% were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and 80% to ofloxacin. Twenty M. catarrhalis, 20 H. influenzae and 20 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates were also all susceptible to levofloxacin. Furthermore, 20 community-acquired P. aeruginosa isolates showed similar percentage susceptible rates to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. These in-vitro results suggest that levofloxacin may be useful in the treatment of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - [Chronic sinusitis in patients infected by HIV: therapeutic strategies].
AB  - Chronic sinus pathology is a frequently encountered disease in HIV infected patients. The responsible bacterial agents and management are yet to be settled. The authors report the results of a retrospective study led in the unit of Head and Neck Surgery of the University Hospital of Nice. 25 patients where HIV holders and had a sinus pathology which had lasted more than 6 weeks, despite one or several antimicrobial drug administrations. Clinical and CT scan data are detailed as well as pathology results of the samples harvested during sinus surgery (bacteria free 32%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 32%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 16%, Staphylococcus aureus 16%, Hemophilus influenzae 16%, anaerobic agents 16% and Toxoplasma gondii 4%). All patients underwent surgery (antral puncture with maxillary sinus drainage 17, functional endoscopic sinus surgery 8). Results where gathered at 4 months with 76% of relapse (100% in patients with less than 200/mm3 CD4 cells). In conclusion empiric antimicrobial drug therapy will be expected to be also effective on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the surgical management being most often deceiving and leading to relapse especially when considering the frequency of bilateral morbidity and the level of CD4 cell below 200/mm3.
TI  - [A consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-negative bacilli].
AB  - The results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare during the period of January 1993 to July 1995, were analyzed for typical Gram-negative bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. During these 3 years, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (FOM) and Citrobacter freundii. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (MINO). While Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (CMZ). However, these annual changes were almost negligible. Generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against Gram-negative bacilli. However, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. On the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST), CMZ, latamoxef (LMOX), gentamicin (GM) and amikacin (AMK) showed good activities against some of the Gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. In conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and accumulation of moxifloxacin in quinolone-susceptible  bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of moxifloxacin, compared with that of ciprofloxacin,  was determined for five strains of Staphylococcus aureus, including one NorA-overproducing strain, two quinolone-susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, four quinolone-susceptible strains of Haemophilus influenzae, and one strain each of quinolone-susceptible Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Moraxella catarrhalis. In addition, the accumulation of moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin by the NCTC type strain of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa was determined by a fluorescence method. For all strains, moxifloxacin accumulated to a lower concentration than ciprofloxacin. The concentrations of moxifloxacin accumulated ranged from 12 to 44 ng/mg dry cells. The lowest concentration was accumulated by S. pneumoniae NCTC 7465 and the highest concentration by S. aureus NCTC 8532. Increased expression of norA in S. aureus had no effect on the accumulation of moxifloxacin. Despite differences in the concentration of moxifloxacin accumulated by the different species, there was little difference between the MICs of this agent for each strain (0.06-0.5 mg/L), suggesting that the concentration accumulated by wild-type bacteria has little effect on the MIC.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of simple coumarins: structural requirements for biological activity.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a series of simple coumarins was evaluated against  8 microorganisms, including three Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) and five Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae), using the microdilution broth method. The coumarins tested showed broad diversity regarding growth inhibitory activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.9 to > 12.4 microM. This study, presenting the first systematic analysis of structure-activity relationships among this group of coumarins, revealed some interesting structural requirements. While coumarins with a methoxy function at C-7 and, if present, an OH group at either the C-6 or C-8 position are invariably effective against the spectrum of tested standard bacteria (Gram-negative microorganisms including the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus), the presence of an aromatic dimethoxy arrangement is apparently favourable against those microorganisms which require special growth factors (beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae). A combination of these structural features, two methoxy functions and at least one additional phenolic group as reflected by the highly oxygenated coumarins, identify promising candidates with antibacterial broad-spectrum activity.
TI  - Infectious exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: diagnosis and management.
AB  - Chronic bronchitis is an increasing cause of significant morbidity and mortality. Despite treatment, respiratory tract infection is the most common identifiable cause of death for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Repeated infectious exacerbations may ultimately cause acute and chronic lung injury. The most common bacterial aetiologies of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) include Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is often a nosocomial pathogen and is becoming more prevalent in patients with severe underlying disease. Viruses are responsible for approximately one-third of acute exacerbations overall. Atypical pathogens are causative pathogens in < 10% of episodes. The diagnosis of AECB is often based on clinical impression, although suspicion of bacterial infection can be enhanced by quantitative Gram's stains from appropriately obtained sputum specimens. However, a specific microbiological diagnosis is only needed in certain specific situations. Management of AECB involves non-drug interventions (e.g. smoking cessation) and antibiotic treatment. Recommendations for antibiotic use in patients with known or highly suspected AECB are still evolving. The selection of an antibiotic for treatment of an infectious episode must consider underlying patient co-morbidities, likely pathogens, resistance issues and individual antibiotic properties. Cephalosporins, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations and macrolides are all reasonable choices. However, due to the increasing prevalence of resistance to standard antibiotics among common respiratory pathogens, and increased incidence of Pseudomonas spp., fluoroquinolones should be a first-line treatment for AECB in patients who have chronic bronchitis complicated by co-morbid illness, severe obstruction (FEV1 < 50%), old age (> 65 years) or have recurrent exacerbations. In patients who do not have these risk factors (i.e. those with simple chronic bronchitis), agents such as co-trimoxazole remain useful.
TI  - The global epidemiology of resistance to ciprofloxacin and the changing nature of antibiotic resistance: a 10 year perspective.
AB  - Many studies have examined the in-vitro activity of ciprofloxacin. The results are for the most part encouraging but we must guard against complacency. Levels of ciprofloxacin resistance vary geographically, while some predictably difficult-to-treat organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii present challenges globally. The emergence of resistance in species previously exquisitely sensitive to ciprofloxacin, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, in countries associated with 'pirate' production and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials represents a major challenge. Ciprofloxacin continues to show excellent activity against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catharralis. In general, ciprofloxacin shows good activity against Enterobacteriaceae although the emergence of reduced susceptibility and, sometimes, quinolone resistance in multi-resistant isolates should be noted.
TI  - [In vitro activities of 23 antimicrobial agents against 4,993 gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains isolated from multicenter of Japan during 1994--in vitro susceptibility surveillance.Levofloxacin-Surveillance Group].
AB  - In a surveillance study conducted during 1994 at 24 medical institutes from different geographical areas of Japan, the susceptibility of clinical isolates to twenty three comparative agents, such as ofloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, ampicillin, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin, oxacillin, piperacillin, cefaclor, cefotiam, cefdinir, cefclidin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, imipenem, aztreonam, vancomycin, minocycline, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, amikacin, and gentamicin, were tested by the standard broth micro-dilution method. A total of 4,993 isolates tested in this study included Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), coagllase negative streptococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobactericeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa from patients with urinary tract infections or respiratory tract infections, and Haemophilus influenzae. For MSSA, S. pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae, and H. influenzae, more than 70% of the isolates was susceptible to fluoloquinolones. However, resistance occurred in more than 50% of MRSA and P. aeruginosa isolated from UTI. Fluoroquinolones were found to be effective against high level penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, the third generation cephem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae.
TI  - Killed whole bacterial cells, a mucosal delivery system for the induction of immunity in the respiratory tract and middle ear: an overview.
AB  - Infectious diseases remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with mucosal membranes being the most frequent portals of entry of pathogenic micro-organisms. This has prompted studies aimed at the development of vaccination protocols that would lead to an increased protection of mucosae through an understanding of the common mucosal immune system as an immune communication network between mucosal sites. Recent studies have suggested that preferential sub-networks exist within the system and these studies have exploited the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT)-lung sub-network in the development of oral vaccine strategies for infections of the respiratory tract and middle ear. Mucosal immunization with whole formalin killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), Branhamella catarrhalis, nontypable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) or Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) results in enhanced homologous bacterial clearance from the lung of immune animals challenged with live bacteria. These studies have been extended to the middle ear where similar results have been observed for NTHi and Spn. Mechanisms responsible for inducing enhanced bacterial clearance from the airways include opsonising antibody, antigen specific CD4+ T helper cells, cytokine responses and recruitment of activated polymophonuclear neutrophils. The mechanisms induced by immunization which stimulates the immune system to rapidly mobilise both innate and specific immune responses during infection are the subject of ongoing research.
TI  - Topical ofloxacin versus systemic amoxicillin/clavulanate in purulent otorrhea in children with tympanostomy tubes.
AB  - Acute otitis media (AOM) in children with tympanostomy tubes in place typically presents with otorrhea (draining ear). Because therapy is not standardized, various topical and systemic antibiotics of unproven efficacy and safety have been used in this indication. This study compared the safety and efficacy of ofloxacin otic solution, 0.3% (OFLX) with that of Augmentin oral suspension (AUG) in pediatric subjects 1-12 years of age with tympanostomy tubes and acute purulent otorrhea. Subjects were randomized to receive 10d of OFLX, 0.25 ml topically bid, or of AUG, 40 mg/kg per day. Audiometry was performed in subjects > or =4 years of age. Overall cure rate for clinically evaluable subjects was 76% with OFLX (n = 140) and 69% with AUG (n = 146; P = 0.169). Overall eradication rates for OFLX and AUG were similar for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis and were superior with OFLX for Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P<0.05 for both). OFLX had a greater overall pathogen eradication rate (96% vs. 67%; P<0.001). Treatment-related adverse event rates were 31% for AUG and 6% for OFLX (P<0.001). Neither treatment significantly altered hearing acuity. Topical ofloxacin 0.3% otic solution 0.25 ml bid was as effective and better tolerated than systemic therapy with Augmentin oral suspension 40 mg/kg per day in treating AOM in children with tympanostomy tubes.
TI  - Korean Nationwide Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance of bacteria in 1997.
AB  - Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are known to be prevalent in tertiary-care hospitals in Korea. Twenty hospitals participated to this surveillance to determine the nationwide prevalence of resistance bacteria in 1997. Seven per cent and 26% of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were resistant to 3rd-generation cephalosporin. Increased resistance rates, 19% of Acinetobacter baumannii to ampicillin/sulbactam, and 17% of Pseudomonas aeruginoa to imipenem, were noted. The resistance rate to fluoroquinolone rose to 24% in E. coli, 56% in A. baumannii and 42% in P. aeruginosa. Mean resistance rates were similar in all hospital groups: about 17% of P. aeruginosa to imipenem, 50% of Haemophilus influenzae to ampicillin, 70% of Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin, and 70% of pneumococci to penicillin. In conclusion, nosocomial pathogens and problem resistant organisms are prevalent in smaller hospitals too, indicating nosocomial spread is a significant cause of the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria in Korea.

TI  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa fur overlaps with a gene encoding a novel outer membrane lipoprotein, OmlA.
AB  - A novel outer membrane lipoprotein in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is encoded by the omlA gene, which was identified immediately upstream of the fur (ferric uptake regulator) gene. The omlA and fur genes were divergently transcribed and had overlapping promoter regions. The proximal fur P2 promoter and the omlA promoter shared a 5-bp DNA motif for their -10 promoter elements. The distal fur P1 promoter was located within the omlA coding sequence, and the omlA and fur T1 mRNAs overlapped by 154 nucleotides. Optimal expression of both fur and omlA required roughly 200 bp of DNA upstream of the promoter regions, suggesting the presence of cis-acting transcriptional activation elements located within the omlA and fur genes, respectively. The levels of Fur and OmlA proteins had no influence on omlA or fur expression, excluding any trans-acting cross-regulation between fur and omlA. Expression of omlA was constitutive regardless of growth phase, oxygen tension, iron concentration, pH, and temperature. OmlA contained a signal sequence typical of bacterial lipoproteins, with a cysteine as a putative cleavage and lipid attachment site. Inhibition of signal peptidase II by globomycin resulted in failure to process OmlA, thus giving strong evidence that OmlA is a lipoprotein. Cell fractionation followed by Western blot analysis indicated that all OmlA protein is localized in the outer membrane. Mature OmlA was an acidic (pI = 4. 5) protein of 17.3 kDa and had close to 40% amino acid sequence identity to SmpA (small protein A) of Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, and Haemophilus influenzae, a protein of unknown function. All P. aeruginosa strains tested as well as Pseudomonas fluorescens were found to produce OmlA. A mutant strain with impaired production of OmlA but no change in the expression of the overlapping fur gene was constructed. The omlA mutant was hypersusceptible to anionic detergents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate and deoxycholate, and it showed increased susceptibility to various antibiotics, including nalidixic acid, rifampin, novobiocin, and chloramphenicol. A structural role of OmlA in maintaining the cell envelope integrity is proposed.
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in Taiwan. Meropenem was active against most Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis. For many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. It is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. It is uncommon for these common bacteria, except MRSA and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in Taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.
TI  - The role of anaerobes in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia: a prospective study.
AB  - CONTEXT: Aspiration of oropharyngeal material, with its high concentration of anaerobic bacteria, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of both ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonitis (AP). Consequently, patients with these disorders are usually treated with antimicrobial agents with anaerobic activity. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of anaerobic bacteria in patients with VAP and AP. DESIGN: Prospective, nonrandomized, interventional study. SETTING: University-affiliated community teaching hospital. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: We performed sequential blind protected specimen brush (PSB) sampling and mini-BAL in 143 patients with 185 episodes of suspected VAP and 25 patients with AP who required mechanical ventilation. Quantitative aerobic and anaerobic cultures were performed on all specimens. Pneumonia was considered to be present when either > 500 cfu/mL cultured from blind PSB sampling or > 5,000 cfu/mL cultured from mini-BAL were present. RESULTS: Using the predefined criteria, bacterial pneumonia was diagnosed in 63 of 185 suspected VAP episodes (34%) and 12 of 25 patients with AP (48%). At least one dose of an antibiotic was given in the 24 h prior to bacteriologic sampling in 106 suspected VAP episodes (57%) and in 12 patients with AP (48%). More than one pathogen was isolated from 11 VAP and four AP patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and enteric Gram-negative organisms were isolated most frequently from patients with VAP. In the patients with AP, enteric Gram-negative organisms were isolated in patients with GI disorders and Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae predominated in patients with "community-acquired" aspiration. Only one anaerobic organism was isolated from the entire group of patients; Veillonella paravula was isolated from a blind PSB specimen in a patient with suspected aspiration pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Despite painstaking effort, we were able to isolate only one anaerobic organism (nonpathogenic) from this group of patients. The spectrum of aerobes in patients with VAP was similar to that reported in the literature. The organisms found in patients with AP was a reflection of the organisms likely to colonize the oropharynx. The use of antibiotics with anaerobic coverage may not be necessary in patients with suspected VAP and AP. Furthermore, penicillin G and clindamycin may not be the antibiotics of choice in patients with AP.
TI  - [Epidemiology of sinusitis seen in hospitalized patients. Apropos of 77 episodes  of sinusitis among 72 patients between 1993 and 1996].
AB  - The 77 cases of sinusitis seen in 72 patients admitted to the Briancon Hospital between January 1, 1993, and June 30, 1996, were studied. One or both maxillary sinuses were involved in 96.8% of cases. Sinus aspiration was done in 95 cases. All aspirates were subjected to microbiological studies. Of the 45 aspirates that yielded positive cultures, 36 grew one or more pathogenic organisms. The most commonly isolated bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 7), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 5), and Haemophilus influenzae (n = 5). Nosocomial sinusitis defined on a set of criteria including hospital stay duration at onset and an acute tempo of evolution contributed 32.5% of cases overall, 55.2% in the intensive care unit and 18.7% in all other departments combined. Nosocomial cases in the intensive care unit were associated with well-known risk factors, namely tracheal intubation with ventilation and presence of a nasogastric tube. Other study criteria included the type of organism recovered by culture and whether patients ventilated via a tracheal tube had the same organism in their sinus and tracheal tube aspirates. Some nonintensive care patients had none of the known risk factors for sinusitis; prompt diagnosis and treatment of these cases of sinusitis is important to avoid infectious complications, which are, however, less common than in intensive care patients.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the urine of children with urinary tract infections from 1986 to 1995].
AB  - In adults and in children urinary system infections are mostly caused by gram-negative and rarely by gram-positive bacteria. Of gram-negative bacteria the most frequent cause of infections are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Serratia etc., and of gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus agalactiae. In rare cases the cause of infection may also be Pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to investigate the sensitivity to antibiotics of gram-negative bacteria as the predominant cause of urinary infections. METHOD OF THE STUDY: We isolated 20,615 bacterium species from urine of children hospitalized or treated as outpatients at the University Children's Hospital in Belgrade. Urine was collected classically, i.e. by taking the second clean stream into a sterile test tube or by Uricult test. The samples were cultured on blood plates and endo-agar. Identification was done by standard bacteriologic methods and when findings were dubious API-20E (bioMerieux) was used. Bacterium sensitivity to nine antibiotics (ampicillin, cephalexin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, amikacin, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin) was assessed with disc diffuse method on Muller-Hinton agars. RESULTS: Based on the obtained results, Escherichia coli species sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin ranged from 90 to 100%; sensitivity to co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol ranged from 70 to 80%, to cephalexin from 50 to 60%, while to ampicillin it was only 20%. Klebsiella species sensitivity to nalidixic acid and cefotaxime was 70-85%; to amikacin, cefotaxime, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin 60-80%; to cephalexin and chloramphenicol 40-50%, and to ampicillin only 5-15%. Proteus species showed sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime and nalidixic acid of 90-95%; to co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol 70-80%; to cephalexin and ampicillin 40-50%, and to nitrofurantoin 10%. Pseudomonas aeruginosa species showed the highest level of sensitivity to amikacin (40-50%), and somewhat lower to gentamicin (10-40%), and a very low sensitivity to other antimicrobial drugs (10-25%). DISCUSSION: It may be noted from the above data that gram-negative bacteria are the cause of urinary infections in about 90% of cases, while gram-positive bacteria are the cause in only 10%, which is in accordance with data from literature. Of all antibiotic drugs ampicillin (a wide spectrum penicillin) had a very significant role in the therapy of urinary infections. However, the long-term usage of ampicillin led to increased resistance to the drug in infections caused by Escherichia coli. Natural resistance to ampicillin of Klebsiella species limited its usage when penicillin was first introduced. Proteus mirabilis species, especially those isolate in primary infection, are often sensitive to amino penicillin. Contrary to Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus and Providentie species show a high resistance to these antibiotics. Due to the crisis in our country and the lack of other antibiotics, ampicillin was widely used. The wide use of the drug caused evident resistance of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis to this antibiotic. A fall in the sensitivity of Klebsiella to cephalexin, gentamicin, amikacin and co-timoxazole, which occurred in 1992, has been explained by intrahospital circulation of multiresistant Klebsiella species. The sensitivity of isolated gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most prominent to aminoglycosides (amikacin and gentamicin). The most frequent mechanism of enterobacterial resistance to trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole involves dihydrofolate reductase enzyme. Comparative studies related to the administration of co-trimoxazole have shown that the difference in the efficacy between thes
TI  - Septic arthritis of the hand and wrist.
AB  - Septic arthritis of the hand and wrist is relatively uncommon. The most common cause is penetrating trauma such as a human or animal bite. The most common causative organism is Staphylococcus aureus. Septic arthritis caused by Streptococcal species. Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia species, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pasteurella multocida, Eikenella corrodens, and Mycobacterium marinum also may occur in specific clinical settings. The best clinical results occur following an accurate diagnosis, prompt surgical drainage, and debridement in concert with appropriate antibiotics and early postoperative range of motion. A delay in diagnosis or treatment is associated with an unsatisfactory outcome.
TI  - The identification of response regulators of Branhamella catarrhalis using PCR.
AB  - Potential response regulator gene fragments from the genome of Branhamella (Moraxella) catarrhalis were isolated by PCR using degenerate oligonucleotide primers. DNA sequence analysis of several cloned PCR products with similar restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) patterns revealed that the cloned gene fragment had significant homology to members of the OMPR sub-family of response regulator genes, including 61% identity with the phoB gene of Haemophilus influenzae. The derived amino acid sequence showed greatest similarity to the PhoB response regulator protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Characterisation of this phoB homologue and of other response regulators identified in this study should provide new knowledge of the physiology and pathogenic mechanisms of B. catarrhalis.
TI  - The effect of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection on clinical parameters in steady-state bronchiectasis.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection on clinical parameters in Chinese patients with noncystic fibrosis and steady-state bronchiectasis. DESIGN: Prospective, cross-sectional clinicomicrobiological study with informed consent. SETTING: Consecutive outpatient recruitment from a specialist bronchiectasis respiratory clinic. PATIENTS: Outpatients (n = 100; 62 women; 55.1+/-16.7 years old; FEV1/FVC 1.4+/-0.7/2.1+/-0.9 L), who had stable respiratory symptoms for more than 3 weeks. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Respiratory pathogens isolated from the sputum were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (33), Haemophilus influenzae (10), Moraxella catarrhalis (2), other Gram-negative bacilli (5), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), Staphylococcus aureus (5), mycobacteria (3), and yeast (1). Clinical parameters in patients with positive isolation of P aeruginosa were compared with those without the organism in the sputum culture (non-P aeruginosa). In the P aeruginosa group, the FEV1/FVC ratio and sputum volume were lower (p < 0.005) and higher (p < 0.0001), respectively, than those of the non-P aeruginosa group. The FEV1/FVC ratio (< 60%) and sputum volume (grading > 5) were independently associated with a positive sputum isolation of P aeruginosa with odds ratios of 3.1 (confidence interval [CI] 1.2 to 8.4; p < 0.01) and 4.7 (CI 1.6 to 13.3; p < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: P aeruginosa is the predominant respiratory pathogen isolated in the sputum of Chinese patients with steady-state bronchiectasis, and its isolation is associated with high sputum output (> or = 75th quartile) and moderately severe airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC < 60%).
TI  - Community-acquired septicaemia in southern Viet Nam: the importance of multidrug-resistant Salmonella typhi.
AB  - In a prospective study conducted between mid 1993 and 1994, 437 adults and children were admitted with community-acquired septicaemia to an infectious diseases hospital in southern Viet Nam. Gram-negative aerobes accounted for 90% of isolates and were predominantly Salmonella typhi (67%), Sal. para-typhi A (3%), Escherichia coli (10%), and Klebsiella spp. (5%). Other Salmonella spp. (1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1%), Neisseria meningitidis (0.5%) and Haemophilus influenzae (0.2%) were uncommon. Staphylococcus aureus (5.5%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (2%) were the most common Gram-positive isolates. Patients with enteric fever were younger (median age 16 years, range 1-63) than the other patients (median age 43 years, range 1-88) (P < 0.001) and had a lower mortality rate (0.3% vs. 23%; relative risk 69.5, 95% confidence interval 9.5-507.8; P < 0.0001). Over 70% of the Sal. typhi isolated were multi-drug-resistant, and 4% were resistant to nalidixic acid. Multidrug-resistant Sal. typhi is a major cause of community-acquired septicaemia in Viet Nam.
TI  - [Other infections (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas  aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Nocardia asteroides, Rhodococcus equi and Bartonella spp.)].
AB  - People infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are at increased risk for bacterial infections due to HIV-associated immunologic defects. Bacterial infections were found to be, both a predictor of progression to AIDS and a substantial cause of mortality in pre-AIDS stages. Most bacterial infections are caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Rhodococcus equi, Nocardia spp., Campylobacter spp. and Bartonella spp. are less common. Data derived from two AIDS Clinical Trials Group studies showed that the most common bacterial infections were sinusitis (8.5 per 100 episodes per person years [py]), bacterial pneumonia (5.0 per 100 py), bronchitis (4.1 per 100 py) and soft tissue infections (3.5 per 100 py). In this review clinical characteristics and treatment recommendations according to data available in the literature for these infections are summarized.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates from otitis media and otitis externa].
AB  - In order to evaluate the annual changes of susceptibility, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ofloxacin (OFLX) and 4 control drugs were determined against clinical isolates that were obtained from patients with otitis media and otitis externa during the periods between January and December 1993, and the periods between October 1996 and March 1997. The results are summarized as follows: 1. No annual changes were seen for MIC50 of OFLX, but MIC80 and MIC90 of that rose against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from 1993 to 1996. It appears that resistance to OFLX is increasing among these bacteria. Detection frequency of highly resistant strains to OFLX (MIC > 100 micrograms/ml) was lower than to other control drugs. 2. No annual changes were seen of MIC50, MIC80 and MIC90 of OFLX against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), Streptococcus spp., Proteus spp. and Haemophilus influenzae. OFLX showed strong antimicrobial activities against these bacteria. 3. Since there was no large annual changes in the antimicrobial activity of OFLX against clinical isolates that were obtained from patients with otitis media and otitis externa, OFLX otic solution was considered as one of the clinically useful drugs even now.
TI  - An ampD gene in Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes a negative regulator of AmpC beta-lactamase expression.
AB  - The ampD and ampE genes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 were cloned and characterized. These genes are transcribed in the same orientation and form an operon. The deduced polypeptide of P. aeruginosa ampD exhibited more than 60% similarity to the AmpD proteins of enterobacteria and Haemophilus influenzae. The ampD product transcomplemented Escherichia coli ampD mutants to wild-type beta-lactamase expression.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of high dose intravenous ciprofloxacin in the treatment of bacterial pneumonia. Italian Ciprofloxacin Study Group.
AB  - One hundred and fifty three hospitalized patients were enrolled in an open, prospective, multi-center study on the efficacy and safety of intravenous ciprofloxacin (400 mg i.v., b.i.d.) for acute bacterial pneumonia: 93 (63%) patients were valid for efficacy out of 148 valid for intention-to-treat analysis. The most commonly isolated organisms from 93 valid-for-efficacy patients were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17%), Haemophilus influenzae and parainfluenzae (17%), Streptococcus aureus (14%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (11%). Cure was achieved in 89/93 (95.7%) valid-for-efficacy patients; effective eradications were obtained in 42 (45%) and presumed eradications in 48 (52%) of the 93 patients. Mild or moderate adverse events (AE) occurred in 13/153 (8.5%) patients assessable for safety; all but one AE were rapidly reversible and only one treatment-stop (0.65%) was decided. The treatment of acute bacterial pneumonias with high-dose parenteral ciprofloxacin appears to be efficacious and well tolerated.
TI  - Etiology, susceptibility, and treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of complicated chronic bronchitis in the primary care setting: ciprofloxacin 750 mg b.i.d. versus clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. Bronchitis Study Group.
AB  - Although controversial, antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) appears beneficial in patients with a history of repeated infections, those who have comorbid illnesses, and those with marked airway obstruction. In a community-based, open, randomized trial, the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin (CIP) 750 mg and clarithromycin (CLA) 500 mg, each given twice daily for 10 days, were compared in 2180 patients with AECB (1083 CIP, 1097 CLA). Patients were >40 years of age and had complicated/severe AECB episodes defined as at least three episodes within the past year, at least three comorbid conditions, previous failed antibiotic treatment for AECB within the previous 2 to 4 weeks, or community susceptibility data indicating a high number of resistant pathogens. Significant bacterial isolates (>10(5) colony-forming units per milliliter) from homogenized sputa were identified. Susceptibility to a range of antimicrobials was determined by the microbroth dilution technique. The majority of patients were white (83%) and were current or previous smokers (81%). Mean patient age was 62 years. A history of at least three AECB episodes in the previous year was reported by 54% of CIP-treated patients and 53% of CLA-treated patients. Of 777 primary isolates positively identified and cultured from 673 patients, the bacterial pathogens isolated and their incidence included Haemophilus species, 28%; Moraxella catarrhalis, 18%; Enterobacteriaceae, 18%; Staphylococcus aureus, 17%; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 7%; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4%. Beta-lactamase production was found in 38% of Haemophilus influenzae, 10% of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and 85% of M catarrhalis isolates. Thirty-four percent of S pneumoniae isolates were resistant to penicillin (minimum inhibitory concentration > or =0.12 mg/L). Among the 673 patients who were valid for clinical assessment and had a pretherapy pathogen isolated, clinical success and overall bacteriologic eradication rates at the end of therapy were 93% and 98% for CIP versus 90% and 96% for CLA. The differences between CIP and CLA did not reach statistical significance. Superinfections were reported significantly more frequently in CLA-treated (3%) versus CIP-treated patients (1%). Eradication rates for specific organisms for CIP and CLA, respectively, were Haemophilus species, 99% and 93%; M catarrhalis, 99% and 100%; S pneumoniae, 91% and 92%; and Enterobacteriaceae, 100% and 95%. Drug-related adverse events occurred in 12% of CIP-treated patients and 10% of CLA-treated patients. CIP 750 mg b.i.d. had a higher (but not statistically significant) clinical and bacteriologic cure rate than CLA 500 mg b.i.d. in the treatment of patients with bacteriologically proven complicated/severe AECB. The causative bacterial pathogens of AECB appear to be evolving, with a predominance of gram-negative and other resistant organisms observed. Thus antibiotic therapy for at-risk patients with AECB should include agents that have activity against gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antibiotics on 1,116 clinical gram-positive and gram-negative isolates.
AB  - A total of 1,116 clinically isolated strains belonging to Staphylococcus aureus (200), Staphylococcus epidermidis (200), Streptococcus pneumoniae (20), Escherchia coli (200), Klebsiella spp. (177), Serratia marcescens (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (224), Haemophilus influenzae (35) and Salmonella (38) from the Department of Infectious Diseases, La Sapienza University in Rome (Italy) were tested against three fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) and 10 other antibiotics (augmentin, ampicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefotaxime, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin, minocycline, oxacillin and vancomycin). Fluoroquinolones inhibited essentially about 100% of H. influenzae, Salmonella and S. pneumoniae, more than 75% of Staphylococcus including methicillin-resistant strains, and about 90% of Enterobacteriaceae and 50% of P. aeruginosa. Minimal inhibitory concentration values ranged from < 0.015 to > 32 micrograms/ml for Klebsiella, S. aureus and epidermidis, E. coli and P. aeruginosa; from < 0.015 to 2 micrograms/ml for Salmonella; from 0.03 to 16 micrograms/ml for Serratia; from < 0.015 to 1 microgram/ml for Haemophilus; and from 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml for S. pneumoniae. Levofloxacin and to a lesser extent ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, generally exhibited a greater activity than the other agents against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Regarding the distribution of resistant strains in Italy, we found a peculiar pattern of resistance as far as E. coli and P. aeruginosa were concerned. Quality control parameters are also summarized. S. epidermidis resulted as a new emergent pathogen especially in immunocompromised patients and its level of sensitivity has been modified over the last few years. In fact, the percentage of resistant strains to antibiotics or the percentage of methicillin-resistant isolates (in our study 35%), has gradually increased. Levofloxacin and ofloxacin showed good activity against staphylococcal strains compared with the majority of other antibiotics. These results suggest that the newer quinolones are promising antimicrobial agents for various infections.
TI  - Activities of new fluoroquinolones against fluoroquinolone-resistant pathogens of the lower respiratory tract.
AB  - The activities of six new fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin, grepafloxacin, gatifloxacin, trovafloxacin, clinafloxacin, and levofloxacin) compared with those of sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin with or without reserpine (20 microg/ml) were determined for 19 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 5 Haemophilus sp. isolates, and 10 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin from patients with clinically confirmed lower respiratory tract infections. Based upon the MICs at which 50% of isolates were inhibited (MIC50s) and MIC90s, the most active agent was clinafloxacin, followed by (in order of decreasing activity) trovafloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, sparfloxacin, and grepafloxacin. Except for clinafloxacin (and gatifloxacin and trovafloxacin for H. influenzae), none of the new agents had improved activities compared with that of ciprofloxacin for P. aeruginosa and H. influenzae. A variable reserpine effect was observed for ciprofloxacin and S. pneumoniae; however, for 9 of 19 (47%) isolates the MIC of ciprofloxacin was decreased by at least fourfold, suggesting the presence of an efflux pump contributing to the resistance phenotype. The laboratory parC (Ser79) mutant strain of S. pneumoniae required eightfold more ciprofloxacin for inhibition than the wild-type strain, but there was no change in the MIC of sparfloxacin and only a 1-dilution increase in the MICs of the other agents. For efflux pump mutant S. pneumoniae the activities of all the newer agents, except for levofloxacin, were reduced. Except for clinafloxacin, all second-step laboratory mutants required at least 2 microg of all fluoroquinolones per ml for inhibition.
TI  - [A national multicenter study of the in-vitro activity of piperacillin-tazobactam. The Spanish Piperacillin-Tazobactam Group].
AB  - The action of piperacillin-tazobactam on 4,137 of the 4,364 strains collected in  a Spanish multicenter study involving 46 participating hospitals was studied. The samples were from the following: 41% urine, 18% exuded from wound abscesses, 13% respiratory, 9% blood, 3% peritoneal liquid, and the remainder from other various sources. The gram-negative bacteria included 2,778 strains from 13 genera: Escherichia (1,289), Pseudomonas (451), Proteus (230), Klebsiella (203), Haemophilus (172), Enterobacter (145), Acinetobacter (88), Salmonella (60), Bacteroides (57), Morganella (53), Serratia (46), Citrobacter (46), Stenotrophonomas (23) and Moraxella (21). The gram-positive bacteria were S. aureus (316), E. faecalis (239), S. epidermis (130), S. pneumoniae (115) and Clostridium spp. (12). The global susceptibility of the gram-negatives to piperacillin-tazobactam was 94%: E. coli 98%, P. aeruginosa 92%, and P. mirabilis, Morganella, K. pneumoniae, Serratia and Salmonella spp. all greater than 94%. The susceptibility of other bacteria was as follows: 91% Citrobacter, 77% E. cloacae, 42% A. baumannii, 61% S. maltophilia, 97% E. faecalis, 93% S. epidermidis, 100% M. catarrhalis, 99% H. influenzae and 100% anaerobic bacteria. The action on S. pneumoniae and S. aureus varied according to the susceptibility or lack there of to penicillin or methicillin. In comparison to other antibiotics (piperacillin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem and ciprofloxacin), piperacillin-tazobactam was far better than piperacillin alone and better or similar to the others.
TI  - Airways microbial flora in COPD patients in stable clinical conditions and during exacerbations: a bronchoscopic investigation.
AB  - Patients affected with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) undergo frequent exacerbations of their illness characterized by increased cough and expectoration. The precise aetiology of these episodes often remains unknown. In the absence of clinical or radiographic signs of pneumonia, bacterial or viral cultures of sputum usually provide little useful information. Thus, we performed fibreoptic bronchoscopy using a protected specimen brush (PSB) to obtain uncontaminated secretions for culture from 56 patients with COPD, 16 with stable clinical conditions and 40 affected with exacerbations of the disease. The aim of our study was to evaluate bronchial microbial flora by quantitative aerobic and anaerobic culture of each specimen. Twenty five subjects (45%), 4 (16%) in stable state and 21 (84%) with COPD exacerbations, had specimens which gave rise to significant bacterial growth (> 10(3) colony forming units.mL-1). The predominant bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (in 10 cases) and alpha-haemolytic streptococci (in 6 cases); other bacteria found were coagulase-negative staphylococci and Branhamella catarralis in (2 cases each), and Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aerococcus viridans and Chromobacterium violaceum (each in a single case only). Although significant bacterial growth was more frequently found in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations and in those with a higher degree of bronchial inflammation, the differences between the two groups of patients were not statistically significant. Nevertheless, the results obtained in our study confirm the validity of and the need for reliable sampling methods (like the protected specimen brush) to demonstrate significant bacterial colonization of the airways in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.
TI  - Sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  - The microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. Anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). There were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and 12 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella sp. (5), Peptostreptococcus sp. (4), Fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and Bacteroides fragilis (1). Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. Organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven instances. This study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.
TI  - [Characteristics of fauces microflora in children treated in intensive care units].
AB  - Characteristic features of fauces aerobic microflora in children treated in intensive care units (ICU) were analysed. For comparison fauces microflora in children outpatients and in children patients from general surgical units was investigated. A retrospective analysis of all the smears without exception for 2 years (a total of 2120) revealed a direct dependence of the changes in the fauces microflora composition on the patient condition and the antibiotic load. It was shown that the fauces indigenic microflora in ICU patients was more often replaced by enterococci, gramnegative enteric bacteria and nonfermenting bacteria which are not usual under the normal conditions. The flora in such cases was represented by monoculture. Thus, microorganisms natural for the fauces i.e. Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria spp. were not practically detected in the fauces of the ICU patients (0.5 and 0.4 per cent, respectively). Grampositive cocci in the children of the surgical units and in the outpatients included alpha-hemolytic streptococci in association with beta-hemolytic or nonhemolytic streptococci. No such bacteria were isolated from the ICU newborns. The associations of gramnegative organisms from the ICU patients included 40 variants. Seventy-eight association variants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were mainly represented by the combinations with Serratia spp. and Klebsiella spp. as well as with coagulase negative staphylococci or enterococci, especially in the ICU newborns. The results of the study demonstrated that the target-aimed antibiotic therapy providing eradication of P.aeruginosa in the ICU patients was not always justified because of possible superinfection practically due to any organism from the association. Massive antibiotic therapy with pressing on gramnegative flora in the ICU patients induced selective contamination of the mucosa by polyresistant enterococci thus increasing their potential role in the development of hospital infections.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from protected bronchopulmonary samples: variation as a function of the previous length of stay in the recovery room].
AB  - We retrospectively reviewed the variation of the organisms recovered from 403 protected bronchopulmonary specimens in three surgical intensive care units according to the time elapsed from admission. The predominant pathogens during the four first days were Haemophilus influenzae (33.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (18.2%), mostly methicillin susceptible strains, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (14.3%). After the fourth day, they were progressively replaced by typical nosocomial bacteria such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa and cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, strains resistant to third generation cephalosporins occurred significantly later than the susceptible strains. These results indicate that the time elapsed from intensive care unit admission has a major influence on the bacteriology of respiratory tract infections, but no clear cut-off point between early-onset and late onset pneumonia is evident.
TI  - Susceptibility of European respiratory tract isolates to trovafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, azithromycin and ampicillin.
AB  - As part of the Artemis project, 11500 isolates (3000 from patients with respiratory tract infections) were collected throughout six European countries between 1994 and 1996. Twenty-seven hospitals or laboratories participated in this first phase of the study. The activities of three classes of antimicrobial agents (fluoroquinolones, beta-lactam agents, macrolides) are presented for the six most frequently isolated pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae). Overall, trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin activities were similar for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. Of the Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 6% were resistant to penicillin. Trovafloxacin had the highest activity against the Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.25 mg/l for 90% of isolates (MIC90); all strains tested were susceptible to trovafloxacin. The MIC90 of ciprofloxacin for Streptococcus pneumoniae was 3 mg/l, and overall 52% of the strains were susceptible; 9% were resistant. Azithromycin and clarithromycin exhibited similar activity against all collected pathogens, except Haemophilus influenzae. All strains of Haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to azithromycin compared with 79% for clarithromycin, with respective MIC90s of 2 and 16 mg/l. The data presented demonstrate differences in the susceptibility patterns of six major respiratory tract pathogens in Europe.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1996)].
AB  - The bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout Japan, since 1981. Ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. Results obtained from these investigations are discussed. In 16 institutions around the entire Japan, 557 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 449 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from October 1996 to September 1997. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 98 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 93 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 84 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 84 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 17 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 31 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, 21 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. 1) S. aureus S. aureus strains for which MICs of oxacillin (MPIPC) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) accounted for 67.3%. The frequency of the drug resistant bacteria increased comparing to the previous year's 52.7%. Arbekacin (ABK) and vancomycin (VCM) showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA with MIC80s of 1 microgram/ml. 2) S. pneumoniae Imipenem (IPM) and panipenem (PAPM) of carbapenems showed the most potent activities with MIC80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. Faropenem (FRPM) showed the next potent activity with MIC80 of 0.125 microgram/ml. The other drugs except erythromycin (EM), clindamycin (CLDM) and tetracycline (TC) were active against S. pneumoniae tested with MIC80s of 8 micrograms/ml or below. 3) H. influenzae The activities of all drugs were potent against H. influenzae tested with MIC80s of 4 micrograms/ml or below. Cefotiam (CTM), cefmenoxime (CMX), cefditoren (CDTR) and ofloxacin (OFLX) showed the most potent activities with MIC80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. 4) P. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) Tobramycin (TOB) showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) with MIC80 of 1 microgram/ml. Ceftazidime (CAZ), cefsulodin (CFS), IPM, gentamicin (GM), ABK and ciprofloxacin (CPFX) showed the next potent activities, with MIC80s of 2 micrograms/ml. The MIC80s of the other drugs ranged from 4 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml. 5) P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) TOB and CPFX showed the most potent activities against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) with MIC80s of 1 microgram/ml. The MIC80s of piperacillin (PIPC) and cefoperazone (CPZ) were 16 micrograms/ml in 1995, and they were 64 micrograms/ml in 1996. 6) K. pneumoniae All drugs except ampicillin (ABPC) were active against K. pneumoniae. CMX, cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP) and carumonam (CRMN) showed the most potent activities against K. pneumoniae with MIC80s of 0.125 microgram/ml. The MIC80s of the other drugs ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 2 micrograms/ml. 7) M.(B) catarrhalis Against M.(B.) catarrhalis, all drugs showed good activities with MICs of 4 micrograms/ml or below. IPM and minocycline (MINO) showed the most potent activities with MICs of 0.063 microgram/ml. Also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. Patients' backgrounds were examined for 557 isolates from 449 cases. The examination of age distribution indicated that the proportion of patients with ages over 60 years was 71.0% of all the patients showing a slight increase over that in 1994. Proportions of diagnosed diseases were as follows: Bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the most frequent with 35.9% and 30.3% respectively. They were followed by bronchiectasis with a proportion of 10.
TI  - [An epidemiological investigation for MRSA and PRSP in Kinki area. Kinki Infection Working Group].
AB  - Recent trends in the development of resistance of the Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae to antibiotics were investigated, using a questionnaire delivered to participants at a meeting of the Kinki District Society of Infections. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounted for 55.4% of all isolated S. aureus, and more than 80% of MRSA was detected within hospitals. In outpatients, MRSA was often detected in pus, while in hospitalized patients, MRSA was often detected in sputum. Further, MRSA was accompanied by some other organisms (most frequently Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in 64.7% of MRSA positive patients. The sensitivity of MRSA to vancomycin (VCM) was 100%, to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) 99.2%, and to arbekacin, 98.6%. In contrast, Penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) accounted for 42.4% of all isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae. About 50% of PRSP was detected in out-patients. For both hospitalized patients and outpatients, PRSP was most frequently detected in sputum. PRSP was accompanied by some other organisms (most frequently Haemophilus influenzae) in 49.3% of PRSP positive patients, PRSP had high sensitivity to cephems, carbapenems and VCM.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens (non-Mycobacterium) from sputum culture and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - Sputum culture of patients at Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok was 49.84% positive for bacterial pathogens in 1994 and 40.95% in 1995. The average incidence of gram-negative rods was 3.11 fold more than the combination of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative cocci. The most common gram-negative rod was Pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by either Klebsiella pneumoniae or Acinetobacter anitratus depending on year. The most common coccus was Staphylococcus aureus. From both years, the number of Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Burkholderia pseudomallei and Nocardia spp isolated were 122, 93, 13 and 11 strains respectively. For antimicrobial susceptibility, P. aeruginosa was sensitive to ceftazidime, imipenem, gentamicin, amikacin, netilmicin, ciprofloxacin (range 56-89%). S. aureus (MSSA) was sensitive to common used drugs. S. aureus (MRSA) was sensitive to co-trimoxazole, fosfomycin, vancomycin (range 57-100%) and resistant to most drugs.
TI  - Comparison of the modified Stokes' method of susceptibility testing with results  obtained using MIC methods and British Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy breakpoints.
AB  - The majority of clinical microbiology laboratories in the UK use comparative disc diffusion methods based on the Stokes' method to determine antibiotic susceptibility. The technical validity of the results obtained from the modified Stokes' method of disc testing and how they relate to MIC data are not known. We studied susceptibility testing using a modified Stokes' disc diffusion method for a wide range of clinical isolates against which MICs had been determined by collaborators not involved with the disc testing evaluation. Results indicated that for 1301 organism-antibiotic combinations the number of major errors (where resistant strains were reported as sensitive) was 21/468 (4.4%) and the number of minor errors (where sensitive strains were reported as resistant) was 14/713 (1.9%) using ciprofloxacin breakpoints of 0.5 and 2 mg/L. There was good correlation between the disc susceptibility test and the MIC for 119 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae tested with the exception of Serratia spp. Excluding Serratia spp. the number of major errors for Enterobacteriaceae was 1/200 (0.5%). Data revealed 2/25 (8%) major errors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 1/45 (2.2%) for Acinetobacter spp. Haemophilus influenzae showed a number of unexpected categorization errors. The modified Stokes' method performed accurately for Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci when tested for susceptibility to gentamicin, erythromycin, teicoplanin and vancomycin. No major errors were reported for Streptococcus pneumoniae and beta-haemolytic streptococci. Problems occurred with the detection of antibiotic resistance in Enterococcus spp. Major errors were seen for ampicillin (2/12 strains), teicoplanin (5/6 strains) and vancomycin (5/13 strains) using a 30 microg disc but only 1/13 strains using a 5 microg disc. Overall, from our data, the modified Stokes' disc diffusion antibiotic susceptibility test showed an unacceptable number of major errors but an acceptable number of minor errors.
TI  - Interactions of plaunotol with bacterial membranes.
AB  - Plaunotol, a cytoprotective antiulcer agent, has a bactericidal effect against Helicobacter pylori, which may result from interaction of this compound with the bacterial cell membrane. The purpose of the present study was to confirm that plaunotol interacts with the H. pylori membrane. Membrane fluidities were measured using two stearic acid spin labels, namely 5-doxyl-stearic acid (in which the nitroxide group is located in the upper portion of the bacterial cell membrane) and 16-doxyl-stearic acid methyl ester (in which the nitroxide group is located deeper in the bacterial cell membrane), by means of electron spin resonance. The membrane fluidities of plaunotol-treated cells were significantly increased in the measurements made using the two spin labels. We also attempted to isolate plaunotol-resistant H. pylori in vitro by two different methods. To assess the level of resistance that could be reached, H. pylori was passaged five times on an agar plate containing subinhibitory concentrations of plaunotol or metronidazole. To measure the rate of development of resistance, H. pylori was grown with subinhibitory concentrations (0.25 x MIC) of plaunotol or metronidazole, and quantitatively plated on to medium containing 4 x MIC of the compounds. This treatment was repeated once more. No plaunotol-resistant colonies were selected by the two methods. H. pylori developed resistance to metronidazole easily and at a relatively high rate. The mechanism by which plaunotol directly fluidizes and destroys the H. pylori membrane might make it difficult for this organism to develop resistance to plaunotol. It was confirmed that the bactericidal effects of plaunotol were also shown against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. No such effect was seen against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - In vitro pharmacodynamic studies of L-749,345 in comparison with imipenem and ceftriaxone against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - L-749,345 is a new parenteral carbapenem with a very long half-life similar to that of ceftriaxone. The aim of the present study was to investigate different pharmacodynamic parameters of L-749,345 in comparison with those of ceftriaxone and imipenem. The following studies were performed: (i) comparative studies of the MICs of L-749, 345, imipenem, and ceftriaxone for 70 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria; (ii) comparative studies of the rate of killing of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by L-749,345, imipenem, and ceftriaxone; (iii) studies of the postantibiotic effects of L-749,345, imipenem, and ceftriaxone; and (iv) studies of the postantibiotic sub-MIC effects of L-749,345, imipenem, and ceftriaxone. Significantly lower MICs of L-749,345 compared with those of ceftriaxone were found for all gram-negative organisms except Haemophilus influenzae. The MICs of L-749,345 were similar to those of imipenem for all organisms except Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, for which the MICs of L-749,345 were higher. A concentration-dependent killing of methicillin-resistant S. aureus but not methicillin-susceptible strains was noted for both L-749,345 and imipenem. All three of the investigated drugs exhibited a postantibiotic effect against the gram-positive strains but exhibited no postantibiotic effect against the gram-negative strains.
TI  - The phosphorylcholine epitope undergoes phase variation on a 43-kilodalton protein in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and on pili of Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  - Phosphorylcholine (ChoP) is a component of the teichoic acids of Streptococcus pneumoniae and has been recently identified on the lipopolysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae, also a major pathogen of the human respiratory tract. Other gram-negative pathogens that frequently infect the human respiratory tract were surveyed for the presence of the ChoP epitope as indicated by binding to monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) recognizing this structure. The ChoP epitope was found on a 43-kDa protein on all clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa examined and on several class I and II pili of Neisseria meningitidis. The specificity of the anti-ChoP MAb was demonstrated by the inhibition of binding in the presence of ChoP but not structural analogs. As in the case of H. influenzae, the expression of this epitope was phase variable on these species. In P. aeruginosa, this epitope was expressed at detectable levels only at lower growth temperatures. Expression of the ChoP epitope on piliated neisseriae displayed phase variation, both linked to pilus expression and independently of fully piliated bacteria.
TI  - Cocaine and lidocaine with phenylephrine as topical anesthetics: antimicrobial activity against common nasal pathogens.
AB  - Topical anesthetics are commonly used in the evaluation of nasal pathology. The anesthetics routinely used, 4% lidocaine with phenylephrine, or 4% cocaine, have been demonstrated to have varying inhibitory effects on bacterial cultures. The present study examined the antimicrobial activity of these topical anesthetics used in nasal procedures. The pathogens used were Branhamella catarrhalis, Enterobacter sp., Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Organisms were against two-fold serial dilutions of stock preparations of 4% lidocaine with 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.1% methylparaben, 250 mg/ml ampicillin, and 4% cocaine. The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration for each of the solutions were obtained. The bacteria studied varied gently in their susceptibility to lidocaine with phenylephrine versus cocaine: Cocaine consistently exhibited greater antimicrobial activity than lidocaine. Phenylephrine and methylparaben showed slight antimicrobial activity. These topical anesthetics have slight bactericidal activity against nasal pathogens, which can sometimes lead to false-negative results. Otolaryngologists should recognize the possible antimicrobial effects of topical anesthetics when culturing specimens. This is especially important when the specimen will be used for guidance of antimicrobial therapy, as in the case of the critically ill patient who requires aspiration for organism-specific therapy. Further studies, specifically in vivo experiments, are needed to determine if use of the drugs produces a significant change in the ability to culture organisms from these sites. This type of study would, however, be difficult to perform, since most patients requiring aspiration are already on high-dose antibiotics that would inhibit the growth of most microorganisms. A modified aspiration technique using a less concentrated topical anesthetic will likely be required to increase the chances of obtaining positive cultures.
TI  - Kartagener's syndrome: a re-visit with Chinese perspectives.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical, radiological investigation profiles, and ciliary function and ultrastructure in Chinese patients with Kartagener's syndrome (presence of dextrocardia, sinusitis and bronchiectasis). All patients with dextrocardia were assessed for the presence of sinusitis and bronchiectasis in our hospital network. Patients identified with Kartagener's were assessed when they were at steady state for their bronchiectasis. Seven cases (4 males; mean age 34.9 years) were identified and systematically reviewed. The mean 24 h sputum volume was 26.6 +/- 32.77 mL/day and the patients suffered from a mean of 2.9 exacerbations/year. Nasal symptoms (anosmia in one, obstruction in six and persistent discharge in three patients) were common. Only two cases (1 M) were married and both had normal fertility. Lung function assessment showed a mean FEV1/FVC of 83.3 +/- 38.78/86.5 +/- 36.72 (% predicted) with little reversibility. High resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) revealed bronchiectactic involvement of the lower lobes in seven and middle lobe/lingula in four cases. Assessment of alpha-1-anti-trypsin, aspergillus precipitins, auto-antibodies and serology for Pseudomonas pseudomallei was normal. Sputum culture yielded Pseudomonas aeruginosa in three, Haemophilus influenzae in three and commensals in one case. Phase contrast microscopy assessment of respiratory cilia, obtained by brushing the inferior turbinate, revealed that most of the mucosa was unciliated. The mean ciliary beat frequency was 5.2 +/- 6.76 Hz (range 0-13.7; normal range 12-18 Hz). Four patients had immotile cilia whilst the rest had normal ciliary movement. Transmission electron microscopy showed the absence of dynein arms in four patients. The results of this study show that patients with Kartagener's syndrome may have normal ciliary ultrastructure and the absence of dynein arms is not necessarily associated with ciliary immotility. The presence of ciliary immotility might have prognostic value as these patients appear to have more active bronchiectasis. Our experience on this series should help clinicians in the investigation and management of these patients.
TI  - Natural competence for DNA transformation in Helicobacter pylori: identification  and genetic characterization of the comB locus.
AB  - The gram-negative bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori, an important aetiological agent of gastroduodenal disease in humans, belongs to a group of bacterial species displaying competence for genetic transformation. Here, we describe the comB gene locus of H. pylori involved in DNA transformation competence. It consists of a cluster of four tandemly arranged genes with partially overlapping open reading frames, orf2, comB1, comB2 and comB3, constituting a single transcriptional unit. Orf2 encodes a 37-amino-acid peptide carrying a signal sequence, whereas comB1, comB2 and comB3 produce 29 kDa, 38 kDa and 42 kDa proteins, respectively, as demonstrated by immunoblotting with specific antisera. For Orf2 and ComB1, no homologous proteins were identified in the database. For ComB3, the best homologies were found with TraS/TraB from the Pseudomonas aeruginosa conjugative plasmid RP1 and TrbI of plasmid RP4, VirB10 from the Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens and PtlG, a protein involved in secretion of pertussis toxin of Bordetella pertussis. Defined transposon knock-out mutants in individual comB genes resulted in transformation-defective phenotypes ranging from a 90% reduction to a complete loss of the natural transformation efficiency. The comB2 and comB3 genes show homology to HP0528 and HP0527, respectively, located on the cagII pathogenicity island of H. pylori strain 26695.
TI  - Ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia: challenges in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.
AB  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common infection in intensive care unit patients that results in high mortality and morbidity and increased duration of hospital stay. Clinical diagnostic methods are sensitive, but lack specificity. Quantitative analysis of specimens from the lower respiratory tract increases specificity. Bacteria causing VAP may originate from the patient's endogenous flora, other patients or hospital personnel, or from environmental sources. Aspiration or direct inoculation are the major routes of bacterial entry into the lower respiratory tract. The bacterial inoculum and host response in the lung are important factors for pathogenesis. Late-onset nosocomial pneumonia is often caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, and Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, however, are the more common pathogens in early-onset disease. Oropharyngeal and gastric colonization with bacteria, cross-infection, as well as the indiscriminate use of antibiotics or invasive devices substantially increase the risk of VAP. An understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of VAP, along with implementation of appropriate preventive measures, are needed to decrease the incidence, morbidity, and mortality associated with VAP.
TI  - Pyogenic bacterial pneumonia in human immunodeficiency virus-infected inpatients: a clinical, radiological, microbiological, and epidemiological study.
AB  - We prospectively studied features of pyogenic bacterial pneumonia in 263 consecutive human immunodeficiency virus-infected inpatients over a 6-month study period. Risk factors for bacterial pneumonia were examined by a case-control study that included 33 cases who presented with at least one episode of bacterial pneumonia and 80 controls without bacterial pneumonia. The estimated cumulative incidence of bacterial pneumonia per year was 12.5 cases per 100 inpatients (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.8-17.2). The 38 episodes of bacterial pneumonia that occurred in the 33 inpatients were mainly unilateral, but 32 episodes were patchy lobar or diffuse infiltrates. Microbiological etiologies were obtained in 33 of the 38 episodes of bacterial pneumonia. Thirty-seven pathogens were identified, including Streptococcus pneumoniae (16, of which 12 had a decreased susceptibility to penicillin), Haemophilus influenzae (6), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6). The risk factors for bacterial pneumonia that were identified after logistic regression included prior sinusitis within 1 month before admission (odds ratio [OR], 3.2; 95% CI, 1.1-9.1) and prior bacterial infection of the lower respiratory tract within 6 months before admission (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.1-8.3).
TI  - Epithelial cell damage is induced by neutrophil-derived, not pseudomonas-derived, proteases in cystic fibrosis sputum.
AB  - Airway histopathological changes in cystic fibrosis (CF) include damage to the epithelial tissue and accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). Airways of CF patients are usually colonized with bacteria such as mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). Bacteria and PMN can both release proteolytic enzymes capable of causing tissue damage. This study aims to clarify and compare the roles of these agents in epithelium damage. Epithelial cell (EC) damage and detachment induced by sputum samples from CF or non-CF patients, with and without lung infection, were assessed on amnionic EC in an in vitro model of airway epithelium. Protease activity was determined using inhibitor profiles, and compared to the proteolytic activity of isolated neutrophils and bacteria. Sputa from CF patients and infected non-CF patients induced high levels of detachment. PA also induced high levels of EC detachment but Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae, two other bacteria commonly isolated from CF sputa, induced no detachment. Antiprotease inhibition profiles were similar for PMN and sputa-induced EC detachment, but different for PA-induced detachment. These results suggest that PMN proteolytic enzymes, probably elastase and cathepsin G, are more likely to be the inducers of tissue damage in the airways of CF patients than PA proteolytic enzymes.
TI  - Comparative study of the clinical presentation of Legionella pneumonia and other  community-acquired pneumonias.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the clinical, biological, and radiologic features of presentation in the emergency ward of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) by Legionella pneumophila (LP) and other community-acquired bacterial pneumonias to help in early diagnosis of CAP by LP. Three hundred ninety-two patients with CAP were studied prospectively in the emergency department of a 600-bed university hospital. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to compare epidemiologic and demographic data and clinical, analytical, and radiologic features of presentation in 48 patients with CAP by LP and 125 patients with CAP by other bacterial etiology (68 by Streptococcus pneumoniae, 41 by Chlamydia pneumoniae, 5 by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 4 by Coxiella burnetii, 3 by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 by Haemophilus influenzae, and 2 by Nocardia species. Univariate analysis showed that CAP by LP was more frequent in middle-aged, male healthy (but alcohol drinking) patients than CAP by other etiology. Moreover, the lack of response to previous beta-lactamic drugs, headache, diarrhea, severe hyponatremia, and elevation in serum creatine kinase (CK) levels on presentation were more frequent in CAP by LP, while cough, expectoration, and thoracic pain were more frequent in CAP by other bacterial etiology. However, multivariate analysis only confirmed these differences with respect to lack of underlying disease, diarrhea, and elevation in the CK level. We conclude that detailed analysis of features of presentation of CAP allows suspicion of Legionnaire's disease in the emergency department. The initiation of antibiotic treatment, including a macrolide, and the performance of rapid diagnostic techniques are mandatory in these cases.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of otorrhea associated with tympanostomy tubes in children.
AB  - The microbiology of in 55 ear aspirates obtained from 34 children with chronic otorrhea was studied. Aspiration of the middle ear exudate was done immediately following removal of tympanostomy tube (TT). The middle ear aspirates and swab specimens of the external auditory canals were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Sixty-five isolates were recovered only from the middle ears, 73 only from the external ear canals, and 73 were present at both sites. Analysis of the 138 middle ear isolates demonstrated the recovery of aerobic bacteria only in 28 patients (50%), anaerobes only in seven (13%), and both aerobes and anaerobes in 20 (36%). There were 77 aerobic and 61 anaerobic isolates. Commonly recovered aerobes were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (11), Proteus sp. (7), Moraxella catarrhalis (6), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and non-typable Haemophilus influenzae (5). Commonly isolated anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp. (25 isolates), Prevotella sp. (10), Bacteroides sp. (8) and Fusobacterium sp. (6). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. aureus were more often isolated in children older then 6 years. These findings demonstrate the polymicrobial bacteriology of TT-related otorrhea in children. Specimens collected from the external auditory canals can be misleading. Reliable information can be obtained from the ear exudes when collected through the TT or through the open perforation after their removal.
TI  - Effect of salmeterol on Haemophilus influenzae infection of respiratory mucosa in vitro.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae is a common bacterial pathogen causing human respiratory tract infections. We have previously shown that the beta2-agonist salmeterol reduces damage to the respiratory mucosa caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro. We have now investigated the effect of salmeterol on H. influenzae infection of adenoid tissue in an organ culture by scanning electron microscopy. Tissue was preincubated with or without salmeterol (4x10(-7)M), prior to infection with H. influenzae and incubated for 12 or 24 h. Infected organ cultures had increased epithelial damage and decreased numbers of both ciliated and unciliated cells at 12h, which were significantly different (p < or = 0.01) from the controls at 24 h. Salmeterol (4x10(-7)M) significantly (p < or = 0.03) reduced damage and loss of ciliated cells in infected organ cultures at both 12 and 24, and significantly (p < or = 0.03) reduced loss of unciliated cells at 24 h. Salmeterol had no effect on the density of bacteria adhering to each individual mucosal feature or the total number of bacteria adhering to the organ culture. These results suggest that salmeterol protects the respiratory epithelium against Haemophilus influenzae-induced damage. The mechanism of salmeterol cytoprotection and its potential clinical relevance remain to be investigated.

AB  
TI  - Comparative analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa penicillin-binding protein 7 in the context of its membership in the family of low-molecular-mass PBPs.
AB  - The Pseudomonas aeruginosa pbpG gene encoding penicillin-binding protein 7, a homologue of the Escherichia coli gene encoding a DD-endopeptidase, was cloned and sequenced, pbpG was located immediately downstream of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (phh) operon. DNA sequencing revealed an open reading frame of 936 bp (starting with a GTG codon) which encodes a protein of 34,115 Da. N-terminal amino acid sequencing confirmed the presence of a cleavable N-terminal signal peptide of 23 amino acids. Verification that the protein is a penicillin-binding protein was directly demonstrated by labelling with 125I-labelled penicillin X. Inactivation of P. aeruginosa pbpG by interposon mutagenesis resulted in no obvious phenotypic changes, but when P. aeruginosa PbpG was overexpressed in E. coli using a T7 expression system, cell lysis resulted. P. aeruginosa PbpG resembled E. coli PbpG in being associated with the membrane fraction. Two additional members of the PbpG subfamily were identified in the database. P. aeruginosa PbpG shows 63% identity with E. coli penicillin-binding protein 7 (PbpG) and 60% identity with Vibrio cholerae PbpG, but only 23% identity with Haemophilus influenzae PbpG. The PbpG subfamily and three other subfamilies constituting the low-molecular-mass PBP protein family were analysed by multiple alignment of 26 sequences. PbpG exhibited the consensus motifs of other penicillin-binding proteins. Ten anchor residues were identified that are conserved at the family level within the superfamily of serine-active-site penicillin-interacting proteins.
TI  - [Survey of the sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 21 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance. The activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,282 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at all institutions between October and December 1995. The results were as follows: 1. Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ABPC. Carbapenems showed low activities against MRSA. 2. OFLX exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity against Haemophilus influenzae, followed by MEPM. The antibacterial activities of the other carbapenems were comparable to those of FMOX and CTM. 3. The carbapenems showed high activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than that exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents. The carbapenems also exhibited greater antibacterial activities against Serratia marcescens than the other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains were detected. 4. The antibacterial activities of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were comparable to those of CAZ, AZT, AMK.
TI  - [Correlation between pulmonary pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics support the  hypothesis of the usefulness of ceftazidime at a single 1g daily dose in the treatment of bacterial exacerbation of chronic obstructive bronchopneumonia with moderate functional damage].
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND: Experimental studies have shown that cephalosporins  have an antibacterial effect in vivo even when their levels are above MIC for only 40-50% of dosing intervals, whereas maximum killing is obtained when concentrations are above MIC for 60-70% of the time. Since most patients treated with antibiotics have neutrophils and other natural defence mechanisms, it is likely that a bacteriostatic effect should be sufficient to induce an effective therapeutic response. METHODS: Given that in the potential sites of lung infection ceftazidime reaches significantly higher levels than the MIC of the most commonplace respiratory pathogens, even 8-12 hours after the administration of 1 g i.m., the authors evaluated the efficacy of treatment of renewed acute episodes of COPD using this antibiotic at a dose of 1 g once a day. In order to do this, 20 outpatients were enrolled in the study, half of whom presented moderate bronchial obstruction (FEV1 = 50-70% of theoretical) whereas the remainder presented marked bronchial obstruction (FEV1 = < 50% of theoretical). RESULTS: The 10 patients with moderate obstruction at the time of enrollment, who presented Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae or Moraxella catarrhalis as causal agents in the sputum (Escherichia coli was only isolated in one patient), showed a marked improvement following treatment with 1 g ceftazidime one a day. A real or presumed eradication of the causal microorganism was observed in all subjects. Treatment with ceftazidime at the dose of 1 g/die once a day was much less effective in patients with marked bronchial obstruction. Treatment was successful in 7 out of 10 subjects, but 2 of them relapsed within 2 weeks. In this second group, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found in the sputum of 3 patients; one of the patients showed a persistence of the bacterium after ceftazidime treatment, and another presented reinfection 12 days after the end of treatment. The two patients in whom Staphylococcus aureus was isolated did not benefit from ceftazidime treatment at this dosage. One subject who initially presented Streptococcus pneumoniae in his sputum and was then thought to have recovered, underwent a new acute episode caused by Moraxella catarrhalis 2 weeks after the suspension of ceftazidime treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic responses observed during this study suggest the possibility of using ceftazidime in a single daily dose of 1 g i.m. to treat those patients with exacerbations of COPD who only present moderately impaired functional symptoms. On the contrary, this type of therapeutic approach must be used with extreme caution in subjects with marked functional damage, although a satisfactory clinical response may be obtained in some cases. However, the small number of patients included in this study does not allow firm conclusions to be drawn. Only a study involving a larger group of patients could provide the necessary information to confirm the hypothesis for treatment put forward by the authors.

TI  - Levofloxacin and sparfloxacin: new quinolone antibiotics.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To discuss the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, spectrum of activity, clinical trials, and adverse effects of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin, two new fluoroquinolone antibiotics. DATA SOURCES: Literature was identified by a MEDLINE search from January 1985 to September 1997. Abstracts and presentations were identified by review of program abstracts from the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy from 1988 to 1996. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized, controlled clinical studies were selected for evaluation; however, uncontrolled studies were included when data were limited for indications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In vitro data were selected from comparison trials whenever available. Only in vitro trials that provided data on the minimum inhibitory concentrations required to inhibit 90% of isolates were used. Data from North American studies were selected whenever available. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were evaluated with respect to in vitro activity, study design, clinical and microbiologic outcomes, and adverse drug reactions. DATA SYNTHESIS: Levofloxacin and sparfloxacin are active against pathogens frequently involved in community-acquired upper and lower respiratory tract infections, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Both compounds have enhanced activity compared with ciprofloxacin against most gram-positive bacteria, including enterococci, streptococci, and staphylococci, and retain good activity against most Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Sparfloxacin has greater anaerobic activity than levofloxacin, which is more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin. Although many clinical studies are available only in abstract form, the clinical data demonstrate that these new quinolones are effective for most community-acquired upper and lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, gonococcal and nongonococcal urethritis, and skin and skin structure infections. FDA-approved indications are limited for both compounds to date. CONCLUSIONS: Levofloxacin and sparfloxacin have improved gram-positive activity compared with that of older fluoroquinolones, and are administered once daily. Sparfloxacin-associated photosensitivity may limit its therapeutic usefulness. Clinical trials confirm that these agents are as effective as traditional therapies for the management of community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, sinusitis, urinary tract infections, acute gonococcal and nongonococcal urethritis, and skin and skin structure infections.
TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of twice-daily ciprofloxacin 750 mg in the treatment of patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and pneumonia.
AB  - In a review of the US Bayer ciprofloxacin (CIP) database, an analysis was undertaken to summarize the effectiveness and tolerability of CIP 750 mg BID in the treatment of patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) and pneumonia. In five controlled studies, comparator (COMP) agents included ampicillin, intravenous cefuroxime/cefaclor, and other unspecified agents. Primary efficacy end points were clinical success (resolution plus improvement) and bacteriologic eradication at the end of therapy. The incidence of adverse events for CIP 750 mg BID was compared with that for COMP and with that in the CIP 500-mg-BID AECB and pneumonia clinical trials database. In five uncontrolled studies, 443 patients received CIP 750 mg BID; in 5 controlled trials comprising 344 patients, 169 received CIP 750 mg BID and 175 received COMP. Clinical success for CIP was 93% (368/396) and 99% (160/162), respectively, in the uncontrolled and controlled studies versus 98% (156/160) for COMP agents. Corresponding bacteriologic eradication rates for CIP 750-mg-BID-treated patients were 77% (273/356) and 95% (122/128), respectively, and 77% (96/125) for COMP agents. Overall bacteriologic eradication by organism for CIP 750 mg BID included Streptococcus pneumoniae 96% (51/53), Haemophilus influenzae 98% (92/94), Haemophilus parainfluenzae 100% (56/56), Moraxella catarrhalis 100% (14/14; 13 of 14 organisms were isolated in patients with AECB), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 66% (135/204). Drug-related adverse events were reported in 113 (26%) CIP 750-mg-BID-treated patients in uncontrolled trials and in 62 (37%) CIP 750-mg-BID- and 61 (35%) COMP-treated patients in controlled trials. In the combined data from the CIP 750-mg-BID uncontrolled and controlled trials, adverse events occurred with similar frequency compared with COMP except for nausea (CIP 10%, COMP 7%) and diarrhea (CIP 3%, COMP 13%). In conclusion, CIP 750 mg BID provided excellent clinical success rates in the treatment of patients with AECB and pneumonia. CIP 750 mg BID was well tolerated compared with the COMP agents administered.
TI  - Bacterial adherence in smokers and non-smokers.
AB  - Bacterial adherence is thought to be a first important step in the pathogenesis of infection. It is now recognized that bacteria bind to and colonize mucosal surfaces in a highly selective manner via a lock- and key mechanism with complementary receptors on the mucosal surfaces of the host. We studied adherence to buccal cells of a panel of potential respiratory pathogens as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 18 smokers and 18 healthy non-smokers. Our results show an increased pneumococcal adherence in smokers compared to that of non-smokers and this may explain the role of smoking as a risk factor in the susceptibility to bacterial pneumonia. The other bacterial species tested do not differ in their adhesion values and probably require previous damage of the mucosa before adhesion 1997 The Italian Pharmacological Society.
TI  - The infectious complications of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
AB  - Infectious complications continue to have a major impact on the clinical course of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia despite advances in therapeutic approaches to this disease and supportive care. Although the pathogenesis of infection in these patients is multifactorial, systemic hypogammaglobulinemia is the major immune defect accounting for the increased risk of infection. Despite common knowledge of systemic immune defects in this population, information regarding mucosal immune function is minimal. In patients treated with conventional alkylating agents, infections commonly occur at mucosal sites, especially the respiratory tract, and organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are frequent isolates. The use of purine analogues as fludarabine has resulted in a change in this spectrum of infection, with the appearance of opportunistic infections caused by Pneumocystis, Listeria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Nocardia, Candida, Aspergillus, and herpesviruses. Further knowledge of the impact of chemotherapy on immune function, and of the immune defects in these patients, both inherent to the primary disease process and therapy-related, will aid in the formulation of better prophylactic and therapeutic interventions to reduce the risk of infection and improve the ultimate outcome of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
TI  - Experience with a broth culture technique for diagnosis of bacterial keratitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine if a broth culture technique is a practical means for bacteriological investigation of keratitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-seven eyes of 27 patients with a clinical diagnosis of bacterial keratitis were included in a prospective and non-comparative study at a Danish referral hospital. A corneal scrape was inoculated directly into broth medium which was transferred to the diagnostic laboratory for incubation and subculture. RESULTS: Culture was negative in 4 patients, and 19 of the remaining 23 patients had a pure growth of either Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 8), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 2), Haemophilus influenzae biotype III (n = 1), Moraxella species (n = 1), Corynebacterium species (n = 1), or coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 4). In 4 patients there was a mixed gram-positive growth. There was no association between microbiological findings and previous topical antibiotic therapy. Contamination and lack of quantitative assessment of growth proved not to be a problem. CONCLUSIONS: By broth culture technique we identified a definite pathogen (P. aeruginosa, S. aureus or S. pneumoniae) in 44% of patients (95% binomial confidence limits: 25-65%). The technique may replace the standard technique of direct plate culture under circumstances where it is difficult to keep a supply of fresh media or transport inoculated plates.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of S-4661, a new carbapenem.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of S-4661, a new 1beta-methylcarbapenem, were compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, biapenem, cefpirome, and ceftazidime. The activity of S-4661 against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococci was comparable to that of imipenem, with an MIC at which 90% of the strains tested were inhibited (MIC90) equal to 0.5 microg/ml or less. S-4661 was highly active against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, with MIC90s ranging from 0.032 to 0.5 microg/ml. Against imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S-4661 was the most active among test agents (MIC90, 8 microg/ml). Furthermore, S-4661 displayed a high degree of activity against many ceftazidime-, ciprofloxacin-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates of P. aeruginosa. The in vivo efficacy of S-4661 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and drug-resistant P. aeruginosa, reflected its potent in vitro activity and high levels in plasma in mice. We conclude that S-4661 is a promising new carbapenem for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and drug-resistant P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Impact of tracheotomy on colonization and infection of lower airways in children  requiring long-term ventilation: a prospective observational cohort study.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Determination of the following: (1) colonization and infection  rates in children requiring long-term ventilation initially via a transtracheal tube and subsequently via a tracheotomy; (2) the number of infection episodes per 1,000 ventilation days, during both types of artificial airways; and (3) routes of colonization/infection of the lower airways, ie, whether the pathogenesis was endogenous (via the oropharynx) or exogenous (via the transtracheal tube or tracheotomy). DESIGN: Observational, cohort, prospective study over 2 1/2 years. SETTING: Pediatric ICU (PICU), Royal Liverpool Children's National Health Service Trust of Alder Hey, a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Twenty-two children requiring long-term mechanical ventilation initially transtracheally and subsequently via a tracheotomy. INTERVENTION: Nil. RESULTS: The lower airways were colonized in 71% of children during transtracheal ventilation; posttracheotomy, this was 95% (p=0.03). Children developed significantly fewer infections following colonization with a microorganism posttracheotomy (8/15 pretracheotomy vs 6/21 posttracheotomy; p=0.013). Throughout the study, there were a total of 17 episodes of infection, all of which were preceded by colonization. Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the same four causative pathogens during mechanical ventilation both transtracheally and via tracheotomy. Forty-nine episodes of colonization were observed, 15 pretracheotomy and 34 posttracheotomy; of these, 12 (80%) and 19 episodes (56%), respectively, were primary endogenous, ie, present in the oropharynx on hospital admission and subsequently at tracheotomy. Only one colonization episode (7%) of exogenous pathogenesis was observed during transtracheal intubation, while 12 (35%) (p=0.02) occurred after tracheotomy. An equal number of secondary endogenous colonization episodes (two and three, ie, acquired in the oropharynx after PICU admission and after tracheotomy, respectively, were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Despite a high level of hygiene, exogenous colonization without subsequent infection was common. (2) Although all patients were colonized, the infection rate was lower after tracheotomy. This may be due to enhanced immunity (medically stable) and improved tracheobronchial toilet. (3) Microorganisms in children with tracheotomy differ from those in adults.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of extracts and constituents of Pelargonium sidoides and Pelargonium reniforme.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of extracts and isolated constituents (scopoletin, umckalin, 5,6,7-trimethoxycoumarin, 6,8-dihydroxy-5,7-dimethoxycoumarin, (+)-catechin, gallic acid and its methyl ester) of Pelargonium sidoides and Pelargonium reniforme (Geraniaceae), plant species used in folk medicine by the Southern African native population, was evaluated against 8 microorganisms, including 3 Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus 1451) and 5 Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) varied with the preparation of the extracts and microorganisms tested, from about 0.6 mg/ml for aqueous phases to over 10 mg/ml for crude Pelargonium extracts. With the exception of the ineffective (+)-catechin, all the potentially active compounds exhibited antibacterial activities with MICs of 200-1000 micrograms/ml. The results provide for a rational basis of the traditional use of the titled Pelargonium species.
TI  - [Monotherapy with meropenem in febrile granulocytopenic patients].
AB  - Infection remains the major cause of morbidity and mortality for cancer patients  who become granulocytopenic. Combinations of beta-lactams plus aminoglycosides have been the standard empiric therapy for febrile granulocytopenic patients, especially those with profound long-lasting granulocytopenia. The advent of new broad-spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenems has favoured the possibility of empiric monotherapy. Meropenem is a parenteral carbapenem antibiotic stable to renal dehydropeptidase-I which has excellent bactericidal activity against almost all clinically significant aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Meropenem hasta an antibacterial spectrum similar to that of imipenem but it is more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, all Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus spp, Morganella spp and Providencia spp. Recently, the efficacy, safety, and tolerance of meropenem monotherapy for the empirical treatment of fever in granulocytopenic cancer patients have been compared in two large prospective randomized multicenter trials. The Meropenem Study Group compared monotherapy with meropenem versus ceftazidime and the EORTC conducted a comparative study of meropenem monotherapy versus the combination of ceftazidime plus amikacin. In both groups, success rates were similar by type of infection and infection-related mortality was low. Related adverse events were also similar in both groups. These studies confirm that monotherapy with meropenem is as effective as ceftazidime-containing regimens for the empiric treatment of fever in granulocytopenic patients.
TI  - [Meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  - Meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position C1 which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (DHP-1), thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. Its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in C2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. Meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the PBPs. It covers gram positive aerobes (Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, Enterococcus faecalis, Rhodococcus equi, Listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Vibrio, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria, Moraxella) and anaerobes (Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: P. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and H. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci, streptococci and staphylococci). Meropenem has no activity on Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus resistant to methycillin, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). Resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the OprD porin (OprD2 in enterobacteria and P. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the PBPs (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of clarithromycin against recent obtained clinical isolates].
AB  - In order to evaluate antimicrobial activities of clarithromycin (CAM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CAM and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates that were obtained from outpatients in 1994 and 1996. The results are summarized as follows; 1. It was not showed that CAM-resistant strains were increasing among Staphylococcus spp., beta-streptococci, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis, Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni, Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. It appeared that resistances to CAM and macrolides (MLs) were increasing among Streptococcus pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp. 2. The drug susceptibility patterns to MLs were similar and detection frequencies of induced resistant strains that were resistant to only 14-membered ring MLs including CAM and constitutive resistant strains that were resistant to 14 and 16-membered ring MLs were high among Streptococcus pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp. It appears that MLs-resistance systems are linked to each other, and that this was a cause of increasing MLs-resistance among these bacterial species. 3. Notwithstanding of antibiotic resistance problems, CAM is still useful since it maintains strong antimicrobial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, B. pertussis, C. jejuni subsp. jejuni, C. trachomatis and M. pneumoniae, and it controls arginate producing abilities of mucoide strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Sequence of the ponA gene and characterization of the penicillin-binding protein  1A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the ponA gene encoding the high molecular-mass penicillin-binding protein 1A (PBP1A) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) PAO1 was determined and characterized. The predicted PBP1A protein of 822 amino acids (aa) has a calculated molecular mass of 91.2 kDa corresponding to the size of the protein expressed in vitro and in vivo. A penicillin-binding (PB) assay showed that the Pa ponA gene product covalently binds penicillin. The deduced PBP1A aa sequence has features typical of class-A high-molecular-mass PBPs: a highly hydrophobic N-terminus portion containing a potential transmembrane segment which might anchor the protein to the cytoplasmic membrane; an N-terminal module with the conserved boxes 1 (E86D(DN)F(AN)H(Y)G), 2 (G117GS(T)I(TM)Q), 3 (R139K(IN)E(ILL)AL) and 4 (R221R(NW)IL); a PB module with the conserved boxes 5 (S461SFK), (S520RN) and (K695TG); an internal extension at aa 297-407 between the N-terminal and PB modules; and a C-extension at the end of the PB module at aa 742 to 822. The highest percentage of similarity (62.8%) was found with the class A high-molecular-mass PBP1A of Escherichia coli (Ec) and Haemophilus influenzae. The observed extensive homology in the modular design of the Pa PBP1A with the bifunctional Ec PBP1A suggests structural and functional relationships between these proteins and refutes the proposed correspondence between Pa PBP1A and Ec PBP1B.
TI  - Disruption of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa dipZ gene, encoding a putative protein-disulfide reductase, leads to partial pleiotropic deficiency in c-type cytochrome biogenesis.
AB  - The Pseudomonas aeruginosa dipZ gene has been cloned and sequenced. Whereas disruption of Escherichia coli dipZ (dsbD), the hydrophilic C-terminal domain of which has been deduced to be periplasmic and to function as a protein-disulfide reductase, leads to the absence of c-type cytochromes, disruption of P. aeruginosa dipZ attenuated, but did not abolish, holo-c-type cytochrome biosynthesis. Comparison of the P. aeruginosa DipZ sequence with three other DipZ sequences indicated that there are not only two conserved cysteine residues in the C-terminal hydrophilic domain, but also two more in the central highly hydrophobic domain. The latter would be located toward the centre of two of the eight membrane-spanning alpha-helices predicted to compose the hydrophobic central domain of DipZ. Both these cysteine residues, plus other transmembrane helix residues, notably prolines and glycines, are also conserved in a group of membrane proteins, related to Bacillus subtilis CcdA, which lack the N- and C-terminal hydrophilic domains of the DipZ proteins. It is proposed that DipZ of P. aeruginosa and other organisms transfers reducing power from the cytoplasm to the periplasm through reduction and reoxidation of an intramembrane disulfide bond, or other mechanism involving these cysteine residues, and that this function can also be performed by B. subtilis CcdA and other CcdA-like proteins. The failure of dipZ disruption to abolish c-type cytochrome synthesis in P. aeruginosa suggests that, in contrast to the situation in E. coli, the absence of DipZ can be compensated for by one or more other proteins, for example a CcdA-like protein acting in tandem with one or more thioredoxin-like proteins.
TI  - Cochlear changes following destruction of semicircular canal in healthy and previously toxin-exposed rats. An electrophysiological and morphological investigation.
AB  - One group of Sprague-Dawley rats (group A, n = 6) was treated by instilling Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (PaExoA), and another (group B, n = 6) treated similarly with Haemophilus influenzae type b endotoxin (HiBEndo). In group A a 20 dB hearing loss was observed, predominantly in the high-frequency region, which was reversible within 1 month. In group B no significant hearing impairment was noted. Between 1 and 6 months later, the lateral and posterior semicircular canals (SCCs) were ablated unilaterally. Control rats (group C, n = 8) were subjected to ablation only. All rats were cochleotomized contralaterally prior to labyrinthine surgery. Frequency-specific evoked potential testing at 2-31.5 kHz tone bursts was performed before and directly after surgery, 6, 24 and 48 hours and 1, 4 and 16 weeks postoperatively. After surgery in 18 rats, thresholds rose immediately, predominantly at 2, 4 and 6 kHz, followed by varying degrees of recovery. Greatest immediate postoperative hearing loss was observed in group A; no rat recovered completely and two rats showed severe permanent threshold elevation. All group B rats recovered completely, except one showing moderate threshold impairment. No permanent hearing loss was observed in group C. This study shows that destruction of SCCs in rats does not necessarily cause permanent hearing loss, even if the fluid spaces are not sealed off. However, previous exposure of the middle ear to PaExoA (but not HiBEndo) renders the cochlea more vulnerable and can result in persistent hearing loss.
TI  - In-vitro activities of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were equally active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens. Ciprofloxacin was the most active compound against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 = 1 mg/L), followed by trovafloxacin (MIC90 = 4 mg/L). Trovafloxacin was twice as active as sparfloxacin against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L) and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90 = 0.06 mg/L) (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, for which the MIC90 was 8 mg/L). Trovafloxacin was the most active compound against Enterococcus faecalis: 80% of strains were susceptible to 0.25 mg/L. There was complete cross-resistance between all fluoroquinolones.
TI  - Fatty acid biosynthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: cloning and characterization of the fabAB operon encoding beta-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein dehydratase (FabA) and beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase I (FabB).
AB  - The Pseudomonas aeruginosa fabA and fabB genes, encoding beta-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein dehydratase and beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase I, respectively, were cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. Northern analysis demonstrated that fabA and fabB are cotranscribed and most probably form a fabAB operon. The FabA and FabB proteins were similar in size and amino acid composition to their counterparts from Escherichia coli and to the putative homologs from Haemophilus influenzae. Chromosomal fabA and fabB mutants were isolated; the mutants were auxotrophic for unsaturated fatty acids. A temperature-sensitive fabA mutant was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of a single base that induced a G101D change; this mutant grew normally at 30 degrees C but not at 42 degrees C, unless the growth medium was supplemented with oleate. By physical and genetic mapping, the fabAB genes were localized between 3.45 and 3.6 Mbp on the 5.9-Mbp chromosome, which corresponds to the 58- to 59.5-min region of the genetic map.
TI  - Trovafloxacin.
AB  - Trovafloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent with a broad spectrum of activity. Trovafloxacin has similar or 2-fold lower activity than ciprofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, trovafloxacin has similar activity to ciprofloxacin. Other susceptible Gram-negative pathogens include Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis and mycoplasmas. The drug is active against Gram-positive bacteria and consistently displayed greater activity (2- to 8-fold) than ciprofloxacin against all staphylococci and streptococci tested; activity included methicillin-resistant staphylococci and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Trovafloxacin has some activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Anaerobes such as Bacteroides and Clostridium spp. are also susceptible to trovafloxacin. Preliminary clinical data suggest that trovafloxacin is effective in the treatment of patients with upper and lower respiratory tract and uncomplicated urinary tract infections and infections caused by C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae. The most frequently noted adverse event with trovafloxacin is dizziness which is reported in 11% of patients versus 3% of those receiving comparator agents. Other commonly reported events (> 1% of patients) are nausea, headache, vomiting, vaginitis and diarrhoea.
TI  - [Survey of sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 20 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance of clinical isolates. Activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems, were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,326 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at the institutions between October and December 1994. The results are as follows: 1. Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ABPC. Carbapenems showed low activities against MRSA. 2. OFLX exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity against Haemophilus influenzae, followed by MEPM. Antibacterial activities of the other carbapenems were comparable to those of FMOX, CTM, and ABPC. 3. The carbapenems showed high activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than those exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents. The carbapenems also exhibited stronger antibacterial activities against Serratia marcescens than the other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains were detected. 4. The antibacterial activities of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were comparable to those of CAZ, AZT, AMK.
TI  - Vertebral osteomyelitis: nontypeable beta-lactamase-negative Haemophilus influenzae in an adult: case report.
AB  - Adult pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis due to Haemophilus influenzae is exceedingly rare. After a search of the literature, we deemed our case to be the seventh case of H. influenzae pyogenic osteomyelitis. Vertebral osteomyelitis in itself is a rarity. The most common organisms associated with vertebral osteomyelitis are Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Of the six previously reported cases of adult pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis due to H. influenzae, four of the six cases were caused by Type B H. influenzae, one case was attributed to Type C, and the other strain was not typed.
TI  - A review of the in vitro activity of meropenem and comparative antimicrobial agents tested against 30,254 aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated world wide.
AB  - The in vitro activity of meropenem (formerly SM-7738), a new carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem and five other broad-spectrum antimicrobials (ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin) against 30,254 clinically significant pathogens isolated in nine countries worldwide. Overall, the carbapenems, meropenem and imipenem, were the most active drugs. Meropenem was four- to 64-fold more active than imipenem against Gram-negative bacteria, including the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. Meropenem was also quite active against ceftazidime-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting 87.5 to 100% at < or = 4 micrograms/ml. In contrast, imipenem was four- to eight-fold more active than meropenem against Gram-positive species, including methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. Among the anaerobes, strains resistant to meropenem or imipenem were encountered very rarely. These extensive data provide additional in vitro support for the clinical use of meropenem as a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent active against key pathogenic species of bacteria.
TI  - Effect of sputum bacteriology on the quality of life of patients with bronchiectasis.
AB  - Bronchiectatic patients have impaired health-related quality of life (QoL) and are prone to chronic lower respiratory tract infections. We have investigated whether impaired QoL is related to sputum bacteriology. Eighty seven patients with non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis, in a stable phase of their illness, completed three QoL measures, underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan and lung function tests, and provided a fresh sputum sample for microscopy and culture. The QoL of patients colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa group) was significantly worse than all other patients grouped together (non-Pa group), and specifically those infected by Haemophilus influenzae (Hi group) or who had no bacterial growth (NG group) (p<0.05), but not those infected by other bacterial species (O group). The Pa group had worse lung function, but no significant differences were found between the groups for forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow rate. The Pa group had significantly worse bronchiectasis scores than the O, NG and non-Pa groups, but not the Hi group. There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to the number of infective exacerbations in the last year, but the Pa group had significantly more hospital admissions. Patients infected by P. aeruginosa for more than 3 yrs had significantly worse FEV1 (p<0.03) and bronchiectasis scores (p<0.05) than those infected with P. aeruginosa for less time, but not significantly worse QoL. We conclude that, overall, patients infected with P. aeruginosa have worse quality of life, and that P. aeruginosa is associated with a greater extent of disease and worse lung function. Although patients infected with H. influenzae had extensive bronchiectasis their quality of life was better than the P. aeruginosa infected group.
TI  - A five-day course of dirithromycin in the treatment of acute exacerbation of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  - Since dirithromycin persists at high concentrations in the lung for at least 3 days following the last dose of a 5-day course, we evaluated the clinical efficacy and tolerance of a 5-day course of dirithromycin in 20 patients with acute exacerbation of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, treated with a total dose of 2.5 g dirithromycin (500 mg once-daily for 5 days) in an open, non-comparative study. Patients were assessed before therapy and after 5 (last administration), 10 (post-therapy) and 20 (late post-therapy) days. Pathogen elimination or presumed elimination was seen in 18/20 patients at the post-therapy visit and at the late post-therapy visit, but two Haemophilus influenzae out 5 were isolated in sputum after 10 days and only one after 20 days (Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the other pathogen). Dirithromycin was well-tolerated and only 2 patients reported mild gastrointestinal pain. This study shows that a 5-day dirithromycin therapy provides a convenient and efficient dosage regimen in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. Notwithstanding its poor in vitro activity against H. influenzae, dirithromycin was fairly active against this microorganism in vivo.

TI  - Procalcitonin as a marker of bacterial sepsis in patients infected with HIV-1.
AB  - Procalcitonin (ProCT) is a recently described marker of severe sepsis. It was decided to assess the value of proCT as a marker of secondary infection in patients infected with HIV-1. ProCT plasma levels were measured by immunoluminometric assay in a prospective study in 155 HIV-infected individuals: 102 asymptomatic and 53 with lever or suspected secondary infections. The baseline plasma level of ProCT was low (0.5 ng/ml +/- 0.37), even in the latest stages of the disease, and did not differ from the values of healthy subjects (0.54 ng/ml +/- 0.08). EDTA-treated whole blood was collected from patients before starting specific antimicrobial therapy. No elevation of ProCT level was detected in HIV-infected patients with evolving secondary infections including PCP (n = 4), cerebral toxoplasmosis (n = 4), viral infections (n = 9), mycobacterial infections (n = 5), localized bacterial (n = 12) and fungal infections (n = 4), malignancies (n = 3), and in various associated infectious and non-infectious febrile events (n = 13). All these plasma values were lower than 2.1 ng/ml. In contrast, high ProCT plasma levels were detected in one HIV-infected patient with a septicaemic Haemophilus influenzae infection (16.5 ng/ml) and another one with a septicaemic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection (44.1 ng/ ml), ProCT values decreased rapidly under appropriate therapy. ProCT seems to be a specific marker of bacterial sepsis in HIV-infected patients, as no increase in other secondary infections could be detected in those patients. A rapid determination of ProCT level could be useful to confirm or refute bacterial sepsis for a better management of febrile HIV-infected patients.
TI  - [Epidemiological evaluation of mycobacteria isolates in one city hospital: reports from the hospital microbiology laboratory].
AB  - The frequency of mycobacteria isolated from patient's specimens at Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital was investigated. By fitting a polynominal curve (degree = 3) of the annual frequency of culture-positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis (1977 through 1995), it was noted that the frequency had not changed since 1977. The patients in the 40s or older and 60s or older comprised 74 and 38%, respectively. Of 104 patients diagnosed as tuberculosis (between 1993 and 1995), 43 (41%) were compromised hosts with the following underlying diseases: kidney disease; diabetes mellitus; malignant tumor; respiratory disease; Behcet's disease; ophthalmosarcoidosis; multiple arthritis; Hashimoto's disease. This suggested that these compromised hosts are at high risk of onset and relapse of tuberculosis, and occasionally the doctor's or patient's delay was seen during the diagnostic process. By fitting a polynominal curve (degree = 3) of the annual frequency of culture-positive atypical mycobacteria (1977 through 1995), it was noted that the frequency had increased since 1981. The patients in the 40s or older and 60s or older comprised 88 and 60%, respectively. Between 1982 and 1994, we encountered 46 cases of atypical mycobacteriosis of the lung: 37 M. avium complex (MAX) diseases; 7 M. kansasii diseases; one M. chelonae disease; one unidentified disease involving Runyon Group II mycobacterium. Eight involved patients with bronchiectasia (5 cases), diabetes mellitus (2 cases), or leukaemia (one case). Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Moraxella catarrhalis at more than 10(7) CFU per ml of sputum were isolated from 6 patients diagnosed with MAC or M. kansasii lung diseases, suggesting the possibility of mixed infections. M. tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterium (15 cases), and two different atypical mycobacteria (16 cases) were isolated from the same or different specimens of the same patients at the same or different times. However, the pathogenicity of these mycobacteria remained unknown, because atypical mycobacteria are non-pathogenic in many cases. The above findings suggested that the environment fit for the mycobacteria growth in human body has gradually been formed associating with aging, lung-lesion, and decline of immune capacity.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of RU-59863, a C-7 catechol substituted cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of RU-59863, a so-called "fifth generation" catechol cephalosporin, was evaluated against 606 bacterial isolates and compared with the activities of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, and cefpirome. RU-59863 demonstrated a broad spectrum of inhibition and superior overall activity than comparators when tested against Enterobacteriaciae (MIC90s, 0.015 to 2 micrograms/ml), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml), Acinetobacter ssp. (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus ssp. (MIC90s, 0.5 to 8 micrograms/ml). Potent RU-59863 activity was also observed against beta-haemolytic and viridans gr. streptococci (MIC90s, 0.12-0.5 microgram/ml), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90s, 0.03 to 0.5 microgram/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 0.06 microgram/ml), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). RU-59863 demonstrated marginal potency against Enterococcus faecalis (MICs 2 to 16 micrograms/ml) and was inactive against Enterococcus faecium (MIC90, > 128 micrograms/ml). Oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were not inhibited by RU-59863 (MIC90s, 32 to 128 micrograms/ml). Among the cephalosporins tested, RU-59863 performed best versus ceftazidime-resistant Bush group 1 isolates and strains producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases. RU-59863 was also effective against many fluoroquinolone-, aminoglycoside-, and imipenem-resistant isolates. RU-59863 seems to be a significant advance in cephalosporin chemistry and activity, especially against Gram-negative pathogens resistant to current beta-lactam therapeutic agents. Further studies of human pharmacokinetics and against clinical infections are encouraged.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of trovafloxacin against nosocomial Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates.
AB  - A total of 1132 clinical isolates from 952 patients with nosocomial infections were tested against the fluoroquinolone trovafloxacin by the agar dilution method. They comprised 285 staphylococci, 111 streptococci, 94 enterococci and 470 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, 92 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 27 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 28 Haemophilus influenzae and 25 Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. The in-vitro activity of trovafloxacin was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, beta-lactam and aminoglycoside agents. Over 96% of Enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to trovafloxacin with an MIC of <0.03-4 mg/L. It also inhibited 97% and 100% clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa and S. maltophilia, respectively. All staphylococci, including 51 strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, were susceptible to trovafloxacin, which also had excellent activity against streptococci and enterococci, inhibiting all 111 strains of the former and 94% of the latter. Trovafloxacin had a greater activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria than ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, penicillins, cephalosporins and the aminoglycosides tested.
TI  - In vitro activity of HSR-903, a new quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new fluoroquinolone HSR-903 was compared with those  of ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin. HSR-903 inhibited 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clinical isolates at 0.78 and 1.56 microg/ml, respectively, and its activity against MRSA was 16-fold higher than those of sparfloxacin and levofloxacin and 64-fold higher than that of ciprofloxacin. The MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of HSR-903 for Streptococcus pyogenes and penicillin G-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) were 0.10, 0.05, and 0.05 microg/ml, respectively. Against PRSP, the activity of HSR-903 was 4-fold higher than that of sparfloxacin and 32- to 256-fold higher than those of the other quinolones. The MIC90 of HSR-903 for Enterococcus faecalis was 0.20 microg/ml, and HSR-903 was more active than the other quinolones against enterococci. The activity of HSR-903 against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly similar to that of ciprofloxacin and greater than those of the other quinolones. Against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Helicobacter pylori, HSR-903 was the most potent of the quinolones tested. The activity of HSR-903 was not affected by the medium, the inoculum size, or the addition of serum, but decreased under acidic conditions, as did those of the other quinolones tested. HSR-903 exhibited rapid bactericidal action and had a good postantibiotic effect on S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. HSR-903 inhibited supercoiling by DNA gyrase from Escherichia coli, but it was much less active against human topoisomerase II.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of novel oral carbapenem DZ-2640.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of DZ-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and MIC90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively. MIC90s of DU-6681a were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC50 and MIC90 of DU-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) CFU), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DU-6681a was less than or equal to those of the reference compounds. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of DU-6681a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and H. influenzae.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1995)].
AB  - The bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout Japan, since 1981. Ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. Results obtained from these investigations are discussed. In 23 institutions around the entire Japan, 567 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 459 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from October 1995 to September 1996. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 74 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 82 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 104 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 85 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 18 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 52 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. 1) S. aureus. S. aureus strains for which MICs of oxacillin (MPIPC) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) accounted for 52.7%. Arbekacin (ABK) showed the most highest activity against S. aureus with MIC80 of 0.5 micrograms/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) showed the next highest activity with MIC80 of 1 microgram/ml. These drugs showed the high activities against MRSA with MIC80S of 1 microgram/ml. 2) S. pneumoniae. Most of drugs tested showed potent activities against S. pneumoniae. Imipenem (IPM) and panipenem (PAPM), carbapenems, showed the most potent activity with MIC80S of 0.063 microgram/ml. Cefotaxime (CTX), cefmenoxime (CMX) and cefpirome (CPR) of cephems showed the next most potent activities with MIC80S of 0.25 microgram/ml. Erythromycin (EM) and clindamycin (CLDM) showed low activities with MIC80S 128 micrograms/ml or high. Among these strains, however, 48.8% and 65.9% of respective strains were quite toward sensitive these agents with MICs of 0.063 microgram/ml. 3) H. influenzae. The activities of all drugs were potent against H. influenzae test with all MICs at 4 micrograms/ml or below. Cefotiam (CTM), CMX, cefditoren (CDTR) and ofloxacin (OFLX) showed the most potent activity with MIC90S to 0.063 microgram/ml. 4) P. aeruginosa. (mucoid strains) IPM and tobramycin (TOB) showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) with MIC80S of 1 microgram/ml. Ceftazidime (CAZ), cefsulodin (CFS) and carumonam (CRMN) showed next potent activity, with MIC80S of 2 micrograms/ml. The MIC80S of the other drugs ranged from 4 micrograms/ml to 32 micrograms/ml. 5) P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). TOB and ciprofloxacin (CPFX) showed the most potent activities against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) with MIC80S of 1 microgram/ml. The MIC80 of ampicillin (ABPC) was 128 micrograms/ml in 1994, it was 16 micrograms/ml in 1995. 6) K. pneumoniae. All drugs except ABPC were active against K. pneumoniae. CPR and CRMN showed the most potent activities against K. pneumoniae with MIC80S of 0.063 microgram/ml. The MIC80S of the other drugs ranged from 0.125 microgram/ml to 2 micrograms/ml. 7) M. (B.) catarrhalis. Against M. (B.) catarrhalis, all the drugs showed good activities with MIC80S at 4 micrograms/ml or below. And MICs of all strains were 8 micrograms/ml or below. IPM, OFLX and minocycline (MINO) showed the most potent activity with MIC80S of 0.063 microgram/ml. Also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. Patients' backgrounds were examine for 567 isolates from 459 cases. The examination of age distribution found that the proportion of patients with ages over 60 years was 66.3% of all the patients showing a slight increase over that in 1994. Proportion of differe
TI  - [The evaluation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) level in peripheral blood of patients with chronic lower respiratory tract infection].
AB  - In the present study, we assessed the serum level of IL-6 and TNF-alpha by ELISA  in patients with chronic lower respiratory tract infection. The serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha of patients in acute exacerbation phase are higher than that of in stable phase. We also classified patients in acute exacerbation phase into two groups according to the microorganism of persistent infection. The serum level of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in the patients with persistent infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than that with Haemophilus influenzae. Moreover, the serum level of IL-6 and TNF-alpha were found to be related with malnutrition which assessed by clinical indices such as the serum level of albumin and cholinesterase. The present result suggests that IL-6 and TNF-alpha may have relationship with not only inflammation in airway but also indices of nutrition in patients with chronic lower respiratory tract infection.
TI  - Molecular and immunological characterization of OprL, the 18 kDa outer-membrane peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Immunological screening of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa cosmid library led to the identification of clones producing an 18 kDa outer-membrane protein. This protein reacted in Western blots with a polyclonal antiserum against outer-membrane proteins of P. aeruginosa and with a monoclonal antibody (MA1-6) specific for OprL, the peptidoglycan-associated outer-membrane lipoprotein (PAL). Sequencing of pOML7, a subclone expressing oprL, revealed an ORF of 504 bp encoding a polypeptide with a typical lipoprotein signal recognition sequence. Another ORF was found upstream of oprL, with homology to the TolB protein of Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. Downstream of oprL, a second ORF, of 321 bp, was found (orf2), encoding a protein with a signal peptide and with no homology with proteins of known biological function. After the stop codon of orf2, a rho-independent terminator sequence was detected which is part of the P. aeruginosa PAO1 insertion element IS222. OprL showed homologies with all known PALs from Gram-negative bacteria, especially in the C-terminal part. mAb MA1-6 reacted with P. aeruginosa cells in immunofluorescence, and with E. coli cells expressing oprL, which had an abnormal, elongated morphology, an indication that production of the protein perturbed the division process.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of distal airways in healthy subjects and chronic lung disease: a bronchoscopic study.
AB  - In contrast to the healthy population, distal airway bacterial colonization may occur in patients with chronic lung diseases, who often have altered pulmonary defences. However, the information dealing with this issue is insufficient and is based mainly on nonspecific samples, such as sputum cultures. Using quantitative cultures of bronchoscopic protected specimen brush (PSB) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples, we studied the bacterial colonization of distal airways in 16 healthy subjects, 33 patients with bronchogenic carcinoma, 18 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 17 with bronchiectasis, and 32 with a long-term tracheostomy due to laryngeal carcinoma. All patients were without exacerbation, and free from antibiotic treatment at least 1 month before the study protocol. Thresholds for quantitative cultures to define colonization were > or = 10(2) colony-forming units (cfu) x mL(-1) for PSB and > or = 10(3) cfu x mL(-1) for BAL. Only one healthy subject was colonized by a potential pathogenic microorganism (PPM) (Staphylococcus aureus 4x10(2) cfu x mL(-1) in a PSB culture). Colonization was observed in 14 (42%) bronchogenic carcinoma patients (19 non-PPMs, and 10 PPMs); in 15 (83%) COPD patients (22 non-PPMs and 7 PPMs); in 15 (88%) bronchiectasis patients (20 non-PPMs and 13 PPMs); and in 15 (47%) long-term tracheostomy patients (5 non-PPMs and 13 PPMs). The two most frequent non-PPMs isolated in all groups studied were Streptococcus viridans and Neisseria spp. Haemophilus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis were the most frequent PPMs isolated in bronchogenic carcinoma, COPD, bronchiectasis and long-term tracheostomized patients, respectively. Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization was infrequent in all the groups. Our results show that distal airway bacterial colonization is a frequent feature in stable patients with chronic lung diseases and also in patients with long-term tracheostomy. However, the pattern of colonization differs among groups studied. The knowledge of different colonization patterns may be important for future antibiotic prophylactic strategies and for the empirical antibiotic regimens when exacerbations occur in these patients.
TI  - Identification of greA encoding a transcriptional elongation factor as a member of the carA-orf-carB-greA operon in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.
AB  - A homolog of the transcriptional elongation factor, GreA, was identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The deduced amino acid sequence for GreA from this organism exhibits 65.2% identity to its counterpart in Escherichia coli K-12. The nucleotide sequence of greA from P. aeruginosa overlaps by four bases the 3' terminus of carB which encodes the large subunit of carbamoylphosphate synthetase. S1 nuclease experiments showed that level of the greA transcript is elevated approximately 10-fold under conditions of pyrimidine limitation, consistent with the conclusion that transcription is initiated from the previously identified pyrimidine-sensitive promoter upstream of the carA-orf-carB-greA operon. Transcriptional fusion experiments showed the presence of an additional weak promoter within the carB sequence. A greA insertional mutant of Pseudomonas aerugionsa was constructed by gene replacement. The mutant derivative grew well in rich medium but did not grow in minimal medium supplemented by arginine and nucleosides. The greA phenotype was suppressed by secondary mutations at a relatively high rate, consistent with the notion of an important physiological role for GreA.
TI  - Microbiologic data overview of Italian cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - The aim of our study was to determine the frequency of microbiological culturing  and prevalence of colonization by principal pathogens of the respiratory tract of Italian cystic fibrosis patients. Data on all Italian cystic fibrosis patients were collected using a questionnaire sent to all Italian CF Centers. Results were obtained of microbiological cultures from 2,521 patients. Information was gained regarding the method of gathering biological samples, the percentage of patients undergoing microbiological culturing regularly, the procedures used to isolate bacteria and types of culture media used which were selective for Burkholderia cepacia. Ninety-four percent of Italian CF patients are regularly tested microbiologically. Sputum and pharyngeal cultures are most often carried out. 49% of Italian patients are colonized by Staphylococcus aureus, 5.4% by Haemophilus influenzae, 48.9% by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 3.8% by Burkholderia cepacia. In Italy there is a high prevalence of CF patients colonized by Staphylococcus aureus and a low prevalence of patients colonized by Haemophilus influenzae. The prevalence of Burkholderia cepacia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa does not differe significantly from other countries examined.
TI  - [Otorrhea on transtympanic aerator].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Purulent otorrhea is the most common complication of tympanostomy tubes. POPULATION AND METHODS: Results of culture of otorrhea in 33 consecutive cases were compared to two similar studies performed 4 and 8 years ago in the same institution. RESULTS: The most frequent organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae (45, 24, 21 and 15% of the cases, respectively). Such flora resembles that of external otitis and chronic otitis media (P aeruginosa and S pneumoniae). CONCLUSION: Sensitivity of the organisms encountered in these otorrheas favors the use of topical drops rather than oral antibiotics as the first choice of treatment.
TI  - The activity of the methylpiperazinyl fluoroquinolone CG 5501: a comparison with  other fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of CG 5501 against a wide range of recent clinical isolates was compared with that of three fluoroquinolones. CG 5501 inhibited 90% of the species of the family Enterobacteriaceae at 0.5 mg/L or less, exceptions being Enterobacter spp. (MIC90 2 mg/L) and Serratia spp. (MIC90 4 mg/L). Ninety per cent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by 16, 4 and 1 mg/L respectively. CG 5501 had high activity against Gram-positive cocci, 90% of staphylococci being inhibited at 2 mg/L. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains were generally ciprofloxacin-resistant yet were all susceptible to 4 mg/L or less of CG 5501. Isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae were eight-fold more susceptible to CG 5501 (MIC90 0.5 mg/L) than to ciprofloxacin (MIC90 4 mg/L) and the former had a similar activity to that of trovafloxacin and sparfloxacin. Enterococcus faecalis was generally two- to four-fold more susceptible to CG 5501 or trovafloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. CG 5501 and trovafloxacin had high activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90 0.25 mg/L). Five strains of Chlamydia spp. were inhibited by < or =0.12 mg/L of CG 5501; sensitive and multiresistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were inhibited by < or =0.5 mg/L of CG 5501. The high activity and breadth of its antibacterial spectrum suggests that CG 5501 should be useful in a wide range of clinical infections.
TI  - Structure and gene-polypeptide relationships of the region encoding glycerol diffusion facilitator (glpF) and glycerol kinase (glpK) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The glycerol facilitator is one of the few known examples of bacterial solute transport proteins that catalyse facilitated diffusion across the cytoplasmic membrane. A second protein, glycerol kinase, is involved in entry of external glycerol into cellular metabolism by trapping glycerol in the cytoplasm as sn-glycerol 3-phosphate. Evidence is presented that glycerol transport in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is mediated by a similar transport system. The genes encoding the glycerol facilitator, glpF, and glycerol kinase, glpK, were isolated on a 4.5 kb EcoRI fragment from a chromosomal mini-library by functional complementation of an Escherichia coli glpK mutant after establishing a map of the chromosomal glpFK region with the help of a PCR-amplified glpK segment. The nucleotide sequence revealed that glpF is the promoter-proximal gene of the glpFK operon. The glycerol facilitator and glycerol kinase were identified in a T7 expression system as proteins with apparent molecular masses of 25 and 56 kDa, respectively. The identities of the glycerol facilitator and glycerol kinase amino acid sequences with their counterparts from Escherichia coli were 70 and 81%, respectively; this similarity extended to two homologues in the genome sequence of Haemophilus influenzae. A chromosomal delta glpFK mutant was isolated by gene replacement. This mutant no longer transported glycerol and could no longer utilize it as sole carbon and energy source. Two ORFs, orfX and orfY, encoding a putative regulatory protein and a carbohydrate kinase of unknown function, were located upstream of the glpFK operon.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance: implications for managing respiratory failure.
AB  - The prevalence of antibiotic resistance in respiratory pathogens is increasing rapidly. In the community, resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics has escalated dramatically among Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Resistance to penicillin among S. pneumoniae has developed at an alarming rate over the past two decades. Recent studies in the United States have cited rates of penicillin resistance as high as 23.6%, with 9.5% exhibiting high-level resistance. Many of these strains are resistant to multiple antibiotics. Antimicrobial resistance in hospital-acquired pathogens is a problem, which in large part reflects patterns of antibiotic use. Antimicrobial resistance may arise via multiple mechanisms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli have become increasingly resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, including imipenem. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases are seen with increasing frequency in Enterobacteriaceae, primarily Klebsiella spp. Fluoroquinolone resistance has increased in P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus and has now been identified in Escherichia coli isolated from hematology wards. Excessive use of antibiotics may promote the emergence and spread of resistant microorganisms. Rigorous infection control measures and modification of antibiotic use patterns may limit or reduce the prevalence of resistant organisms.
TI  - Role of interleukin-8 in community-acquired pneumonia: relation to microbial load and pulmonary function.
AB  - In pneumonia local phagocyte activation is crucial for clearing of pathogenic microorganisms. In this context alveolar macrophage interleukin-8 secretion, phagocyte oxidative response and concentrations of lavage proteins were quantified, including interleukin-8, in 31 patients with pneumonia, 13 age matched patients with peripheral lung consolidation and six healthy volunteers; these findings were related to the impairment of gas exchange and the bacterial load in the alveolar space. Increased interleukin-8 levels were found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and in alveolar macrophage supernatants from patients with pneumonia (214 ng/10(5) AM +/- 121 vs 71 ng/10(5) AM +/- 35 and 66 ng/10(5) AM +/- 30, p < 0.05). Interleukin-8 release from alveolar macrophages correlated with the upregulated spontaneous luminol enhanced oxidative response of pulmonary phagocytes but not with the neutrophil count in BALF. In pneumonia patients a significant difference was found between patients with 10(4) or more colony forming units (CFU)/ml BALF of one pathogen and patients with less CFU or nonspecific microbiological results (261 ng/10(5) AM +/- 89 vs 179 ng/10(5) AM +/- 81 and 7.5 ng/ml BALF +/- 17 vs 0.44 ng/ml BALF +/- 1, p < 0.05). Further, a negative correlation between interleukin-8 release of alveolar macrophages and the arterial pO2 at the time of BALF could be demonstrated (r = -0.47, p < 0.05). The results demonstrate local cellular activation in community-acquired pneumonia, which is related to the bacterial load in the alveolar space and to impairment of gas exchange. This is consistent with the hypothesis that pulmonary phagocytes play a central role in the pathogenesis of bacterial pneumonia, contributing not only to bacterial clearing but also to local tissue damage.
TI  - Molecular genetic analysis of the region containing the essential Pseudomonas aeruginosa asd gene encoding aspartate-beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase.
AB  - asd mutants of Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria have an obligate requirement for diaminopimelic acid (DAP), an essential constituent of the cell wall of these organisms. In environments deprived of DAP, for example mammalian tissues, they will undergo lysis. This was previously exploited to develop vaccine strains of Salmonella typhimurium and cloning vectors containing asd as an in vivo selectable marker. As a first step for development of such systems for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the asd gene from wild-type strain PAO1 was cloned by a combined approach of PCR amplification from chromosomal DNA, construction of mini-libraries and by complementation of an Escherichia coli delta asd mutant. The nucleotide sequence of a 2433 bp Smal-Nsil fragment was determined. This fragment contained the C-terminal 47 nucleotides of leuB, encoding 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase; asd, encoding aspartate-beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (Asd); and orfA, whose product showed similarity to the Asd proteins from Vibrio spp. By subcloning, asd was localized to a 1.24 kb DNA fragment which in an E. coli T7 expression system strongly expressed a 40,000 Da protein. The amino acid sequence was deduced from the DNA sequence. A comparison of the Asd proteins from P. aeruginosa, E. coli and Haemophilus influenzae revealed greater than 63% identity, demonstrating the conserved nature of Asd in Gram-negative bacteria, and defined the active-site-containing consensus sequence GGNCTVXMLMXXXLGLF as a possible signature motif. Chromosomal delta asd mutants were isolated. They were auxotrophic for DAP, lysine, methionine and threonine, and lysed in the absence of DAP. Genetic analyses indicated that orfA probably is naturally frame-shifted and does not contribute to the Asd phenotype. By PFGE, the asd gene was mapped to between coordinates 1.89 and 2.15 Mbp, or 37-40 min, on the 5.9 Mbp P. aeruginosa chromosome.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of meropenem versus other extended-spectrum antimicrobials against randomly chosen and selected resistant clinical isolates tested in 26 North American centers.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of meropenem and up to nine other antimicrobials was compared in studies at 26 North American centers from 1989 to 1992 with use of standardized and controlled procedures for determining minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against 12,483 recent clinical isolates and additional drug-resistant strains. Overall, carbapenems were the most active drugs. The antibacterial activity of meropenem was consistent against random isolates in all centers; however, inclusion of large proportions of multidrug-resistant gram-negative aerobes by some centers did increase MICs of meropenem and the comparators. Meropenem was 4-64 times more active than imipenem against gram-negatives, including Enterobacteriaceae organisms, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Neisseria meningiditis, and Haemophilus influenzae. Imipenem was up to 2-4 times more active than meropenem against some gram-positive cocci, including Enterococcus faecalis. Carbapenems were similarly active against anaerobes, and resistant strains were rarely encountered. Meropenem, unlike imipenem or ceftazidime, was bactericidal for all strains of Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, and gram-positive cocci tested at < or = 8 times the MIC. A lack of antibiotic cross-resistance was frequently observed between comparator-resistant strains and meropenem. These data suggest the potential utility of meropenem as a monotherapeutic agent against a broad range of pathogens.
TI  - [Nationwide survey of susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1992].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents in 144 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1992. In this study, the isolates were identified and susceptibility tests were performed at individual laboratories. The susceptibility tests were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. S. aureus (including MRSA) strains were highly susceptible to arbekacin (ABK) and netilmicin (NTL). S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were susceptible to most of the agents tested. E. faecalis were highly susceptible to penicillins and imipenem (IPM). P. aeruginosa showed high susceptibility to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM and amikacin (AMK). Annual changes in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns over 5 years (1988-1992) were examined. The frequency of sensitive strains of S. aureus to methicillin (DMPPC) has slightly increased from 1991 to 1992. A moderate increases of PCG-insensitive S. pneumoniae was observed. B. fragilis group showed a slight increase in sensitivity to minocycline (MINO) but no yearly changes in IPM sensitivity was observed.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of ER-35786, a new antipseudomonal  carbapenem.
AB  - ER-35786 is a new parenteral 1 beta-methyl carbapenem with a broad antibacterial  spectrum and a potent antipseudomonal activity. It showed high in vitro activity, comparable to those of meropenem and a new carbapenem, BO-2727, against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, with MICs at which 90% of strains tested are inhibited (MIC90S) of < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. Against methicillin-resistant S. aureus, ER-35786 was the most active among the compounds tested, yet its MIC90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae, ER-35786 inhibited 90% of strains tested at a concentration of < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 of ER-35786 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 3.13 micrograms/ml, and the compound was more active than meropenem. In addition, the activity of ER-35786 against imipenem-, meropenem-, cefclidin-, or ceftazidime-resistant P. aeruginosa was equal to or higher than that of the most active reference compound. The in vivo activity of ER-35786 was consistent with this in vitro activity. The in vivo activity of ER-35786 was highest for systemic infection models with methicillin-resistant S. aureus and beta-lactam-resistant P. aeruginosa strains. In acute pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa, ER-35786 produced a greater reduction in the viable cell count in the lungs than did imipenem-cilastatin or meropenem.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpirome against microorganisms isolated in haematology, oncology and intensive care units in Switzerland.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefpirome, a new parenteral fourth-generation cephalosporin, was investigated in the 5 university hospitals of Switzerland, and compared to 9 other antibiotics mainly used in hospitals, such as ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, piperacillin, imipenem, gentamicin, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. A total number of 992 strains collected only from intensive care units and haematology-oncology units were tested by microdilution according to NCCLS. Cefpirome showed an excellent activity against all Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90 = 4 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC90 = 1 mg/l), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 = 0.25 mg/l) and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/l) isolates. Its activity was superior to that of third-generation cephalosporins against cephalosporinase-depressed mutants of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii isolates (MIC90 > 32 mg/l for third-generation cephalosporins vs 4 mg/l for cefpirome). The MICs of cefpirome of 3 strains of Klebsiella spp. with an extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase were lower (MIC90 = 2 mg/l) than those of third-generation cephalosporins (MICs90 > 32 mg/l). Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa cefpirome was as active as ceftazidime. The activity of cefpirome was poor against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci and nosocomial Gram-negative bacteria such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
TI  - [Community-acquired pneumonia: Etiological diagnosis].
AB  - Microbiological and immunoserological approaches were used in etiological diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. It was concluded that Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila and Klebsiella pneumoniae predominated in the etiological structure of present severe community-acquired pneumonia. The most actual causative agents of nonsevere community-acquired pneumonia in persons under 60 were S. pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Nonsevere community-acquired pneumonia in persons over 60 and/ or at the background of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, diabetes mellitus or other affections was most frequently due to S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and aerobic gramnegative microbes.
TI  - Hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Hong Kong: a randomized study comparing imipenem/cilastatin and ceftazidime.
AB  - The aetiology and outcome of hospitalized patients with moderate to severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) were evaluated in 60 adult patients (38 male 22 female, mean age 68.4 years). They were randomized for treatment with either ceftazidime or imipenem/cilastatin intravenously for 7 days. Bacteriological diagnoses were made in 25 cases (41.6%): Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Haemophilus influenzae (5), Pseudomonas spp. in particular Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8), Staphylococcus aureus (4), Chlamydia spp. (2), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (2) and Moraxella catarrhalis (3); mixed organisms were found in 4 patients. Forty-two patients (70%) responded satisfactorily to the regimens with improvement in sputum purulence cough and dyspnoea scores; there was no difference in response between the two groups. Sixteen patients (26.6%) underwent bronchoscopy on day 4 because of inadequate response to the antibiotics regimens, and 9 of them (15%) required a modification of the initial treatment with addition of erythromycin in 5 patients vancomycin in 1 cloxacillin in 1 and antituberculous drugs in 2. Three out of the 60 patients (5%) died of pulmonary sepsis: the aetiological agents were M. tuberculosis in one, Pseudomonas spp./methicillin-resistant S. aureus in another, but were not identified in the third. We conclude that treatment with either ceftazidime or imipenem/cilastatin was efficacious for moderate to severe CAP in Hong Kong.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of faropenem, a novel oral penem.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of faropenem, a novel oral penem, was studied in comparison with other beta-lactam antimicrobials against 711 recent clinical isolates including Gram-negative, Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. MIC data showed that faropenem was active against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae (MICs < or = 4 mg/L), with reduced activity against Serratia spp. (MIC90 = 32 mg/L). In common with its comparators, faropenem had weak activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC > 128 mg/L). Faropenem was active against staphylococci, although for MRSA MICs were raised (MIC90 = 2 mg/L) compared with those for MSSA (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L). Faropenem was also found to be active against streptococci, Neisseria spp., Enterococcus faecalis and beta-lactamase-producing and non-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Of the anaerobic bacteria studied, faropenem was most active against peptostreptococci and Clostridium perfringens (MIC90 < or = 1 mg/L) and Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90 = 4 mg/L). An increase in inoculum from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu raised faropenem MICs for Morganella morganii from 0.06-1 mg/L to 2-4 mg/L and for MRSA from 0.25-2 mg/L to 8 mg/L (a similar increase was not observed for MSSA). The MICs of faropenem were not affected by the presence of either 20% or 70% (v/v) serum. MICs for faropenem to 11 well characterized beta-lactamase producers were similar to those of non-producers. In hydrolysis studies, faropenem was shown to be highly stable to a number of beta-lactamases, including TEM-1, SHV-1, the extended spectrum beta-lactamases, TEM-3 and TEM-9, and the beta-lactamase produced by Staphylococcus aureus (NCTC 11561).
TI  - Neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Airway colonization with Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. Whether GNB are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI) and/or to the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is unknown. METHODS: We prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. Data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. The severity of BPD was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with GPC (Staphylococus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). Superimposed on 36% of these infants was GNB airway colonization with Klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), Enterobacter cloacae (25%), Escherichia coli (25%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), Serratia marcescen (10%), Acinetobacter baumannii and Haemophilus influenzae (5%). Comparison between 174 GPC- and 86 GNB-colonized infants showed that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. Fifteen percent of GNB-colonized infants developed BSI caused by GNB and 14% developed BSI caused by GPC. No significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and BSI was noted. GNB infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with GPC. GNB colonization was a predictor of severe BPD after controlling for ventilation. Ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of GNB-colonized and 33% of noncolonized infants and was not a predictor of BPD severity. CONCLUSION: GNB airway colonization creates a moderate risk for BSI. Antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate GNB. GNB airway colonization is associated with severe BPD, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate GNB from the airways should be undertaken.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime in vitro.
AB  - Cefpodoxime proxetil is a new orally administered prodrug which is absorbed and de-esterified by the intestinal mucosa to release the third-generation cephalosporin, cefpodoxime, and which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. Using the standard agar dilution method, we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other oral cephalosporins and quinolones against 637 recent clinical isolates from Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital in Taiwan. Against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, cefpodoxime showed excellent activity, inhibiting over 90% of these isolates at 1 mg/l. Like other oral drugs of its class, it had little activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. Against Haemophilus influenzae, irrespective of beta-lactamase production, its activity was similar to comparative drugs. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, cefpodoxime showed moderate activity, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 4 mg/l, whereas it was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. However, all cephalosporins have shown little in vivo activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus regardless of in vitro results. Cefpodoxime was inactive against Enterococcus spp. Against other streptococci, its activity was similar to other oral cephalosporins and quinolones tested. The results of this in vitro study indicated that oral administration of cefpodoxime should be an ideal agent in the empirical outpatient treatment for community-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of BAY 12-8039, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of BAY 12-8039, a new fluoroquinolone, was studied in comparison with those of ciprofloxacin, trovafloxacin (CP 99,219), cefpodoxime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate against gram-negative, gram-positive, and anaerobic bacteria. Its activity against mycobacteria and chlamydia was also investigated. BAY 12-8039 was active against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MIC at which 90% of strains tested were inhibited [MIC90S] < or = 1 microgram/ml, except for Serratia spp. MIC90 2 microgram/ml), Neisseria spp. (MIC90S, 0.015 microgram/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 0.03 microgram/ml), and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.12 micrgram/ml), and these results were comparable to those obtained for ciprofloxacin and trovafloxacin. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the quinolones were more active than the beta-lactam agents but BAY 12-8039 was less active than ciprofloxacin. Strains of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were fourfold more susceptible to BAY 12-8039 and trovafloxacin (MIC90S, 2 micrograms/ml) than to ciprofloxacin. BAY 12-8039 was as active as trovafloxacin but more active than ciprofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml) and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus auerus (MIC90S, 0.12 micrograms/ml). The activity of BAY 12-8039 against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml) was lower than that against methicillin-susceptible strains. BAY 12-8039 was active against anaerobes (MIC90S < or = 2 micrograms/ml), being three- to fourfold more active against Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella spp., and Clostridium difficile than was ciprofloxacin. Against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, BAY 12-8039 exhibited activity comparable to that of rifampin (MICs < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml). Against Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydia pneumoniae BAY 12-8039 was more active (MICs < or = 0.12 microgram/ml) than either ciprofloxacin or erythromycin and exhibited a greater lethal effect than either to these two agents. The protein binding of BAY 12-8039 was determined at 1 and 5 micrograms/ml as 30 and 26.4%, respectively. The presence of human serum (at 20 or 70%) had no marked effect on the in vitro activity of BAY 12-8039.
TI  - Aerobic bacteria isolated from blood cultures of patients and their antibiotic susceptibilities in Harare, Zimbabwe.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent of involvement of different types of gram positive and gram negative bacteria and incidence of monomicrobial and polymicrobial cases in patients with bacteremia but without a record of the underlying clinical conditions of the patients. Antibiotic susceptibility patterns of isolates were also determined to guide clinicians in the management of such bacteremic cases especially where routine sensitivity testing is not performed. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: The study comprised patients attending different clinics in Parirenyatwa Hospital, Harare. SUBJECTS: A total of 817 blood cultures from patients, comprising 469 and 348 males and females respectively. There were no records of the underlying clinical conditions of the patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence rates of organisms and their antibiograms using standard techniques and Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Results obtained revealed that only 303(37.1%) of the 817 total samples screened were positive for either monomicrobial or polymicrobial bacteremia. Two hundred and eighteen (71.9%) and 85 of positive cultures were Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria respectively. Coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) strains were the predominant organisms isolated (42.9%). Other organisms isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (11.6%), Escherichia coli (6.9%), Salmonella spp. (8.3%), Klebsiella spp. (5.3%), whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter and Micrococcus species each accounted for less than 4%. Antibiogram patterns showed multiple resistance of S. aureus and CNS to Penicillin, Erythromycin and Methicillin. All isolates of S. pyogenes (10), S. pneumoniae (18) and Micrococcus spp (10). were susceptible to penicillin. Ciprofloxacin, Clindamycin, Fusidic acid and Gentamycin were highly active against gram positive organisms except that Gentamycin was inactive against S. pneumoniae. Ceforoxime, Erythromycin and Ceftriazone also showed good activities against Gram positive organisms. All (10) isolates of P. aeruginosa were susceptible to Polymyxin B, Carbenicillin and Ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin, Norfloxacin and Gentamycin were highly active against all Gram negative bacteria. CONCLUSION: For infections due to both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, Ciprofloxacin and Gentamycin would be appropriate for therapy whereas Fusidic acid and Clindamycin may, in addition, be recommended for Gram positive organisms. It is also concluded that a prevalence rate of 37.1% of bacteremic cases existed in the sampled population and that monomicrobial cases were more predominant.
TI  - Inhibition by dextran of Pseudomonas aeruginosa adherence to epithelial cells.
AB  - Adherence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to cells of the respiratory tract of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) appears to be a necessary precondition for colonization and infection. To date no effective anti-adhesive strategy has been devised for preventing P. aeruginosa infection in these vulnerable hosts. The purpose of these studies was to evaluate the potential for preventing adhesion of P. aeruginosa to epithelial cells with dextran. Dextran (3,000-70,000 MW) inhibited adhesion of P. aeruginosa to buccal and A549 pulmonary epithelial cells; the 3,000 MW compound, at 10 mM was most inhibitory. Adhesion was inhibited optimally at pH 7.4 and was independent of charge; dextran and dextran sulfate were equally inhibitory. Dextran was most inhibitory if added to the epithelial cells before the P. aeruginosa; adhesion was reversed only minimally by adding dextran after the bacteria were bound. The inhibitory effect appeared to be nonspecific because other neutral polysaccharides (glycogen and mannan) were also inhibitory, dextran blocked attachment of other respiratory tract pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Group A streptococcus, and Haemophilus influenzae), and because dextran did not bind specifically to bacteria or to epithelial cells. Dextran is an inexpensive and nontoxic agent and may be useful in patients with CF to prevent colonization and infection with P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in India and the United States.
AB  
TI  - Identification of a gene, pilF, required for type 4 fimbrial biogenesis and twitching motility in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Many bacterial pathogens produce a class of surface structures called type 4 fimbriae. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa these fimbriae are responsible for adhesion and translocation across host epithelial surfaces. We have identified a novel gene involved in the complex process of type 4 fimbrial biogenesis. This gene, termed pilF, is located on SpeI fragment S at 30 min on the P. aeruginosa genomic map, which is the sixth region on the chromosome shown to contain a fimbrial-associated gene. The PilF protein has a predicted M(r) of 22402, and together with a highly homologous upstream ORF shares a chromosomal arrangement similar to that found in Haemophilus influenzae. A pilF mutant is blocked in the export/assembly of the fimbrial subunit PilA, and accumulates this protein in the membrane fraction. Complementation studies indicate that the cloned pilF gene is able to restore the expression of surface fimbriae, twitching motility and susceptibility to fimbrial-specific bacteriophage.
TI  - PhhR, a divergently transcribed activator of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene cluster of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa was recently found to possess a cluster of structural genes encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PhhA), carbinolamine dehydratase (PhhB), and aromatic aminotransferase (PhhC). We now report the presence, in the flanking upstream region, of a divergently transcribed gene (phhR) encoding an activator protein. Inactivation of phhR markedly reduced expression of the structural genes. PhhR belongs to the large prokaryote family of sigma 54 enhancer-binding proteins, and activation of the phh operon by PhhR in P. aeruginosa required rpoN. The closest homologues of PhhR are the TyrR proteins from Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. E. coli TyrR is an unusual member of the homologue family in that the transcriptional units regulated by tyrR are driven by sigma 70 promoters. P. aeruginosa phhR was able to replace E. coli tyrR as a repressor of the aroF-tyrA operon (but not as an activator of mtr) in the heterologous E. coli system. Two regions that resemble E. coli TyrR boxes were identified in the intervening region between phhR and phhA. We propose that one or both boxes may be the target of PhhR acting as an autogenous repressor at a sigma 70 promoter in one direction. In the other direction, one or both boxes may be the upstream activator sequence targeted by PhhR to facilitate expression of the phh operon from a sigma 54 promoter. The phh operon was strongly induced in fructose- or glucose-based minimal medium by L-phenylalanine. Inactivation of phhR in P. aeruginosa abolished ability to utilize either L-phenylalanine or L-tyrosine as a sole source of carbon for growth.
TI  - The effect of bacterial toxins on levels of intracellular adenosine nucleotides and human ciliary beat frequency.
AB  - Toxins that slow ciliary beat are virulence determinants of bacteria that infect  or invade ciliated epithelial surfaces. We have previously shown that the effect of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa toxin pyocyanin on ciliary beat is associated with a fall in intracellular cAMP and ATP. We have now investigated whether reduction in intracellular adenosine nucleotides might be a common mechanism of action of other bacterial toxins which slow ciliary beat. Two other P. aeruginosa toxins, 1-hydroxyphenazine (1-HP) and rhamnolipid, and two Haemophilus influenzae fractions produced by gel filtration of broth cultures were tested. The effect on human nasal epithelium ciliary beat frequency (CBF), and intracellular cAMP and ATP were measured, and the effect of two pharmacological agents, dibutyryl cAMP and salmeterol, on these changes was assessed. 1-HP, rhamnolipid and the two H. influenzae fractions slowed CBF before there was significant release of lactate dehydrogenase from the cells. The toxins also caused a fall in intracellular cAMP and ATP. Dibutyryl cAMP and salmeterol at the concentrations used do not increase baseline CBF, but diminished the fall in CBF and intracellular adenosine nucleotides. The cAMP and ATP levels in these studies were combined with those previously obtained with pyocyanin. there was a good correlation between cAMP and ATP levels and CBF. Bacterial toxins which slow CBF may act by causing a fall in intracellular adenosine nucleotides, and agents which stimulate cAMP may prevent toxin-induced slowing of ciliary beat.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of sulbactam/cefoperazone for lower respiratory tract infections. Correlation between the efficacy of sulbactam/cefoperazone and beta-lactamase].
AB  - The efficacy and safety of sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) were evaluated in 42  patients with respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia (29 patients) and lower respiratory tract infections (5 patients). Overall clinical efficacy rates (excellent + good) were 79% in pneumonia and 80% in respiratory tract infections in 34 patients evaluated for clinical efficacy. It was excellent that the clinical efficacy rate was 92% in mild and moderate pneumonia. Pathogens isolated from sputa were 31 strains, including 8 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 7 of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 3 of Staphylococcus aureus and 3 of Haemophilus influenzae. Since the isolates were eradicated in 18 strains, replaced in 3, unchanged in 2 and unknown in 8, the overall eradication rate was 91%. The eradication rates were 89% in beta-lactamase producing strains and 100% in beta-lactamase positive sputum, and excellent or good in 19 (83%) of 23 patients with beta-lactamase negative sputum. The eradication rate was 88% in 5 patients with beta-lactamase positive sputum. One patient experienced a moderate rash. Abnormal laboratory test values were observed in 10 patients (26.3%), but these abnormalities were mild and transient. These results suggested that SBT/CPZ was effective and safe for the treatment of respiratory tract infections caused by beta-lactamase producing as well as beta-lactamase non-producing bacteria.
TI  - Microbiology and management of sinusitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: The pathophysiology, microbiology, and treatment of acute and chronic sinusitis are reviewed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current literature is reviewed. REVIEW: Sinusitis generally develops as a complication of viral or allergic inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. Bacterial pathogens contribute to the inflammatory process-Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are predominant in acute sinusitis, while anaerobic bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus are predominant in chronic sinusitis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has emerged as a potential pathogen in the immunocompromised patients and in those who have nasal tubes or catheters. Many of these organisms recovered from sinusitis became resistant to penicillins either through the production of beta-lactamase (H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. aureus, Fusobacterium sp., and Prevotella sp.) or through changes in the penicillin-binding protein (S. pneumoniae). The pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria is expressed directly through their ability to cause infections, and indirectly through the production of beta-lactamase. CONCLUSIONS: The indirect pathogenicity is conveyed not only by surviving penicillin therapy, but also by "shielding" penicillin-susceptible pathogens from the drug. The direct and indirect virulent characteristics of these bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections. Proper therapy, with antimicrobial and decongestants combined when indicated with surgical drainage and correction of pathology, constitutes the cornerstone of management of sinusitis.
TI  - Mechanisms of bacterial antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Infectious complications are major contributing factors to morbidity and mortality in the ICU setting. Organisms frequently encountered in the ICU include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae (particularly in trauma victims), enterococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumanii, Escherichia coli, and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia. Antibiotics have played a major role in the treatment of infections caused by such bacterial pathogens. Organisms have responded to the antibiotic challenge, however, evolving and developing resistance to all available antimicrobial agents to a greater or lesser degree. Specific mechanisms of resistance include reductions in cell-wall membrane permeability, alterations of antimicrobial agent target sites, enzymatic inactivation of antibiotics, and development of bypass pathways around antimicrobial targets. This article describes, pathogen by pathogen, antimicrobial agents that are useful for the treatment of infection in the ICU setting and the mechanisms whereby bacteria have short-circuited our antimicrobial armamentarium.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of tosufloxacin against recently obtained clinical isolates].
AB  - To evaluate antimicrobial activities of tosufloxacin (TFLX), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of TFLX and other drugs were determined against clinical isolates that were obtained in our laboratory from February of 1993 to January of 1994 (Period I), and from February of 1995 to January of 1996 (Period II). The results are summarized as follows: 1. Compared to MIC90's reported by others for TFLX in the 1980's, those obtained by us against beta-streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Peptostreptococcus spp., Haemophilus influenzae and Salmonella spp. were similar to, but those obtained against other bacteria were higher than those reported values. 2. Detection frequencies of resistant strains to TFLX were compared between Period I and Period II. MIC90's of TFLX against Staphylococcus spp., Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-streptococci, S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp. were lower in Period II than in Period I. TFLX-insensitive or -resistant H. influenzae were found among strains isolated in either of the Periods. 3. Most of the TFLX-resistant Gram-negative organisms tested were also resistant to other NQ's. 4. TFLX showed strong antimicrobial activities against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - [Prospective study of the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia among patients in a general hospital].
AB  - We prospectively studied the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia among all patients who were admitted to our hospital from July 1994 to June 1995. Tests for microbial pathogens including Chlamydia spp. and Legionella spp. were performed and diagnoses were made with strict criteria. A total 110 patients with 111 episodes of pneumonia were evaluated, and a pathogen was identified in 61 episodes (55%). The most common pathogen was Streptococcus pneumoniae (18%), followed by Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia spp. Infection with Legionella pneumophila was not found. Dual pathogens were identified in five episodes. Few prospective studies of the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia have been done in Japan. To prepare guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia in Japan, a national study of the etiology of pneumonia is necessary.
TI  - Clinical applications of a new parenteral antibiotic in the treatment of severe bacterial infections.
AB  - Cephalosporins are one of the mainstays of antibiotic therapy, and third-generation cephalosporins are first-line agents for the treatment of many types of serious infections, including those of nosocomial origin. Gaps in activity of currently available third-generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime, cefoperazone, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime, and increasing reports of gram-negative bacilli resistance to some of these agents, especially Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp., make it necessary to investigate new compounds. Cefepime, a fourth-generation cephalosporin with a wide range of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multi-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae, was evaluated in comparison with ceftazidime for the treatment of serious infections in hospitalized patients. Ceftazidime is a commonly prescribed third-generation cephalosporin used for empiric treatment of serious infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and skin and skin-structure infection. This investigation was an open, randomized comparative study involving 882 patients in North America. Cefepime 2 g every 12 hours demonstrated similar efficacy to that of ceftazidime 2 g every 8 hours for the treatment of pneumonia and urinary tract infection (including cases associated with concurrent bacteremia), and skin and skin-structure infections. The bacteriologic responses were generally >85%. The most common pathogens isolated were Escherichia coll, Streptococcus pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus, group B. Overall, approximately 94% of pathogens isolated in pretreatment cultures were susceptible to cefepime and ceftazidime. Cefepime and ceftazidime were well tolerated; only 3% of patients in each group discontinued therapy because of an adverse event. The most common adverse events were headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and rash. The results of this study indicate that cefepime is a promising, effective, and safe single-agent therapy for serious infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Severe pulmonary infections in AIDS patients.
AB  - Pulmonary infections are a very common complication in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. These infections may be severe enough to initiate the admission of these patients to intensive care units (ICU). Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is the most frequent cause of ICU admission because of acute respiratory failure. Mortality of ICU-admitted patients with this infection has changed with time. Initial reports confirmed a high mortality (80% to 90%). After 1985, the mortality rate decreased (50%). Factors such as the use of corticosteroids, better patient care, and a better knowledge of the disease probably explain this change. In recent years (1990 to 1995), mortality has worsened again, perhaps, because ICU facilities were offered more liberally to patients failing aggressive conventional treatment, including adjuvant therapy with corticosteroids. However, for those patients able to be discharged, the prognosis is not worse than expected according to the stage of their human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection and immunologic status. Consequently, at least a limited period of ICU care and some respiratory support (either continuous positive airway pressure or mechanical ventilation) should be considered and offered to all HIV-1-infected patients with PCP and respiratory failure. Cytomegalovirus may be another cause of severe pulmonary infection in AIDS patients. This infection is difficult to diagnose; hence, it should be suspected when patients with PCP do not progress appropriately, or when no responsible pulmonary pathogen is found. When associated with PCP, mortality is very high. Disseminated tuberculosis is another potential cause of severe respiratory failure and respiratory secretions should be routinely examined for acid-fast bacilli in AIDS patients with pulmonary infiltrates. Finally, bacterial pneumonia (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) may also be the etiological agents of severe acute respiratory failure. Empiric antibacterial treatment to cover these microorganisms should be given when a bacterial agent is suspected.
TI  - A human temporal bone study of acute bacterial meningogenic labyrinthitis.
AB  - It is well established that sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is an important sequela of acute bacterial meningitis. Previous human temporal bone histopathologic studies have suggested that such hearing loss is due to labyrinthitis. This study involved a detailed and systematic evaluation of the auditory and vestibular end-organs in 41 human temporal bones from patients with acute bacterial meningitis, aimed at describing the spectrum of histopathologic changes within the labyrinth, ascertaining likely routes for spread of infection from the meninges to the inner ear, and comparing the data from humans with those described in a rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. Our study revealed the following: (a) Suppurative labyrinthitis occurred in 20 (49%) bones. Of these 20 bones, the cochlea was affected in all, whereas the vestibular organs were involved in 10. Eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids without the presence of inflammatory cells (so-called "serous" labyrinthitis) occurred in 14 of the remaining 21 bones. This staining occurred primarily within the vestibular system. Its significance and pathogenesis remains unknown; (b) Sensory and neural structures of the inner ear appeared intact in the majority of specimens, including bones with suppurative labyrinthitis and those with eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids. This finding raises the possibility of preventing or reversing SNHL by therapeutic intervention. Spiral ganglion cells were severely degenerated in 12% of bones, indicating a retrocochlear site of hearing loss in addition to the cochlea. This subset of patients may perform poorly after cochlear implantation; (c) It has been traditionally assumed that irreversible and permanent SNHL is caused by suppurative labyrinthitis, whereas reversible SNHL is caused by serous labyrinthitis. Our findings question the validity of these assumptions; (d) The data were consistent with the hypothesis that both the cochlear modiolus and cochlear aqueduct can serve as potential pathways for spread of infection from the meninges to the inner ear; (e) There were many similarities in the histopathology of the inner ear in humans when compared with the rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. A notable difference was that the cochlear aqueduct appeared to be the sole pathway for spread of infection in the rabbit, whereas in the human, both the modiolus and aqueduct were possible pathways.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1994)].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections were collected in cooperation with institutions located throughout Japan, since 1981. IKEMOTO et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. Results obtained from these investigations are discussed. In 23 institutions around the entire Japan, 492 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputum of 421 patients with lower respiratory tract infections from October 1994 to September 1995. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 70 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 101 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 92 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 61 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 25 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 48 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, 14 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. 1. S. aureus. S. aureus strains for which MICs of oxacillin were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) accounted for 51.4%, but the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria decreased comparing to the previous year's 56.0%. Vancomycin showed the highest activity against S. aureus with MIC80 of 0.5 microgram/ml. 2. S. pneumoniae. Most of the drugs tested showed potent activities against S. pneumoniae. Imipenem of carbapenems showed the most potent activity with MIC80 was 0.063 microgram/ml. Erythromycin and clindamycin showed low activities with MIC80s > or = 256 micrograms/ml. Among these strains, however, 46.5% and 68.3% of strains, were quite sensitive toward these agents, respectively, with MICs of 0.063 microgram/ml. 3. H. influenzae. The activities of all drugs were potent against H. influenzae tested. Cefmenoxime a cephem, showed the most potent activity, the MICs of this drug against all of the 92 strains were 0.063 microgram/ml. Ofloxacin also showed a potent activity, and inhibited about 96% of strains with MIC of 0.063 microgram/ml. 4. P. aeruginosa (mucoid strains). Tobramycin showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) with MIC80 of 0.5 microgram/ml. Gentamicin, arbekacin and ciprofloxacin showed next potent activities, and their MIC80s were 2 micrograms/ml. 5. P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). Tobramycin showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) with MIC80 of 2 micrograms/ml. Comparing to the activities against P. aeruginosa (mucoid strains), the activities of all the drugs tested were lower against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). 6. K. pneumoniae. Carumonam showed the most potent activity against K. pneumoniae with MIC80 of 0.063 microgram/ml. Cefozopran showed the next most potent activity with MIC80 of 0.125 microgram/ml. Ampicillin and cephems except cefpodoxime, cefozopran and cefditoren showed low activities and their MIC80s were > or = 16 micrograms/ml, and their MICs were all higher than > or = 4 micrograms/ml. 7. M. (B.) catarrhalis. Imipenem and ofloxacin showed the most potent activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, their MIC80s were 0.063 microgram/ml. Erythromycin and minocycline showed the next highest activities with their MIC80s at 0.25 microgram/ml. Also, we investigated year to year changes in the background of patients, the respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology of bacteria. Patients characteristics, in this period of investigation showed varieties of infectious diseases found in patients in a high age bracket, and the patients over age 60 accounted for 62.0% of all the cases. Different lower respiratory tract infectious were distributed as follows: chronic bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia accounted for the greatest number of cases with 35.6%, 27.1%, respectively, followed by
TI  - An evaluation of the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  - Tazobactam is a new, irreversible inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases of staphylococci, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of the TEM and SHV types found in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species and beta-lactamases of anerobes such as Bacteroides species. Its combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum ureido-penicillin, would be expected to improve the activity of piperacillin against staphylococci, TEM and SHV beta-lactamase producing Gram negative bacteria and anerobes. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of piperacillin/tazobactam were determined for 1952 individual patient isolates of Gram positive and negative bacteria causing significant infections and compared with MIC values for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. MICs were determined by agar dilution (NCCLS 1990 and 1992). Piperacillin/tazobactam had excellent activity against methicillin susceptible staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, enterococci and organisms of the Bacteroides fragilis group. It was also active against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates tested. It was not active against extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella species and some high level TEM and SHV beta-lactamase producing E. coli and Klebsiella species. Activity against Gram negative organisms capable of producing chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases was good, since in most organisms tested, the enzymes were not induced in sufficient quantities to cause antibiotic resistance. However some Enterobacter species were derepressed hyperproducing mutants; these isolates showed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam since tazobactam does not inhibit these Class I beta lactamases. Activity was superior to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid for Gram negative rods. Imipenem was the most active agent against ESBL producing Klebsiella species. Piperacillin/tazobactam has a suitable spectrum of activity in vitro to suggest its use in monotherapy of mixed anerobic infections, mixed respiratory infections such as aspiration pneumonia and, in combination with an aminoglycoside, it would provide Gram positive as well as Gram negative cover of febrile episodes in immunosuppressed patients.
TI  - Bronchoalveolar lavage or oropharyngeal cultures to identify lower respiratory pathogens in infants with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - As collections of lower respiratory tract specimens from young children with cystic fibrosis (CF) are difficult, we determined whether oropharyngeal cultures predicted lower airway pathogens. During 1992-1994, 75 of 90 (83%) infants with CF diagnosed by neonatal screening had 150 simultaneous bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and oropharyngeal specimens collected for quantitative bacterial culture at a mean age of 17 months (range, 1-52). Ten children undergoing bronchoscopy for stridor served as controls. Total and differential cell counts and interleukin-8 concentrations were measured in BAL fluid. A subset of bacterial pathogens were typed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. A non-linear relationship with inflammatory markers supported a diagnosis of lower airway infection when > or = 10(5) colony-forming units/ml were detected. This criterion was met in 47 (31%) BAL cultures from 37 (49%) children. Staphylococcus aureus (19%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11%), and Hemophilus influenzae (8%) were the major lower airway pathogens. In oropharyngeal cultures, S. aureus (47%), Escherichia coli (23%), H. influenzae (15%), and P. aeruginosa (13%) predominated. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of oropharyngeal cultures for pathogens causing lower respiratory infections were 82%, 83%, 41%, and 97%, respectively. When there was agreement between paired oropharyngeal and BAL cultures, genetic fingerprinting showed some strains of the same organism were unrelated. We conclude that oropharyngeal cultures do not reliably predict the presence of bacterial pathogens in the lower airways of young CF children.
TI  - In vitro activity of the tricyclic beta-lactam GV104326.
AB  - GV104326 is a novel tricyclic beta-lactam (a trinem or, formerly, tribactam). The in vitro activity of GV104326 was compared with those of cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpirome, and ciprofloxacin. GV104326 had in vitro activity generally similar to that of cefixime against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [MIC90], < or = 2 micrograms/ml), with cefuroxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid being 8- to 32-fold less active and with cefpirome being 4- to 8-fold more active against members of this family. The trinem had no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90, > 128 micrograms/ml) but was the most active agent against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. GV104326 was particularly active against gram-positive cocci. Ninety percent of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to 0.03 microgram of GV104326 per ml, making it the most active agent studied. Enterococci and Lancefield group A and B streptococci were generally equally or somewhat more susceptible to GV104326 than they were to amoxicillin. Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were highly susceptible to GV104326, and those strains which showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin were generally twofold more susceptible to the trinem than to amoxicillin. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were highly susceptible to GV104326 (MIC90s, 0.12 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively). The anaerobes Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus spp. were more susceptible to the trinems (formerly tribactams) than to the other agents studied.
TI  - Surfactant protein A stimulates phagocytosis of specific pulmonary pathogens by alveolar macrophages.
AB  - Surfactant protein A (SP-A) regulates alveolar macrophage function and has been implicated in the mediation of pulmonary host defense. Our goals were to characterize the interaction of SP-A with various pulmonary pathogens, to investigate the mechanism of SP-A-mediated phagocytosis using an assay that distinguishes bound from internalized bacteria by quenching the fluorescence of extracellular bacteria, and to examine further the interactions of SP-A and the structurally homologous protein complement component 1q (C1q) with alveolar macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes. We found that SP-A binds to and increases the phagocytosis of Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Group A Streptococcus; SP-A aggregates only H. influenzae. SP-A neither binds to, aggregates, nor stimulates the phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We have also found that bronchoalveolar lavage stimulates phagocytosis and that this stimulation is reduced by an anti-SP-A antibody. While the enhancement of phagocytosis by SP-A is inhibited in blood monocytes adhered to C1q-coated surfaces, which presumably clusters the C1q receptor on the basal surface of the cell, alveolar macrophages on C1q-coated slides show no significant change in their response to SP-A. In summary, SP-A stimulates the phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages of specific pulmonary pathogens to which it binds, but aggregation is not required for the effect. Additionally, the role of the C1q receptor in the response to SP-A may differ between monocytes and alveolar macrophages.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new parenteral penem, sulopenem].
AB  - Eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, Streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, Enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml, Enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, Escherichia coli CS2(R+): 0.10 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, Proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, Morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, Providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, Serratia marcescens: 1.56 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and Bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. Sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam against Gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa. Sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of PBPs of S. aureus, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, even of P. aeruginosa. Affinities of sulopenem to PBPs-1 and -3 of S. aureus, PBP-2 of E. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (IPM). Sulopenem generally has small Ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to Ia and IIb types of beta-lactamases than IPM. No synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. However, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. The cells of E. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 MIC of sulopenem. Moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-Is. Sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.
TI  - In-vitro interaction of azithromycin and fluoroquinolones against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the combined in-vitro effects of azithromycin plus the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin or lomefloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. METHODS: Fractional inhibitory (FIC) and fractional bactericidal concentration indices of azithromycin and the fluoroquinolone were determined using a microtiter-checkerboard method. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, Xanthomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus were studied. Fourteen strains of S. aureus were also studied in time-kill curves with azithromycin (4 mg/L), lomefloxacin (6 mg/L) and the two in combination. RESULTS: No synergism or antagonism was found in inhibitory assays. However, bactericidal assays revealed antagonism with some strains of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, X. maltophilia, A. calcoaceticus, P. aeruginosa, P. cepacia, K. pneumoniae and E. coli. Kill-curve results with 14 strains of S. aureus showed no antagonism with four strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and antagonism with one strain of MRSA and seven methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). CONCLUSIONS: In-vitro exposure to combinations of azithromycin and a fluoroquinolone does not produce a synergistic effect. Antagonism was found in bactericidal assays against some gram-negative bacteria and MSSA; caution is therefore recommended in the use of macrolides and quinolones against these organisms.
TI  - Nosocomial pneumonia in mechanically ventilated adult patients: epidemiology and  prevention in 1996.
AB  - Mechanically ventilated patients have a higher incidence of pneumonia and mortality than do nonventilated patients. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is diagnosed clinically, by bronchoscopy or "blind" bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or protected specimen brush (PSB), and by quantitative endobronchial aspirates (QEA). VAP is usually caused by bacteria, but Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, viruses, and fungi are also potential pathogens. Bacteria causing nosocomial pneumonia may be part of the patient's endogenous flora, originate from other patients, hospital personnel, or environmental sources. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp, and Staphylococcus aureus are the most common causative agents in late-onset nosocomial pneumonia, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae are more commonly found in early-onset pneumonia. Aspiration appears to be the major route for the entry of bacteria into the lower respiratory tract. Host factors, oropharyngeal and gastric colonization, cross-infection, and complications from the use of antibiotics and nasogastric and endotracheal tubes increases the risk of bacterial VAP. A working knowledge of the epidemiology and strategies for prevention of VAP should reduce infection rates, morbidity, and mortality in critically ill patients.
TI  - Microbial causes of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - Aspiration of microorganisms colonizing the oropharynx is the main route of bacterial entry to lower airways in mechanically ventilated patients. Examination of the microbial flora involved in ventilator-associated pneumonia shows that only few species, among the many oropharynx microorganisms, are responsible for the majority of lower respiratory tract colonizations and infections in intubated patients. Underlying disease, length of intubation, and type and duration of prior antibiotic therapy are the most important factors related with the causative flora of respiratory infections in these patients. Except in certain populations (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] patients who may be colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and unencapsulated Hemophilus influenzae are the predominant respiratory pathogens within the first week of intubation in critically ill patients. These microorganisms are subsequently replaced by multiresistant flora, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococci or Acinetobacter baumanii. This change of flora takes place as a consequence of prior antibiotic therapy among other factors. Fungi have to be taken in account particularly in the presence of severe immunodepression. All of these multiresistant pathogens (particularly P aeruginosa) are responsible for most of the deaths directly related to pneumonia; therefore, the early recognition of causative agents and appropriate antibiotic therapy are of great importance determining outcome. This strategy represents the most efficient approach to managing patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia.
TI  - Comparison of oral ciprofloxacin and amoxycillin in treating infective exacerbations of bronchiectasis in Hong Kong.
AB  - A randomised double-blind controlled clinical trial was conducted to compare oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg b.d.) and amoxycillin (1 g t.d.s.) in the treatment of infective exacerbations of bronchiectasis. The commonest organism isolated from sputum was Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which accounted for 34% of all positive sputum cultures. Other Pseudomonas species and Haemophilus influenzae, accounted for 19%, respectively. Ciprofloxacin produced better clinical response, a higher sputum to serum antibiotic level (mean of 0.65 in the ciprofloxacin group vs. 0.18 in amoxycillin group, p = 0.0001), broader spectrum of antibacterial activity and less side-effect. It was also better tolerated by patients. The findings suggest that ciprofloxacin is an effective treatment of infective exacerbations of bronchiectasis.
TI  - [Microbiological study of the respiratory tract in children with cystic fibrosis].
AB  - PURPOSE: Pulmonary infections is a main cause of morbimortality in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis. The objective of this study was to know the flora implicated in respiratory pathology of all mucoviscidotic children attending Hospital Sant Joan de Deu of Barcelona. METHODS: Quantitative cultures from respiratory samples (most of them: sputum) of 26 patients were performed from January 91 to June 93. There were 13 girls and 13 boys, aged 1 to 13 years (mean: 7 years). RESULTS: 282 microorganisms were isolated from 203 positive samples. Cultures of 88.4% of patients yielded in some moment Haemophilus influenzae, 82.6% of them Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 65.3% Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 50% Streptococcus pneumoniae, 38.4% Staphylococcus aureus. The most prevalent microorganism was P. aeruginosa (66%) followed by H. influenzae (29%) and S. aureus (26.6%). 59% of P. aeruginosa strains showed a mucoid phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Haemophilus sp. causes short term infections that affect children of all ages, whereas infections due to P. aeruginosa persist in spite of correct antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Diffusion of 3-quaternary ammonium cephem antibiotics into cerebrospinal fluid of patients with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Cefepime and cefpirome are new beta-lactamase resistant parenteral cephalosporin  derivatives whose spectrum of activity makes them suitable for use in the treatment of severe infections such as bacterial meningitis. However, the published information on the penetration of these new agents into human CSF and on their use in the treatment of bacterial meningitis are really scarce. Experimental studies have shown that cefepime and cefpirome penetrated remarkably well into the CSF of animals infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mean changes in bacterial colony count in CSF after cefpirome or cefepime administration express the antibacterial activity of these drugs. Studies in patients show that cefepime and cefpirome crossed the blood-brain barrier and reached concentrations in the CSF that are bactericidal against most potential pathogens. Higher levels are likely to be achieved with multiple dosing and in the presence of inflamed meninges. No study has been performed to investigate the efficacy of cefpirome in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. Cefepime was as effective and safe as cefotaxime for treatment of patients with bacterial meningitis as shown in the only clinical trial.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1993)].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from respiratory tract infections were collected in cooperation with institutions located throughout Japan, since 1981, and the Ikemotor et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of the isolates of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and the relationships between the isolates and backgrounds of the patients and so forth each year. We discuss the results in detail. In 20 institutions around the entire Japan from October 1993 to September 1994, 584 strains of bacteria were isolated mainly from sputa of 473 patients with respiratory tract infections and presumed to be the etiological agents. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 91 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 98 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 122 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 91 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid), 34 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid), 42 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were measured except the strains which died during transportation. 1. S. aureus S. aureus strain sfor which MICs of methicillin was higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) accounted for 56.0%, but this frequency of the drug resistant bacteria was lower than the previous year's 61.4%. Arbekacin and vancomycin showed the highest activities against MRSA and MIC80s were 1 microgram/ml. 2. S. pneumoniae Benzylpenicillin among the penicillins showed potent activities against S. pneumoniae. Cefuzonam, cefotaxime and cefmenoxime among the cephems showed excellent antimicrobial activities against S. pneumoniae. Imipenem; carbapenems, showed the most potent activity, and MIC90 was 0.063 microgram/ml. 3. H. influenzae All the drugs tested were quite active against H. influenzae. Cefotaxime, cefmenoxime, cefuzonam and cefixime among the cephems showed the most potent activities, and MIC90 were 0.063 microgram/ml against H. influenzae. Ofloxacin also showed MIC90 of 0.063 microgram/ml. 4. P. aeruginosa (mucoid) Tobramycin showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid), and MIC80 was 1 microgram/ml. Ceftazidime, cefsulodin, imipenem, aztreonam, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin showed potent activities with MIC80s of 2 micrograms/ml. 5. P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid) Tobramycin showed the highest activity against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid), and MIC80 was 1 microgram/ml, followed by ciprofloxacin with MIC80 of 2 micrograms/ml. Comparing to activities against P. aeruginosa (mucoid), all the drugs tested had relatively low activities against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid). 6. K. pneumoniae. The activities of all drugs except ampicillin and minocycline were high against K. pneumoniae. Cefozopran, imipenem and carumonam showed the highest activities and MIC80s were 0.125 microgram/ml. Flomoxef showed the next highest activities with an MIC80 of 0.25 microgram/ml. 7. M.(B.) catarrhalis Imipenem showed the most potent activity against M.(B.) catarrhalis, with an MIC80 of 0.063 microgram/ml, followed minocycline and ofloxacin with their MIC80s of 0.125 microgram/ml. We also investigated year to year changes in the background of patients, as well as types of respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiological agents. As for patients background, there were many infectious diseases found among patients a high age bracket, and the patients over age 60 accounted for 61.3% of the diseases. The distribution by respiratory tract infections was as follows: chronic bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia accounted for the greatest numbers of cases with 31.1% and 26.0%, respectively, followed by bronchiectasis with 10.4%. In this year chronic bronchitis under age 29 were 41.7%, thus was much higher than 12.5% in previous year. This marked change was first noted in your research during the recent 5 years. As for frequencies of etiologic bacteria by respiratory tract infections, S. pneumoniae (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)
TI  - [Bacteriology of the nose and sinuses].
AB  - The authors, on the basis of 140 cases, analyze the bacterial flora of essentially chronic rhino-sinusitis observed in hospital consultations at the Pellegrin Hospital, the referral centre of the Aquitaine region. Samples taken in the operating theatre from 100 cases, by aspiration and mucosal biopsy, were studied in aerobic and anaerobic media. The results marked by the scarcity of sterile samples and of anaerobic germs, evidence the predominance of an aerobic flora, with in particular Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic Streptococci. No significant difference was recorded between the bacteriology of acute sinusitis as against chronic sinusitis. The flora of sinusitis appear to depend more on the age factor than on the pathogenic type. Branhamella catharralis is present only in patients under 30. The enterobacteria appear in the adult 30-50 year-old age group and, as from the age of 50, are combined by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which account for 18% of the strains. These two types of germs then appear to be predominant over the Staphylococci and the Haemophilus.
TI  - Tonsillar focal infection: clinical observations of low grade fever.
AB  - Thirty patients (above 18 years) who had complained of low grade fever were diagnosed as having tonsillar focal infection. We performed tonsillectomies on all the patients. A total of 24 were cured and 6 patients improved after the operation. These results indicate that tonsillectomy is often an effective treatment for tonsillar focal infection. However, the provocation test did not always give a good result.
TI  - Comparative bacteriology of the surface of normal and pathological palatine tonsils in children.
AB  - There are only few studies on the normal bacteriology of tonsils. The purpose of  this study was to acquire knowledge about the normal microflora: patients without recurrent tonsillitis (RT) and without tonsil hypertrophy (TH) and to compare these results with the pathological microflora: patients who have recurrent tonsillitis and/or tonsillar hypertrophy. We did 132 cultures of tonsil surface obtained from normal children and 96 cultures from pathological surfaces during the summer and in the winter. Comparing normal and pathological groups, we found Neisseria spp and Enterobacteria spp more frequently in the normal group. There are differences in the surface microflora of tonsils from normal persons and from individuals with tonsillitis.
TI  - Potential of preventing Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients: experimental studies in animals.
AB  - In patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), respiratory tract infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae are followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa with increasing age. Chronic endobronchial lung infection with P. aeruginosa is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. In Danish CF patients we noted that both onset of initial colonization and chronic lung infection with P. aeruginosa peaked during the winter months which is the season for respiratory virus infections. Virus may therefore pave the way for P. aeruginosa. We established a chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection in rats by embedding mucoid bacteria in seaweed alginate and installing the beads intratracheally into the lower part of the left lung. Although the rats did not suffer from CF, the antibody responses and the pathologic changes of the lungs mimicked the findings in CF patients. By using this model in normal and athymic rats we showed that the T-cell response during the "natural" course of the infection played no major role. In a model of acute P. aeruginosa pneumonia we found that the macroscopic inflammatory response of the lungs was immense and that the natural capacity to clear P. aeruginosa was very efficient and could not be improved by immunization, although high serum levels of IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies to P. aeruginosa alginate, LPS, exotoxin A and sonicate were induced. We developed a method for collecting and measuring IgA in saliva and noted that mucosal IgA antibodies were induced by vaccination; they did not significantly prevent inflammation, however. In the chronic rat model we succeeded to improve the survival significantly and to change the inflammatory response subsequent to vaccination from an acute type inflammation dominated by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) as in CF patients to a chronic type inflammation dominated by mononuclear leukocytes. Furthermore, we found that rats immunized with an alginate containing vaccine had a significantly earlier cellular shift to a chronic type inflammation as well as a significant reduction in the severity of the macroscopic inflammation compared to two other vaccine groups and to nonimmunized controls. Similar results were obtained in rats treated with the TH1 cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Several authors have shown that the lung tissue damage during chronic infection in CF patients is caused by a type III hypersensitivity reaction leading to release of elastase by PMNs surrounding the bacterial microcolonies. The cellular shift we have induced by vaccination and by IFN-gamma treatment therefore offers a possible new strategy for improving the clinical course in chronically infected CF patients.
TI  - Recent trends in clinical isolates from paranasal sinusitis.
AB  - Trends in the detection of causative pathogens and changes in bacterial counts in patients with sinusitis treated between January 1989 and December 1993 were investigated. In adult patients with chronic sinusitis, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS), Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Corynebacterium sp., Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae), and Moraxella catarrhalis were often isolated while Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and anaerobic bacteria were detected in 2.4% and 5.3% of patients, respectively. The bacteria isolated from adult patients with acute sinusitis and pediatric patients with either acute or chronic sinusitis were somewhat different from those of adult chronic sinusitis. No bacteria could be isolated from 5.8% of adult chronic sinusitis patients, 8.1% of adult acute sinusitis patients, and 3.1% of pediatric sinusitis patients. The detection rate for anaerobic bacteria has been rising in chronic sinusitis patients owing to improved detection techniques in recent years, while there has been no appreciable change in the isolation rate for other types of bacteria. When the pathogenicity of isolated bacteria was determined based on the amount of bacterial colonization it was found that P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and S. aureus were significant as causative pathogens in sinusitis, while CNS.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1992)].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections were collected in cooperation with institutions located throughout Japan since 1981, and Ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of the isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and the relationships between the isolates and characteristics of the patients and so forth each year. We discuss the results in detail. In 20 institutions around the entire Japan from October 1992 to September 1993, 690 strains of bacteria were isolated mainly from sputa of 549 patients with lower respiratory tract infections and presumed to be the etiological bacteria. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 101 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 121 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 122 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 92 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid), 32 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid), 52 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, 28 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were measured except the strains which died during transportation. 1. S. aureus S. aureus strains for which MICs of methicillin were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) accounted for 61.4% and the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria was higher than the previous year's 58.3%. MICs values indicated that arbekacin was as active as vancomycin against all the strains on S. aureus. 2. S. pneumoniae Benzylpenicillin among the penicillins showed potent activities against S. pneumoniae. Cefuzonam, cefazolin, cefotaxime and cefmenoxime among the cephems showed excellent antimicrobial activities against S. pneumoniae. Imipenem; carbapenems, showed the most potent activity, and MIC80 was 0.015 microgram/ml. 3. H. influenzae All the drugs tested were potent against H. influenzae. Ampicillin among the penicillins showed MIC80 1 microgram/ml against H. influenzae. Cefotaxime, cefmenoxime, cefuzonam and cefixime showed the most potent activities, and MIC80s were 0.063 microgram/ml. The antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin was equivalent to those of cephems. 4. P. aeruginosa (mucoid) Ciprofloxacin showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid), and MIC80 was 1 microgram/ml. Cefsulodin, aztreonam, carumonam and tobramycin showed the next most potent activities with an MIC80s of 2 micrograms/ml. 5. P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid) Tobramycin and ciprofloxacin showed the highest activities against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid) with an MIC80s of 2 micrograms/ml. Norfloxacin also showed some activity, and MIC80 was 4 micrograms/ml. Comparing to activities against P. aeruginosa (mucoid), all the drugs tested showed lower activities against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid). 6. K. pneumoniae The activities of all drugs except penicillins were high activities against K. pneumoniae. Carumonam showed the most potent activity with an MIC80 of 0.063 microgram/ml, followed by flomoxef, cefixime and cefozopran with their MIC80s of 0.125 microgram/ml. 7. M.(B.) catarrhalis Imipenem; carbapenems, showed the most potent activity against M.(B.) catarrhalis with an MIC80 0.063 microgram/ml. Minocycline and ofloxacin showed MIC80s 0.125 microgram/ml, respectively. We also investigated year to year changes in the background of patients, as well as types of respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiological bacteria. As for patients backgrounds, there were many infectious diseases found among patients in a high age bracket, and the patients over age 60 accounted for 60.8% of the diseases. The distribution by lower respiratory tract infections was as follows: bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for the greatest numbers of cases with 30.4%, 29.5%, respectively, followed by bronchiectasis with 12.2%. As for frequencies of etiologic bacteria for respiratory tract infections, H. influenzae: 22.2%, and S. pneumoniae: 15.1% in chronic bronchitis; S. pneumoniae: 2
TI  - Lung abscess in patients with AIDS.
AB  - We identified 31 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and lung abscess. All patients had advanced HIV disease, and the mean CD4 cell count was 17/mm3 (range, 2-50/mm3). Twenty-two patients (71%) had previous opportunistic infections, and 24 (77%) had previous pulmonary infections. Symptoms at the time of presentation included fever (90% of patients), cough (87%), dyspnea (35%), pleuritic chest pain (26%), and hemoptysis (10%). The microbiological etiology was established for 28 patients, and the pathogens recovered were bacteria (65%), Pneumocystis carinii (6%), fungi (3%), and mixed microorganisms (16%). The pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), P. carinii (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5), Staphylococcus aureus (4), Aspergillus species (3), viridans streptococcus (2), Haemophilus influenzae (1), Streptococcus milleri (1), Proteus mirabilis (1), and Cryptococcus neoformans (1). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was not isolated; two patients for whom a microbiological etiology was not established responded to antituberculous therapy. Patients were treated for 2-12 weeks; 25% of the patients received > 4 weeks of therapy. The outcome was poor: 36% of the patients had recurrences, and 19% died. In patients with AIDS, lung abscess is associated with advanced HIV infection, is due to a broad spectrum of pathogens, responds poorly to antibiotics, and has a poor prognosis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. Rationale for clinical use.
AB  - Most Gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (MIC90) were < or = 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. Enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant Enterococcus faecium. E. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. Among the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and Haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. are resistant. The drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant E. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus with the combination of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus infection in rabbits, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the MIC, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - The product of the pilQ gene is essential for the biogenesis of type IV pili in Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  - The product of the Neisseria gonorrhoeae omc gene possesses regions homologous to those found in members of a protein superfamily that are associated with the translocation of proteins and DNA-protein complexes across the outer membrane. Amongst its protein homologues, Omc has higher overall homology to PilQ, which is required for type IV pilus expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and OrfE, which is required for sequence-specific DNA uptake by Haemophilus influenzae. The function of Omc, however, is unknown and gonococcal omc mutants have not been described. We constructed gonococcal mutants expressing truncated forms of the protein, and found that these mutants are severely defective for both pilus expression and competence for natural transformation. To be consistent with pre-existing pilus gene nomenclature, we have redesignated the gene pilQ instead of omc, and its product, PilQ instead of Omc. The MS11 gene was sequenced and found to differ from the DNA sequence reported for that of another gonococcal strain; these differences were associated with a repeated DNA element, suggesting a genetic basis for structural variation in PilQ. The results also show that PilQ- mutants are distinct from previously described gonococcal pilus-assembly mutants and P. aeruginosa PilQ- mutants by virtue of their expression of rare pilus filaments. Taking these data into account, PilQ is proposed to function in the terminal steps of organelle biogenesis by acting as a pilus channel or pore.
TI  - Quality assessment of Microbe Base antimicrobial susceptibility data.
AB  - AIMS: To assess the quality of centres contributing antimicrobial susceptibility  data to a centralised database. METHODS: Twelve organisms were distributed to 31 regional microbiology laboratories contributing data to a centralised susceptibility database. Participants were asked to determine susceptibilities to certain antibiotics by their routine method and return the data to the Department of Microbiology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, for analysis. RESULTS: Results for the overwhelming majority of organism/antibiotic combinations were in agreement with expected results. Reasons for discrepancies included the non-bimodal distribution of susceptibilities, the use of different content discs, and, more importantly, minimum inhibitory concentrations falling close to breakpoint values. CONCLUSIONS: It is inevitable that any large multicentre database will contain a degree of inaccurate data. This study has highlighted several areas where discrepant results have occurred and has enabled Glaxo Laboratories to approach individual laboratories to address this problem. This study emphasises the value and consistency of Microbe Base as the largest database, of its kind, nationally.

TI  - Community acquired, nursing home acquired and hospital acquired pneumonia: A five-year review of the clinical, bacteriological and radiological characteristics.
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the contemporary clinical, bacteriological and radiographic features of hospitalized patients with community acquired (ca), nursing home acquired (na) and hospital acquired pneumonia (ha) and to examine patient outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All hospital records of patients with pneumonia over a five-year period from April 1987 to March 1992 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients included in the study were all those with a diagnosis of pneumonia as identified by computer records of diagnostic codes at discharge; patients with a specific diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia were excluded. Of 74,435 discharges over the five-year period, 1782 patients met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Charts of 1622 of the total 1782 cases were reviewed. Mean age was 64.4 years with 59.4% men and 40.6% women. Sixty-three per cent were ca, 28.5% were ha and 8.5% were na. A total of 1542 patients (95%) had at least one concomitant medical condition. Chest roentgenogram was abnormal in 97%. Common organisms isolated overall were Haemophilus influenzae (from 204 patients), Staphylococcus aureas (from 152 patients), Streptococcus pneumoniae (from 143 patients ), Escherichia coli (from 113 patients) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (from 111 patients). H influenzae and S pneumoniae were most common in ca pneumonia, whereas S aureus and Gram-negative organisms were more common in the ha group and Gram-negative agents in the na group. One hundred and four patients developed complications. Fifteen per cent required intensive care unit admission. The average length of hospitalization in the ca and na groups was 17 days and in the ha group, 43 days. At time of discharge 1261 patients (78%) were cured or improved, and 361 patients (22%) died during the admission. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that hospitalization for pneumonia in the 1990s is primarily for elderly patients with significant co-morbidity. Although microbiology appears unchanged compared with earlier reports, the contemporary population is significantly sicker than previous cohorts. This may account for the persistently high morbidity and mortality despite better or newer antibiotics.
TI  - [Pathogenic bacteria isolated from the sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema].
AB  - Isolated pathogenic bacteria from sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema who were admitted in our hospital from 1984 to 1994 were examined to elucidate the relationship between isolated bacteria from sputum and pulmonary functions including vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume (FEV1.0), PaO2 and PaCO2. VC of the patients from whom MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) or Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Branhamella catarrhalis (B. catarrhalis) or Haemophilus influenza (H. influenza) were isolated. FEV1.0 had a similar tendency as VC in terms of isolated organisms from the patients with emphysema. Similarly, PO2 of the patients from whom MSSA or E. cloacae were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenzae were isolated, and PCO2 of the patients from whom S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenza were isolated. There was also impaired respiratory function in the patients from whom MSSA, Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Xanthomonas maltophilia (X. maltophilia) or Enterobacter cloacae (E. cloacae) were isolated, compared with those in the patients from whom S. pneumonia, B. catarrhalis or H. influenzae were isolated. These results suggest that isolated pathogenic bacteria are shifted from S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenza to MSSA, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, X. maltophilia or E. cloacae in the course of impairment of respiratory function in pulmonary emphysema. The treatment and prophylaxis for acute exacerbation in pulmonary emphysema should be based on these results.
TI  - Contamination of multi-use closed tracheal suction catheters: an in-vitro study.
AB  - The use of closed multi-use tracheal suction systems in ventilated patients is increasingly popular as it offers a number of potential physiological and microbiological advantages. As the use of these systems has been associated with an increased prevalence of tracheal colonization, effective self-cleaning mechanisms employed in these catheters are necessary. Using an in-vitro model we assessed the degree of catheter colonization in two multi-use catheter systems; Stericath and Trach-Care. Fifty of each catheter type were tested for colonization with five challenge organisms: Staphylococcus aureus (NCTC 6571); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (NCTC 10662); Haemophilus influenzae type b; S. epidermidis (slime producer); and S. epidermidis (slime non-producer). All five challenge strains had colonized both catheter types after 24 h and all 100 catheter tips were colonized. The extent and density of colonization was variable and interspecies variation in the pattern of catheter colonization was observed. The mean colonized lengths of Stericath catheters was 10.9 +/- 1.4 cm and of Trach-Care 2.7 +/- 1.3 cm (P < 0.0001).
TI  - A multicenter comparative study of the in vitro activity of fleroxacin and other  antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of fleroxacin was determined by broth microdilution against 2,079 recent bacterial isolates and compared to the activities of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefixime, ceftriaxone, amoxicillin/clavulanate, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), and, as appropriate, erythromycin and oxacillin. Most Enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by the quinolones at a concentration of < or = 1 microgram/ml; MIC90s of fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin were 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 1 micrograms/ml, respectively. Fleroxacin was 2-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against Providencia stuartii and Serratia marcescens. Aside from the quinolones, ceftriaxone and TMP-SMX were the most active antibiotics against the Enterobacteriaceae, with MIC90s of 8 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively. Ciprofloxacin was more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa than the other quinolones, while fleroxacin was more active against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia: 17.7, 11.2, 20.0, and 22.4% of P. aeruginosa were resistant to fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were uniformally susceptible to all antibiotics tested, as were the majority of oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. The MIC90s of the quinolones and of the beta-lactam antibiotics for oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were 8- to 256-fold higher than for oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. The beta-lactam antibiotics, TMP-SMX, and erythromycin were more active than the quinolones against streptococci; all antibiotics were poorly active against enterococci. Fleroxacin is active against a broad range of gram-negative bacilli and against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci and should prove useful for such infections. However, its use cannot be recommended for infections due to oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, streptococci, or enterococci.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefprozil in vitro.
AB  - Cefprozil is a new orally active cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. Using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other oral cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against 637 recent clinical isolates from the Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan. Against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, cefprozil showed good activity, inhibiting over 80% of these isolates at 8 mg/l. Like other oral drugs of its class, it had little activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. Against Haemophilus influenzae, irrespective of beta-lactamase production, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, cefprozil showed high activity, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 4 mg/l, whereas against methicillin-resistant S. aureus, its activity was higher than that of other oral cephalosporins tested and was similar to that of ciprofloxacin. Of enterococci tested, 57.7% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefprozil. Against beta-hemolytic streptococci, its activity was superior to all other drugs tested. The results of this in vitro study indicate that oral administration of cefprozil might be efficacious in the treatment of community-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
TI  - Bacterial pneumonia in recipients of bone marrow transplantation. A five-year prospective study.
AB  - Bacterial pneumonia as an important complication of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has not been subjected to comprehensive analysis. Two hundred fifty-five consecutive allogeneic and autologous BMT recipients, ranging in age from 1 month to 53 years, were prospectively followed for 3 days to 3 years (median, 108 days) for development of bacterial pneumonia. Etiology, place acquired, chest radiography, and outcome were recorded and the association between bacterial pneumonia and demographic and clinical variables was analyzed. Thirty-seven (15%) patients experienced 52 episodes of bacterial pneumonia: onset of 13 episodes occurred within 30 days after transplantation, 10 episodes occurred on days +31 to +100, and 29 episodes occurred thereafter. Bacterial pneumonia was the terminal event or contributed to fatal outcome in 8 patients (22% of bacterial pneumonia cases, 3% total study population). Mortality due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (6/21) was significantly higher than (P = 0.03). Bacterial pathogens were identified in 27 (52%) episodes. During the first 100 days after BMT, hospital-acquired Gram-negative bacteria predominated, caused mainly by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter lwoffi, and Enterobacter cloacae. After day +100, community-acquired, Gram-positive bacteria predominated, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae. Haemophilus influenzae occurred periodically. Considering all episodes, significant association was found between bacterial pneumonia and veno-occlusive disease (VOD) (P < 0.01) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (P < 0.02). For culture-positive episodes, the association between bacterial pneumonia and VOD was significant (P < 0.001) and borderline for acute GVHD (P = 0.07). It is concluded that VOD and GVHD are positively associated with post-BMT bacterial pneumonia. Its incidence, etiology, risk factors, and outcome are important considerations in its prevention and treatment.
TI  - Open clinical trial of roxithromycin in patients of Plateau Hospitals, Jos in upper and lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - An open clinical study to assess the efficacy and tolerance of Roxithromycin 150  mg twice daily was carried out amongst Nigerian patients with upper and lower respiratory tract infections at Plateau Hospital Jos. Twenty-two patients aged between 13 and 86 years comprising of twelve women, seven men and three children completed the study. 18 (81.8%) had bronchopulmonary infections, 3 (13.6%) had tonsillitis and 1 (4.6%) had otitis media. Pathogens isolated included streptococcus Pneumonia (22.7%), Streptococcus pyogenes (13.6%), Bramhella Catarrhalis (9.1%), Haemophilus influenzae (9.1%), Staphylococcus Aureus (4.6%), Klebsiella species (4.6%), Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (4.6%). There was 88.2% bacteriological cure and patients responded fast, with no major adverse reactions. Roxithromycin is therefore concluded to be an effective well tolerated drug for treatment of respiratory tract infections in Nigerians.
TI  - Bacterial pneumonia in adult patients with HIV infection.
AB  - Patients with HIV infection are at increased risk for community-acquired bacterial pneumonias, due in part to their defects in B-cell function. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the commonest cause of community-acquired pneumonia, with the second most common bacterial agent being Haemophilus influenzae. These two organisms account for about two-thirds of community-acquired bacterial pneumonias. Frequently bacterial pneumonias appear difficult to distinguish from Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia or other opportunistic lung infections, because of their atypical clinical and radiologic presentations. Community-acquired pneumonias may be recurrent but have low fatality rates. In comparison, nosocomial pneumonias occur primarily in patients with AIDS and are usually due to Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other aerobic gram-negative bacilli. Nosocomial pneumonias have high fatality rates. S.aureus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with AIDS and has emerged as a secondary opportunist in lungs of patients with opportunistic diseases. While appropriate laboratory study is being done, empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed against the microorganisms above described.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1991)].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from respiratory tract infections were collected since 1981 in  cooperation with institutions located throughout Japan, and have been investigated for their sensitivities to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics and reported by IKEMOTO, et al. Relationships between these isolates and backgrounds of the patients were also studied each year. These results are discussed in detail in this report. In 20 institutions around the entire Japan from October 1991 to September 1992, 631 strains of bacteria were isolated mainly from sputa of 529 patients with respiratory tract infections and tentatively determined to be etiological agents. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics against 96 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 112 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 111 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 114 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid), 41 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, 39 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid), Klebsiella pneumoniae and some others, were determined, and the drug sensitivities of these strains were determined except for the strains that had been killed during transportation: 1. S. aureus. S. aureus strains for which MICs of methicillin were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) accounted for 58.3% and the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria increased over previous year's 42.5%. As shown by the MICs, arbekacin was active as vancomycin against all the strains on S. aureus. 2. S. pneumoniae: Benzylpenicillin among the penicillins showed a potent activity against S. pneumoniae. Cefuzonam, cefmenoxime, cefozopran and cefotaxime among the cephems showed excellent antimicrobial activities against S. pneumoniae. Imipenem; a penem antibiotic, showed the most potent activity with MIC80 of 0.03 micrograms/ml. 3. H. influenzae: Activities of all drugs were excellent against H. influenzae strains tested. Ampicillin showed MIC80 of 1 micrograms/ml against H. influenzae. Cefuzonam showed the most potent activity among cephems, it completely killed all bacteria at MIC 0.06 micrograms/ml. Cefotaxime and cefmenoxime showed next most potent activities with MIC80s of 0.06 micrograms/ml. The antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin was equivalent to those of cephems. 4. P. aeruginosa (mucoid). Ciprofloxacin and tobramycin showed the most potent activities against P. aeruginosa (mucoid), and their MIC80s were 4 micrograms/ml. 5. P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid): Similarly, ciprofloxacin and tobramycin showed the most potent activities against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid) with MIC80 of 2 micrograms/ml. Comparing to activities against P. aeruginosa (mucoid), all the drugs tested showed lower activities against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid). 6. K. pneumoniae: The activities of all drugs except for penicillins were very high against K. pneumoniae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Efficacy of meropenem in experimental meningitis.
AB  - Meropenem and comparator antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, benzyl  penicillin and a combination of ampicillin plus gentamicin, were evaluated in a model of bacterial meningitis in the guinea-pig. The model is an acute infection in which challenge with each organism, if untreated, causes an increase in numbers of white blood cells, elevation of protein concentrations and 6-8 log10 cfu/mL of bacteria in the CSF. Infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, three strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (two penicillin-resistant), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Listeria monocytogenes all responded to meropenem, which was as active as the comparator agents in all studies, and was more active in most. Of particular note were the results seen against S. pneumoniae (penicillin-resistant) infections, in which meropenem was significantly more effective than ceftriaxone. Also notable were results from the P. aeruginosa infection where meropenem, at low doses, was more effective than ceftazidime. Activity against L. monocytogenes was equivalent to that produced by treatment with the combination of ampicillin plus gentamicin, even when treatment was delayed. These results show that, in an animal model, meropenem penetrates into CSF in concentrations sufficient to produce significant reductions in the numbers of common and less common pathogens.
TI  - Treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in hospitalised patients--a comparison of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin. COPD Study Group.
AB  - Meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin were compared in an open, randomised prospective multicentre study in the treatment of acute exacerbations of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in hospitalised patients. One-hundred-and-seventy-three patients were enrolled; 164 were evaluable for clinical efficacy and 98 for bacteriological efficacy, with 144 pathogens isolated. The predominant pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae (n = 30), Streptococcus pneumoniae (18), Staphylococcus aureus (12), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11), Moraxella catarrhalis (8), other Gram-negative bacteria (Neisseria, Klebsiella, Proteus, and Enterobacter spp.) (53) and other Gram-positive bacteria (12). A single bacterial pathogen was identified in 61 patients, whereas two bacterial pathogens were isolated in 31 patients and three in six patients. The clinical response at the end of treatment was very high in both groups with a satisfactory outcome (cured or improved) in 97.6% of the meropenem patients and in 96.3% of the imipenem/cilastatin patients; at follow-up the rates were 89.1% and 89.8%, respectively. The bacterial success (eradication or presumed eradication) was 88.2% in the meropenem group and 89.4% in the comparator group. Nausea or vomiting were reported more frequently in patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin, whereas in the meropenem group an increase in aminotransferases was reported. One patient treated with imipenem/cilastatin was withdrawn from the study due to seizures. Meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin were highly effective for the treatment of severe bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis but meropenem was better tolerated.
TI  - Meropenem: a microbiological overview.
AB  - Meropenem is a parenteral carbapenem antibiotic which has excellent bactericidal  activity in vitro against almost all clinically significant aerobes and anaerobes. Its high activity is explained by ease of entry into bacteria combined with good affinity for essential penicillin binding proteins, including those associated with cell lysis. Breadth of spectrum is due, in part, to stability to all serine-based beta-lactamases, including those which hydrolyse third-generation cephalosporins. Meropenem has an antibacterial spectrum which is broadly similar to that of imipenem but, whilst slightly less active against staphylococci and enterococci, it is more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, all Enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae. Amongst common human pathogens, only methicillin-resistant staphylococci and Enterococcus faecium are uniformly resistant to meropenem. The meropenem MICs for penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae are higher than for penicillin-susceptible strains but the organisms remain susceptible. Clinical susceptibility in vitro to meropenem is defined by MICs of < or = 4 mg/L, intermediate susceptibility by MICs of 8 mg/L and MICs of > or = 16 mg/L define resistance; equivalent figures for zones of growth inhibition are > or = 14 (susceptible), 12-13 (intermediate) and < or = 11 (resistant) mm. Studies in guinea pig models of systemic infection and infections localised to the lungs, urinary tract and the central nervous system, some of which used immunocompromised animals, confirm the potential of meropenem demonstrated in vitro. These factors, combined with the human plasma, tissue or urinary concentrations of meropenem which exceed modal MICs for the pathogens isolated in clinical trials for most or all of the recommended 8 h dosing interval, predict that meropenem should be efficacious in the treatment of infections at many body sites.
TI  - Microbiology of nosocomial sinusitis in intensive care unit patients.
AB  - We performed a 2-year microbiological study of specimens of sinus fluid recovered from patients with suspected nosocomial sinusitis in six intensive care units. Over that period, 103 cases of sinusitis were documented by positive culture. The number of cases varied widely from one unit to another and was particularly high in the neurosurgical unit. Cultures were often polymicrobial. The main pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacteriaceae. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were far less frequently isolated. Anaerobes and yeasts were often associated with aerobic bacteria. The pathogen involved was also recovered from bronchopulmonary samples in 50 patients and from blood cultures in seven patients.
TI  - Progression of pulmonary disease after disappearance of Pseudomonas in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Once cystic fibrosis (CF) patients become chronically colonized, eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is rare. We report five patients, each colonized for at least 6 yr, whose subsequent cultures did not reveal PA or any other gram-negative pathogen for at least 2 yr. Two patients harbored yeast, normal throat flora, and occasional colonies of Aspergillus fumigatus, but no PA, Haemophilus influenzae, or other gram-negative pathogens. In two patients, sputum cultures revealed Staphylococcus aureus. Sputum smear showed no gram-negative organisms in any patient. Antipseudomonal antibody titers in all patients decreased during the noncolonized period. However, titers increased in four other CF patients who had continued PA colonization. Despite disappearance of PA, four of five patients had clinical progression of lung disease with deterioration of FEV1. We conclude that (1) PA, even after it has chronically colonized the airways of CF patients, can occasionally disappear; and (2) lung disease can progress despite the disappearance of PA. Thus, the elimination of a milieu favorable to PA, such as might be anticipated with therapy directed at the basic defect, may not be sufficient to halt the pulmonary disease progression in CF.
TI  - Clinical experience with ceftriaxone treatment in the neonate.
AB  - The safety of ceftriaxone has been evaluated in 80 neonates who were treated empirically for suspected infection with either ceftriaxone and ampicillin (group A, age 0-72 h) or ceftriaxone and vancomycin (group B, age greater than 72 h). Within 48 h after birth 2 group A patients died from sepsis (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 case each); 1 group B patient died from sepsis (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). All bacterial isolates from group A patients were susceptible to ceftriaxone, but in 4 of the 8 group B patients with positive cultures a change in antibiotic therapy was required. Eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and an increase in serum alkaline phosphatases were observed in a limited number of patients during and after discontinuation of treatment. Direct hyperbilirubinemia ( > 2 mg/dl) occurred in 2 cases during treatment. Gallbladder sludge was sonographically diagnosed in 6 patients, but disappeared within 2 weeks after detection. One neonate had exanthema. Nurses rated ease of administration as very good. Ceftriaxone appears to be an interesting alternative in the empiric antibiotic treatment in the early neonatal period.
TI  - Virulence factors in the colonization and persistence of bacteria in the airways.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are commonly isolated from sputum specimens of patients with lower respiratory tract infections. Haemophilus influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and M. catarrhalis have several pathogenic properties in common. These bacteria are able to interact with mucus, to exert ciliotoxic activity, to adhere to bronchial epithelial cells, and to invade airway epithelium. Haemophilus influenzae and S. pneumoniae strains persist for many months in the respiratory tract of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), despite the specific antibodies present in serum and sputum against the persistent strain. Especially during exacerbations persistent strains with changes in their antigenic composition are isolated. Among H. influenzae strains, the antigenic characteristics of the outer membrane protein composition vary. Variation in S. pneumoniae occurs in capsular polysaccharides, the major immunogens of this bacterium. Such variations affect the efficacy of the antibody-mediated defense mechanisms against the bacteria. Between exacerbations, particularly H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae strains are recovered from the sputum of patients with COPD. Recovery may continue for periods up to 2 yr, although not continuously. Besides ineffective antibody-mediated defense mechanisms, it is likely that hiding of the bacteria in tissue contributes to the persistence of these bacteria in patients with COPD.
TI  - Maintenance treatment with antibiotics in cystic fibrosis patients. Sense or nonsense?
AB  - The majority of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have chronic lung infection with a variety of organisms. It is accepted clinical practice to treat acute exacerbations of infection with appropriate oral or intravenous antibiotics. The aim of this paper is to review the use of maintenance antibiotics for these patients with chronic pulmonary infection. There is clinical trial evidence to support the use of maintenance treatment for patients chronically infected with Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. No such evidence is available in the case of Haemophilus influenzae or Burkholderia cepacia. Chronic infection with Staphylococcus aureus is commonly treated with maintenance oral flucloxacillin and chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa either with 3-monthly intravenous antibiotics or long-term aerosol antibiotics. Further clinical trials need to be performed on many aspects of maintenance treatment for CF patients with chronic pulmonary infection.
TI  - Protection against non-typable Haemophilus influenzae following sensitization of  gut associated lymphoid tissue: role of specific antibody and phagocytes.
AB  - Rats intestinally immunized with whole killed non-typable Haemophilus influenzae  clear this organism from the lungs faster than non-immunized rats. This study investigated the role of antibody and phagocytes in the clearance mechanism. First, dose-response experiments demonstrated that while lowering the dose of non-typable H. influenzae reduced the level of detectable specific antibody in bronchial washings, the ability to accelerate bacterial clearance persisted to much lower doses. Second, specificity experiments showed that intestinal immunization with non-typable H. influenzae cross-protected against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, even though antibodies were not absorbed out of serum by incubation with P. aeruginosa. Third, serum antibody was shown to be bactericidal for non-typable H. influenzae in the presence of complement (P < 0.05), while bronchial washings antibody was not. The bactericidal effect of the serum was abrogated by the addition of bronchial washings. Fourth, an ELISA quenching assay demonstrated that neutrophils from intestinally immunized rats were able to phagocytose more bacteria in a given time period (P < 0.05) than unimmunized rats and rats immunized by other routes. In the fifth experiment, the chemotactic response of neutrophils to casein was shown to be significantly depressed by the addition of bronchial washings obtained from immunized rats (P < 0.01). It is proposed that specific antibody in bronchial washings does not have a direct role in opsonizing bacteria for killing or phagocytosis, but instead has an anti-inflammatory effect. Non-specific effectors such as neutrophils driven by specific immune cells are a likely means of clearance of bacteria following intestinal immunization and acute challenge.
TI  - The isolation and characterization of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae from the sputum of adult cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - The role of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae in cystic fibrosis (CF) remains unclear. We wanted, therefore, to determine the presence and characteristics of non-typeable H. influenzae in sputum samples from patients with CF. In order to do this, we have assessed sputum samples from 55 consecutive clinically stable patients seen routinely at an adult CF out-patient clinic. Quantitative bacterial culture was performed using a selective media containing cefsoludin, and isolates were characterized by biotyping and outer membrane protein profile analysis. In 17 (30%) of these samples, non-typeable H. influenzae was isolated and was present in similar viable numbers (mean 7.7 x 10(8) colony-forming units (cfu).mL-1; SEM 3.1) to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mean 8 x 10(8) cfu.mL-1: SEM 2.4). All non-typeable H. influenzae isolates recovered were beta-lactamase negative and sensitive to a range of antibiotics. Several biotypes and outer membrane protein profiles were observed, with no apparent association between these two phenotypic characteristics. The study showed that large numbers of non-typeable H. influenzae are often present in sputum from adult patients with CF. Further longitudinal studies of outer-membrane protein profile analysis are required to determine the dynamics of non-typeable H. influenzae colonization in individual patients and the clinical significance.
TI  - Bacterial agents causing chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Ear swabs from 350 patients with chronic otitis media attending different orthorhinolaryngological clinics at different hospitals and health centres in Benin City and Ekpoma in Edo State were screened for the presence of bacterial agents of chronic otitis media. Results revealed the presence of 19 different species indicating polymicrobial infections. Species isolated comprised Staphylococcus aureus (33.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3%), Proteus mirabilis (17%), Alcaligenes faecalis (6.2%) and Klebsiella aerogenes (4.3%). Others included Escherichia coli (3.3%), Proteus rettgeri (2.8%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter spp, Proteus morgani, Haemophilus influenzae, Providencia spp, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, non-haemolytic streptococci and Diphotheroids, each accounted for less than 2% of isolates. The study also showed a higher prevalence of chronic otitis media among males (55.7%) than females (44.3%). Cases of chronic otitis media were highest among the age groups (0-5 years) with a prevalence rate of 50% and least among the 6-10 year age group with a prevalence rate of 14.9%. Antibiogram of isolates revealed marked sensitivities (over 90% of the isolates) to ciproxin, tarivid, rocephin and fortum whereas over 70% were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. Results have indicated that Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis are leading bacterial agents of otitis media and highlights the high risk involved in the use of penicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cloxacillin and septrin in the management of chronic otitis media in our locality.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of BO-2727, a new carbapenem.
AB  - BO-2727, a new injectable carbapenem, was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo  antibacterial activities in comparison with those of biapenem, meropenem, imipenem, cefpirome, and ceftazidime. BO-2727 had activity comparable to that of imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococci, with MICs at which 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) are inhibited being equal to 0.5 microgram/ml or less. Against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, BO-2727 was the most active among the antibiotics tested, with MIC90s ranging from 4 to 8 micrograms/ml. BO-2727 was highly active against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, with MIC90s ranging from 0.006 to 2 micrograms/ml. BO-2727 was also highly active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (imipenem-susceptible strains), for which the MIC90 was 2 micrograms/ml, which was lower than those of imipenem, cefpirome, and ceftazidime and comparable to those of biapenem and meropenem. Differences in activity between BO-2727 and the other carbapenems against imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa were particularly striking (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). Furthermore, BO-2727 displayed a high degree of activity against many of the ceftazidime-, ciprofloxacin-, and/or gentamicin-resistant isolates of P. aeruginosa. The in vivo efficacy of BO-2727 against experimental septicemia caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, reflected its potent in vitro activity and high levels in plasma.
TI  - Multicenter Spanish study of ciprofloxacin susceptibility in gram-negative bacteria. The Spanish Study Group on Quinolone Resistance.
AB  - The susceptibility of 2,426 gram-negative bacteria obtained from 18 Spanish hospitals to ciprofloxacin was evaluated. Among different medical centers, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ranged from 83 to 100% for Enterobacteriaceae, from 35 to 100% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, from 0 to 100% for Xanthomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp. and other gram-negative non-fermenting bacilli, and from 33 to 100% for Campylobacter spp. All clinical isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were susceptible to ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of SM-17466, a novel carbapenem antibiotic with potent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of SM-17466, a new 1 beta-methyl carbapenem, were evaluated against a wide range of clinical bacterial isoaltes and compared with the activities of meropenem, imipenem, vancomycin, and arbekacin. SM-17466 had a broad spectrum of action against gram-positive bacteria, showing especially potent activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci. The MICs of SM-17466, meropenem, imipenem, vancomycin, and arbekacin at which 90% of clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were inhibited were 3.13, 50, 100, 1.56, and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. This activity of SM-17466 was almost equivalent to those of the antibiotics used for the treatment of infections caused by this organism. SM-17466 also showed bactericidal activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. In contrast, SM-17466 was less active against gram-negative bacteria, especially against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, compared with the other carbapenems; however, of the carbapenems, SM-17466 exhibited the highest activity against Haemophilus influenzae and Bacteriodes fragilis. SM-17466, at a 50% inhibitory concentration of less than 1 microgram/ml, bound to penicillin-binding proteins 1 to 4 in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and also had good binding to penicillin-binding protein 2' in a methicillin-resistant strain (50% inhibitory concentration, 5.9 micrograms/ml). This high affinity, which was 10 and 20 times greater than those for meropenem and imipenem, respectively, was reflected in the potent activity of SM-17466 against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. SM-17466 demonstrated excellent in vivo efficacy against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. aureus strains in a mouse peritoneal infection model: the efficacy of SM-17466 against methicillin-resistant strains was equal to or one-third that of vancomycin. This activity was comparable to the in vitro activity of SM-17466. The subcutaneous injection of SM-17466 in mice revealed that the half-life of SM-17466 in serum was about 18 min, intermediate between those of vancomycin and arbekacin and 1.5-fold that of imipenem-cilastatin. SM-17466 was resistant to hydrolysis by swine renal dehydropeptidase I, to an extent comparable to the resistance shown by meropenem.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of the sputum pathogens and throat swab pathogens isolated from the patients undergoing treatment in twenty-one private clinics in Japan.
AB  - Bacteriology of the respiratory isolates from 2,539 patients with respiratory infections in 21 primary care clinics was documented. Of a total of 1,887 strains of potential pathogens recovered from 1,507 patients, 996 were gram-positive and 891 were gram-negative. Major pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. The MIC's against microbial isolates of six antimicrobial agents were determined. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were more active against S. aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ampicillin and cefteram were more active against S. pnuemoniae and S. pyogenes than four other antimicrobials tested, respectively, in this experiment. New quinolones and new generation cephems were active against H. influenzae and Enterobacteriaceae. Only one strain of S. aureus was methicillin-resistant. As regards other pathogens, 6.5% of S. pneumoniae and 14.9% of H. influenzae were resistant to ampicillin, and 26.7% of H. influenzae were beta-lactamase-positive. MRSA was found infrequently. But ampicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were found in primary care clinics almost as frequently as in intensive-medication-oriented clinics.
TI  - Combination beta-lactam and beta-lactamase-inhibitor products: antimicrobial activity and efficiency of enzyme inhibition.
AB  - Classification schemes for gram-negative beta-lactamases are presented, mechanisms by which beta-lactamases inactivate beta-lactam antibiotics are reviewed, and methods for assessing the efficiency of beta-lactamase inhibitors are evaluated. Beta-lactamases are commonly produced by Staphylococcus species, the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, and some anaerobes. Currently available beta-lactamase inhibitors are thought to be "suicide inhibitors" that form stable complexes between the bacterial beta-lactamase and the beta-lactamase inhibitor in a multistep chemical reaction. Each step can be quantitated; however, the overall process is difficult to measure. Thus, a comparative evaluation of commercially available beta-lactamase inhibitors is extremely difficult and must be done under standardized test conditions. In general, sulbactam, clavulanate, and tazobactam are all potent inhibitors of staphylococcal penicillinase; chromosomal beta-lactamases produced by Bacteroides species, Proteus vulgaris, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae; and type IV enzymes of Klebsiella species. Although sulbactam possesses activity against TEM-1 and TEM-2 beta-lactamases, it does not have reliable activity against SHV-1 beta-lactamases. Clavulanate and tazobactam are potent inhibitors of both TEM and SHV-1 beta-lactamases. P. aeruginosa and some Enterobacteriaceae produce an inducible, extremely potent, broad-spectrum enzyme (type I beta-lactamase). Tazobactam is the only currently available. beta-lactamase inhibitor with activity against type I beta-lactamases; however, some enzymes are not inhibited by tazobactam.
TI  - Evaluation of the automated Bact-Alert system for pediatric blood culturing.
AB  - The Organon Teknika BacT/Alert (Organon Teknika, Durham, NC), using the Pedi-BacT 20 mL aerobic bottle (BPBCS) was compared to the Wampole Isolator (WI) 1.5 Microbial tube (Wampole Laboratories, Cranbury, NJ), for detection and recovery of pediatric pathogens. The BPBCS continuously monitors culture bottles for changes in CO2 concentrations, while WI cultures are examined twice daily for appearance of colonial growth on agar media. Of 5,175 paired blood cultures, 383 pathogens were recovered from 606 positive cultures. There were 272 pathogens recovered by both systems, 64 from BPBCS only, and 47 from WI only. Overall recovery rates were 88% for BPBCS and 83% for WI. There was no significant difference between the two systems in detection or times to positivity of staphylococci, Enterobacteriaceae, or pseudomonads. Trends toward better recovery of streptococci (20 vs. 10) and fastidious microaerophiles (3 vs. 0) were found with BPBCS, whereas more slowly growing pathogens (Rochalimaea henselae [1], Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare [1]) were recovered by WI only, but because of their lower frequency did not achieve statistical significance. Detection of Haemophilus influenzae (14.9 hours in WI vs. 45.4 hours in BPBCS) was faster with WI. False positive plus contaminant cultures were detected in 5.9% BPBCS versus 1.5% WI. BPBCS offers detection of bacteremia at a rate comparable to WI with advantages of automation.
TI  - Adhesion of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae from blood and sputum to human tracheobronchial mucins and lactoferrin.
AB  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae strains are the most common pathogens encountered in patients with chronic bronchitis. These organisms chronically colonize the airways of patients and occasionally cause bacteremia. Nontypeable H. influenzae strains have been demonstrated microscopically to bind to mucus, but quantitative studies of adhesion have not been published to date. We have therefore developed a reproducible microtiter plate assay to study mucin binding and have examined the adhesion of sputum and blood strains of nontypeable H. influenzae. The assay is similar to that described for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (S. Vishwanath and R. Ramphal, Infect. Immun. 45:197-202, 1984), but notably 2% Tween 20 is used to desorb bacteria from the wells to quantitate bacterial binding. Using a standard strain, we have established that 1 h of incubation is optimum with an inoculum of < or = 5 x 10(8) CFU/ml. The standard strain binds to bronchitic and cystic fibrosis mucins equally well but binds less to bronchiectasis mucins. It does not bind to bovine serum albumin or fetuin. We have also examined the levels of adhesion of freshly isolated sputum and bacteremia strains and find very significant differences in adhesion. Blood strains bound six to seven times less than sputum strains ([13.8 +/- 7] x 10(2) per well versus [102 +/- 43] x 10(2); P < 0.001). Studies with adhesion to lactoferrin, another glycosylated protein, revealed variable binding of respiratory strains but marked binding of blood strains compared with mucin. An isogenic pair of respiratory and blood isolates was examined by electron microscopy but did not show surface differences. We speculate that bacteremic strains studied may have masked, lost, or downregulated adhesin production to allow them to escape from mucins or upregulated adhesins for lactoferrin to invade the bloodstream.
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1991. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and CNS showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (DMPPC). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. Though Enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), imipenem (IPM), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) compounds, Enterococcus faecium was resistant to almost all antibacterial agents but to ST compounds. High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae to IPM, gentamicin (GM) and ofloxacin (OFLX) and for strains of Proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (LMOX), IPM, aztreonam (AZT), GM and OFLX. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group were highly susceptible only to IPM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM, amikacin (AMK) and tobramycin (TOB). Pseudomonas cepacia was relatively susceptible only to CAZ. IPM showed strong antibacterial activity to many species except for S. aureus and CNS.
TI  - Cross-reactive antigens shared by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Helicobacter pylori, Campylobacter jejuni, and Haemophilus influenzae may cause false-positive titers of antibody to H. pylori.
AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients suffer from many of the gastrointestinal conditions which occur in non-CF individuals, e.g., dyspepsia and peptic ulceration. These symptoms may be caused by Helicobacter pylori but could also be due to either pancreatic insufficiency or the intensive antibiotic treatment used in CF patients. Since CF patients chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa produce antibodies against a wide range of antigens, including antigens common to many other bacteria, e.g., GroEL and lipopolysaccharide, we studied, by the Western blot (immunoblot) technique, the specificity of immunoglobulin G antibodies to H. pylori in Danish CF patients chronically infected with P. aeruginosa, CF patients without P. aeruginosa infection but with Haemophilus influenzae infection, patients with dyspeptic ulcers associated with H. pylori, and patients recovering from acute Campylobacter jejuni or Campylobacter coli infection. Sera from CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa or H. influenzae infection and patients recovering from acute C. jejuni infection cross-reacted with H. pylori antigens. A strong cross-reacting protein antigen at approximately 14 kDa and minor cross-reactive antigens at approximately 27, 30, and 60 kDa (the heat shock protein GroEL is equivalent to the common antigen of P. aeruginosa) could be demonstrated. The results of this study show that high immunoglobulin G antibody titers against H. pylori in CF patients cannot be regarded as indicating present or past H. pylori infection unless their specificity is proven by absorption studies.
TI  - National survey of the in vitro spectrum of piperacillin-tazobactam tested against more than 40,000 aerobic clinical isolates from 236 medical centers.
AB  - Hospital microbiology laboratories from 41 states participated in a bacterial antimicrobial susceptibility study comparing in vitro results generated by the standardized disk diffusion method. Over 41,000 freshly isolated aerobic and facultative strains, representing all specimen types (except stools and urines), were tested for their susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam and 21 other antimicrobial agents. Enterococcus spp. was the second or third most common isolate from intraabdominal, gynecologic, and cutaneous infections, confirming its growing importance as a nosocomial pathogen. Escherichia coli was the most frequent isolate overall, despite the exclusion of urinary tract specimens from the study. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the second most prevalent species, ranking first in frequency of recovery from lower-respiratory-tract specimens. Piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active beta-lactamase inhibitor combination tested against Gram-negative bacteria. Its activity against Gram-positive bacteria and Haemophilus influenzae was similar to that of ampicillin-sulbactam (95-97% susceptible). Imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam displayed similar spectrums of activity against Gram-positive organisms and Haemophilus influenzae. Against Enterobacteriaceae, piperacillin-tazobactam and ceftazidime exhibited similarly wide spectrums of activity, but with some gaps, particularly among Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii. In this large-scale in vitro study, piperacillin-tazobactam and imipenem displayed the widest antimicrobial spectrums, inhibiting > 90% of all isolates tested.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of apalcillin alone and combined with Ro 48-1220, a novel penam beta-lactamase inhibitor.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The in vitro activity of apalcillin plus Ro 48-1220, a novel penam sulfone beta-lactamase inhibitor, was compared with apalcillin alone, piperacillin/tazobactam, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, imipenem, ceftazidime and cefepime. METHODS: Agar dilution and broth microdilution testing of 854 bacterial strains, subcultured from frozen stocks incubated for 24 h in 5% carbon dioxide, was carried out to determine the minimum bactericidal (MBC) and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of each of the study drugs in accordance with the NCCLS M26-T method. RESULTS: Apalcillin/Ro 48-1220 was active against all gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates except Klebsiella oxytoca (MIC90 32 microg/mL). Among the Enterobacteriaceae, synergy for apalcillin/Ro 48-1220 (4 microg/mL fixed concentration) vs apalcillin alone was demonstrated for nearly all species when comparing MIC90 results. Apalcillin/Ro 48-1220 was highly potent against beta-lactamase-producing Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MICs less-than-or-equal 1 microg/mL). However, much of this activity was due to the direct antimicrobial action of Ro 48-1220 alone (MICs less-than-or-equal 4 microg/mL). All Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia and Acinetobacter species were inhibited by apalcillin/Ro 48-1220 (MIC90 0.25 to 4 microg/mL). For the aerobic gram-positive organisms, none of the drugs tested were consistently effective against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, Corynebacterium jeikeium and Enterococcus species other than E. faecalis. Apalcillin/Ro 48-1220 was as effective as piperacillin/tazobactam against Escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum TEM enzymes, but less active against isolates producing SHV-type beta-lactamases. When tested against 204 ceftazidime-, gentamicin- or fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms, 78%, 91% and 66% of strains, respectively, were susceptible to apalcillin/Ro 48-1220 (less-than-or-equal 16 microg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Apalcillin/Ro 48-1220 is bactericidal with a modest inoculum effect; its wide spectrum of activity favors continued studies of spectrum, pharmacokinetics and in vivo efficacy.
TI  - Continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions in preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether continuous subglottic aspiration prevents nosocomial pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients. DESIGN: A randomized, controlled, blinded study. SETTING: Medical-surgical intensive care unit. PATIENTS: 190 patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit during a 33-month period and whose condition suggested the need for prolonged intubation (> 3 days). INTERVENTION: 76 patients were randomly allocated to receive continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions, and 77 control patients were allocated to receive usual care. MEASUREMENTS: The numbers of cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilated days, days in intensive care unit, and deaths were recorded. The amount of subglottic secretions aspirated daily and surveillance cultures in the subglottic secretions were also obtained periodically. Etiologic diagnosis was based on the quantitative culture of secretions obtained by protected specimen brush or bronchoalveolar lavage. RESULTS: The incidence rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia was 19.9 episodes/1000 ventilator days in the patients receiving continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions and 39.6 episodes/1000 ventilator days in the control patients (relative risk, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.82). This difference was due to a significant (P < 0.03) reduction in the number of gram-positive cocci and Haemophilus influenzae organisms in the patients receiving continuous aspiration. However, no differences were observed in the number of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Enterobacteriaceae organisms. Episodes of ventilator-associated pneumonia occurred later in patients receiving continuous aspiration (12.0 +/- 7.1 days) than in the control patients (5.9 +/- 2.1 days) (P = 0.003). The same microorganisms isolated from protected specimen brush or bronchoalveolar lavage cultures in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia were previously isolated from cultures of subglottic secretions in 85% of cases. No significant differences in outcome were found. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of nosocomial pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients can be significantly reduced by using a simple method that decreases the chronic microaspirations through the cuff of endotracheal tubes.
TI  - Effect of inflammation on intraocular penetration of intravenous ofloxacin in albino rabbits.
AB  - The effect of inflammation on the intraocular penetration of ofloxacin was studied in 20 albino rabbits (New Zealand White). Inflammation was induced in the left eye by inoculation of a suspension of 10(9) CFU of heat-killed Staphyloccus epidermidis per 0.1 ml of saline solution (0.9%) in the midvitreous cavity. The other eye was kept as a control. Twenty-four hours following inoculation, ofloxacin was administered in the marginal ear vein at a dose of 15 mg/kg over 20 min with an infusion pump. Animals were sacrificed at different times up to 24 h following drug administration. Ofloxacin levels were determined in aqueous humor, vitreous humor, and serum by a bioassay. Inflammation was scored on the basis of perilimbal and corneal reactions and vitreoretinal statuses. Inflammation had a relevant effect on intraocular penetration of ofloxacin, with levels in the ocular fluids of the inflamed eye markedly exceeding the ones of the control eye. In the uninflamed eye, the levels were rapidly decaying below assay sensitivity and were no longer detectable at approximately 5 h following drug administration while they were still detectable in both ocular fluids of the inflamed eye at 24 h. Ofloxacin levels in the ocular fluids of the inflamed eye were superior to the MIC for several of the bacteria which commonly cause endophthalmitis, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, and strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa genomic DNA sequence,  encoding a putative DNA helicase belonging to superfamily I.
AB  - The isolation and characterization of a 2,122 bp DNA fragment from a Pseudomonas  aeruginosa genomic library containing a 1,495 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a putative DNA helicase is described. The deduced amino acid (498 residues) sequence derived from this ORF, exhibited a high degree of homology to the rep and uvrD helicases of Escherichia coli (55 and 38% identities, respectively), and to those of Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae (43 and 39% identities, respectively), all of them belonging to superfamily I.
TI  - Bacterial resistance to carbapenems.
AB  - The carbapenems have the broadest spectra of all beta-lactams but resistance still occurs, caused by target modification, impermeability or beta-lactamase production. Target modification or replacement is important in methicillin-resistant staphylococci, E. faecium and some pneumococci. These organisms present the greatest current threat to carbapenem efficacy. Impermeability to carbapenems arises in P. aeruginosa mutants, where it is contingent on loss of D2 outer membrane protein, a minor porin. This resistance functions only if the Pseudomonas retains its chromosomal group 1 beta-lactamase, and so reflects the interplay of impermeability and hydrolysis rather than impermeability alone; nevertheless porin loss is the critical change that engenders resistance. Resistance based on impermeability coupled to a group 1 beta-lactamase has also been described in E. cloacae, but demands loss of a major porin and is much rarer and less stable than in P. aeruginosa. Although group 1 beta-lactamases contribute to resistance in these organisms, they have only feeble carbapenemase activity. Chromosomal beta-lactamases with potent carbapenemase activity occur in most or all X. maltophilia, A. hydrophila and F. odoratum isolates. These enzymes, which cause carbapenem resistance when expressed copiously, are all zinc-dependent. Zinc carbapenemases also are a concern in B. fragilis, where they are encoded by the chromosomal DNA of c. 3% of isolates, though expressed by only 1%. Carbapenemases are extremely rare outside these species. Nevertheless, a plasmidic zinc carbapenemase was reported from one P. aeruginosa isolate and from several S. marcescens. Further carbapenemases, some not zinc-dependent, are known from a tiny numbers of Serratia, Enterobacter, and Acinetobacter isolates. Despite these various modes of resistance, carbapenems have retained their efficacy far better than have expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. Whether this advantage will be retained indefinitely is uncertain. If resistance does become more prevalent it may be possible to derivatize the carbapenems so as to extend their activity. There is already interest in the design of carbapenems that bind beta-lactam-resistant PBPs and, to an extent, in the development of carbapenemase inhibitors.
TI  - [Mechanism of antibiotic resistance in bacteria responsible for respiratory infections].
AB  - Bacterial resistance is both a frequent phenomena and in perpetual evolution; currently it effects all antibiotics. The acquisition of resistance is a result of chromosomal mutations or is a contribution of genetic material either as plasmids or transposons. The principle mechanisms which can be isolated or associated can be grouped together under changes of bacterial permeability which alters the target of the anti-infectious agents; or the synthesis of enzymes which inhibit the activity of the antibiotic. Some micro-organisms such as Staphylococcal aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and certain enterobacteria have developed resistance to varying degrees against the antibiotics initially or more recently introduced which pose, in some cases, very real therapeutic problems. The prescribing doctor should recognise the principle bacterial phenotypes which are resistant, as well as the rules of association of the different antibiotics in order to institute an effective anti-infectious regime, which allows the cure of the patient and limits any introduction of resistance or the selection of resistant mutants.
TI  - [Infectious complication after lung transplantation for cystic fibrosis].
AB  - The infectious complications after lung transplantation have been studied in 26 patients suffering from mucoviscidosis who had transplants in the Ile-de-France between July 1987 and October 1990. We counted 99 infections (74 bacterial infections, 23 viral infections and two fungal infections) during a cumulative observation period of 127 months. The majority of the infections (48%) were localised to the grafted lung. These infections were responsible for 61% of deaths (50% secondary to bacterial infections and 11% to viral infections). The risk of infection remains even after a considerable time after transplantation in this series. These studies underline the importance of infectious complications in the mortality and morbidity of lung transplant patients suffering from mucoviscidosis.
TI  - [Yearly changes of isolated organisms from the respiratory tract in Hokusho Central Hospital].
AB  - Isolated organisms from the respiratory tract have been studied in our hospital from 1986 to 1993. The total number of samples were 18,345 and samples which showed 10(5) cfu/ml organisms were 8648 in our hospital for 8 years. Enterobacteriacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and glucose nonfermenting gram-negative rods were major isolates in 8 years. Haemophilus influenzae, which used to be the commonest isolate, decreased from 10.9% in 1993 while Enterobacteriacae increased from 8.9% in 1986 to 17.6% in 1993. S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were major isolates from out-patients consisting of 50%, followed by Enterobacteriacae, P. aeruginosa and MSSA. Enterobacteriacae and P. aeruginosa were major isolates from in-patients, followed by MRSA and beta-Streptococcus. Streptococcus agalactiae, Serratia marcescens and Corynebacterium spp. prevailed especially in the geriatric ward. S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were major isolates from patients with pneumoconiosis, especially in winter.
TI  - [Bacteriological study of purulent otitis media in children in CHU in the tropical zone].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Haemophilus influenzae and S pneumoniae are the most common causative agents of acute otitis media in Europe and the USA. This work aimed to identify the agents in Senegal and to study their sensitivity to antibiotics. POPULATION AND METHODS: Two hundred and one patients, aged 0 to 15 years, with persistent middle-ear effusion, were included in this study from 1983 to 1993. Purulent samples aspirated from the external canal were analysed for bacteriology and sensitivity testing. RESULTS: Eighty two percent of cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus (37%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25%), Proteus (18%) and Klebsiella (8%). Positive cultures were found mainly in children aged between 1 and 5 years. Amikacin and cefotaxim were the most active antibiotics against the majority of strains. Staphylococcus aureus was always resistant to penicillin. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus as the causative agent of persistent middle-ear effusion may be explained by late examination. Its resistance to penicillin favors early administration of third generation cephalosporins or pristanimycin.
TI  - Laboratory data which differentiate meropenem and imipenem.
AB  - Meropenem and imipenem are carbapenems which are distinguishable from all other currently available beta-lactam antibiotics by breadth of antibacterial spectrum and stability to beta-lactamases, but can be differentiated one from another. Meropenem is relatively stable to human renal dehydropeptidase-I (DHP-I); it does not require to be co-administered with cilastatin and consequently, unlike imipenem, will be administered as a single agent. In vitro both meropenem and imipenem are active against almost all clinically important aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Differences in potency are seen but few may be of clinical significance: imipenem is more active against enterococci and meropenem is more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus, Morganella and Providencia species. The primary target of imipenem is PBP2 in P. aeruginosa whilst meropenem has high affinity for both PBP2 and 3; this may contribute to greater potency against this organism. Laboratory evaluations predict that meropenem will not be seizurogenic, which combined with activity against likely pathogens, identified its potential for the treatment of bacterial meningitis. This has been investigated in a guinea-pig model in which meropenem exhibited potent activity against the common meningeal pathogens and also infections caused by penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae or Listeria monocytogenes. Clinical experience will determine the significance of these differences.

TI  - The role of bacterial proteases in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Among the roles of mediators damaging the respiratory epithelium in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) during the course of chronic, purulent bronchitis, that of neutrophil proteases is well established. The role of bacterial proteases is less well known. Among all pathogens colonizing the airways in CF, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is quantitatively the dominant pathogen; Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae are present in lower numbers. Anaerobic bacteria may be detected in numbers exceeding those of Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. Among all enzymes secreted by these bacterial strains, Pseudomonas elastase and alkaline protease were shown to be secreted in vivo over prolonged periods in the airways. These enzymes, mainly elastase, have proteolytic activity on many proteins involved in host defense mechanisms, often the same as those hydrolyzed by neutrophil proteases. Pseudomonas elastase has damaging effects on the respiratory epithelium; it has recently also been shown to augment the permeability of the respiratory epithelium cultured in vitro by proteolytic attack of tight junctions. The potential role of proteases and other enzymes secreted by anaerobic bacteria has not been studied in this disease. In conclusion, bacterial proteases secreted in vivo may play a role in the pathogenesis of the airway disease in CF; their relative importance to the role of host proteases is, however, often difficult to determine.
TI  - [A clinical study of respiratory infections due to mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa  diagnosed by transtracheal aspiration].
AB  - We performed a clinical study of 20 cases (33 episodes) of respiratory infections due to mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa by transtracheal aspiration (TTA) in the recent 10 years. There was only one pneumonia without underlying chronic lower respiratory infection (CLRTI) case positive for mucoid P. aeruginosa and others were all CLRTI among 33 TTA trials. In contrast, nonmucoid P. aeruginosa was recovered from 9 cases of respiratory infections without underlying CLRTI among 46 TTA trials. Monomicrobial infection of mucoid P. aeruginosa was 69.7%, and polymicrobial infection containing mucoid P. aeruginosa was 30.3%, and Haemophilus influenzae was the most frequent microorganism recovered with mucoid P. aeruginosa. The recovery rate of mucoid P. aeruginosa among P. aeruginosa-colonized cases was 56.3% in diffuse panbronchiolitis, and that was 42.9% and 40.0% in bronchiectasis and chronic bronchitis, respectively. Mortality due to pneumonia with nonmucoid P. aeruginosa was 46.1%, but there was no fatal pneumonia case with mucoid P. aeruginosa. In CLRTI, laboratory data were not remarkably different between mucoid and non-mocoid P. aeruginosa-colonized cases. Thus, these results suggest that mucoid P. aeruginosa is a more important organism in persistent infections in the lower respiratory tract compared with nonmucoid P. aeruginosa, and further investigations is required on the mechanism and clinical role of this infection.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of bacterial pathogens at two tertiary-care centers, in  Riyadh and Texas.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance of bacterial pathogens usually varies from one geographic location to another. During the last 20 years, outbreaks of disease caused by multiresistant bacteria have occurred with higher frequency in developing countries. We investigated the antimicrobial resistance patterns of bacteria isolated in 1992 from two tertiary-care centers, in Riyadh and Texas. Of the 8841 strains used, 5318 were isolated from clinical specimens of patients at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, and 3523 were from Olin E. Teague Veterans Medical Center, Temple, Tex. Members of Enterobacteriaceae at the King Faisal hospital were significantly more resistant to frequently prescribed antimicrobials than were those at the Olin Teague center. Susceptibility to less frequently used agents like ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime was similar at both hospitals. Resistance patterns of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were similar at both medical centers. The Olin Teague center encountered significantly more methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
TI  - Prediction of piperacillin-tazobactam susceptibility among Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other bacteria using ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, and other broad-spectrum antimicrobial in vitro test results.
AB  - The ability of various in vitro beta-lactam susceptibility test results to predict the susceptibility of piperacillin-tazobactam (a new beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination) was assessed using more than 46,000 recent clinical isolates. The organisms were tested by reference-quality National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) broth microdilution procedures and interpreted by the currently published NCCLS criteria. The recommended antimicrobial tests that would accurately predict the piperacillin-tazobactam in vitro efficacy had an overall very major, false-susceptible rate of only 0.6% (< or = 1.5% is acceptable). The following drug tests can be used to judge piperacillin-tazobactam activity and spectrum (low patient risk) conservatively: for Enterobacteriaceae use ticarcillin-clavulanic acid results (0.6% very major error); for Pseudomonas aeruginosa use piperacillin (0.1%) results; for enterococci use ampicillin or ampicillin-sulbactam (1.8%) results; for Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis use cefotaxime or cefuroxime or ceftriaxone (1.5%); and for staphylococci use oxacillin by NCCLS recommendations. When the piperacillin-tazobactam testing reagents become available, the direct testing of this combination should be applied to relevant clinical isolates. The piperacillin-tazobactam break points should be reassessed as indicated by the cited minimum inhibitory concentration population analysis to improve predictive accuracy; H. influenzae susceptibility modified to < or = 2/4 micrograms/ml and Enterococcus species susceptibility tested at < or = 16/4 micrograms.
TI  - In vitro activity of the new fluoroquinolone CP-99,219.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new fluoroquinolone CP-99,219 [7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl)naphthyridone] was compared with those of four other quinolones against 541 gram-negative, 283 gram-positive, and 70 anaerobic bacterial isolates. CP-99,219 inhibited 90% of many isolates in the family Enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml (range, < 0.008 to 1 microgram/ml), an activity comparable to those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin and two times greater than that of temafloxacin. Ninety percent of the Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, and Serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by 0.5 to 2 micrograms of CP-99,219 per ml. CP-99,219 inhibited 90% of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae isolates at 1 and 0.015 micrograms/ml, respectively. The compound inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus at 0.06 micrograms/ml, whereas a ciprofloxacin concentration of 1 microgram/ml was required to inhibit these organisms. CP-99,219 inhibited 90% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates at a concentration of < or = 4 micrograms/ml, while ciprofloxacin and temafloxacin had MICs against these isolates of > 16 micrograms/ml. Streptococci were inhibited by < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml, an activity comparable to that of tosufloxacin. CP-99,219 was eight times more active than ciprofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Bacteroides species were inhibited by CP-99,219 at a concentration of 2 micrograms/ml, whereas inhibition of these species required 4- and 16-microgram/ml concentrations of tosufloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. The MBCs of CP-99,219 ranged from two to four times the MICs, and inoculum size had a minimal effect on MIC. CP-99,219 was active against P. aeruginosa at pH 5.5, with only a fourfold increase in MIC compared with values obtained at pH 7.5. The addition of up to 9 mM Mg(2+) increased the MIC range from 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml to 0.12 to 0.5 microgram/ml. In view of its excellent in vitro activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, CP-99,219 merits further study to determine it's clinical pharmacologic properties and potential for therapeutic use.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefozopran in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefozopran (CZOP, SCE-2787), a newly developed parenteral cephem antibiotic, was  administered to children with bacterial infections. We determined its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety in these patients. 1. Antibacterial activity MICs of cefmetazole, ceftazidime, cefuzonam, flomoxef and CZOP were determined against a total of 19 strains. For Gram-positive cocci, MICs of CZOP ranged from 0.39 to 0.78 microgram/ml against Staphylococcus aureus (3 strains), from 0.05 to 6.25 micrograms/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae (5 strains), and 12.5 micrograms/ml against Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain). These MICs were generally similar to those of other cephems, but the MIC of CZOP against E. faecalis was lower than those of the other cephems examined. For Gram-negative bacilli, MICs of CZOP were 25 micrograms/ml against Citrobacter freundii (1 strain), and 6.25 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 strain). These values were similar to or lower than those of other cephems, MICs of CZOP against Haemophilus influenzae (7 strains) ranged from 0.1 to 0.39 microgram/ml. However, the MIC of CZOP against Serratia marcescens (1 strain) was higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and CZOP was as ineffective as the other cephems against this organism. 2. Pharmacokinetics CZOP was administered to children at 20 or 40 mg/kg via intravenous injection, and determinations were made for its serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using the bioassay. Serum concentrations at 30 minutes after administration were 60.4 micrograms/ml with a dose of 20 mg/kg to one patient and 93.9 and 99.0 micrograms/ml with 40 mg/kg to two patients. The corresponding half-lives were 1.55 hours for 20 mg/kg administration, and 1.10 and 3.41 hours for 40 mg/kg, while the AUCs were 136.5 micrograms.hr/ml for 20 mg/kg, and 194.4 and 264.5 micrograms.hr/ml for 40 mg/kg. The rates of urinary recovery in the first 8 hours after administration were 45.0% in the patient receiving 20 mg/kg, and 84.6 and 97.6% in the two patients receiving 40 mg/kg. The concentrations in the CSF determined in 3 patients with purulent meningitis ranged from 2.6 to 16.0 micrograms/ml 1 hour after administration, and the CSF/serum concentration ratio ranged from 6.5 to 39.0%. These values for pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in the bioassay were similar to those obtained using HPLC. 3. Clinical evaluation Forty-eight patients were clinically evaluated. Of these patients, 75% were less than 3 years of age and there were slightly more male children than female children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (V). The pattern of distribution on bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and virus isolated from patients with respiratory infections, who were seen in six private clinics, and clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin and roxithromycin].
AB  - The pattern of distribution of bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and virus isolated from the same specimen recovered from the throat swab or the sputum of 479 patients with respiratory infections who were seen in six private clinics in Sendai City of Japan during the period from October to November in 1992 (period I) and from January to February in 1993 (period II) was documented. Of the 479 patients, 234 had acute pharyngitis, 145 had acute bronchitis, 96 had influenza, 21 had acute tonsillitis, 5 had acute pneumonia and 9 had other respiratory infections. One hundred (42.4%) strains of potential pathogen and one strain of M. pneumoniae were recovered from 236 cases in period I, and 66 (27.2%) strains of potential pathogen, one strain of M. pneumonae and 73 strains of Influenza virus (30.0%: 43 of type A Hong-Kong and 30 of type B) from 243 cases in period II. Of the 166 strains, major isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (56 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (12 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (15 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (17 strains), Esherichia coli (4 strains), Klebsiella spp. (35 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4 strains) and Acinetobacter spp. (23 strains). Only one strain of S. aureus was resistant to methicillin (MIC: 50 micrograms/ml). None of S. pneumoniae was resistant to 1 microgram/ml of ampicillin. Ciprofloxacin was administered to 113 cases and roxythromycin to 220 cases by doctors in charge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The in-vitro activity of FK-037, a new broad spectrum injectable cephalosporin.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of the parenteral cephem FK-037 was compared to those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxycillin and co-amoxiclav. Against the Enterobacteriaceae FK-037 was generally > or = 16-fold more active than cefuroxime and two- to four-fold more active than ceftazidime and similar in activity to cefpirome. Pseudomonas aeruginosa displayed similar susceptibilities to ceftazidime and FK-037 (MIC90 4 and 8 mg/L respectively). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by < or = 4 mg/L of FK-037. The MIC of FK-037 for 90% of Streptococcus pneumoniae was 0.5 mg/L. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were inhibited by < or = 2 mg/L FK-037.
TI  - Comparative microbiological activity and pharmacokinetics of cefprozil.
AB  - In vitro studies on the activity of cefprozil have been conducted in Europe and North America. Against gram-negative bacilli, cefprozil and cefaclor are at least two to four times more active than cephalexin. Cefixime is more active against these organisms. Against gram-positive cocci, cefprozil is at least two to four times more active than cefaclor and cephalexin; cefixime has limited gram-positive activity, and is particularly inactive against staphylococci (MIC90 32 mg/l). Cefprozil is highly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae (unlike cefixime). Those strains of this genus that display intermediate resistance to pneumococci are more susceptible to cefprozil than cefaclor. Neisseria species and Moraxella catarrhalis are susceptible to cefprozil (MIC90 0.06 and 1 mg/l). beta-lactamase-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae appear to be susceptible to cefprozil, as the reported MIC90 is 2-4 mg/l. Enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and those strains of the Enterobacteriaceae that commonly possess a chromosomal cephalosporinase (e.g., Providencia, Morganella and Enterobacter) are generally considered to be resistant to cefprozil as well as to other oral cephalosporins. Cefprozil appears to display enhanced stability to the commonly encountered Tem-1 and SHV-1 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, as found in Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and the Enterobacteriaceae. Cefprozil is rapidly absorbed, reaching a maximum concentration 0.9 to 1.2 h post-dose. Following oral doses of 250 and 500 mg, the Cmax is 6.2 and 10.0 mg/l respectively. Serum half-lives are generally reported as between 1.2 and 1.4 h, and urine recovery is high, 57-70%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Evaluation of OPC-17116 against important pathogens that cause respiratory tract  infections.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of OPC-17116, a new fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent, against important pathogens that cause respiratory tract infections was evaluated in vitro and in vivo and compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin. The pharmacokinetic profiles of OPC-17116 were studied in both mice and rats given the drug orally at doses of 50 and 40 mg/kg of body weight, respectively. OPC-17116 showed a high degree of distribution in the lung tissues of both species, with maximum concentrations of 29.6 and 32.0 micrograms/g, respectively. Furthermore, the drug concentrations in lung tissue were about 10 to 15 times greater than the concentrations in plasma. OPC-17116 showed potent antibacterial activity against such pathogens as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The MICs of this compound for 90% of these organisms except methicillin-resistant S. aureus and P. aeruginosa ranged from < or = 0.006 to 0.78 microgram/ml. The in vitro antibacterial activity of OPC-17116 was reflected by the efficacy of a single oral dose against systemic bacterial infections in mice. OPC-17116 showed a superior effect against gram-positive bacteria, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis. In comparison with the other reference compounds, the efficacy of OPC-17116 was less than that of ciprofloxacin against K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. OPC-17116 showed a greater therapeutic effect than the other drugs against experimental acute pneumonia caused by these organisms in mice or rats. This excellent therapeutic effect against respiratory tract infections may be a result of its high level of distribution in lung tissue.

TI  - Bacterial bronchitis and bronchiectasis in human immunodeficiency virus infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial pneumonia and sinusitis are important causes of morbidity in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We noted an increased incidence of bacterial bronchitis and bronchiectasis in our patients with HIV infection. METHODS: This study was conducted on persons with HIV infection at a county hospital and clinic. Bronchiectasis was diagnosed by bronchogram and computed tomography in one patient and by computed tomography alone in two others. Bacterial bronchitis was defined by a Gram's stain showing an abundance of neutrophils with a predominance of one or more bacteria and by a confirmatory sputum culture. Bronchoscopy with broncho-alveolar lavage was performed in patients with bronchitis to eliminate other causes of bronchial inflammation. RESULTS: Eighteen episodes of bacterial bronchitis in 10 patients are described. The mean CD4 lymphocyte counts for these patients was 0.061 x 10(9)/L (range, 0.001 to 0.203 x 10(9)/L). The most common pathogens in 18 episodes of bacterial bronchitis were Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae (five episodes each) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (four episodes). Response to antibiotic therapy was usually rewarding though recurrences were frequent. Three patients with well-defined bronchiectasis who appeared to have developed, or who became symptomatic during the course of, HIV infection are described. Their mean CD4 cell count was 0.03 x 10(9)/L (range, 0.024 to 0.037 x 10(9)/L). Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas cepacia, and P aeruginosa were recovered from these patients; the P aeruginosa was a mucoid strain. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent bacterial bronchitis should be added to the list of bacterial infections that occur with increased frequency with HIV infection. Repeated bacterial bronchitis may lead to bronchiectasis, which may be more common in HIV infection than generally appreciated.
TI  - [Clinical microbiological study of sputum and aspirates from larynx or trachea. An evaluation of exact criteria for assessment by direct microscopy].
AB  - A prospective study of specimens of lower airway secretions was carried out in order to investigate the association of specimen quality and results of microbiological culture. The quality of expectorates (EXP) or aspirates from larynx/trachea (ALT) was assessed on the basis of numbers per low power field (< 1, 1-10, 11-25, and > 25) of squamous epithelial cells (SEC) and leukocytes, respectively. Specimens were classified as either acceptable, A (< or = 10 SEC), partly acceptable, B (11-25 SEC, > 25 leukocytes), or not acceptable, C (the remaining specimens). Six hundred and six specimens (385 EXP, 221 ALT) from 408 patients were included, and the distribution among categories was A 373 (62%), B 88 (15%), and C 144 (24%). For isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 42) and Haemophilus influenzae (n = 51) there was a statistically significant association with specimen quality, and for aerobic bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa a trend was noted. However, isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (n = 105), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 61), yeasts (n = 45) and Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 7) were not associated with specimen quality. It is concluded that a defined set of criteria allows a useful classification of EXP and ALT by direct microscopy and that it is justifiable not to cultivate specimens found not to be acceptable (category C).
TI  - Acute otorrhea: bacteriology of a common complication of tympanostomy tubes.
AB  - We prospectively followed 246 children with tympanostomy tubes and observed acute otorrhea through a functioning tube at least once in 50% of subjects. Pathogens typical of acute otitis media (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes) were found in 42% of all episodes; Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus was found in 44% of all episodes. Pathogens of acute otitis media were found in 50.0% of subjects under 6 years old versus 4.4% of subjects 6 years or over at the first episode (p < .001). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found more often in children 6 years or older (43.5% versus 20.5% at the first episode, p = .052). Pathogens typical of acute otitis media were less prevalent in the summer months (14.7% versus 52.2% for the first episode, p = .001), while P aeruginosa was more prevalent in summer (44.1% versus 16.4% for the first episode, p = .006). This suggests that while many younger children with acute otorrhea may respond to treatment with oral antimicrobials alone, outpatient therapy of older children may involve use of topical antipseudomonal agents that may be complicated by the question of the safety of such medications.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activities of 3-thiazol-4-yl-1-carba-1-dethiacephalosporins.
AB  - The synthesis and microbiological evaluation of a new series of 3-thiazol-4-yl-carba-1-dethiacephalosporins is described. Structure activity relationship was achieved by changing substitution at the 2-position of the thiazole moiety. The result was a marked variance of microbiological activity in the C7 side-chain derivatives. ATMO derivatives possess potent activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. For example, MICs (microgram/ml) of LY215226 against representative organisms are as follows: S. aureus 0.25, S. pneumoniae 0.008, H. influenzae 0.008, E. coli 0.25, K. pneumoniae 0.008, E. cloacae 0.5, S. typhi 0.25, and M. morganii 0.25.
TI  - Cefquinome (HR 111V). In vitro evaluation of a broad-spectrum cephalosporin indicated for infections in animals.
AB  - Cefquinome (formerly HR 111V), an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was compared with cefepime, cefpirome, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime against 681 clinical cultures and a challenge set of bacteria with well-characterized resistance mechanisms. Cefquinome minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC90) for the enterobacteriaceae ranged from < or = 0.12-2 micrograms/ml with the highest MIC (4 micrograms/ml) obtained among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and Providencia stuartii strains. A total of 90% of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by cefquinome at < or = 8 micrograms/ml. Cefquinome activity of particular note for Gram-positive isolates included Corynebacterium jeikeium (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml) and enterococci (MIC50, 4-8 micrograms/ml). Oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was 32-fold less susceptible (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml) to cefquinome than oxacillin-susceptible (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) strains. Cefquinome was very potent against fastidious isolates such as Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml); Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 0.06-1 micrograms/ml), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC90, 0.06-0.5 micrograms/ml), and Streptococcus species (MIC90, < or = 0.03-006 micrograms/ml). When tested against organisms possessing Bush group 2 enzymes (including extended spectrum beta-lactamases), cefquinome remained active (MIC, < or = 8 micrograms/ml) against the majority of strains. This compound should be very active against pathogens generally found in animal infections and possesses a potency and spectrum comparable to the "fourth-generation" cephalosporins (cefepime and cefpirome) being investigated for human infectious diseases.

AB  - The antibacterial activity of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. SY5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Clostridium spp., and Bacteroides fragilis. Against Providencia spp., Proteus spp., and Haemophilus influenzae, SY5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. SY5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. The bactericidal activities of SY5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the MICs for clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. SY5555 was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. However, SY5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by X. maltophilia (L-1) and P. aeruginosa/pMS354 beta-lactamases, two Bush group 3 beta-lactamases, SY5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from C. freundii GN7391 and E. cloacae GN7471 strains. These results suggest that SY5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Resistance to antimicrobial agents of common bacteria isolated from Taiwan.
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of 11 commonly seen and/or important pathogenic bacteria isolated from the National Taiwan University Hospital in 1981 and 1992 was analysed. Oxacillin-resistance was most remarkable in Staphylococcus aureus. Its prevalence increased rapidly from 6.7% in 1981 to 49.7% in 1992. A high proportion of oxacillin-resistance was also found in coagulase-negative staphylococci, both in 1981 and in 1992. For Streptococcus pneumoniae, no penicillin-resistant nor erythromycin-resistant strain was found in 1981, but by 1992, 5.8% of the isolates were penicillin-resistant 42.3% erythromycin-resistant. Gentamicin-resistance was the most common problem in enterococci, with 70.6% resistance in 1992. As to Gram-negative bacteria, Enterobacter spp. demonstrated a high proportion of resistance to various antimicrobial agents: more than 72% susceptibility was found only for amikacin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was also a highly resistant bacterium, with only 50 to 90% of susceptibility to various antipseudomonal agents. In Haemophilus influenzae, both ampicillin-resistance and chloramphenicol-resistance were remarkable, with 52.2% and 32.9% resistance, respectively, in 1992.
TI  - Bronchoalveolar lavage findings in cystic fibrosis patients with stable, clinically mild lung disease suggest ongoing infection and inflammation.
AB  - To determine the extent of airway infection and inflammation in adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have mild lung disease and are without symptoms of active infection, we performed bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on 18 CF patients > or = 12 yr of age who were stable, appeared clinically well, and had mean (+/- SEM) FEV1 of 79 +/- 4% of predicted. We quantitated the bacteria, inflammatory cells, immunoglobulins, and mediators of inflammatory tissue damage in the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) of these patients and in 23 healthy control subjects. All CF patients were found to be infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and/or Haemophilus influenzae; no organisms were isolated from the control subjects. The mean number of cells in the ELF was 14 times greater in the CF patients than in the control subjects. Neutrophils constituted 57% of the recovered cells in the CF patients versus 3% in the control subjects, and their concentration was 380 times greater in the CF patients versus the control subjects. IgG, IgA, and IgM were 2.5 to 6 times greater in CF ELF versus that of control subjects. Abundant active elastase was present in the ELF of the CF patients (2.3 +/- 0.9 microM) despite threefold elevated levels of alpha 1-protease inhibitor (alpha 1-PI). No active elastase was detectable in the control subjects. alpha 1-PI was functional in CF as demonstrated by elevated elastase:alpha 1-PI complex (0.045 microM in CF versus 0.002 microM in control subjects). This active elastase caused proteolytic destruction of surface complement receptors on airway neutrophils in situ.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Otitis media: microbiology and management.
AB  - Otitis media (OM) is a common childhood disease and one that can cause significant morbidity. A knowledge of the pathogens responsible for OM can assist in the selection of the most appropriate treatment regimen and can minimize complications that may require surgery. The microbiology of acute, serous, and chronic OM is reviewed. The major organisms recovered from about three quarters of acute OM and half of serous OM cultures are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, and viruses can each be isolated in less than 5% of the patients with acute OM. The predominant organisms isolated from chronic OM are Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes are gram-positive cocci, pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp, Bacteroides sp, and Fusobacterium sp. Many of the aerobic and anaerobic organisms causing OM can produce beta-lactamase, rendering them resistant to many of the penicillins. The appropriate surgical and medical therapies for acute, serous, and chronic otitis media are discussed.
TI  - Pediatric osteomyelitis in Panama.
AB  - Two hundred forty-one children who had osteomyelitis during a 19-year period, 1974 through 1992, were identified by chart review. Acute osteomyelitis or chronic osteomyelitis was the diagnosis for 221 (92%) and 20 (8%) of the children, respectively. Bacteriologic etiology was documented in 137 (57%) of the cases. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella species organisms, and Haemophilus influenzae type b were isolated from 97 (40%), 10 (4%), 8 (3%), and 7 (3%) of the children, respectively. S. aureus was the predominant microorganism in all age groups, whereas H. influenzae occurred only in children younger than 2 years of age. P. aeruginosa was recovered predominantly from children with a penetrating injury of the foot, while salmonella bone infections were diagnosed in patients with sickle cell disease. These data provide guidelines for the initial work-up for and management of osteomyelitis in children living in developing Latin American countries.
TI  - Diabetes mellitus in cystic fibrosis: effect of insulin therapy on lung function  and infections.
AB  - The effect of insulin therapy on lung function and lung infections was studied in a retrospective case-control design in 18 diabetic cystic fibrosis (CF) patients; 18 non-diabetic CF patients, matched for sex, age and presence of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection, served as controls. Parameters of CF clinical status were collected for six years before and two years after the onset of insulin therapy in the diabetic patients. Before onset of insulin therapy, body mass index (BMI) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in (pre)diabetic patients deviated increasingly from those in control patients. Decreases in BMI and lung function during the past three months before onset of insulin therapy were reverted within three months of insulin therapy. From three months to two years after onset of insulin therapy, differences in BMI and lung function diminished between diabetic and control patients. After two years of insulin therapy, BMI was similar in diabetic and non-diabetic patients and the percentage differences in forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) and FVC between the two groups were similar to those found six years before the onset of insulin therapy. The finding that insulin therapy improves lung function in diabetic CF patients suggests strongly that the insidious decline in lung function seen during the years before the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus results from the pre-diabetic condition. After onset of insulin therapy, the percentages of sputum examinations positive for Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae decreased in the diabetic patients, whereas parameters of lung infections with P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus remained unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The pattern of respiratory infection in patients with lung cancer.
AB  - We examined retrospectively the pattern of respiratory infection in 579 patients  with lung cancer admitted to Nagasaki University Hospital during the past 15 years. A total of 139 patients (24.0%) developed respiratory infection. The rates of pulmonary infection associated with large (36.2%) and small cell carcinomas (33.6%) were significantly higher than those with squamous cell carcinoma (26.0%) and adenocarcinoma (17.3%). Advanced stages of lung cancer were associated with higher complication rates (stage I: 6.3%, stage II: 15.9%, stage III: 27.9%, and stage IV: 33.8%). Deceased patients showed a significantly higher rate of pulmonary infection than alive patients during the period of investigation. Isolated organisms in excess of 10(7) cfu/ml in sputum or 10(4) cfu/ml in bronchial aspirate were mainly gram-negative bacteria (68.8%), such as Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The number of patients infected with gram-positive bacteria increased markedly after 1982. Our results suggest that a successful control of pulmonary infection associated with lung cancer is important in improving the prognosis of lung malignancy.
TI  - Beta-lactamases: current situation and clinical importance.
AB  - Production of beta-lactamases is the most important means of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. The traditional, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases were initially confined to Enterobacteriaceae but have now spread to other genera and species including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Extended-spectrum plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases have been identified in Enterobacteriaceae, particularly Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli. They are capable of hydrolyzing second- and third-generation cephalosporins and older beta-lactams. Chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases may be produced constitutively or induced by the presence of a beta-lactam. Mutation within the bacterial genome may lead to constitutive enzyme hyperproduction. Strains that produce these enzymes are resistant to practically all beta-lactams, with the exception of carbapenems. The wide-spread occurrence of antibiotic resistance dictates that therapies be judiciously chosen with attention to the resistance patterns of the causative organisms.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of a new carbapenem antibiotic, biapenem (L-627), in the pediatric field].
AB  - Biapenem (L-627) was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in 27 children with various bacterial infections. L-627 was effective in cases with osteomyelitis due to Staphylococcus aureus, pneumonia and purulent meningitis due to penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and urinary tract infections due to Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, L-627 failed to produce good responses in 2 of 7 cases of Haemophilus influenzae infections. Pharmacokinetic parameters of 30-minutes infusion of 12 mg/kg were as follows: Cmax 29-46 micrograms/ml, T 1/2 0.68-0.94 hr. Adverse reactions were minimal. These data suggest that L-627 is safe in children, and is valuable especially for treatment of infections in immunocompromised hosts and infections due to multiply resistant bacteria.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on biapenem (L-627) in children].
AB  - The results are summarized as follows: 1. A total of 10 patients were treated with biapenem (L-627). We received informed consent from all of their parents. Each dose was 6 mg/kg, and it was administered 3 times daily (40 mg/kg, 4 times daily in meningitis), in a 30-minute intravenous drip infusion for 5-17 days. The clinical efficacies of L-627 in 10 patients with bacterial infections (1 with purulent meningitis, 1 with sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 2 with urinary tract infection and 1 with purulent tonsillitis) were evaluated as excellent in 8 patients, as good in 2 patients with an efficacy rate of 100%. Seven causative organisms found in 5 patients (Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis in 2, Haemophilus influenzae in 2 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 1) were eradicated. No adverse reaction was observed in any of the 10 patients. 2. Pharmacokinetic studies Peak plasma concentrations of L-627 were 12.5-13.7 micrograms/ml at the dose of 6 mg/kg administered by 30-minute drip infusion. Plasma half-lives of L-627 in the beta-phase averaged 0.72 hour (0.63-0.80 hour). CSF concentration/plasma concentration ratios of L-627 were 1.12/8.16 micrograms/ml (Day 2, 1.17 hours after at dose of 20 mg/kg), 0.88/3.44 micrograms/ml (Day 3, 4.0 hours after at dose of 30 mg/kg) and 0.68/5.12 micrograms/ml (Day 13, 3.0 hours after at dose of 40 mg/kg) administered by 30-minute drip infusion in the child with purulent meningitis (case 1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Lactoferrin is a lipid A-binding protein.
AB  - Lactoferrin (LF), a cationic 80-kDa protein present in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and in mucosal secretions, is known to have antibacterial effects on gram-negative bacteria, with a concomitant release of lipopolysaccharides (LPS, endotoxin). In addition, LF is known to decrease LPS-induced cytokine release by monocytes and LPS priming of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Its mechanism of action is incompletely understood. We have now demonstrated by in vitro-binding studies that LF binds directly to isolated lipid A and intact LPS of clinically relevant serotypes of the species which most frequently cause bacteremia (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), as well as to lipid A and LPS of mucosal pathogens (among others, Neisseria meningitides and Haemophilus influenzae). Binding to LPS was inhibitable by lipid A and polymyxin B but not by KDO (3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate), a glycoside residue present in the inner core of LPS. Binding of LF to lipid A was saturable, and an affinity constant of 2 x 10(9) M-1 was calculated for the LF-lipid A interaction. Our data may explain, in part, the mechanism whereby LF exerts its antibacterial and anti-endotoxic effects. Further studies on the ability of LF to block the detrimental effects of LPS, both in vitro and in vivo, are warranted.
TI  - Piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections: an open non-comparative and multicentered trial. Latin American Clinical Research Group.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and bacteriological efficacy  and safety of piperacillin-tazobactam (PT) (4g/500 mg IV tid) in the treatment of 107 adult patients with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) requiring hospitalization. Patients included were 66 men and 41 women with a mean age of 55.2 years (range 18-89), enrolled from Mexican (6) and Argentinean (5) hospitals. Ninety-nine clinically evaluable patients (92.5%), 87 with pneumonia and 12 with bronchitis, were treated for a mean period of 9.3 and 7.3 days, respectively. Response to treatment was favorable in 94.3% cases with pneumonia and 100% of cases with bronchitis; 86 cases (80.3%) were bacteriologically evaluable, 77 with pneumonia (eradication 74, persistence 1, superinfection 2), and 9 with bronchitis (eradication in all). Streptococcus pneumoniae was recovered in 24, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 21, Staphylococcus aureus in 8, Haemophilus influenzae in 7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 5, Enterobacter spp. in 6, Escherichia coli in 6 and other organisms in 12. Toxicity or intolerance were not observed. Our data suggest that PT is a reliable therapy for severe LRTI.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. The advantages of in vitro activity of FK037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (MIC90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA), (3) a strong activity against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (MIC90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for C. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant S. aureus (L-MRSA), Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for H-MRSA and Serratia marcescens. FK037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except MRSA, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except P. vulgaris and/or M. catarrhalis. The increase in MICs of FK037 against 2 L-MRSA strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa at the MIC or higher. FK037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. Its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against H-MRSA and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Against the other strains, FK037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that FK037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in MRSA after 4 h incubation.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of aztreonam against clinical isolates].
AB  - To evaluate the antibacterial activity of a monobactam antibiotic, aztreonam (AZT), MICs of AZT and other antibiotics against clinical isolates collected at 36 participating institutions after January 1992 were determined using the agar plate dilution method (size of inoculum, 10(6) cfu/ml) according to the Japan Society of Chemotherapy standard. The antibiotics that were tested along with AZT included piperacillin (PIPC), cefoperazone (CPZ), and amikacin (AMK). AZT was found to be more active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Providencia rettgeri than CPZ, PIPC, and AMK. AZT was also more active against Serratia marcescens than the other antibiotics, but about 6% of the strains tested were resistant to AZT with MIC of 12.5 micrograms/ml. Against Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii, however, was more active AMK than AZT. AZT showed a normal activity distribution with a single peak at the MIC of 3.13-6.25 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 35% of inoculum was resistant with high MIC values (MIC > or = 25 micrograms/ml). Activities of AZT against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were comparable to those of CPZ.
TI  - Minimum inhibitory concentration quality-control guidelines for biapenem, DU-6859a, FK-037, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, and ceftizoxime when using various National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards susceptibility test methods. Quality Control Study Group.
AB  - Several multilaboratory collaborative studies using broth microdilution and agar  dilution (gonococcal tests only) methods of susceptibility testing were performed to establish quality-control (QC) giudelines. Replicate dilution tests with multiple lots of media were performed with National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards recommended QC strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213) by using the following antimicrobials: biapenem, DU-6859a, FK-037, levofloxacin, and grepafloxacin. In addition QC MIC ranges, using appropriate medium modification for Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226 were reported on four (DU-6859a, FK-037, levofloxacin, and grepafloxacin) and two (ceftizoxime and FK-037) antimicrobials, respectively.
TI  - Inhibition of fungal growth by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas cepacia isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - This study was undertaken because of the infrequency of infections due to Candida species in patients with cystic fibrosis despite their extensive treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. In vitro susceptibility studies revealed significant inhibition of 11 strains of fungi known to infect human beings by 10 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and nine strains of Pseudomonas cepacia isolated from the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis. The fungi were Candida krusei, Candida keyfr, Candida guillermondii, Candida tropicalis, Candida lusitaniae, Candida parapsilosis, Candida pseudotropicalis, Candida albicans, Torulopsis glabrata, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus fumigatus. Inhibition of fungal growth by Escherichia coli (NCTC 10418), Staphylococcus aureus (NCTC 6571) and Haemophilus influenzae (NCTC 11931) could not be demonstrated. The continued presence in the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis of strains of P. aeruginosa and P. cepacia, which produce antifungal substances, may inhibit growth of Candida species and so prevent overt Candida infections. A. fumigatus would seem to be the most important fungus causing disease in patients with cystic fibrosis. It is therefore interesting to note that this was the most resistant of all the fungi tested for inhibition by P. aeruginosa and P. cepacia.
TI  - Community acquired lobar pneumonia in patients with HIV infection and AIDS.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Community acquired bacterial pneumonia is increasingly encountered in HIV infected individuals and some patients have a radiographic lobar pneumonia. METHODS: A retrospective review of clinical features, microbiological diagnosis, and outcome of community acquired lobar pneumonia was carried out in HIV positive patients admitted to a specialist unit from 1987 to 1993. RESULTS: Forty nine episodes occurred in 45 patients, all of whom were men. CD4 counts ranged widely. A bacteriological diagnosis was made in 25 episodes (51%), seven patients had more than one infective cause. The commonest pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (11 episodes), Staphylococcus aureus (six), Pneumocystis carinii (three), Haemophilus influenzae (three), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two). Four patients died. Other complications included intrapulmonary cavitation or abscess formation (11 episodes), empyema (three), and pleural effusion (10 episodes). CONCLUSIONS: Many different infections cause community acquired lobar pneumonia in HIV positive men. Some patients have co-infections and there is a high complication rate.
TI  - Mucosal and systemic immunizations with killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa protect against acute respiratory infection in rats.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the efficacies of prior mucosal (oral, intra-Peyer's patch, or intratracheal) and systemic (subcutaneous) immunizations with killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa in clearance of an acute P. aeruginosa respiratory infection in rats. Rats were immunized with paraformaldehyde-killed P. aeruginosa at various doses, and 2 weeks later, the rats were challenged with a log10 dose of 8.7 live bacteria. This dose was fatal for unimmunized rats, with death occurring approximately 12 h after challenge. The numbers of surviving bacteria in the airways and lung tissue were determined by analyses of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) and lung homogenate samples, respectively. Enhanced bacterial clearance was associated with survival of intra-Peyer's patch-immunized rats. Determination of bacterial clearance in BAL 4 h after challenge demonstrated that the use of all immunization routes led to significant clearance compared with the bacterial levels in unimmunized controls (the order of effectiveness was intra-Peyer's patch > oral-intratracheal > intratracheal > subcutaneous > oral). Bacterial clearance in the lung homogenate was also significantly greater for all immunization routes than in the unimmunized controls (the order of effectiveness was intra-Peyer's patch > subcutaneous > oral-intratracheal > oral = intratracheal). Prior oral immunization with killed P. aeruginosa also induced enhanced bacterial clearance of heterologous strains of P. aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and to a lesser extent, Klebsiella pneumoniae. Because of the ease of antigen delivery, oral immunization with killed P. aeruginosa may be an important route of immunization for induction of enhanced bacterial clearance of subsequent acute respiratory infection with P. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefdinir (FK482) and ten other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from adult and pediatric patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefdinir, an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin was compared with that of cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 279 gram-positive and gram-negative recent clinical isolates from adult and pediatric patients. Cefdinir was the most active drug among the cephalosporins against oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90 0.015-2 mg/l). Cefixime was the most active agent against Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris (MIC90 < 0.015-0.125 mg/l). The activity of cefpodoxime was better than that of cefixime against S. pneumoniae and oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci (MIC90 0.25-8 vs. 0.5-32 mg/l), similar to cefixime against S. pyogenes (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) and not as good as cefixime against H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. (MIC90 < 0.015-0.25 vs. 0.125-0.5 mg/l). The activity of cefdinir was greater than that of the other cephalosporins against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 16-32 vs. > 64 mg/l). None of the cephalosporins were active against methicillin-resistant, coagulase-positive or -negative staphylococci or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 > 64 mg/l). Overall, the susceptibilities of adult and pediatric isolates were similar. Kinetic kill curves demonstrated rapid and similar killing at 6 h by cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime and ofloxacin. At 24 h at 1 x MIC, the least regrowth was observed with cefdinir and cefpodoxime; at 2 x MIC, suppression of growth was similar with all four drugs.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in children: etiology and clinical features, an 11-year review of 618 cases.
AB  - During the period January 1980 to December 1990 (11 years) a retrospective study  of patients with bacterial meningitis who were admitted to Bangkok Children's Hospital was carried out. There were 618 patients with 77 cases (12.5%) occurring below the age of one month (neonatal meningitis), and 541 cases (87.5%) between one month to 15 years (childhood meningitis). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common pathogenic organism (16.9%) in neonatal meningitis; other causative agents in this age group included Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.0%), group B Streptococcus (11.7%), Escherichia coli and Enterobacter sp (10.4% each). In childhood meningitis, Haemophilus influenzae was the most common causative organism (42.3%), and followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.2%) and Salmonella sp (12.4%). Excluding a 13 year-old leukemic patient, Salmonella meningitis occurred exclusively in infants, 87% of them were under six months, and 13% of them developed relapsing meningitis. Presenting symptoms and signs on admission of neonatal meningitis such as fever (81.8%), convulsions (45.4%), neck stiffness (22.5%), bulging fontanelle (33.3%) and Brudzinski sign (11.5%) were significantly less frequent than in the patients beyond the neonatal period (p < 0.05). The overall fatalities during 1980-1990 were 45.4% and 17.3% for neonatal meningitis and childhood meningitis, respectively. The fatalities of the two age groups declined significantly during 1987-1990 to 26.3% and 11.4% respectively.
TI  - [Bacteriologic study of 80 cases of acute otitis media in children].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Etiology of acute otitis media (AOM) in children is almost unknown in our country. We report 80 cases in order to study the most common pathogens. METHODS: Eighty healthy children diagnosed of acute otitis media were studied between June 1989 and March 1992. Tympanocentesis was performed on each patient with an Abbocath-20G needle connected to a sterile syringe. RESULTS: Some pathogens was isolated in 58 patients (72.5%) and in 22 (27.5%) the culture was sterile or with usual flora of the external canal. S. pneumoniae was recovered in 26 cases (32.5%); H. influenzae in 23 cases (28.7%); S. pyogenes 4 cases (5%); E. coli 4; P. aeruginosa 3 (3.7%); S. aureus 2 (2.5%); anaerobes 2 cases. M. catarrhalis was not found in any cases. In 6 children there was mixed flore. CONCLUSIONS: In 80 children with AOM some pathogens was isolated in 58 cases (72.5%). The most common agents were S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae.
TI  - Comparative crossover assessment of serum bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.
AB  - The study compared the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in 12 healthy male volunteers with normal renal function. Each volunteer received oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg, intravenous (i.v.) ciprofloxacin 400 mg, oral ofloxacin 400 mg, or i.v. ofloxacin 400 mg in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design with a one-week 'washout' period between doses. Mean peak serum concentrations were 4.48 and 5.44 mg/L for i.v. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, respectively. For the oral regimens, mean peak serum concentrations were 2.45 mg/L for ciprofloxacin and 4.44 mg/L for ofloxacin. Minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) and serum bactericidal activity (SBA) for each drug were measured against five strains of each of the following species: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratus, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, using the microdilution method of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Ciprofloxacin was more active in vitro than ofloxacin against the tested species of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, while ofloxacin was slightly more active against A. anitratus. MBCs for the two drugs were similar for H. influenzae and S. aureus. Oral and i.v. ciprofloxacin in the doses given resulted in nearly equivalent SBA. Similarly, oral and i.v. ofloxacin had nearly equivalent SBA. For the i.v. and oral regimens of both agents, peak SBA was > or = 2 throughout the 12-hour test period against the Enterobacteriaceae and H. influenzae. At peak concentrations, both drugs had modest SBA against P. aeruginosa, A. anitratus, and S. aureus but little or no activity 8 and 12 h after dosing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The comparative pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration of single-dose ciprofloxacin 400 mg i.v. and 750 mg po.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin following single doses of 400 mg i.v. and 750 mg po were compared in six healthy volunteers. Concentrations of ciprofloxacin were measured in plasma, cantharides induced blister fluid and urine, by microbiological assay and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Mean peak plasma concentration was 6.7 +/- 1.4 mg/L after i.v. and 3.9 +/- 1.7 mg/L after oral administration with mean elimination half-lives of 4.2 and 4.0 h respectively. Mean area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) was greater following oral administration (19.2 +/- 1.1 mg/L.h versus 14.2 +/- 1.1 mg/L.h). Blister fluid peak concentrations following i.v. and oral administration were 2.6 +/- 1.3 mg/L and 2.28 +/- 1.2 mg/L respectively. The elimination half-life from blister fluid was 4.1 +/- 1.1 h and the AUC 13.8 +/- 1.1 mg/L.h following i.v. administration compared with 4.6 +/- 1.5 h and 20.3 +/- 1.3 mg/L.h for the oral dose. A mean of 50.8% of i.v. administered drug and 39.6% or orally administered drug was excreted in urine in 24 h as measured by HPLC. The corresponding values by microbiological assay were greater, suggesting excretion of active metabolites. Both i.v. and oral doses produced levels in blister fluid concentration above the MICs for most Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria spp. at 12 h post dose. The pharmacokinetic data from inflammatory fluid indicate that ciprofloxacin 400 mg i.v. is more equivalent to 750 mg po than the plasma pharmacokinetic data suggest.
TI  - C-reactive protein is not a useful indicator of intermittent bacterial colonization in early lung disease of patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - C-reactive protein (CRP) is a general marker of the systemic inflammatory response to bacterial infection. Serial measurement of CRP is useful in monitoring respiratory exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We hypothesized that regular monitoring of CRP in young children with CF prior to colonization with P. aeruginosa might provide an objective guide to the need for antibiotic treatment. Twenty-two children were studied prospectively over a 6 month period. We measured CRP every 2 months and at the beginning and end of respiratory exacerbations. In samples taken when the children were well, median CRP was 0.45 microgram/mL compared with 1.92 micrograms/mL when they were symptomatic with positive culture results (P < 0.05). Despite this difference there was considerable overlap between CRP levels for infected and noninfected patients. A CRP value of > 1.82 micrograms/mL (the upper 95% confidence interval for a control group of well children without CF) had a sensitivity of 49% and a specificity of 83% in determining a symptomatic exacerbation. We conclude that in this group of patients CRP measurements were of little value in monitoring respiratory exacerbations in patients who become intermittently infected with either Haemophilus influenzae or Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Microbiology and management of otitis media.
AB  - Otitis media is a complex and multifactorial condition with four defined stages:  myringitis, acute otitis media, secretory (serous) otitis media and chronic otitis media. Drugs utilized in its treatment are antihistamines, decongestants, mucolytic agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, corticosteroids, vaccine therapy and antibiotics. The rationale for using antibiotics is that inflammation has been associated with the presence of virulent bacteria in all types of otitis media. In acute otitis media the major organisms, present are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. In chronic otitis media these organisms, plus Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobic bacteria are all prevalent. The microbiological flora of the middle ear in secretory otitis media is almost identical with that in acute otitis media. Empirical therapy can be given in most instances of acute and serous otitis media. However, in cases of failure, in the immunocompromised and in instances of chronic otitis media, establishing the individual microbiology of the inflamed middle ear is very helpful. The growing resistance of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis to amoxycillin, due to beta-lactamase production, increases the risk of treatment failure of acute and serous otitis media. By adding a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid) to amoxycillin, or using second-generation cephalosporins, clearance can be achieved. Management of chronic otitis media requires surgical correction, drainage and coverage of anaerobic bacteria with agents such as amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, or clindamycin plus antimicrobials against other pathogens such as Pseudomonas spp. where present.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a new antipseudomonal dual-action drug, Ro 25-0534.
AB  - Ro 25-0534, a tertiary amine-linked dual action combination (DAC) of a catechol cephalosporin and ciprofloxacin, was compared with a previously described DAC (Ro 23-9424), ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime. A total of 688 recent clinical isolates were tested and an additional collection of 110 Gram-negative bacilli possessing documented resistance to broad-spectrum antimicrobials were used. Ro 25-0534 was active against all tested species of Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90 range, 0.06-2 micrograms/ml), oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and penicillin-susceptible pneumococci (MIC90 range, 1-2 micrograms/ml). Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 range, 0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml), and most nonenteric Gram-negative bacilli (MIC90 range, 2-4 micrograms/ml) such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., and Xanthomonas maltophilia. Enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis isolates were resistant to Ro 25-0534. The Ro 25-0354 potency against most susceptible strains was generally severalfold less than that of Ro 23-9424 (except for Pseudomonas-Xanthomonas) or ciprofloxacin alone.
TI  - [Bacterial meningitis in patients with sepsis syndrome].
AB  - The authors discuss problems connected with diagnosis, management and treatment of bacterial meningitis among patients with the sepsis syndrome. Considering secondary organ changes bacterial meningitis belongs to the severest one and as a life-threathing sequel of sepsis demands immediate use of proper casual treatment. The authors show the therapeutic difficulties in this group of patients particularly when the etiological organism is unknown. They discuss this problems and present their own schemes of tretment. They indicate the value of passive immunotherapy and surgical removal of the primary source of infection. They emphasize final result depends on secondary organ changes, age, immunity of patient and the kind of etiological agent.
TI  - The role of HSV-induced Fc- and C3b (i)-receptors in bacterial adherence.
AB  - Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) induces Fc- and C3b(i)-receptors on infected  cells. The role of these receptors in bacterial superinfection was studied by comparing the adherence of non-opsonised and opsonised bacteria to HSV-infected and non-infected HEp-2 cells. A flow cytometric adherence assay, based on the fluorescent quantitation of FITC-labelled bacteria, was developed. Opsonisation of Staphylococcus epidermidis with human serum, resulted in a marked increase in adherence to HSV-infected cells and revealed a role for C3b(i)R- and FcR-mediated adhesion. However, the enhanced adherence never exceeded the level of attachment to non-infected cells. Increased adherence of other pathogenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not observed, indicating that the HSV-receptors play a minor role in secondary infections. Bacterial adhesion factors such as the fimbriae of E. coli played a more dominant role in the adherence of bacteria to HSV-infected cells.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of cefotaxime: comparative multinational hospital isolate surveys covering 15 years.
AB  - The "third-generation" cephalosporins (3GC) have emerged as one of the most significant therapeutic entities in the last 15 years. These 3GC compounds (using cefotaxime as a model) have generally maintained their potency and spectrum of activity against important pathogens. However, the continuing popularity of this class associated with local, regional, or national-level use or abuse has led to efficacy reduction against some organism populations associated with selection of Class I cephalosporinase, stably derepressed mutants predominantly among Citrobacter and Enterobacter spp.; emergence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae (usually Klebsiella spp.), as well as some isolates mimicking Class I-type resistance patterns; and lastly, altered PBP-mediated resistances among pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae and pathogenic Neisseria spp. Some of these resistance patterns had been present prior to the clinical introduction of 3GCs and have only significantly threatened their use in the last 5 years. Prudent application of these 3GC drugs should be the goal for this decade as follows: 1) use as monotherapy at appropriate doses and frequencies only for organisms with low potential for mutational events; 2) use combination therapy routinely for organisms such as Citrobacter, Enterobacter, some indole-positive protease and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to minimize emerging resistance clones; 3) use conservatively in high risk patients to minimize "super-colonization" by emerging problem bacteria (e.g. vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Xanthomonas maltophilia etc.); 4) use only those agents among 3GCs that have documented safety, broad clinical applications to all age groups, acceptable pharmacokinetic features and clear cost-saving potential; and 5) use in prophylaxis (surgical procedure, selective decontamination), should be focused toward single-dose or short-course regimens to reduce total hospital-wide exposure to broad-spectrum beta-lactam drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefepime in vitro.
AB  - Cefepime is a new parenterally active fourth-generation cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. Using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli (98 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (99 strains), Acinetobacter spp. (24 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (98 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (108 strains), Staphylococcus aureus (100 strains), Enterococcus spp. (45 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (group A; 19 strains) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B; 36 strains). Cefepime showed excellent activity against E. coli and K. pneumoniae, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 0.12 mg/l. The in vitro activity of cefepime was superior to or comparable to the third-generation cephalosporins tested but was inferior to ciprofloxacin against Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa. Against H. influenzae, whether or not the strains produced beta-lactamase, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. All 84 isolates of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime whereas, like other cephalosporins, it had little activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Of the 45 enterococci isolates tested, 44.4% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime. Against streptococci, its activity was superior to any drug tested. This in vitro study indicates that cefepime has the potential to be a valuable agent for the treatment of community- and hospital-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
TI  - Agar disk diffusion (Bauer-Kirby) tests with various fastidious and nonfastidious reference (ATCC) strains: comparison of several agar media.
AB  - Several agar media (Mueller-Hinton agar, MHA; diagnostic sensitivity test agar, DSTA; Schaedler agar, SchA; Todd-Hewitt agar with added yeast extract, THYA; Wilkins-Chalgren agar, WCA) were compared using the Bauer-Kirby agar disk diffusion test against six nonfastidious quality control strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and ATCC 29213, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and ATCC 35218, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212. MHA, DSTA, and THYA yielded essentially comparable inhibition zones. However, WCA and SchA antagonized cotrimoxazole and aminoglycoside antibiotics; furthermore, SchA antagonized polymyxin B, and both WCA and SchA antagonized imipenem against the P. aeruginosa strain, but not against the E. coli strains. Sheep blood-MHA (Bl-MHA), WCA, THYA, and DSTA were examined with Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 13813, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 6306. In comparison with Bl-MHA, both WCA and THYA yielded comparable inhibition zones against S. pyogenes; DSTA afforded suboptimal growth. DSTA yielded larger inhibition zones with the majority of antimicrobial drugs against S. agalactiae, whereas WCA and THYA enhanced the activity of oxacillin and penicillin G against this strain. S. pneumoniae strain ATCC 6306 grew well on Bl-MHA, yielded suboptimal growth on WCA and faint growth on THYA, and failed to grow on DSTA. Chocolate-supplemented sheep blood-MHA (CHOC-MHA) was compared with Haemophilus test medium (HTM), WCA with added NAD, and THYA with added hematin and NAD against Haemophilus influenzae strains ATCC 35056 and ATCC 49247. The activities of doxycycline and rifampin were enhanced against both strains by HTM, WCA+NAD, and THYA+hematin+NAD. Only WCA+NAD antagonized cotrimoxazole against both H. influenzae strains, an effect due to thymidine; however, HTM antagonized cotrimoxazole against S. aureus ATCC 25923 and E. coli ATCC 25922. It was concluded that Bl-MHA performed best for beta-hemolytic streptococci quality control strains. Likewise, CHOC-MHA was optimal for the two H. influenzae strains used in this comparative agar disk diffusion study.
TI  - Utility of gram stain in evaluation of sputa from patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - The utility of sputum Gram stain in assessing salivary contamination and in predicting the presence of pathogens on the basis of morphology was investigated in 287 respiratory specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis. Where acceptability for culture was defined as a leukocyte/squamous epithelial cell ratio of > 5, 76.6% (220 of 287) of respiratory specimens received in the laboratory were considered acceptable. Unacceptable specimens were more common in younger patients. The positive predictive value of the Gram stain for growth from acceptable sputum samples was 98% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 84.4% for Pseudomonas cepacia, 86.3% for Staphylococcus aureus, and 100% for Haemophilus influenzae. In cystic fibrosis patients, as has been reported for respiratory specimens in general, Gram stain of respiratory specimens in helpful for interpreting culture results.
TI  - [Endoscopic monitoring in lung transplantation. Transplantation Group of the Maggiore Policlinico Hospital of Milan].
AB  - During the period March 1991-June 1992 5 single lung transplantations were successfully performed at the Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico in Milan. All patients underwent regular fibrobronchoscopies within the context of a complex follow-up programme in order to monitor the resolution of the bronchial anastomosis and identify the onset of intercurrent lung infections and rejections using bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsies (TBB). Forty-four fibrobronchoscopies were performed of which 24 for anastomotic follow-up, BAL and TBB, and 20 for the simple monitoring of the anastomosis. Fibrobronchoscopies confirmed the optimal resolution of bronchial anastomosis in 4 patients, whereas one patient showed a granulomatous anastomotic reaction which was successfully treated using local steroid injections. Although recovery was normal in one patient, kinking appeared in the bronchus of the receiving lung which was successfully treated by the insertion of Gianturco prosthesis. BAL enabled the identification of 2 CMV infections, one Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one Haemophilus influenzae and one Pneumocystis carinii infection. TBB allowed 3 cases of CMW lung infection and 7 episodes of rejection to be diagnosed. The authors' personal experience confirms the decisive role played by bronchoscopy in the follow-up of lung transplant patients. This procedure allowed bronchial anastomosis to be closely monitored and was of vital importance in the diagnosis of lung infections and rejection.
TI  - In vitro activity of DU-6859a, a new fluorocyclopropyl quinolone.
AB  - DU-6859a was tested against 844 recent clinical isolates (most from bacteremias)  by using reference MIC determination procedures. The activity of DU-6859a against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin (range of MICs for 90% of isolates [MIC90], < or = 0.015 to 1 microgram/ml), and the highest MICs were observed among Serratia marcescens and Providencia rettgeri isolates. The DU-6859a MIC90 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Xanthomonas maltophilia was 0.5 microgram/ml. Pneumococci (MIC90, 0.06 microgram/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, < or = 0.004 microgram/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, < or = 0.015 microgram/ml), and pathogenic neisseriae (MIC90, 0.015 to 0.03 microgram/ml) were very susceptible to DU-6859a. All staphylococci had DU-6859a MICs of < or = 1 microgram/ml, including oxacillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. DU-6859a was very active against isolates resistant to ceftazidime (MIC90, < or = 0.12 microgram/ml), ciprofloxacin (MIC90, < or = 8 micrograms/ml), and gentamicin (MIC90, < or = 1 microgram/ml).
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of PD 138312 and PD 140248, new fluoronaphthyridines with outstanding gram-positive potency.
AB  - PD 138312 and PD 140248 are new quinolones with high in vitro activities against  a wide spectrum of bacterial species, notably including gram-positive isolates. The respective MICs (in micrograms per milliliter) of PD 138312 and PD 140248 capable of inhibiting > or = 90% of the strains were < or = 0.06 and < or = 0.06 for oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococci, streptococci (including Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; 0.125 and 0.03 for Legionella pneumophila; 0.25 and 0.125 for Listeria monocytogenes; 0.25 and 0.25 for Enterococcus faecalis; 0.5 and 0.06 for anaerobic gram-positive cocci; 0.5 and 0.25 for Acinetobacter spp.; 0.5 and 0.5 for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (excluding Serratia marcescens); 2 and 0.5 for Bacteroides fragilis; 2 and 2 for Serratia marcescens and ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci; and 8 and 4 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - In vitro activity of Bay y 3118, a new quinolone.
AB  - MICs of Bay y 3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, cefuroxime, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 878 recent clinical isolates were determined by broth microdilution methods. Among the three quinolones, Bay y 3118 was the most active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Xanthomonas maltophilia, gram-positive cocci, and anaerobes; MICs for 50% of the strains (MIC50s) and MIC90s were < or = 0.015 and < or = 0.015, < or = 0.015 and < or = 0.015, 0.03 and 2, 0.25 and 0.5, 0.06 and 1, and 0.12 and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. For gram-positive cocci and anaerobes, these values were 16- to 32-fold (4 to 5 log2 dilution steps) lower than those for ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Bay y 3118 was similar in activity to ciprofloxacin and more active than ofloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Bay y 3118 MIC50s and MIC90s were 0.03 and 0.25 and 0.5 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. Scattergrams and regression analyses comparing quinolone MICs indicated that, despite differences in activity, organisms relatively susceptible to one were relatively susceptible to all and organisms relatively resistant to one were relatively resistant to all. However, the greater in vitro activity of Bay y 3118 was most pronounced against relatively resistant organisms. Pending pharmacokinetic and safety data for Bay y 3118, there is reasonable anticipation that its enhanced activity against gram-positive cocci and anaerobes would broaden the clinical utility of the quinolone class of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Cefepime: overview of activity in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - Cefepime is a novel methoxyimino-aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a quaternized  N-methyl-pyrrolidine moiety at the 3' position conferring zwitterionic properties. Because of this the molecule penetrates the outer cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria rapidly. In addition it is resistant to degradation by several plasmid and chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases, for which it also shows very low affinity and no inducing capacity. It has good affinity for PBPs 2 and 3 of Escherichia coli and for PBP 3 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Its broad-spectrum of activity includes Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. It is more active than cefotaxime or ceftazidime, against Enterobacteriaceae. The MIC90 for P. aeruginosa is higher than that of ceftazidime, but lower than those of cefpirome, cefoperazone and latamoxef. Other Gram-negative organisms, Haemophilus influenzae, Neiserria meningitidis, Neiserria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis are highly susceptible to cefepime. Among Gram-positive species methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, whether beta-lactamase producers or not, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes are susceptible. Cefepime is active against cefotaxime- and/or ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Only strains of P. aeruginosa producing large amounts of beta-lactamase may be resistant to both ceftazidime and cefepime. In experimental infections such as meningitis, induced with various bacterial species in neonatal rats and chronic staphylococcal osteomyelitis in rabbits, cefepime has shown good efficacy.
TI  - Low-dosage cefepime as treatment for serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Since infection develops in significant numbers of hospitalized patients, the problem of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins is of increasing concern. We evaluated the efficacy of cefepime 1 g bd as treatment for acute, moderately severe bacterial infection in 239 hospitalized patients (mean age 60 years). Of these patients, 204 were evaluated clinically for urinary tract infection (UTI) (n = 90), lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) (n = 70), skin and soft tissue infection (S/STI) (n = 12) and bacteraemia which was associated with either UTI or LRTI (n = 32) but not included in the previously mentioned UTI and LRTI groups. Amongst the pathogens isolated (36 Gram-positive, 150 Gram-negative), the most predominant species were Escherichia coli in UTI and bacteraemia (n = 81), Streptococcus pneumoniae in LRTI and bacteraemia (n = 23), Haemophilus influenzae in LRTI (n = 16), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and Enterobacter cloacae (n = 2) in S/STI. The mean duration of treatment was 8.5 days and was the same for the 204 clinically evaluable patients. Overall, the clinical cure rate for cefepime was 94% (191/204). Pathogen eradication was achieved in 93% (185/199) of infections. Of the patients with associated bacteraemia, the clinical cure rate was 97% (31/32) and 94% (16/17) of the pathogens were eradicated. Cefepime therapy was well-tolerated. Treatment was discontinued in eight patients (3%) because of local intolerance and in five patients (2%) because of drug-related adverse events (rash, headache and pruritus). Cefepime 1 g bd is as safe and effective as other parenteral cephalosporins for the treatment of acute bacterial UTI, LRTI and S/STI, including those cases with associated bacteraemia. The bd dosing schedule and reported lack of cross-resistance with other cephalosporins against some species of aerobic Gram-negative bacilli make cefepime an attractive treatment option in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Impact of previous antimicrobial therapy on the etiology and outcome of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the influence of prior antibiotic use on the etiology and mortality of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). SETTING: A university hospital medical-surgical ICU. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. METHODS: Over a 35-month period, we prospectively studied 129 consecutive episodes of VAP. Etiologic diagnosis was established using a protected specimen brush and quantitative culture techniques. We examined prognostic factors by univariate and multivariate analyses using a statistical software package (SPSS). RESULTS: The rate of VAP caused by Gram-positive cocci or Haemophilus influenzae was statistically lower (p < 0.05) in the patients who had received antibiotics previously, while the rate of VAP caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa was statistically higher (p < 0.01). Patients died of causes directly related to the infection in 18 (14.0 percent) episodes, P aeruginosa being isolated in 9 of these fatal cases. Indeed, we found that 27.7 percent (15/54) of patients who had received prior antimicrobial therapy before the onset of pneumonia died, compared with only 4.0 percent (3/75) of those who did not. In the univariate analysis, the variables significantly associated with attributable mortality were age older than 45 years, use of corticosteroids, presence of shock, hospital day of VAP over 9, antecedent COPD, and a prior antibiotic use. A step-forward logistic regression analysis defined only prior antibiotic use (p < 0.0001, OR = 9.2) as significantly influencing the risk of death from VAP. The same result was obtained when severity was included in the model. However, prior antibiotic use entirely dropped out as a significant risk factor when the etiologic agent was included in the regression equation. CONCLUSIONS: Distribution of infecting microorganisms responsible for VAP differs in patients who received prior antimicrobial therapy, and this factor determines a higher mortality rate. We suggest a restrictive antibiotic policy in mechanically ventilated patients with the purpose of reducing the risk of death from VAP.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DV-7751a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - We compared the in vitro antibacterial activity of DV-7751a against gram-positive and -negative bacteria with those of quinolones currently available. MICs for 90% of the strains tested (MIC90s) against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.20, 0.39, 0.20, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. Moreover, MIC50s for DV-7751a against ofloxacin-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-fold lower than those for tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. DV-7751a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Peptostreptococcus spp. at 0.39, 0.39, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, and was 4- to > 16-fold more active against enterococci at the MIC90 level than the other quinolones tested. The activity of DV-7751a against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin at the MIC90 level and was two- to fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin. DV-7751a showed activity comparable to those of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against the other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90s of 0.025, 0.20, and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively). DV-7751a activity was not affected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions and in human urine, as were the other quinolones tested. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the rapid bactericidal action of DV-7751a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and P. aeruginosa. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DV-7751a was less than or equal to those of the reference drugs. DV-7751a inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrases from S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa at concentrations comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin.
TI  - [A clinical study of chronic lower respiratory tract infections with Pseudomonas  aeruginosa by transtracheal aspiration].
AB  - We investigated the yearly changes of the incidence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) isolated from chronic lower respiratory tract infections (CLRTI), and also performed a clinical study on CLRTI with P. aeruginosa by transtracheal aspiration (TTA) to clarify the recent trend of P. aeruginosa infection in CLRTI and the predisposing clinical factors to the acute exacerbation. The isolation rate of P. aeruginosa among the total isolated bacteria in CLRTI between December 1978 and March 1983 was 8.4%, but it increased to 23.1% between April 1988 and March 1993. In 69 episodes (40 cases) of P. aeruginosa isolated from CLRTI between April 1983 and March 1993, monomicrobial infections of P. aeruginosa were 42 episodes (60.9%) and polymicrobial infections were 27 episodes (39.1%). When the diseases were classified into acute exacerbated and non-exacerbated phases, polymicrobial infections were seen more in the former phase, and the principal organisms detected with P. aeruginosa were Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In the acute exacerbated cases, predisposing conditions concerning the exacerbation were divided into four patterns: 1. polymicrobial infections with H. influenzae or S. pneumoniae, 2. after acute upper respiratory tract infections due to viral superinfection, 3. early phase from bacterial replacement by P. aeruginosa, 4. immunocompromised states such as adrenal corticosteroid administration or systemic underlying diseases. These results suggest that the importance of P. aeruginosa in CLRTI is increasing year by year and we must pay attention to the fact that P. aeruginosa alone may also cause acute exacerbation in the latter 2 patterns of the condition.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in infants and children in southern Taiwan: emphasis on Haemophilus influenzae type B infection.
AB  - During a four-year period from November 1988 to October 1992, 41 cases of bacterial meningitis with a positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture and/or CSF antigen test were collected at the National Cheng Kung University Hospital. The ages of the subjects ranged from 32 days to 13 years, with a median of seven months. The male to female ratio was 2.4:1. The most common causative agent was Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib, 29.3%), followed by group B beta-hemolytic streptococci (GBS, 24.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.0%), Escherichia coli (4.9%), Neisseria meningitidis (4.9%), Salmonella species (4.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.6%), and viridans streptococci (2.6%). The onset of GBS meningitis was always prior to four months of age. Of the 41 cases studied, 27 (65.9%) were aged from two months to five years; 12 (44.4%) of these had meningitis caused by Hib. Most of the cases (90.2%) had a fever as the first clinical manifestation. Ampicillin combined with a third-generation cephalosporin was effective against most of the causative pathogens. The most frequently encountered short-term sequelae were seizures (64.7%), subdural effusion (55.9%) and ventriculomegaly (44.1%). Observations on long-term sequelae are ongoing. While the case-fatality rate was as high as 33.3% in S. pneumoniae, and 25% in Hib-infected patients, the overall mortality rate was 17.1%. There is a need for greater emphasis on prevention through the use of available vaccines, including the newly introduced conjugate vaccines against Hib which are capable of eliciting immune responses in infants as young as two months.
TI  - Quality control guidelines for cefdinir, cefepime, cefetamet, cefmetazole, cefpodoxime, cefprozil, and clinafloxacin (CI-960) for various National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards susceptibility testing methods. Quality Control Study Group.
AB  - Several multilaboratory studies to determine quality control (QC) ranges for a variety of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) susceptibility tests are summarized. Replicate testing used multiple lots of media and antimicrobial disks in accordance with NCCLS recommendations, including the appropriate medium modifications for tests with Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. QC ranges for MIC and disk diffusion testing of N. gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226 were proposed for cefepime, cefetamet, cefmetazole, and cefpodoxime. Disk diffusion QC ranges for Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 or ATCC 49766 were recommended with cefepime, cefetamet (10- and 30-microgram disks), cefmetazole, cefpodoxime, and cefprozil. Disk diffusion QC ranges for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 with cefdinir and clinafloxacin and those for Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 with clinafloxacin were also proposed.
TI  - In vitro activities of BAY Y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
AB  - BAY Y3118 was highly active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). For Enterococcus faecalis and Corynebacterium jeikeium, MIC90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. BAY Y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
TI  - [The bactericidal effect of oxybuprocaine. A possible cause of false negative results in bronchoalveolar lavage].
AB  - New approaches in the diagnosis of pneumonia, especially in intensive care units, are quantitative cultures of bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid or the protected specimen brush. The sensitivity of these methods, however, has often been found to be as low as 50-60%. One possible explanation for the low sensitivity of these diagnostic tools is the antimicrobial activity of local anaesthetics used in bronchoscopy. Therefore, we investigated the bactericidal properties of oxybuprocaine, a topical anaesthetic used for bronchoscopy in our clinic, in order to test the reliability of specimens obtained from BAL. METHODS. The bactericidal activity of oxybuprocaine in concentrations of 1%, 0.1%, 0.05% and 0.01% was tested by constructing time-kill curves for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Five stains of each bacterial species were tested. The inoculum size was 10(4) ml, and bacteria were counted after 10, 20, 30, 60 and 120 min. RESULTS. The resulting time-kill curves are demonstrated in Figs. 1-4. The most sensitive bacteria were S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, in which significant bactericidal activity could be shown even with a 0.01% solution of oxybuprocaine. E. coli and P. aeruginosa were also inhibited, but only at the highest concentration of 1%. CONCLUSIONS. The use of local anaesthetics before material is taken for culture, e.g. from BAL, may give rise to false-negative results and should therefore be avoided or reduced. For each local anaesthetic used in bronchoscopy, the concentrations that can be used without the risk of false-negative results should be determined.
TI  - Gastric and pharyngeal flora in nosocomial pneumonia acquired during mechanical ventilation.
AB  - We studied the interrelations between gastric, pharyngeal, proximal, and distal airway bacterial flora in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) on 36 patients with nosocomial pneumonia acquired during mechanical ventilation (MV) and 27 mechanically ventilated control subjects without pulmonary infection. Gastric, pharyngeal, and endotracheal (EA) sampling for quantitative cultures were performed upon all patients, as well as fiberoptic bronchoscopy with protected specimen brush (PSB) sampling. Mean bacterial and fungi colony counts were significantly increased in pharyngeal, EA, and PSB samples in patients with VAP compared with control subjects. The overall increase in colonization was due to gram-positive cocci in all samples. In addition, gram-negative bacilli and fungi mean counts increased significantly in PSB pneumonia samples versus control samples. However, mean gastric colonization was similar in both patients with VAP and control subjects. In the former group there was an increase in coincident microorganisms isolated from gastric, pharyngeal, and EA samples in relation to PSB samples compared with control samples. Among the different quantitative cultures analyzed, only those obtained from EA significantly correlated with PSB cultures in patients with pneumonia (r = 0.67, p = 0.001). In summary, the present study shows that the coincidence between microorganisms isolated in PSB cultures and those from gastric and oropharynx increase in MV patients with pneumonia, indicating that both reservoirs play a key role in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. Conceivably, preventing both gastric and pharyngeal colonization may reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. From all the noninvasive samples studied only endotracheal aspirate cultures were useful for inferring the etiology of some VAP pneumonias.
TI  - The North American component (the United States and Canada) of an International Comparative MIC trial monitoring ofloxacin resistance.
AB  - Common lots of reference MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) method reagents were used to monitor ofloxacin, a newer fluoroquinolone, and 13 other drugs against 3200 recent clinical isolates in February-April 1992. Five medical centers in the United States and Canada contributed 640 strains per facility as follows: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (100 strains each); Streptococcus pneumoniae (40 strains); and Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (20 strains each). Quality-control strains were processed concurrently, MICs recorded, and data processed at a common location. Selected ofloxacin-resistant isolates were retested at a reference laboratory to confirm resistances and determine cross-resistant patterns. Results indicate the following (a) fluoroquinolones were superior in usable spectrum of activity to other orally administered drugs (for example, cefaclor, cefixime, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, minocycline, oxacillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole); (b) ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were generally equal to gentamicin and cefotaxime against commonly isolated Gram-negative pathogens; (c) fluoroquinolone resistance was rare among enteric bacilli, pneumococci (ciprofloxacin > ofloxacin), H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis, but more common among oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and P. aeruginosa; (d) cross resistance was generally observed between ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin but was species or genus dependent; and (e) a new fluoroquinolone, levofloxacin, demonstrated promising activity against contemporary pathogens.
TI  - Characterization of pilQ, a new gene required for the biogenesis of type 4 fimbriae in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Type 4 fimbriae are produced by a variety of pathogens, in which they appear to function in adhesion to epithelial cells, and in a form of surface translocation called twitching motility. Using transposon mutagenesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we have identified a new locus required for fimbrial assembly. This locus contains the gene pilQ which encodes a 77 kDa protein with an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence characteristic of secretory proteins. pilQ mutants lack the spreading colony morphology characteristic of twitching motility, are devoid of fimbriae, and are resistant to the fimbrial-specific bacteriophage PO4. The pilQ gene was mapped to Spel fragment 2, which is located at 0-5 minutes on the P. aeruginosa PAO1 chromosome, and thus it is not closely linked to the previously characterized pilA-D, pilS,R or pilT genes. The pilQ region also contains ponA, aroK and aroB-like genes in an organization very similar to that of corresponding genes in Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. The predicted amino acid sequence of PilQ shows homology to the PulD protein of Klebsiella oxytoca and related outer membrane proteins which have been found in association with diverse functions in other species including protein secretion, DNA uptake and assembly of filamentous phage. PilQ had the highest overall homology to an outer membrane antigen from Neisseria gonorrhoeae, encoded by omc, that may fulfil the same role in type 4 fimbrial assembly in this species.
TI  - The activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against clinical isolates collected in 20 UK centres and the design of a disc test for susceptibility testing.
AB  - The in-vitro activities of piperacillin plus tazobactam at ratios of 4:1, 8:1 and 16:1 were determined against 952 non-copy clinical aerobic bacterial isolates collected from 20 UK centres. Tazobactam enhanced the activity of piperacillin against Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. No enhancement was noted for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Pseudomonas spp., streptococci and enterococci. For 95.6% of strains MICs were either the same or only one two-fold dilution different with all the three ratios of tazobactam, and for most of the remaining strains the piperacillin MIC was lowest with the highest proportion of the tazobactam (4:1). The percentage of strains which remained resistant was also lowest with the 4:1 ratio. Regression analysis of MICs versus inhibition zone size with a variety of disc strengths tested on DST agar indicated that for Enterobacteriaceae, and H. influenzae 30 +4 micrograms, and 5 +1 microgram piperacillin/tazobactam discs gave the most reliable results. However, for S. aureus no disc gave good discrimination. Zone sizes obtained on DST and Iso-Sensitest agar were similar, with 96.1% of 1450 paired tests showing agreement to within 3 mm.
TI  - [A nationwide survey of antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics in Japan (1988-1990)].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout Japan from September to December in both 1989 and 1990. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (IPM) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to IPM and aminoglycosides. Bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to IPM. IPM had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin and its effect on bacterial adherence to medical material].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (CAM) in comparison with other 6 macrolides was determined against 419 recent clinical isolates including Streptococci, Enterococci, Staphylococci, Moraxella, Haemophilus and Bacteroides strains. MICs80's of CAM against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.78, 0.10 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. MICs80's against Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were 0.05 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. Laboratory-induced resistance to CAM in strains of S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in stepwise fashion and at a very low rate. Adherence to silicon filter of strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or S. epidermidis was strongly repressed by the addition of sub-MIC of CAM or other macrolides. Although tosufloxacin (TFLX) alone had no bactericidal activity against the sessile cells of P. aeruginosa strains tested, TFLX showed synergistic bactericidal activity when combined with sub-MICs of CAM or erythromycin.
TI  - [Efficacy of fibronectin on opsonic activity by alveolar macrophage and experimental rat pneumonia].
AB  - The opsonic activity of plasma fibronectin (FN) by rat alveolar macrophage (AM) was examined, and the in vivo effect of FN in Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) experimental rat pneumonia was evaluated. The chemiluminescence response of AM was enhanced by the presence of FN (300 micrograms/ml) in S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, but was not enhanced in gram-negative rods (Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). FN (300 micrograms/ml) promoted the phagocytosis of S. aureus by AM, but did not promote the bactericidal activity of that by AM. In the experimental rat pneumonia with S. aureus inoculation, plasma FN concentration decreased with time, but increased by the administration of FN (1 mg). The number of bacteria in the lung, peripheral white blood cell and BAL fluid cell also decreased by the administration of FN. Furthermore, FN was significantly improved on inflammatory findings of rat lung tissue 24 hours after inoculation with S. aureus. These results suggest that FN plays an important role as an opsonic by alveolar macrophage, and that FN has utility for clinical trials in patients with pneumonia.
TI  - Detection of 2-eicosanol by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in sputa from patients with pulmonary mycobacterial infections.
AB  - A total of 96 sputum specimens from patients with suspected or known mycobacterial and nonmycobacterial pulmonary infections were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for the presence of 2-eicosanol. This secondary alcohol was detected in all of the 25 sputum specimens culture positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, in 7 of the 9 sputum specimens culture positive for M. avium complex, and in all 3 of the studied sputum specimens associated with M. malmoense. The alcohol was not detected in any of the 45 culture-negative sputum specimens or in 14 sputum specimens culture positive for Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The ratio of tuberculostearic acid to 2-eicosanol was much lower in sputum samples culture positive for mycobacteria than in the corresponding in vitro-grown cultures. The present findings indicate that 2-eicosanol may be useful as a chemical marker for rapid diagnosis of pulmonary infections caused by the M. avium complex, M. malmoense, and M. tuberculosis.
TI  - Penicillins. A current review of their clinical pharmacology and therapeutic use.
AB  - The penicillins are a large group of bicyclic ring compounds which contain a 4-membered beta-lactam ring (penams) fused to a 5-membered thiazolidine ring. Benzylpenicillin (penicillin G) was the first natural penicillin with potent activity against all Gram-positive pathogens, Gram-negative cocci and some spirochaetes and actinomycetes. For the last 50 years benzylpenicillin has been the mainstay of therapy for serious pneumococcal, streptococcal, meningococcal and gonococcal infections. However, the past decade has seen the emergence of resistance in certain parts of the world, initially among the gonococci, and more recently among the pneumococci and meningococci. Discovery of the 6-aminopenicillinamic acid nucleus has led to considerable manipulation of the basic ring structure, resulting initially in the synthesis of ampicillin, and subsequently the other aminopenicillins, analogues, esters and prodrugs. These drugs have the advantages of improved oral bioavailability and superior activity against Haemophilus influenzae, certain Gram-negative bacilli, salmonellae, enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes, making these agents popular in the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections. The increasing spread of bacterial resistance, particularly among Enterobacteriaceae and H. influenzae, has curtailed the usefulness of these drugs in these clinical settings. To counteract this problem, a number of agents combining a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor (e.g. clavulanic acid, tazobactam and sulbactam) have been developed. These inhibitors have no intrinsic antibacterial activity, but combining them with a penicillin (e.g. amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) confers greater stability to beta-lactamases and hence a broader spectrum of activity. The emergence of penicillinase-producing staphylococci that rendered benzylpenicillin ineffective also stimulated the search for penicillinase-resistant penicillins--methicillin and nafcillin, followed by the acid-stable isoxazolyl penicillins. These agents are now the principle antistaphylococcal treatment. Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci are currently a major cause of hospital sepsis, and are resistant to these latter agents. Enteric Gram-negative bacilli have been the predominant cause of serious hospital infections during the last 30 years. Further manipulation of the penicillin structure has resulted in compounds with broader activity against Gram-negative bacilli, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while retaining activity against Gram-positive pathogens. The carboxypenicillins were the first step in this direction, but have been largely superseded by the ureidopenicillins. These agents have better activity against P. aeruginosa, and are still effective against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including enterococci and anaerobic organisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - The penetration of oral ciprofloxacin into the aqueous humor, vitreous, and subretinal fluid of humans.
AB  - We examined ciprofloxacin levels in the aqueous humor, vitreous, or subretinal fluid in 40 patients undergoing cataract extraction, vitrectomy, or scleral buckling. Ciprofloxacin, 750 mg, was administered orally an average of 17 1/2 and 5 1/2 hours preoperatively. We obtained mean ciprofloxacin levels of 0.53 microgram/ml in aqueous humor, 0.51 microgram/ml in vitreous, and 0.71 microgram/ml in subretinal fluid. These vitreous levels exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)90 of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Haemophilus influenzae, as well as the MIC70 of S. aureus and Bacillus cereus. Therefore, ciprofloxacin may have a role in the management and prevention of endophthalmitis.
TI  - Incidence of bacterial respiratory pathogens and their susceptibility to common antibacterial agents.
AB  - Although most respiratory tract infections are caused by viruses, bacterial pathogens are responsible for higher morbidity and mortality. Because virtually nothing is known about the etiology of bacterial respiratory pathogens in Saudi Arabia, this study examined the incidence of these organisms in 5426 patients over a 1-year period. Of the bacterial pathogens isolated from 904 patients, the most common organism was Hemophilus influenzae (31%), followed by pneumococci (22%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%), and others (31%). Because the first two organisms accounted for more than 50% of isolates, their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics was also reviewed. The results are presented here.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefpirome, a new fourth-generation cephalosporin in comparison with other agents.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefpirome was compared with amoxycillin/clavulanic  acid, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin and amikacin against 743 non-duplicate clinical isolates. MIC50 and MIC90 showed that the antibiotic was active against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. Cefpirome was highly active against most of the Enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive Proteus spp., Aeromonas spp. (MIC < or = 1 mg/L) and Salmonella spp. (MIC < or = 0.5 mg/L). Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were all susceptible, with MIC less than 0.5 and 0.25 mg/L respectively. Cefpirome was more active than cefuroxime and ceftazidime against Campylobacter spp. (MIC < or = 2 mg/L), but less active than ceftazidime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefpirome was active against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Streptococcus bovis and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC < or = 0.5 mg/L) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MIC < or = 2 mg/L). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes were resistant to cefpirome. The stability of cefpirome to TEM-1, TEM-2, PSE-1, SHV-1 and the chromosomal-mediated P99 and K-1 beta-lactamases was comparable to ceftazidime.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of 13 out genes from Erwinia carotovora subspecies carotovora: genes encoding members of a general secretion pathway (GSP) widespread in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The chemical mutagen ethylmethanesulphonate (EMS) has been used to generate mutants of Erwinia carotovora subspecies carotovora which are defective in the secretion of pectinases (Pel) and cellulases (Cel) but unaltered for protease (Prt) secretion. Such mutants, called Out-, still synthesize Pel and Cel but these enzymes accumulate within the periplasm. Cosmid clones carrying wild-type E. carotovora ssp. carotovora DNA, identified by their ability to restore the Out+ phenotype when transferred to some Out- mutants, were classified into six complementation groups using cosmids and cosmid derivatives. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of a 12.7 kb DNA fragment, encompassing complementing cosmid inserts, revealed a coding capacity for 13 potential open reading frames (ORFs), and these were designated outC-outO. Some of the out gene products were visualized using a T7 gene 10 expression system. The predicted Out proteins are highly similar to components of extracellular enzyme secretion systems from a diverse range of eubacteria including Erwinia chrysanthemi, Klebsiella oxytoca, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Xanthomonas campestris. Lower levels of similarity exist between Ecc Out proteins and components of macromolecular trafficking systems from Bacillus subtilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Yersinia pestis and a protein involved in the morphogenesis of filamentous bacteriophages such as M13.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of OPC-17116, a new 5-methyl substituted quinolone.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of the new 5-methylated fluoroquinolone OPC-17116 was compared with that of other fluoroquinolines and beta-lactams against a total of 690 bacterial strains. With the exception of Klebsiella and Serratia spp., 90% of the Enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by 0.25 mg/L. OPC-17116 inhibited 90% of Serratia spp. at 8 mg/L and Klebsiella spp. at 4 mg/L. Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible (MIC90 < or = 0.03 mg/L). Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more susceptible to ciprofloxacin (MIC90 0.25 mg/L) than OPC-17116 (MIC90 1 mg/L). Generally, OPC-17116 was more active than ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive cocci, 90% of Staphylococcus spp. being inhibited by < or = 0.25 mg/L. OPC-17116 displayed greater activity than ciprofloxacin against Chlamydia spp. (MICs < or = 0.12 and < or = 2 mg/L, respectively).
TI  - Changes in adherence of respiratory pathogens to HEp-2 cells induced by subinhibitory concentrations of sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Preincubation with subinhibitory concentrations of sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim decreased the adherence of the respiratory pathogens Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis to human larynx carcinoma HEp-2 cells. Subinhibitory concentrations of sparfloxacin did not change the adherence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Streptococcus pneumoniae 15.62, but adhesion of S. pneumoniae 15.42 was significantly enhanced by subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations.
TI  - [Usefulness of the API ZYM system for the identification of Legionella sp].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The identification of Legionella genus is usually difficult, time consuming, and expensive. We decided to study the usefulness of API-ZYM system (Biomerieux) for Legionella species identification. METHODS: A total of 96 strains (82 from Legionella genus and 14 from other bacterial genus) were included. We studied 19 different enzyme activities and we proceed following the manufacturers directions, with an incubation time for galleries of 4 hours at 37 degrees C. RESULTS: Seventeen out of the 19 enzyme activities were uniformly positive or negative for Legionella sp. Thus, the sensitivity of these activities was 100% in identifying Legionella sp. Valine and cystine-arylamidase gave variable reactions for Legionella sp. strains. When the results of these enzyme test were compared to those of the control strains (Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) we observed that alkaline phosphatase, esterase, esterase-lipase, acid phosphatase and naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase in one side and esterase, esterase-lipase and leucin-arylamidase in the other side were able to differentiate Legionella sp. strains from P. aeruginosa and H. influenzae, respectively. CONCLUSION: API SYM system is a simple, accurate and reproducible method for the identification of Legionella sp.
TI  - Infectious diseases that result in slowly resolving and chronic pneumonia.
AB  - Familiarity with the natural history of common pneumonias is obligatory for the clinician to determine whether a specific case of pneumonia is resolving at the expected rate. To many clinicians, the term slowly resolving pneumonia conjures an association with underlying neoplasm and/or less common pathogens. In reality, host factors or common pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila are more likely responsible for delayed resolution. Familiarity with the pattern of resolution of pneumonias caused by these organisms should allow the clinician to follow such patients and avoid premature invasive evaluation. In contrast, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia species rarely result in slowly resolving pneumonia. Chronic bacterial pneumonia is an infectious syndrome that may present in the absence of systemic symptoms. The presentation is varied and may mimic neoplasm, interstitial lung disease, or chronic fungal or mycobacterial infection. Bacteria most commonly associated with chronic pneumonia include Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococci (not S pneumoniae), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Serum bactericidal test as a prognostic indicator in acute pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis.
AB  - The serum bactericidal test has been used for many years for optimal assessment of the efficacy of antibiotic therapy in patients with infective endocarditis and other bacterial infections. Its capacity to predict the bacteriological outcome of acute pulmonary exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis was evaluated. A total of 54 courses of intravenous antibiotic therapy were analyzed in 22 patients, whose ages ranged from 4 months to 24 years (mean age: 10 years). The serum bactericidal activity of blood samples, taken at expected peak and trough antibiotic levels on day 4 of therapy, were determined against the potentially pathogenic strains isolated in sputum at the time of admission. For 104 isolates (64 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 28 Staphylococcus aureus, and 12 Haemophilus influenzae strains), the peak and trough bactericidal titers were compared to bacteriological outcome. Bacteriological success was defined as a decrease of 2 log10 units or more in the bacterial density in sputum between days 0 and 7 of therapy. At peak antibiotic levels, serum bactericidal titers of 1:128 or more were 96% (all isolates) and 89% (P aeruginosa isolates), predictive of cure, whereas serum bactericidal titers of less than 1:16 were 100% predictive of failure for all infecting bacteria. In patients aged less than 18 years, the best peak titer for predicting success was 1:64, with a predictive value of 96% for titers of 1:64 or greater. The peak titer that best predicted success in patients aged 18 years or more was 1:128, with a predictive value of only 83% for titers of 1:128 or greater.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of E-4868, a new trifluoroquinolone, compared to six similar compounds.
AB  - The compound E-4868 (Laboratorios Dr. Esteve) is a trifluoro, 7-azetidinyl quinolone with properties resembling those of other fluoroquinolones. Its activity in vitro was compared to that of six other similar drugs against more than 700 nosocomial isolates using standard methods. The MIC50s of E-4868 for enteric bacilli ranged from 0.015 to 0.25 micrograms/ml, being highest for Providencia spp. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were two-fold more susceptible to E-4868 than to ofloxacin. MICs of E-4868 for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and pathogenic Neisseria spp. were all < or = 0.12 micrograms/ml. E-4868 was equal in activity to or eight-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci. The MICs of E-4868 for pneumococci were all < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml but anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml). There was almost complete cross-resistance to several other fluoroquinolones. Resistant mutants were selected by a multiple passage technique but the rate of mutation to resistance was very low (< 10(-8)) at an 8 x MIC.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of CP-99,219, a novel azabicyclo-naphthyridone.
AB  - CP-99,219 is a trifluoronaphthyridone with significant antibacterial activity that includes the family Enterobacteriaceae (MICs for 90% of the strains tested [MIC90s], < or = 0.015 to 0.5 micrograms/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and gonococci (MICs, < or = 0.015 micrograms/ml). Legionella spp. were also CP-99,219 susceptible, with MICs of 0.008 to 0.12 micrograms/ml. CP-99,219 demonstrated activity greater than that of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, or enoxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml), Xanthomonas maltophilia (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml), and pneumococci (MIC90, 0.12 micrograms/ml). Numerous ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates were susceptible to CP-99,219, a new compound showing potential value for further in vivo trials.
TI  - Effectiveness and safety of ofloxacin in chronic otitis media and chronic sinusitis in adult outpatients.
AB  - A multicentric study was conducted to evaluate the clinical efficacy and tolerance of ofloxacin in the treatment of chronic sinusitis and chronic otitis (CSOM) in outpatients. Two hundred milligrams of ofloxacin was administered twice a day orally for 12 days in 198 patients with chronic sinusitis and 215 patients with CSOM. Cultures for bacteriology were carried out before treatment. The spectrum of pathogens sensitive to ofloxacin included Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae. Higher concentrations of ofloxacin were obtained at sites of infection than in serum. Favorable results were achieved clinically in 93.7% of chronic sinusitis cases and 93.9% of CSOM cases. Adverse effects occurred in only 4.1% of cases. These results support the use of ofloxacin as the drug of first choice in the treatment of chronic sinusitis and CSOM in adult outpatients.
TI  - Comparison of empiric aztreonam and aminoglycoside regimens in the treatment of serious gram-negative lower respiratory infections.
AB  - An open-label, controlled, randomized study was performed to assess the efficacy  and safety of combination regimens using either aztreonam or an aminoglycoside control regimen as empiric therapy for suspected aerobic gram-negative bacillary pneumonia or purulent bronchitis. Eighty-four patients, 42 in each arm of the study, were randomly assigned to one of two treatment regimens. The combination aztreonam regimen included aztreonam, 2 gm every 8 hours (q8h), plus either clindamycin, 600 to 900 mg q8h, or nafcillin, 1.5 gm to 2 gm every 6 hours (q6h). The control regimen was one of the following depending on the combination therapy that was designated standard at each of the three study institutions: amikacin, 5 mg/kg q8h, plus cefazolin, 1 gm q8h; amikacin, 500 mg every 12 hours plus mezlocillin, 4 gm q6h; or kinetically dosed tobramycin plus ticarcillin, 3 gm to 4 gm q4h. The two groups were well matched in terms of demographics and clinical characteristics. Among the 84 patients, organisms from the Enterobacteriaceae family accounted for the largest proportion of isolates (44%) including Escherichia coli (13%), Klebsiella species (14%), and Serratia species (9%). Other commonly identified organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19%), Haemophilus influenzae (15%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (12%), and Staphylococcus aureus (8%). Results of this trial included clinical response rates of 83% in both groups (P = 0.951) and a microbiologic cure rate of 75% in the aztreonam group and 63% in the control group (P = 0.291). In the 59 patients with documented aerobic gram-negative pneumonia, microbiologic eradication rates were 72% in the aztreonam group versus 57% in the control group (P = 0.359). Duration of treatment tended to be shorter in the aztreonam group than in the control group, with a median 10 days of therapy versus 12 days of therapy (P = 0.095), respectively. In addition, the percentage of patients requiring nonstudy antimicrobial agents tended to be lower in the aztreonam group than the control group, involving 21% of patients in the aztreonam group compared with 36% of patients in the control group (P = 0.086). All regimens were well tolerated, and no patient was withdrawn because of adverse reactions to the study medications. Two patients, both in the control group, required dose reduction, which was necessitated by possible aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity. This trial shows that aztreonam is an effective agent with an excellent safety profile when used in combination regimens for the empiric treatment of pneumonia. A well-controlled trial is needed to verify the trend toward shorter hospital stays and a reduced need for additional antimicrobial agents seen with the aztreonam regimen when compared with those receiving aminoglycoside-combination regimens.
TI  - Penetration of ofloxacin into nasal tissues.
AB  - The average concentration in 75 female/male patients was 1.90 +/- 1.10/1.55 +/- 0.62 mg/l in serum, 0.81 +/- 0.42/0.74 +/- 0.48 mg/kg in bone, 2.40 +/- 1.16/1.94 +/- 0.87 mg/kg in cartilage, and 2.35 +/- 1.28/1.99 +/- 1.02 mg/kg in mucosa. In each case the highest serum or tissue concentrations were observed 2 hours after the last ofloxacin administration (serum 2.60 +/- 0.41 mg/l, bone 1.10 +/- 0.75 mg/kg, cartilage 3.40 +/- 0.86 mg/kg, mucosa 3.50 +/- 1.05 mg/kg), but even 8 hours after the last dose the levels still exceeded the MIC 90% of e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus or Haemophilus influenzae. The clinical investigations carried out show that ofloxacin represents a new oral therapeutic agent of significant value in otorhinolaryngology, particularly in the treatment of problematic infections. As the investigations show, the level in healthy tissue is definitely within the therapeutic region for a period of 8 hours. In ENT (nasal and paranasal) infections, ofloxacin should be given for defined indications, e.g. for oral therapy of problematic infections due to P. aeruginosa, and if possible after identification of the pathogen.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of Bay y 3118, a new chlorofluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of Bay y 3118, a new quinolone antimicrobial was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin and three beta-lactams against 620 clinical isolates. Bay y 3118 was the most active quinolone against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus spp. The MIC90 for the members of the Enterobacteriaceae were < or = 0.12 mg/L except for Serratia spp. (1 mg/L) and in general Bay y 3118 was two-fold more active than ciprofloxacin or sparfloxacin. Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more susceptible to ciprofloxacin (MIC90 0.25 mg/L) than to Bay y 3118 (MIC90 0.5 mg/L) or sparfloxacin (MIC90 1.0 mg/L). Staphylococcus aureus was more susceptible to Bay y 3118 (MIC90 0.03 mg/L) and sparfloxacin (MIC90 0.06 mg/L) than to ciprofloxacin (MIC90 1 mg/L) and similar differences were noted for Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Streptococcus pneumoniae was susceptible to Bay y 3118 (MIC90 0.03 mg/L) as were other streptococci. Enterococcus spp. was four-fold more susceptible to Bay y 3118 and sparfloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. All strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella spp. were inhibited by Bay y 3118 < or = 0.015 mg/L. Anaerobes were more susceptible to Bay y 3118 than to other quinolones; the MIC90 of Bay y 3118 for Bacteroides fragilis being 0.06 mg/L. Little effect was seen by increasing the inoculum from 10(4) cfu to 10(6). Bay y 3118 inhibited Chlamydia sp. at concentrations < or = 0.015 mg/L.
TI  - Experimental immunoglobulin A nephropathy induced by gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A study was conducted to determine whether intraperitoneal and oral administration of formalin-fixed gram-negative bacteria induced immunohistologically and ultrastructurally evident glomerular deposition of IgA and C3 in C3H/HeN mice. Separate treatments with strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and two kinds of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used. Two mice in each treatment group were sacrificed at 10, 20 and 30 weeks of age to examine sequential glomerular changes. In addition to the intraperitoneal administration (IP) groups receiving whole formalin-fixed bacterial cells, cell precipitate and supernatant fractions of each bacterial strain after sonication were injected intraperitoneally once a week, and the mice were sacrificed at 30 weeks of age. Sequential quantitation or IgG, IgA or IgM in serum and the isotypes specific for each of the bacterial strains or LPS administered was performed by ELISA. The incidence of immunofluorescence positivity for glomerular IgA and C3 was 37-71 and 37-66.7%, respectively, in the IP groups that had received bacterial cells of each strain, which was significantly higher than that in the IP groups given LPS or in the controls. These results suggest that cell wall components common among gram-negative bacteria, other than LPS, play a major role in the glomerular deposition of IgA and C3. This is the first use of gram-negative bacteria to establish an active model of IgA nephropathy.
TI  - The antibacterial effect of halothane.
AB  
TI  - Clinical studies of oral quinolone once daily in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of oral ofloxacin, 400 mg once daily, for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory tract infections were studied. The most common species recovered from the sputum specimens of these patients were Haemophilus influenzae, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Gram positive cocci unidentified, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Morexella catarrhalis, Streptococcus epidermidis, and another Haemophilus species in this order. All these bacteria were susceptible to ofloxacin except for one strain of methicillin resistant S. aureus. A satisfactory clinical outcome was achieved in 34 of 40 patients (85%). It is concluded that ofloxacin, 400 mg once daily, is useful for patients with respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Fluoroquinolones in the treatment of cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Cystic fibrosis patients suffer from recurrent and chronic lung infections mainly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The fluoroquinolones, notably ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, represent an important addition to the therapy of P. aeruginosa infections. They offer the possibility of effective oral treatment for early colonisation as well as chronic infections, even in children. They are associated with only few and mild adverse effects. Development of resistance represents an increasing problem.
TI  - Comparison of the safety and efficacy of lomefloxacin and amoxicillin in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: Results from a Latin American multicenter study.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of lomefloxacin, a new difluornated quinolone, with those of amoxicillin in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis caused by Gram-negative bacteria. The study was conducted as a multicenter, randomized, single-blind comparison in four countries (Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela). In total, 163 evaluable patients were assessed-82 in the lomefloxacin group and 81 in the amoxicillin group. Patients received oral therapy with either 40 mg lomefloxacin once daily or 500 mg amoxicillin three times daily for 10 days. The most frequent bacterial pathogens isolated included: Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The overall clinical success rates (cure plus improvement) were 93.9% in the lomefloxacin group and 81.5% in the amoxicillin group. The eradication rate was 81.7% in the lomefloxacin group and 75.3% in the amoxicillin group. Most of the clinical and bacteriological failures in both groups were associated with P. aeruginosa in baseline sputum cultures. In conclusion, once-daily lomefloxacin is a safe and effective treatment for acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis caused by Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Lomefloxacin versus amoxicillin in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: results of multinational studies.
AB  - The results of two large, multicenter studies comparing the safety and efficacy of lomefloxacin (400 mg administered orally once daily) and amoxicillin (500 mg administered orally three times daily) in adult patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis caused predominantly by Gram-negative pathogens have been combined. The studies were both randomized and blinded. One study enrolled 127 patients in 12 centers in Belgium; the second enrolled 510 patients in 52 centers in ten countries. The protocols were essentially identical, whicl allowed data to be pooled. A total of 253 lomefloxacin-treated patients and 254 amoxicillin-treated patients were considered evaluable. Both groups were well matched in terms of age, gender, and severity of presenting signs and symptoms. The most common pathogens in both treatment groups were Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Two to four days after the conclusion of treatment, bacterial eradication rates were 85.4% for lomefloxacin-treated patients and 75.2% for patients receiving amoxicillin (p = 0.004). The clinical success rate (total of evaluable patients either cured or improved) 2-4 days after the conclusion of treatment for the lomefloxacin group was 90.9%, and for amoxicillin was 82.3% (p = 0.005). The incidence of adverse events was similar in both treatment groups, and no interactions were noted in those patients in both groups who received concomitant theophylline. In these studies, lomefloxacin administered once daily was superior to amoxicillin given three times daily to patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis caused predominantly by Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - The effect of human immunodeficiency virus infection on the distribution and outcome of pneumonia in intensive care units.
AB  - To determine the frequency and distribution of pneumonia in an intensive care unit (ICU), we retrospectively examined the records of 1,854 consecutive ICU admissions between January 1987 and April 1990. A total of 266 patients met criteria for pneumonia (unilateral or bilateral infiltrate by chest roentgenogram, plus 2 of the following: leukocyte count > 10 x 10(9) per liter, temperature > 38.5 degrees C, or culture of blood or sputum positive for pathogens). Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus was the most frequent cause (28%) precipitating an ICU admission in this series of patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae (13%), Staphylococcus aureus (8%), Haemophilus influenzae (4%), and viruses (4%) were also commonly observed. Overall mortality was 20%. An APACHE II score of greater than 24, the need for intubation, and the presence of P carinii were predictive of increased mortality. Age, sex, and length of stay did not predict final results. Patients with P carinii pneumonia who required intubation had an overall mortality of 54%, which was higher than patients without P carinii pneumonia who required intubation (P < .05). Our experience shows the changing spectrum of pneumonia in ICUs. In contrast to reports of a decade ago in which S pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are cited as most common, P carinii is now most prevalent in our ICU. Although our findings reflect the increasing incidence of human immunodeficiency virus infection in San Francisco, California, they may also be pertinent to other areas in the United States where the incidence of this infection continues to increase.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of a gene encoding a 21-kilodalton outer membrane protein  from Bordetella avium and expression of the gene in Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Three gene libraries of Bordetella avium 197 DNA were prepared in Escherichia coli LE392 by using the cosmid vectors pCP13 and pYA2329, a derivative of pCP13 specifying spectinomycin resistance. The cosmid libraries were screened with convalescent-phase anti-B. avium turkey sera and polyclonal rabbit antisera against B. avium 197 outer membrane proteins. One E. coli recombinant clone produced a 56-kDa protein which reacted with convalescent-phase serum from a turkey infected with B. avium 197. In addition, five E. coli recombinant clones were identified which produced B. avium outer membrane proteins with molecular masses of 21, 38, 40, 43, and 48 kDa. At least one of these E. coli clones, which encoded the 21-kDa protein, reacted with both convalescent-phase turkey sera and antibody against B. avium 197 outer membrane proteins. The gene for the 21-kDa outer membrane protein was localized by Tn5seq1 mutagenesis, and the nucleotide sequence was determined by dideoxy sequencing. DNA sequence analysis of the 21-kDa protein revealed an open reading frame of 582 bases that resulted in a predicted protein of 194 amino acids. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of the gene encoding the 21-kDa outer membrane protein with protein sequences in the National Biomedical Research Foundation protein sequence data base indicated significant homology to the OmpA proteins of Shigella dysenteriae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. coli, and Salmonella typhimurium and to Neisseria gonorrhoeae outer membrane protein III, Haemophilus influenzae protein P6, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa porin protein F. The gene (ompA) encoding the B. avium 21-kDa protein hybridized with 4.1-kb DNA fragments from EcoRI-digested, chromosomal DNA of Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica and with 6.0- and 3.2-kb DNA fragments from EcoRI-digested, chromosomal DNA of B. avium and B. avium-like DNA, respectively. A 6.75-kb DNA fragment encoding the B. avium 21-kDa protein was subcloned into the Asd+ vector pYA292, and the construct was introduced into the avirulent delta cya delta crp delta asd S. typhimurium chi 3987 for oral immunization of birds. The gene encoding the 21-kDa protein was expressed equivalently in B. avium 197, delta asd E. coli chi 6097, and S. typhimurium chi 3987 and was localized primarily in the cytoplasmic membrane and outer membrane. In preliminary studies on oral inoculation of turkey poults with S. typhimurium chi 3987 expressing the gene encoding the B. avium 21-kDa protein, it was determined that a single dose of the recombinant Salmonella vaccine failed to elicit serum antibodies against the 21-kDa protein and challenge with wild-type B. avium 197 resulted in colonization of the trachea and thymus with B. avium 197.
TI  - beta-Lactam resistance in gram-negative bacteria: global trends and clinical impact.
AB  - Microbial drug resistance is an inescapable consequence of the utilization of antimicrobial agents in a given environment. Nowhere is the importance of resistance more evident than among agents of the beta-lactam family. Trends toward increased resistance can be seen among fastidious gram-negative bacteria like Haemophilus influenzae, where ampicillin resistance varies from 1% to 64% globally. For Escherichia coli, ampicillin resistance has risen to > or = 50% in high-risk populations, and resistance to third-generation cephalosporins is now being seen in certain areas. Inducible beta-lactamases have been responsible for increasing multiple beta-lactam resistance among certain Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and this has been associated with increased use of newer cephalosporins. Xanthomonas maltophilia with its two inducible beta-lactamases is becoming an increasingly important nosocomial pathogen, especially in areas of heavy imipenem utilization. Only through the recognition of factors associated with increasing resistance and the mechanisms responsible can strategies be designed for minimizing beta-lactam resistance.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (CAZ) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout Japan in 1989 and 1991. Those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC90 of CAZ in 1991 were markedly higher against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Also, among other bacteria such as Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to CAZ were observed in high proportions. However, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of CAZ on Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella spp, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Haemophilus influenzae and Anaerobic GPC (Gram-positive cocci). 2. Among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli of Enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. It appears therefore, that CAZ failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. Antimicrobial activities of CAZ on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. However, it was also demonstrated that CAZ maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. When it is additionally taken into account that CAZ is one of those limited drugs with activity against P. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that CAZ still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.
TI  - Endophthalmitis caused by gram-negative organisms.
AB  - The medical records of 52 patients (53 eyes) with culture-proven gram-negative endophthalmitis between January 1982 and December 1990 were reviewed. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23% [12/53]) and Haemophilus influenzae (19% [10/53]) were the most frequent isolates in this series. Overall, 26 (49%) of 53 treated patients achieved 20/400 or better visual acuity. Fifty-two (98%) of the original 53 gram-negative isolates were sensitive to the aminoglycoside antibiotics. To determine their sensitivity to recently developed antibiotics, 35 of the isolates were again grown on culture media and their sensitivities to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and imipenem were obtained. Only ceftazidime demonstrated in vitro efficacy for all the organisms tested.
TI  - [Basic and clinical study of meropenem in pediatric field].
AB  - Meropenem (MEPM), a novel parenteral carbapenem antibiotic, was examined in a cooperative study involving 12 pediatric and 1 neonatologic facilities. The results are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activity Antibacterial activity of MEPM against stock organisms including 31 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 14 of Listeria monocytogenes, 4 of Bordetella pertussis and 3 of Neisseria meningitidis ranged from 0.025 to 0.10 micrograms/ml in MIC90's, which were equal or lower than those of control drugs such as imipenem cefazolin, cefotiam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and latamoxef. MICs against clinical isolates were as follows: In Gram-positive bacteria, MICs were 0.20 micrograms/ml to 6.25 micrograms/ml against 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and 0.025 micrograms/ml or less against 4 of Streptococcus pneumoniae. In Gram-negative bacilli, MICs were 0.10 micrograms/ml to 0.20 micrograms/ml against 3 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 0.78, 0.10 and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, against one strain each of Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MIC against 1 strain of Peptococcus saccharolyticus was < or = 0.025 micrograms/ml. 2. Pharmacokinetics Maximum plasma concentrations after intravenous infusion of MEPM over 30 minutes at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, respectively, to 3 different groups of 3 children (total 9 cases) were observed at the completion of the treatment. Mean maximum concentrations in the 3 groups were 36.3, 69.5 and 129.8 micrograms/ml, respectively, exhibiting clear dose response. Mean plasma half lives in beta phase were 0.94, 0.86 and 0.94 hours, respectively, exhibiting no difference by doses, and this trend was observed also by HPLC. Urinary excretion rates in the first 6 hours after dose in the 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg groups were 67.3, 65.6 and 68.4%, respectively. Concentrations of MEPM in cerebrospinal fluid were determined in 2 cases of pyogenic meningitis. In 1 case, 500 mg (5.9 mg/kg) of MEPM was infused intravenously over 30 minutes and concentrations on Days 6, 8 and 15 observed at 190, 60 and 100 minutes after respective doses were 0.13, 0.10 micrograms/ml and less than the detection limit. Cerebrospinal fluid-plasma concentration ratio was determinable only on Day 8 and was 2.8%. In another case to which 250 mg (38.5 mg/kg) of MEPM was infused intravenously over 30 minutes, the concentration at Days 6, 7 and 10, 1 hour after the dose were less than the detection limit on day 6, and 2.04 and 2.62 micrograms/ml, respectively on days 7 and 10. 3. Clinical efficacy Clinical efficacies were evaluated in 49 cases and the efficacy rate was 93.9%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Early mucosal changes in experimental sinusitis.
AB  - Normal mucociliary flow is a significant defense mechanism in the prevention of acute sinusitis. We have undertaken a study to examine the early sinus mucosal and mucociliary changes that occur in response to acute infection. Twenty rabbits were evaluated for 5 days after an obstructed maxillary sinus was inoculated with either Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or a sterile saline solution. Data collected included measurements of sinus mucosal ciliary beat frequency, quantitation of ciliated cell losses, and electron microscopic observations. Results demonstrate statistically significant (p < 0.05) changes in mucosal ciliary beat frequency that were either excitatory or inhibitory, depending both on the length of the infection and the specific organism. No changes in ciliary beat frequency were observed in the control animals (p > 0.55). Control animals likewise demonstrated no loss of ciliated cells from mucosal epithelium; however, dramatic losses of ciliated cells from the sinus mucosa of the experimental groups were observed. These losses occurred at different rates, depending on the infecting organism, but all infected groups demonstrated a > 86% decrease in the number of viable ciliated cells from the sinus mucosa after sinusitis of 5 days duration. We conclude that a significant loss of ciliated cells from sinus mucosa and a corresponding disruption of normal mucociliary flow occurs early after exposure to pathogenic organisms and is a significant predisposing factor in the development of acute sinusitis.
TI  - Aerobic bacteriology of chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma in children.
AB  - Medical management of chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma in children was shown recently to be efficacious. We undertook a prospective study in order to determine 1) the organisms associated with the disease and their sensitivity to various antibiotics and 2) their association with clinical variables. Pseudomonas was isolated from 84% of the patients, enteric gram-negative bacilli from 32%, Staphylococcus aureus from 20%, streptococci from 14%, and Hemophilus influenzae from 15%. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the sole isolate in 48 of the 128 patients (38%). The sensitivity of P aeruginosa (78 isolates) was 100% (of isolates) to mezlocillin and ciprofloxacin, 99% to tobramycin and ceftazidime, 97% to piperacillin, 94% to gentamicin, and 78% to ceftriaxone. The isolated organisms and their sensitivity to antibiotics were not associated with age, sex, duration of otorrhea, or the presence of granulation tissue or polyps. We believe that our data may contribute to the appropriate choice of antibiotics when nonsurgical management of chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma is considered.
TI  - Optimum use of selective plated media in primary processing of respiratory tract  specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - A total of 258 respiratory tract specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis were inoculated onto nine different plated media, and the rates of recovery of potential pathogens were compared. Media included sheep blood agar, enriched chocolate agar, MacConkey agar for gram-negative bacilli, chocolate agar containing bacitracin for Haemophilus spp., bromcresol green agar for yeasts, cetrimide agar for Pseudomonas spp., sheep blood agar containing colistin and nalidixic acid for gram-positive cocci, mannitol salt agar for Staphylococcus aureus, and oxidation-fermentation agar containing 300 U of polymyxin B per ml and 2 U of bacitracin per ml (OF-PBL medium) for Pseudomonas cepacia. With two exceptions, all of these media proved useful in recovering potential pathogens from respiratory tract specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis. The two exceptions were cetrimide agar and colistin-nalidixic acid-supplemented sheep blood agar, which were found to be superfluous. In addition, the results of this study further delineated the prevalence of selected bacteria and fungi in respiratory tract secretions from patients with cystic fibrosis. In rank order of frequency of isolation, we recovered isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Candida albicans, S. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, molds, members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, yeasts other than Candida albicans, miscellaneous gram-negative bacilli, beta-hemolytic streptococci, P. cepacia, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - In vitro activity of T-3761, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of T-3761, a new fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agent which  has an oxazine ring structure with a cyclopropyl moiety at C-10, was compared with those of other agents against 2,854 clinical isolates. T-3761 had a broad spectrum of activity and had potent activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The MICs of T-3761 against 90% of the methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Clostridium spp. tested were 0.39 to 6.25 micrograms/ml. Its activity was comparable to those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin and four- to eightfold greater than those of norfloxacin and fleroxacin, but its activity was two- to eightfold less than that of tosufloxacin. Some isolates of ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus (MIC of ciprofloxacin, greater than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml) were still susceptible to T-3761 (MIC of T-3761, less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml). The MICs of T-3761 against 90% of the streptococci and enterococci tested were 3.13 to 100 micrograms/ml. Its activity was equal to or 2- or 4-fold greater than those of norfloxacin and fleroxacin, equal to or 2- or 4-fold less than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and 4- to 16-fold less than that of tosufloxacin. The activity of T-3761 against gram-negative bacteria was usually fourfold greater than those of norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin. Many isolates which were resistant to nonfluoroquinolone agents, such as minocycline- or imipenem-resistant S. aureus, ceftazidime-resistant members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, gentamicin- or imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, were susceptible to T-3761. The MBCs of T-3761 were either equal to or twofold greater than the MICs. The number of viable cells decreased rapidly during incubation with T-3761 at one to four times the MIC. At a concentration of four times the MIC, the frequencies of appearance of spontaneous mutants resistant to T-3761 against S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa were 2.2 x 10(-8) to less than or equal to 1.2 x 10(-9). The 50% inhibitory concentrations of T-3761 for DNA gyrases isolated from E. coli and P. aeruginosa were 0.88 and 1.9 micrograms/ml, respectively.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of a new quinolone, OPC-17116, possessing potent  activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of OPC-17116, a new fluoroquinolone, against  a wide variety of clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin. OPC-17116 showed potent broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The activity of this compound against gram-positive bacteria was higher than those of other quinolones, and its activity against gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria was roughly comparable to those of other quinolones. OPC-17116 had potent activity against important pathogens of respiratory tract infections such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis. The MICs of this compound against 90% of these organisms, except for methicillin-resistant S. aureus, ranged from less than or equal to 0.006 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. OPC-17116 at more than one-half the MICs was bactericidal against clinical isolates of S. aureus, Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa. The activity of OPC-17116 was decreased by several culture conditions such as acidic pH, high concentration of Mg2+ ions, and inoculum size of 10(7) CFU/ml. OPC-17116 inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrases from E. coli KL-16 and S. aureus SA113 (50% inhibitory concentrations, 0.19 and 23.0 micrograms/ml, respectively). The amount of OPC-17116 accumulation was higher than that of other quinolones in S. aureus.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AM-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  - AM-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. AM-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis; its MICs for 90% of strains tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. The activity of AM-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Xanthomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Campylobacter jejuni, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. At a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, AM-1155 inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Development of resistance to AM-1155 in S. aureus and S. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. In the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, AM-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. The efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of AM-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. Against experimental pneumonia with Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. AM-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. These results suggest that AM-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.
TI  - Microbiology of lung infection in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Bronchopulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is associated with chronic progressive lung disease and episodes of acute exacerbation. Infection is predominantly caused by bacteria, although infections with viruses, mycoplasma and fungi may play undervalued roles. Bacteria commonly isolated from CF sputum include Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Colonisation of the airways by mucoid, alginate-producing variants of P. aeruginosa is recognised as a major cause of pulmonary deterioration. In addition, there is now considerable concern relating to the clinical consequences of colonisation and cross-infection with P. cepacia. This review discusses the microbiology of CF focussing on the pathogenesis and epidemiology of P. aeruginosa and P. cepacia.
TI  - Evolution of airway microbiology in the infant with cystic fibrosis: role of nonpseudomonal and pseudomonal pathogens.
AB  - Bacterial colonization of the airways of the infant with cystic fibrosis is usually established early in life, and, once established, is difficult to eradicate and is associated with progressive lung disease. Thus, understanding of early airway microbiology is critical to the development of appropriate early interventions such as prophylactic antibiotics, immunotherapy, and, potentially, gene therapy. The barriers to the study of infant airway microbiology are discussed, and the properties of infant lung anatomy, physiology, and immunity, which predispose the young patient to serious infection, are reviewed. We examine the natural history of lung infection in young patients, reviewing the roles of each of the main bacterial pathogens. Recent research on risk factors for early Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization, including the potential role of respiratory viral infections, is discussed. We conclude with a discussion of the role of prophylactic antibiotic therapy.
TI  - In vitro activity of L-627, a new carbapenem.
AB  - The in vitro activity of L-627, a new parenterally administered carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, FCE 22101 (a penem), ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone. L-627 was active against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90] ranging from 0.03 to 4 micrograms/ml). L-627 displayed activity equal to that of meropenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), although, as with other carbapenems, the antipseudomonal activity was reduced against D2-deficient strains. Staphylococci and streptococci were susceptible (MIC90 of 1.0 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus aureus and 0.015 micrograms/ml for group A streptococci). L-627 also had activity against anaerobic bacteria (MIC90, 2.0 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides fragilis). Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis were highly susceptible (MIC90, 0.06 micrograms/ml), and against the common respiratory pathogens (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis), the MIC90s were less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml. The protein binding of L-627 ranged from 13.8 to 22%, depending on the concentration. The presence of human serum had little effect on the MIC or MBC of L-627. These results suggest that L-627 merits further study in the treatment of infections caused by a wide range of pathogens.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of E1077, a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  - E1077 is a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The in vitro activities of E1077 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC of E1077 for 90% of the strains tested [MIC90], 0.78 microgram/ml) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MIC90, 50 micrograms/ml) were similar to those of cefpirome and flomoxef. Against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 6.25 micrograms/ml), E1077 was the most active of the drugs tested and four times more active than cefpirome. The MIC90S of E1077 for streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ranged from 0.05 to 0.78 microgram/ml; E1077 was similar in activity to cefpirome. E1077 inhibited 90% of most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae at concentrations of less than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml, with the exception of Serratia marcescens and Proteus vulgaris (12.5 micrograms/ml). The activity of E1077 against P. aeruginosa (MIC90, 6.25 micrograms/ml) was comparable to that of ceftazidime. In vivo activity was evaluated with systemic infections in mice. E1077 showed a protective effect against systemic infections by gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria, as reflected by its in vitro activity. The protective effects of E1077 were higher than those of cefpirome against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa infections and similar to those of cefpirome against other bacterial infections. Morphological studies using differential interference and phase-contrast microscopy showed that low concentrations of E1077 caused swelling of S. aureus and spheroplast and bulge formation in P. aeruginosa. In general, the antibacterial profile of E1077 is similar to that of cefpirome.
TI  - Plasma bactericidal activity of a new C-5 methyl fluoroquinolone after oral doses of 400 and 800 mg.
AB  - The plasma bactericidal activity of a new C-5 methyl fluoroquinolone, OPC-17116,  was determined after once-daily oral ingestion of 400 mg and 800 mg in normal, healthy volunteers. OPC-17116 at a 400-mg dose produced plasma bactericidal titers greater than or equal to 1:16 at 12 hours against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. OPC-17116 bactericidal titers against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 1:2 or 1:4 at 6 and 12 hours. The plasma bactericidal titers against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 1:4 or greater, but bactericidal titers against Staphylococcus aureus were 1:2 at 12 hours and less than 1:2 at 24 hours. The 800-mg dose of OPC-17116 produced bactericidal titers of at least 1:32 at 12 hours for the Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus, and Moraxella, and 1:4 for S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, but bactericidal titers against S. aureus were 1:2. These data would suggest that an 800-mg dose of OPC-17116 taken orally once daily would provide adequate concentrations to treat infections due to the pathogens examined in this study.
TI  - Detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in sputum from cystic fibrosis patients by the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - A DNA amplification procedure using heat stable Taq polymerase and the polymerase chain reaction is described for the detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in specimens from cystic fibrosis patients. A set of primers was selected on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of the algD gene encoding GDP mannose dehydrogenase, a major enzyme in the biosynthesis of alginate by P. aeruginosa. Using this set of primers in conjunction with the polymerase chain reaction, P. aeruginosa could be specifically detected, with a sensitivity approximating 10 bacteria, in sputum harbouring large numbers of other respiratory pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. These results suggest that amplification of specific sequences within the algD gene by the polymerase chain reaction may provide a highly sensitive and specific tool for the detection of P. aeruginosa in the early stages of pulmonary colonization.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of the new antibiotic vermisporin.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of vermisporin, a new antibiotic produced by fermentation of the fungus Ophiobolus vermisporis, was tested in vitro. Vermisporin inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. at 1 microgram/ml (range 0.25-1 micrograms/ml). Clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 1 microgram/ml (range 0.25-2 micrograms/ml). Vermisporin inhibited 90% of Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, at 0.5 micrograms/ml (range 0.12-0.5 micrograms/ml). Vermisporin MICs for group A, B, C, F and G streptococci were < 1 microgram/ml when tested in Haemophilus Test Medium but > or = 8 micrograms/ml in the presence of blood. Vermisporin MICs for Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae exceeded 64 micrograms/ml. Inhibited organisms had MBCs 16- to 32-fold above the MICs.
TI  - Systemic hypersensitivity vasculitis associated with bronchiectasis.
AB  - Systemic hypersensitivity vasculitis developed in a 53-year-old man during acute  exacerbation of bronchiectasis infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. High grade fever, mononeuropathy multiplex, cutaneous vasculitis, and biopsy specimen-proved mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis with crescent formation and leukocytoclastic vasculitis associated with circulating immune complex occurred. Corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide therapy was effective for vasculitis and bronchiectasis.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of ticarcillin alone and ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid against beta-lactamase producing and non-producing microorganisms.
AB  - A total of 818 clinical bacterial isolates were tested for the production of beta-lactamase by rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method and for the susceptibility to ticarcillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid (2 micrograms/mL) by agar dilution method. These included 83 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 31 of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 49 of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 58 of Haemophilus influenzae, 112 of Escherichia coli, 118 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 58 of Proteus mirabilis, 30 of Proteus vulgaris, 60 of Serratia marcescens, 113 of Enterobacter cloacae, 60 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 46 of Bacteroides fragilis. The results revealed that 46.6% of P. mirabilis, 53.4% of H. influenzae, 57.1% of N. gonorrhoeae, 80% of P. vulgaris, 83.9% of MRSA, 85.6% of MSSA, 87.5% of E. coli, 91.7% of S. marcescens, 95.7% of B. fragilis, 98.2% of E. cloacae, and 100% of K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa strains produced beta-lactamase. In general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to ticarcillin than beta-lactamase producers. The ranges of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ticarcillin for beta-lactamase nonproducers of MSSA, MRSA, H. influenzae, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, E. cloacae, B. fragilis and beta-lactamase producers of MSSA, H. influenzae strains were all within the in vitro susceptible range. The presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the antibacterial activity of ticarcillin against beta-lactamase producers of MRSA, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris and B. fragilis strains. Clavulanic acid had no synergistic activity for ticarcillin against S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and E. cloacae.
TI  - Ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone. Results from a Multicenter, National Comparative Activity Surveillance Study. The Ofloxacin Surveillance Group.
AB  - Ofloxacin, a newer broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone, was evaluated against 6967 clinical isolates in a multicenter surveillance trial using a standardized disk diffusion method. Thirty-five geographically diverse laboratories contributed zone diameter results for two (ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) to five (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, cefaclor, and cefixime) antimicrobial agents, depending on the site of infection. Ofloxacin was determined to have the widest spectrum of activity and potential empiric use (90.6%, range 87.1%-92.2%) for respiratory tract, urinary tract, and cutaneous infections. The spectrum was superior to ciprofloxacin (average 85.3% versus three sites), ampicillin (35.5%, respiratory tract), cefaclor (60.5%, respiratory tract), cefixime (60.9%, respiratory tract), and norfloxacin (87.3%, urinary tract). Strains resistant to ofloxacin (35 isolates, 0.5%) were confirmed by reference laboratory tests and cross resistance was observed among several current and investigational fluoroquinolone agents. The species most often found to be fluoroquinolone resistant among the Enterobacteriaceae were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Providencia spp. Monitoring for increasing fluoroquinolone resistance should be considered as greater use of drugs in this class develops. By these cited statistics, ofloxacin appears to have a broad and balanced spectrum of potential use, particularly against Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Inhibition of lymphoproliferation by middle ear effusion in experimental otitis media.
AB  - In this study, experimental otitis media was created in the chinchilla by direct  middle ear challenge with Escherichia coli endotoxin, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The effusions recovered from the chinchillas in all four challenge groups were shown to inhibit the lymphoproliferative response of chinchilla peripheral blood lymphocytes to stimulation with phytohemagglutinin. The effect was dose dependent, and for effusions of infectious origin, the degree of inhibition was directly related to the duration of infection. Presence of the inhibitor in plasma was undocumented, suggesting a local production within the middle ear. Lymphocytes from middle ears infected with bacteria but not middle ears challenged with endotoxin were hyporesponsive or nonresponsive to stimulation with phytohemagglutinin. These results confirm the presence of an inhibitor of the lymphoproliferative response in experimental otitis media of different etiologies.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of SCE-2787, a new parenteral cephalosporin with  a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  - SCE-2787, a new cephalosporin having a condensed azolium moiety in the 3 position and an aminothiadiazolyl group in the 7 beta side chain, was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo activities in comparison with those of ceftazidime, flomoxef, cefpirome, and E1040. Against methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, SCE-2787 was more active than ceftazidime and E1040 and was as active as flomoxef and cefpirome, with MICs for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) being 1.56 micrograms/ml or less. SCE-2787 was also active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, for which the MIC90 was 6.25 micrograms/ml, which was lower than that of cefpirome and comparable to that of ceftazidime. SCE-2787 was marginally active against methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci and Enterococcus faecalis, although its MIC90s were the lowest among those of the antibiotics tested. The activities of SCE-2787 against Streptococcus species, most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, and Haemophilus influenzae exceeded those of ceftazidime and flomoxef and were comparable to those of cefpirome. Furthermore, MIC90s of SCE-2787 were significantly lower than those of ceftazidime for ceftazidime-resistant isolates of Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae. SCE-2787 was resistant to hydrolysis by various types of beta-lactamases, including the Bush group 1 beta-lactamases, and had low affinities for these enzymes, with Km or Ki values of greater than 100 microM. The in vitro activity of SCE-2787 was reflected in its efficacy in mouse protection tests. Thus, SCE-2787 appears to be a promising cephalosporin that should be further evaluated in clinical trials.
TI  - [Clinical significance of respiratory infections associated with lung cancer patients].
AB  - An attempt was made to interpret the clinical significance of secondary infections associated with lung cancer. The incidence of secondary infections was 51.4% in 214 in-patients with lung cancer in our institution in 1988 and 1989, and almost all of them had respiratory infections caused by commonly encountered bacteria. The incidence of infection was high in lung cancer of cell types other than adenocarcinoma, and in those with hypoalbuminemia, impaired cellular immunity and obstruction of the airway. The prognosis in patients with infection was much poorer than that in patients without infection. Major pathogens responsible for infection were Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These pathogens, except for H. influenzae, were isolated in the terminal stage in cases with airway obstruction and post cancer chemotherapy. The efficacy rate of 194 therapeutic regimens against infection was 57.7%. It was thus found that the efficacy rate in 1988 and 1989 exceeded that in the 1970s. The effectiveness was very poor for infections caused by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, and for cases with airway obstruction and marked impairment of pulmonary blood flow. The efficacy rate of single-drug regimens was 57.1% (80/140) and that of combined regimens was 59.3% (32/54). The above results indicate that a new combined therapy which includes a beta-lactam antibiotic as well as measures to improve the general health of compromised hosts are required in the treatment of secondary infections in these patients.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of new streptogramins, RP 59500, RP 57669 and RP 54476, alone and in combination.
AB  - RP 59500 is a 30:70 mixture of RP 57669 and RP 54476. The activity of RP 59500 and its two components against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms was compared with that of clarithromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin and rokitamycin. RP 59500 inhibited 90% of erythromycin-susceptible and resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at less than or equal to 1 mg/L (range 0.06-2 mg/L). Both inducibly and constitutively-resistant strains of S. aureus, as well as strains resistant to rifampicin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin, were inhibited. Streptococcus pyogenes, including erythromycin-resistant isolates, and group C and G streptococci were inhibited by 0.5 mg/L. Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci were inhibited by 1 mg/L. The MIC90 was 4 mg/L for Haemophilus influenzae and 1 mg/L for Moraxella catarrhalis. RP 59500 did not inhibit Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The activity of RP 59500 against streptococci was less than that of the four other macrolides. Clostridium perfringens strains were highly susceptible, as were Bacteroides spp. RP 59500, when combined with ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime or gentamicin, did not have altered activity against susceptible species or alter the activity of the other component of the combination against susceptible species. MBCs in serum were increased two- to four-fold for S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and S. aureus, compared with MBCs in broth, but RP 59500 was as active at pH 6 as at pH 7, and there was not an appreciable inoculum effect. RP 59500 has potential use as an agent against inducibly and constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates of Gram-positive species and selected anaerobic organisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6859, a new potent fluoroquinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  - DU-6859, (-)-7-[(7S)-amino-5-azaspiro(2,4)heptan-5-yl]-8-chloro-6- fluoro-1-[(1R,2R)-cis-2-fluoro-1-cyclopropyl]-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinol one-3- carboxylic acid, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity which is significantly better than those of currently available quinolones. The MICs for 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis clinical isolates (MIC90s) were 0.1, 3.13, 0.1, and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. MIC50s of DU-6859 against quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 8-, 32-, 64-, and 128-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. DU-6859 inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.1 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively, and was more active against enterococci than the other quinolones tested. Although the activity of DU-6859 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to that of ciprofloxacin at the MIC50 level, it was fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin at the MIC90 level. DU-6859 was also more active against other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, than the other drugs tested. Strains of Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. were susceptible to DU-6859; MIC90s were 0.39 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively. DU-6859 generally showed activities twofold or greater than those of ciprofloxacin and the other drugs against almost all members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The action of DU-6859 against the clinical isolates was bactericidal at concentrations near the MICs. DU-6859 activity was not affected by different media, pH, inoculum size, or human serum but was decreased in human urine.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies with meropenem in the pediatric field. Pediatric Study Group of Meropenem].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluations in pediatrics were made on meropenem (SM-7338, MEPM), a new parenteral dehydropeptidase-1 stable carbapenem used without any inhibitors, at 33 medical institutions. The results are summarized as follows. 1. Pharmacokinetic studies. MEPM at a dose of 10, 20, or 40 mg/kg was administered to 53 children by 30-minute drip infusion. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax's) and plasma half-lives (T1/2's) of these doses were 28.5, 47.2 and 130.0 micrograms/ml, and 0.80, 0.93 and 0.94 hours, respectively. A clear dose response was observed in Cmax's and T1/2 values were quite similar to those observed in adults. In the first 6 hours after administration, 54.4 to 68.1% of the administered drug was recovered in urine. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of MEPM in patients with purulent meningitis were 0.13 microgram/ml at a dose of 6 mg/kg, and 0.64 to 4.22 micrograms/ml at a dose of 29 to 44 mg/kg within day 4 of onset. The penetration rate of MEPM showed an intermediate value among those for other cephalosporin antibiotics. 2. Clinical study. Clinical efficacies of MEPM were evaluated in 389 cases. The most common doses used were 10 to 20 mg/kg/once, 2 to 3 times a day. The maximum dose was 173 mg/kg/day q.i.d. MEPM gave "excellent" or "good" responses in 242 (97.6%) out of 248 cases in which causative organisms were documented and in 134 (95.0%) out of 141 cases in which causative organisms were not identified. Clinical efficacy rates were 100% in 11 patients with purulent meningitis, 85.7% in 7 with septicemia, 98.8% in 173 with pneumonia, and 100% in 65 with UTI. Bacteriologically, 260 strains (96.7%) out of 269 strains were eradicated by MEPM treatment. Eradication rates were 89.2% for Staphylococcus aureus (37 strains) and 100% for Streptococcus pneumoniae (35 strains). The overall eradication rate for Gram-positive bacteria was 94.6%. Among Gram-negative bacteria, 98.3% out of 172 strains were eradicated. The eradication rate of Haemophilus influenzae (73 strains) was 98.6% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11 strains) was 90.9%, and all of Branhamella catarrhalis (15 strains), Escherichia coli (42 strains), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6 strains) were eradicated. Out of 84 cases for which previous antibiotic therapies of 3 days or longer were not successful, MEPM gave "excellent" or "good" responses in 77 cases (91.7%) and excellent bacteriological responses (95.7%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In-vitro activity of tosufloxacin, a new quinolone antibacterial agent.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of tosufloxacin (A-61827) was compared with that of temafloxacin, ciprofloxacin and selected members of other groups of antimicrobial agents, against 684 recent distinct clinical isolates and strains with known mechanisms of resistance. Against members of the Enterobacteriaceae, ciprofloxacin was slightly more active than tosufloxacin, which was more active than temafloxacin. The MIC90 of tosufloxacin for all species of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. was less than or equal to 1 mg/L. Tosufloxacin was slightly more active than temafloxacin, and four to eight fold more active than ciprofloxacin, against the Gram-positive species tested. The MIC90 of tosufloxacin for Staphylococcus aureus was 0.12 mg/L, and for Streptococcus pneumoniae was 0.5 mg/L. All strains of Neisseria spp., Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were inhibited by tosufloxacin at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.12 mg/L. Tosufloxacin was the most active quinolone against the anaerobic organisms tested. Cross resistance between quinolones was seen, but not between quinolones and other groups of antimicrobials. The protein binding of tosufloxacin across a range of concentrations averaged 60%. Human serum at a concentration of 70% decreased the bactericidal activity of tosufloxacin by about four-fold.
TI  - In vitro activity of OPC-17116.
AB  - The in vitro activity of OPC-17116, a new C-5 methyl fluoroquinolone, was compared with the activities of other fluoroquinolones. OPC-17116 inhibited 50% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested and 90% of Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria species, and Moraxella catarrhalis isolates at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. At less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, 90% of the Enterobacteriaceae were inhibited, which was comparable to or better than the activities of fleroxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin but less than the activity of ciprofloxacin. OPC-17116 inhibited 90% of the staphylococci tested at less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, but it did not inhibit methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis. Group A, B, C, F, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml, being four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Tosufloxacin was the most active agent tested against gram-positive cocci. OPC-17116 inhibited Bacteroides fragilis at 4 micrograms/ml. There was a minimal effect of inoculum size on MIC, and the MBCs were within 1 dilution of the MICs. The activity of OPC-17116 was decreased at pH 6 and in the presence of high Mg2+ concentrations, but it was unaffected by human serum. OPC-17116 showed a postantibiotic effect against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus similar to the postantibiotic effects reported for other fluoroquinolones. The frequency of spontaneous single-step resistance was low (less than 10(-9)), but repeated passage of organisms in the presence of OPC-17116 resulted in the selection of resistant isolates.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of two new quinolones: rufloxacin and MF 961.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of two new quinolone antimicrobials, rufloxacin and MF 961, together with the desmethylated metabolite of rufloxacin (MF 922) were compared with other orally administered agents against 622 bacterial strains. Against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa rufloxacin was generally active (MIC90 1-8 mg/L) with the exception of Klebsiella and Serratia spp. (MIC90 32 mg/L and Enterobacter spp. (MIC90) 64 mg/L. The respiratory pathogens Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were susceptible to rufloxacin (MIC90 0.5 and 1 mg/L respectively) but Streptococcus pneumoniae was less susceptible (MIC90 32 mg/L). Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to rufloxacin (MIC90 2 mg/L). The rufloxacin metabolite MF 922 was generally as active as its parent. MF 961 was usually two-fold more active than rufloxacin. All three compounds were four to 16 times less active than norfloxacin, but rufloxacin was as active or somewhat more active than norfloxacin against Staphylococcus spp. Any strains showing decreased susceptibility to other quinolones exhibited cross resistance to these new agents. The MBC of rufloxacin and MF 922 was within one dilution of the MIC and human serum had little effect upon the activity of both agents. The protein binding of rufloxacin and MF 922 at 1 and 10 mg/L were 55% and 63.8% and 30.3% and 32.6% respectively. The activity of rufloxacin against four strains of Chlamydia trachomatis and one strain of Chlamydia pneumoniae was determined. The MICs for C. trachomatis were 4-8 mg/L and 4 mg/L for C. pneumoniae.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a C-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. Cefquinome inhibited members of the Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella Shigella, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella, and Providencia. Although most Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) greater than 16 micrograms/ml]. Serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. The majority of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. Most enterococci had cefquinome MICs of 4-8 micrograms/ml. Cefquinome was extremely active against group-A streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MICs less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. Overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. It inhibited some Enterobacter and Citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. Cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Klebsiella, Branhamella, and Pseudomonas, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-5, and TEM-9. Its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) for most species except for Enterobacter were within a dilution of MICs.
TI  - Production and characterisation of mouse monoclonal antibodies reactive with the  lipopolysaccharide core of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the core antigen region of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were produced from mice immunised with whole cells of heat-killed rough mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa expressing partial or complete core LPS. MAbs were screened in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against three different antigen cocktails: S-form LPS from three P. aeruginosa strains, R-form LPS from six P. aeruginosa strains and, as a negative control, R-form LPS from Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. Selected MAbs were subsequently screened against a range of extracted LPS and whole cells from both reference strains and clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa. The antibodies were also screened in ELISA against whole-cell antigens from other Pseudomonas spp. as well as strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria subflava and Staphylococcus aureus. Five MAbs reacting with the core component of P. aeruginosa LPS were finally selected. Two of these, MAbs 360.7 and 304.1.4, were particularly reactive in immunoblots against unsubstituted core LPS, including that from O-antigenic serotypes of P. aeruginosa. The MAbs also reacted with some of the other Pseudomonas spp., but not with P. cepacia or Xanthomonas (Pseudomonas) maltophilia. Cross-reactivity with whole cells from other bacterial species was minimal or not observed. Reactivity of MAbs with some Staph. aureus strains was observed, and binding to the protein A component was implicated. The reactivity of the MAbs was investigated further by flow cytometry and immunogold electronmicroscopy. The suitability of the MAbs for an immunological assay for detection of P. aeruginosa in respiratory secretions from CF patients is discussed.
TI  - [Sputum penetration of levofloxacin and its clinical efficacy in patients with chronic lower respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Sputum penetration of levofloxacin (LVFX) was evaluated after a single oral dose  of 100 mg or 200 mg to 4 patients with copious purulent sputa. The sputum concentration of LVFX reached maximum levels of 1.27 and 4.36 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, and still remained at concentrations of 0.32 and 1.68 micrograms/ml at 8 hours after administration of 100 mg and 200 mg, respectively. The AUC ratio of sputum/serum was 0.9-1.0, indicating good sputum penetration of LVFX in these patients. The clinical efficacy and the safety of LVFX were also evaluated in a total of 13 patients with respiratory tract infections associated with bronchiectasis, diffuse panbronchiolitis, etc. LVFX was administered orally at a daily dose of 200 mg once a day, 100 mg t.i.d. or 200 mg t.i.d. for 7-28 days (mean 14.7 days). The clinical response to the drug was rated as excellent in 1 case, good in 5, fair in 3, and poor in 2 cases in 11 evaluable cases, thus the efficacy rate was 54.5%. All the 3 strains of Haemophilus influenzae were eradicated. Of the 3 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, eradication, decrease, and unchange was observed for 1 strain each. One strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae remained unchanged. No adverse reaction was observed except for 1 case with slight and temporary increase of eosinophils. The above results suggested that LVFX would be clinically useful in the treatment of chronic lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - In-vitro activity of PD 131628, a new quinolone antimicrobial agent.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of PD 131628, the active metabolite of the prodrug PD 131112, was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and members of other groups of antimicrobial agents against 701 recent clinical isolates and strains with known mechanisms of resistance. The MIC90s of PD 131628 against the Enterobacteriaceae were between 0.008 and 0.5 mg/L; PD 131628 was one- to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against these strains and was four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against the Gram-positive species tested, PD 131628 was two- to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin, inhibiting all strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae with 0.5 mg/L or less. PD 131628 was very active against Neisseria spp., Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, with MIC90s ranging from 0.004 to 0.008 mg/L. Organisms with decreased susceptibility to other quinolones had decreased susceptibility to PD 131628, but there was no cross-resistance between this class of antimicrobial and other classes. The protein binding of PD 131628 was at most 25% across a broad range of concentrations. The addition of 70% human serum had little effect on the MICs, but caused a two- to eight-fold increase in MBCs.
TI  - A double-blind study of two dosage regimens of lomefloxacin in bacteriologically  proven exacerbations of chronic bronchitis of gram-negative etiology.
AB  - Lomefloxacin has been shown to produce high and sustained concentrations in serum and bronchial mucosa after once-daily administration. This study was designed to assess whether a dose response exists for 400 mg lomefloxacin given once daily or twice daily for 10 days in the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis of gram-negative etiology. A total of 100 adult patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis were enrolled at 10 study sites in Germany. Patients with confirmed bacterial pathogens in the baseline sputum culture (once-daily group n = 49, twice-daily group n = 47) were eligible for analysis of bacteriologic and clinical efficacy. The eradication rates for the most frequently isolated baseline pathogens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, were at least 75% for both treatment regimens. Overall, once-daily treatment eradicated baseline pathogens in 42 of 49 (85.7%) patients, while twice-daily treatment eradicated pathogens in 43 of 47 (91.5%). This difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.226). Clinically, 47 of 49 (95.9%) patients in the once-daily group and 46 of 47 (97.9%) in the twice-daily group were cured or improved (p = 0.307). Both regimens were well tolerated; there were no differences in the incidence (six patients in each group), types, or severity of adverse events, nor was there clinical evidence of theophylline interaction. The results of this study demonstrate that once-daily treatment with 400 mg lomefloxacin is as effective as twice-daily dosing with 400 mg in patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
TI  - Lomefloxacin: microbiologic assessment and unique properties.
AB  - In comparative studies, lomefloxacin, a new difluorinated quinolone, exhibits broad antibacterial activity in vitro, similar or superior to that of other quinolones (enoxacin, ofloxacin, pipemidic acid, nalidixic acid, and norfloxacin) but less than that of ciprofloxacin. Lomefloxacin inhibited Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and the majority of aerobic gram-negative rods, including nosocomial isolates, at concentrations readily achievable in biologic fluids and tissues. Lomefloxacin was less active against obligate anaerobes and streptococci. Organisms resistant to methicillin, penicillin, or the aminoglycosides were susceptible to lomefloxacin. No significant lomefloxacin resistance was identified in 18 countries in which in vitro studies were conducted, with the exception of a small number of strains tested in France. The frequency with which spontaneous single-step resistance to lomefloxacin develops in vitro is low.
TI  - Safety and efficacy of lomefloxacin versus cefaclor in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - In two multicenter trials, lomefloxacin and cefaclor were compared as treatments  for acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. In total, 522 adult outpatients were enrolled at 50 centers in the United States. Patients were randomized to treatment groups receiving either 400 mg lomefloxacin orally once daily (n = 259) or 250 mg cefaclor every 8 hours (n = 263) for 7-10 days. Both groups were comparable in terms of age, severity of exacerbation, smoking history, theophylline use, and baseline pathogens. The most common baseline pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae, found in 32% of patients in the lomefloxacin group and in 29% in the cefaclor group, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13% and 16%, respectively), Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (12% and 13%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (10% in both groups). Bacterial eradication rates 1-4 days after the completion of treatment for all patients with baseline pathogens were 81.8% in the lomefloxacin group and 62.7% in the cefaclor group (p less than 0.001). Clinical success (disappearance or improvement of presenting signs and symptoms) was noted in 80.0% of patients in the lomefloxacin group and 64.7% in the cefaclor group (p = 0.002). Eradication rates for the subgroup of patients who had pathogens susceptible in vitro to both study drugs and who completed treatment were 97.1% for lomefloxacin and 84.6% for cefaclor (p = 0.002). Clinical success rates in this subgroup were 92.4% for lomefloxacin and 90.1 for cefaclor (p = 0.585). Treatment-related adverse events were reported for 7% of patients in the lomefloxacin group and 5% in the cefaclor group. The most common adverse events in both groups were nausea and diarrhea. Six patients were withdrawn from treatment with lomefloxacin and four from the cefaclor group because of adverse events. There was no clinical or laboratory evidence of theophylline interaction with either treatment. Once-daily oral administration of 400 mg lomefloxacin was an effective, well-tolerated alternative to 250 mg of cefaclor three times daily in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, a dual-action antibacterial agent, against bacterial isolates from cancer patients compared with those of other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 23-9424 against bacterial isolates from patients with cancer was compared with those of fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone, and ceftazidime. Ro 23-9424 inhibited the majority of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and all Aeromonas isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. It was also active against Acinetobacter spp. and Haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. The MIC for 90% of isolates (MIC90) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 16.0 micrograms/ml. All group A and B streptococci were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, and 90% of group G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 1.0 micrograms/ml. All methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 60% of methicillin-resistant strains were susceptible to 2.0 micrograms of Ro 23-9424 per ml, whereas the MIC90 for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus hominis isolates was 4.0 micrograms/ml. Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Enterococcus spp. were less susceptible; MIC90s for them were 16.0 and 32.0 micrograms/ml. Ro 23-9424 has a broad antibacterial spectrum and potential utility for therapy of infections in cancer patients.
TI  - In vitro activity of OPC-17116 compared to other broad-spectrum fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The in vitro activity of OPC-17116 was compared to that of five similar fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and temafloxacin). A total of 700 isolates from recent cases of clinical bacteremia were tested. Fifty additional stock strains with well-characterized resistance mechanisms were also processed. The minimal concentrations inhibiting 90% of strains (MIC90) of Enterobacteriaceae species were for OPC-17116 0.015-0.5 micrograms/ml and for ciprofloxacin 0.015-0.25 micrograms/ml. Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were very susceptible to OPC-17116 (MIC90 0.015 micrograms/ml) thus being fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. For all beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci OPC-17116 MICs were less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. The most resistant enteric bacilli were among the Citrobacter freundii and Providencia rettgeri strains (MIC90 0.5 micrograms/ml). Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were comparably susceptible to OPC-17116 (MIC90 0.5 micrograms/ml). Low pH and CO2 incubation had an adverse effect on OPC-17116 MICs, and resistance development was documented among current clinical isolates of staphylococci, pseudomonas and some Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Cross-reactive proteins of Borrelia burgdorferi.
AB  - The specificity of serological tests for Lyme borreliosis is impaired by cross-reacting antibodies. In order to select antigens for more specific tests, specific and cross-reactive proteins of Borrelia burgdorferi must be identified. Therefore, to analyze cross reactions of Borrelia burgdorferi with other bacteria, rabbit immune sera against heterologous bacteria (Borrelia hermsii, Treponema pallidum, Treponema phagedenis, Leptospira interrogans (serogroup grippotyphosa), Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Yersinia enterocolitica (serotypes O3 and O9), Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes O1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri and Legionella micdadei) were examined by Western blot using Borrelia burgdorferi as antigen. Broad cross reactivity was shown for Borrelia proteins of the 60-75 kDa range. Other broadly cross-reacting proteins were at the level of p40, p33 and two proteins in the range of 20 kDa. Some of the cross reactions were eliminated by absorption of the sera with Treponema phagedenis. The absorbed antibodies were directed mainly against bands at the level of p33 and bands of the 60 to 75 kDa range. Showing the lowest potential for cross reactivity, p100, p41, OspA and pC seem to be the most suitable antigens for serodiagnosis. In contrast to p100 and OspA, however, p41 and pC showed cross reactivity with immune sera against bacteria not belonging to the genus Borrelia.
TI  - Bacterial quantification--a necessary complement for the comprehension of middle  ear inflammations.
AB  - Quantification of bacteria in various types of middle ear effusion (MEE) obtained during current acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME) and chronic suppurative otitis media (COM) was performed. The bacteria were stained with acridine orange and their number per ml effusion evaluated under the fluorescence microscope according to a method described in detail elsewhere. During AOM, 53% of the MEE samples were culture-positive and contained 10(6)-10(8) bacteria per ml (median value 10(7) per ml). During OME, serous effusion and 78% of the mucoid effusions contained no bacteria whatsoever, whereas the remaining mucoid effusions contained 10(4)-5 x 10(5) bacteria per ml (median value 10(4) per ml). Mucopurulent effusions contained 6 x 10(5)-10(8) bacteria per ml (median value 5 x 10(6) per ml). During COM, purulent MEE had 6 x 10(6)-10(9) bacteria per ml (median value 10(8) per ml). Quantification of bacteria involved in middle ear diseases provides further information about the etiopathogenesis and appropriate management of various pathological conditions of the middle ear.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies of panipenem/betamipron in pediatrics].
AB  - We carried out bacteriological and clinical studies of panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP), a newly-developed carbapenem antibiotic, in pediatrics, and the following results were obtained: 1. When antibacterial activities of panipenem (PAPM) were determined, it was found that MICs against such Gram-positive cocci as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae and against such Gram-negative rods as Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Branhamella catarrhalis were all sufficiently low. 2. PAPM showed better MIC-correlated antibacterial activities against 215 subcultured strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) than imipenem. 3. Clinical efficacies were evaluated to be excellent in 23 of 34 patients treated with PAPM/BP, excluding 3 patients from the efficacy evaluation. In addition, good responses were obtained in 10 patients but poor response in one, showing the overall efficacy rate of 97.1%. As for bacteriological efficacies, the eradication rate was also determined to be high, 92.6%. 4. As for side effects, rash appeared in 2 patients, and soft stool and diarrhea occurred in one each. The overall incidence of side effects was calculated to be 10.8%. As for abnormal laboratory findings, increases of eosinophiles in 4 patients, thrombocytes in 2, total bilirubin in 1, and GOT in 1 were observed. From these results, PAPM/BP was thought to be a highly useful drug in pediatrics.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on panipenem/betamipron in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) in children. The results are summarized as follow: 1. Twelve patients with various bacterial infectious diseases were treated with PAPM/BP. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, administered 3 times daily, in 30-minute intravenous drip infusion. Treatments were continued for 5-22 days. Clinical efficacies of PAPM/BP in 12 patients with bacterial infections (1 with suspected sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 2 with acute otitis media, 1 with cervical abscess and 2 with urinary tract infection complexed type) were evaluated as excellent in 7, good in 4 and fair in 1, with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. Seventeen causative organisms found in 10 patients (Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, Staphylococcus aureus in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Corynebacterium sp. in 1, Peptostreptococcus micros in 1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2) were eradicated except 2 strains (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) from 1 patient (patient No. 2). No adverse reactions were observed in any of the 12 patients. 2. MICs of PAPM were examined against 22 clinical isolates (H. influenzae 5, B. catarrhalis 3, alpha-Streptococcus 3, S. pneumoniae 2, Corynebacterium sp. 2, S. aureus 1, P. aeruginosa 1, P. micros 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1, Escherichia coli 1, Group D Streptococcus 1 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) from children with bacterial infections. PAPM showed a good antibacterial activity comparable to the activity of cefoperazone (CPZ) against S. pneumoniae strains relatively tolerant to penicillins. However, the activity of PAPM against H. influenzae was somewhat weaker than that of CPZ. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [A clinical study on panipenem/betamipron in chronic respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Panipenem/betamipron (CS-976, PAPM/BP), a new carbapenem antibiotic, was administered a single dose of 500 mg or 750 mg via intravenous drip infusion twice a day for treatment of chronic respiratory infection to study its clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and safety. Twenty nine cases were studied for the efficacy evaluation. Only the safety evaluation was made in 6 cases which were judged to be unsuitable, because in some of them pneumonia and other diseases were not specified as the subject diseases, of serious illness in some the conditions were too serious, and in the other cases the duration of administration was insufficient since administration had to be discontinued due to side-effects. The duration of administration was 6 to 18 days with 1 g divided into 2 doses daily or 4 to 15 days with 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily. When clinical efficacies were classified according to different diseases, this preparation was effective in 11 cases and slightly effective in 1 case of 12 cases of chronic bronchitis with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. It was effective in 10 cases, slightly effective in 1 case and ineffective in 1 case of 12 cases of bronchiectasis with an efficacy rate of 83.3%. It was slightly effective in 2 and ineffective in 1 out of 3 cases of diffuse panbronchiolitis, and was effective in 2 cases of pulmonary emphysema with infections. PAPM/BP was given at a dose level of 1 g in 2 divided doses daily to 17 cases and that of 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily to 10 cases. For the remaining 2 cases, changes in the dose level were made in middle course of treatment. The efficacy rate in the 1 g regimen was 76.5% and that with the 1.5 g regimen was 90%. The overall results in the 29 cases included 23 effective, 4 slightly effective and 2 ineffective cases, thus the overall efficacy rate was 79.3%. As pathogens, 11 species including 24 strains were isolated and identified from 19 cases. They were Gram-positive cocci including 2 strains each of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus viridans and a strain of Streptococcus spp., and Gram-negative rods including 9 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 1 strain each of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas spp.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [A study on in vitro antibacterial activity and clinical usefulness in respiratory tract infections of panipenem/betamipron, a newly synthesized carbapenem antibiotic].
AB  - Panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) is a combination drug of PAPM, a new parenteral carbapenem antibiotic and BP, an amino acid derivative at a weight ratio of 1:1. Its in vitro antibacterial activities against clinically isolated respiratory pathogenic bacteria were determined. It was superior to imipenem (IPM) in the in vitro antibacterial activities against Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli. PAPM had antibacterial activities almost equal to those of IPM against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus spp. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, its antibacterial activity was about 1/4 that of IPM. The clinical usefulness of PAPM/BP was studied by dissolving it in a solution containing lactate and administering the solution by intravenous drip infusion to 12 cases of respiratory tract infections. Out of 11 cases with respiratory tract infections excluding cytomegalovirus pneumonia, the efficacy rate was 90.9%, with 4 cases of excellent and 6 cases of good responses. In terms of its bacteriological efficacies, eradication of pathogenic bacteria including super-infection were observed in 2 out of 4 strains, but 2 strains of P. aeruginosa remained unchanged. Six strains appeared as superinfected bacteria during and after administration of this preparation substituting original pathogens. Side-effects were not observed in the 12 cases, and in laboratory tests, slight transient increases of S-GOT and S-GPT were found in 1 case. In conclusion, PAPM/BP is a very useful parenteral antibiotic against respiratory tract infections and can be one of the drugs of the first choice.
TI  - A comparison of antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin, L-ofloxacin, and other oral  agents for respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The attainable inhibitory ratios (AR) for oral antibiotics were calculated by using literature reports of concentrations attained in respiratory secretions for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMX/CA), ofloxacin (OFL), L-ofloxacin (L-OFL), cefuroxime (CEFU), ciprofloxacin (CIP), and enoxacin (ENO), and using microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration data of these antimicrobials against the common bacterial respiratory pathogens. AR of each antibiotic against the pathogens was expressed as multiples of the MICs achieved at the respiratory site. Bacteria tested included Staphylococcus aureus, group-A and group-B streptococci, Viridans streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Brahamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Eikenella corrodens, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Legionella pneumophila. The antimicrobials with the narrowest spectrum of activity were amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefuroxime which had high attainable inhibitory ratios only against Gram-positive cocci. Ofloxacin and L-oflaxacin were among the quinolones with the highest overall ARs against respiratory pathogen, including, L. pneumophila, H. influenzae, and B. catarrhalis. All agents showed no, or inadequately low ARs for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Respiratory infections associated with lung cancer].
AB  - We have analyzed the clinical significance of secondary infections associated with lung cancer patients. The incidence of secondary infections was 51.4% in 214 in-patients with lung cancer admitted to our institution in 1988 and 1989, and almost all of them had respiratory tract infections. The incidence was high in patients with cell types other than adenocarcinoma, and in those with hypoproteinemia, impaired cellular immunity and obstruction of the airway. The prognosis in patients with infection was much poorer than that in patients without infection. Major causative pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These pathogens except for H. influenzae were isolated at the terminal stage, in cases with airway obstruction and in post cancer-chemotherapeutic phase. The efficacy rate of 194 chemotherapeutic regimens against infection was 57.7%. Although the efficacy rate in 1988 and 1989 exceeded that in the 1970s, there was no significant difference in the efficacy rate between monotherapy (57.1%) and combined therapy (59.3%). The effectiveness was very poor for infections caused by P. aeruginosa and MRSA, or for cases with airway obstruction and marked impairment of pulmonary blood flow. The above results showed that a new combined therapy as well as the measures to improve the general condition of compromised hosts are required in the treatment of secondary infections in these patients.
TI  - [Respiratory tract infections in the elderly, advances and limitations in the diagnosis and treatment].
AB  - Advances and limitations in the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory tract infections were discussed in relation to the prognosis of the elderly patients. Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the major pathogens in the community-acquired respiratory tract infections. On the other hand, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the major pathogens in the nosocomial respiratory tract infections. Detection of MRSA-PBP genes and antibiotic sensitivity tests are important for the diagnosis of MRSA. Vancomycin or arbekacin is the first-choice antibiotic for the treatment of severe infection caused by MRSA, and a combination therapy using one of the above agents and a partner antibiotic is necessary in some cases of MRSA infections. Reports concerning the significance of anaerobic bacteria in respiratory tract infections in Japan have been rare, presumably because procedures to recover anaerobic bacteria from specimens other than sputum, for example transtrancheal aspiration (TTA), bronchoscopic procedure and transcutaneous lung biopsy, are required for the diagnosis of the anaerobic respiratory tract infections. Nowadays, identification of cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a prerequisit for the rapid diagnosis of CMV infection. Therefore attempts are being made to detect a specific substance, for example messenger RNA during the stage of reactivation of CMV. Prophylaxis as well as treatment is necessary for the control of acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections. In this regard, long-term administration of a small dose of erythromycin or new-quinolone is promising.
TI  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A and Haemophilus influenzae type b endotoxin. Effect on the inner ear and passage through the round window membrane of the chinchilla.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A was applied to the round window membrane of the chinchilla in concentrations ranging from 1 microgram/ml to 1 mg/ml. Haemophilus influenzae type b endotoxin (45,000 endotoxin units/ml) was applied in the same way. Five animals were also subjected to blocking of the Eustachian tube, 3 to 8 months earlier, resulting in serous otitis media and exotoxin A (1 mg/ml) was applied into the round window niche of these animals. Effects on the inner ear was recorded with quantitative morphology (hair cell counting) and electrophysiologically (action potential threshold measurements) 4 weeks after application of exotoxin A. Concentrations of exotoxin A in perilymph was measured with ELISA and concentration of endotoxin in perilymph was measured with Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate and Quantitative Chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate. Four weeks after application of exotoxin A at a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml severe inner ear damage could be demonstrated. No inner ear damage was demonstrated when lower concentrations were used. Passage into the inner ear could only be demonstrated after exposure of the round window membrane to an exotoxin A concentration of 1 mg/ml. Round window membranes affected by chronic inflammation were shown to be less permeable to exotoxin A, thus indicating that thickening of the round window membrane may have a protective effect on the inner ear. A low passage rate into the inner ear was demonstrated after endotoxin exposure. It may be concluded that small amounts of exotoxin A passing through the round window membrane may cause inner ear damage. The passage rates, however, for both exotoxin A and endotoxins are low.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of Ro 09-1227, a novel catechol-substituted cephalosporin.
AB  - Ro 09-1227 is a novel 7-position catechol-substituted parenteral cephalosporin that also has a 3-position radical similar to previously described cephems. The Ro 09-1227 spectrum was slightly wider than that of ceftazidime against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested, principally because of greater activity against species producing Richmond-Sykes type I beta-lactamases. Ro 09-1227 was also more active than ceftazidime against some strains producing extended-spectrum plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases, such as TEM-3, -4, -5, -6, -7, and -9, SHV-2 and -3, and CAZ-2. Most strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter spp. were also more susceptible to Ro 09-1227 than cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone, and ceftazidime. Haemophilus influenzae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 0.5 micrograms/ml), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC90, 0.015 micrograms/ml), and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) were also Ro 09-1227 susceptible. Ro 09-1227 activity against important gram-positive cocci was most comparable to that of ceftazidime. Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, greater than 32 micrograms/ml) and the enterococci (MIC90, greater than 32 micrograms/ml) were resistant to Ro 09-1227. These in vitro results indicate that this catechol-substituted cephalosporin may be useful as an empiric agent, especially for some isolates resistant to currently available broad-spectrum cephalosporins.
TI  - Opsonization of middle ear bacteria during chronic suppurative and secretory otitis media.
AB  - Samples of middle ear effusion were obtained from 16 patients with chronic suppurative otitis media (COM) (20 ears, age range from 1 1/12 to 69 years) and 13 patients with secretory otitis media (SOM) (15 years, age range from 8 months to 13 8/12 years). Qualitative and quantitative bacteriological analyses of the effusions were performed and the intensity of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and complement component C3b adhering to the bacteria was estimated using immunofluorescence technique. In COM effusions, S. aureus in particular was intensely opsonized, whereas Ps. aeruginosa showed minimal, if any, coating with IgG and C3b. SOM effusions exhibited extremely sparse IgG- and C3b-coated bacteria. The difference in IgG and C3b coated bacteria between COM and SOM effusions was significant (p less than 0.01). Specific (IgG) as well as non-specific (C3b) coating of the bacteria that have gained access to the middle ear cavity is of importance for the host defence.
TI  - [Infectious agents associated with exacerbations of chronic obstructive bronchopneumopathies and asthma attacks].
AB  - Infections of the respiratory airways are frequently responsible for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and attacks of asthma. However, the causal infectious agents in practice are rarely precisely identified. We have undertaken a prospective study with the aim of researching into the bacteria and viruses associated with these exacerbations. Forty-seven patients who were in hospital between 1987 and 1989 for attacks of asthma (13 episodes) or exacerbations of COPD (35 episodes) were included in this study. The microbiological analysis consisted of: 1) the bacteriology of expectorated material or the products aspirated by fibroscopy with direct examination, quantitative cytology and culture; 2) samples taken from the nasal airways to identify and isolate pneumotropic viruses and mycoplasma; 3) serial serology looking for antibodies against pneumotropic bacteria and viruses. One of more infectious agents were shown in 47% of the episode studies of which 57% were exacerbations of COPD and treated 23% attacks of asthma. In the cases COPD bacteria were identified in 13 cases including Haemophilus influenzae [3], Streptococcus pneumoniae [3], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [3]. Amongst the 14 viruses recovered, the influenza virus [8] and the respiratory syncytial virus (VRS) [4] predominated. In 14 cases of acute asthma only 4 infectious agents were shown; Mycoplasma pneumoniae, influenza A, VRS and parainfluenza virus. The influenza virus was the agent most frequently discovered (26%) during the course of exacerbation of COPD and of asthma.
TI  - Comparative activity of meropenem (SM-7338) against major respiratory pathogens and amikacin-resistant nosocomial isolates.
AB  - Meropenem, a new broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic, demonstrated excellent in  vitro activity against major respiratory pathogens including Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of meropenem for Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae isolates were frequently less than those of imipenem. For nosocomial amikacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli, meropenem had eightfold lower MIC90 values compared to imipenem against strains of Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli; it was 32-fold more active than imipenem against Proteus mirabilis isolates. Activity was similar to that of imipenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Overall, meropenem showed excellent activity against common community-acquired pathogens as well as amikacin-resistant nosocomial pathogens.
TI  - [Bacteriology of mucoviscidosis during a 5-year period].
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have studied the bacteriology of mucoviscidosis cases from 1985 to 1989. MATERIAL: A total of 336 samples from 50 patients (median age: 7 year, range: 1 day-18 years) with mucoviscidosis were studied. RESULTS: The most frequently isolated microorganisms was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (59.2%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (19%) and Haemophilus influenzae (18.4%). In patients younger than 1 year of age other different microorganisms were identified in 61.1% of cases, but S. aureus (11.1%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.5%) were also isolated. The incidence of Pseudomonas cepacia (0.6%) is low in our environment. We did not isolate any Legionella sp. strain.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BAY Y3118, a new full-spectrum fluoroquinolone.
AB  - BAY Y3118, 1-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8- chloro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity against an expanded spectrum of species including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and also anaerobes such as Bacteriodes fragilis and Clostridium perfringens. MIC90s for S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. faecalis, and S. pneumoniae clinical isolates were 0.125, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against methicillin- and/or quinolone-resistant S. aureus, MIC50 levels of BAY Y3118 were 10- to 100-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. The potency of BAY Y3118 against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae generally was equal to or 2-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin or tosufloxacin. BAY Y3118 was also highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Increasing inoculum concentrations had a minimal effect on MIC determinations. The drug was determined to be bactericidal based upon reference MBCs and time-kill curves. From the results presented here, it was concluded that this new compound surpasses other known 4-quinolones both in spectrum and activity and that its further evaluation by in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies seems warranted.
TI  - In vitro activity of temafloxacin against gram-negative bacteria: an overview.
AB  - The in vitro activities of temafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin against gram-negative bacteria are compared. The 90% minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC90s) of temafloxacin for respiratory pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis, Bordetella pertussis, and Legionella pneumophila are less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/mL. Temafloxacin is also active against bacterial agents of sexually transmitted diseases, including Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.015 micrograms/mL) and Chlamydia trachomatis (MIC90 0.25 micrograms/mL). For strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Campylobacter, Vibrio, Aeromonas, and Acinetobacter, temafloxacin is generally inhibitory at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/mL. The MIC90 of temafloxacin for Pseudomonas aeruginosa is higher than that of ciprofloxacin, approximately 4 micrograms/mL versus 0.5 micrograms/mL. This activity, combined with its pharmacokinetic characteristics, should make temafloxacin an effective antimicrobial agent against infections caused by gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents, 1989. A study mainly focused on imipenem. The Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibilities of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1989. The susceptibility testing was carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: (+++), (++), (+) and (-). IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Bacteroides fragilis and had rather strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Achromobacter xylosoxidans, but was less active to Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Xanthomonas maltophilia. IPM has been found to have activities superior to those of other antibiotics tested against E. faecalis, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis. No antibiotics tested showed good activities against MRSA except minocycline.
TI  - [The study on bacterial infection in chronic lower respiratory tract infection--from the viewpoints of acute and chronic infection].
AB  - Using mainly changes in the amount of sputum as an index of the infectious course of chronic lower respiratory tract infection associated with purulent sputum over years, the disease was divided into stable and acute exacerbated phases and a bacteriological investigation using transtracheal aspiration (TTA) conducted. TTA was performed 107 and 45 episodes during stable phases and acute exacerbated phases respectively. Monomicrobial and polymicrobial infection were detected most frequently during the stable and acute exacerbated phases respectively (p less than 0.01). During the stable phases, the single organisms detected most frequently were H. influenzae (26 episodes) and P. aeruginosa (20 episodes), while in the cases in which multiple organisms were detected during stable phases, combination including H. influenzae were most common (19 episodes). H. influenzae was the most frequently detected organism in cases showing single organisms during acute exacerbated phases (7 episodes). In the cases in which multiple organisms were detected as well, H. influenzae was the most commonly detected organism assumed to predispose to exacerbation (7 episodes), while P. aeruginosa was not found. These results suggest that in chronic lower respiratory tract infection. H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa are important as persistent infective organisms, while H. influenzae are important in acute exacerbation.
TI  - Histidine decarboxylases from bacteria that colonise the human respiratory tract.
AB  - We investigated whether production of histamine by bacteria isolated from sputum  of patients with infective lung diseases could be attributed to the presence of histidine decarboxylase (HD). Twenty gram-positive and 20 gram-negative organisms were studied for their ability to decarboxylate 14C-histidine in vitro over the pH range 4.5-7.5. Of the bacteria investigated, lysates from the gram-negative species Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa liberated 14CO2 and histamine from 14C-histidine in the presence of the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate. In contrast, results obtained in the absence of cofactor were similar to those of negative (lysate-free) controls suggesting that the HD enzymes of these species resembled those previously described in other gram-negative bacteria. No HD activity was detected over this pH range in lysates from gram-positive species. This finding correlated with earlier observations that these gram-positive organisms did not produce histamine in vitro.
TI  - Clinical results of a multicenter study with sulbactam/ampicillin for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory and urinary tract infections.
AB  - A total of 124 patients with lower respiratory tract (44) or urinary tract infections (80) were enrolled in an open, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam/ampicillin, administered at the dosage of 3 g/die by intramuscular route. Pretreatment pathogens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections included: Streptococcus alpha-haemolyticus in 8 cases, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus in 2 cases, Staphylococcus albus in 7 cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases, Staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, Klebsiella oxytoca in 5 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 cases, Escherichia coli in 2 cases; in one subject (2.75%), no microorganisms were isolated. In vitro, 36 isolates (84%) were sensitive to SA and 7 (16%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, all the causative pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated. In patients with urinary tract infections, pretreatment pathogens were: E. coli in 40 cases, S. albus in 16 cases, Proteus mirabilis in 8 cases, Enterobacter agglomerans in 6 cases, Proteus vulgaris in 3 cases, Streptococcus faecalis in 3 cases, Streptococcus liquefaciens in 2 cases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases. In vitro, 64 isolates (80%) were sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 (20%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, 63 out of the 64 pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated; in one case the therapy was interrupted due to adverse effect. Clinical efficacy: in subjects with lower respiratory tract infections, sulbactam/ampicillin cured 32 patients (72.72%) and ameliorated the clinical status of 8 patients (18.18%); efficacy rate: 90.9%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Antibiotic treatment of cystic fibrosis].
AB  - Lower respiratory tract superinfection is nearly constant in cystic fibrosis and  has a significant impact on mortality. The three organisms which most often colonize the bronchial tree are Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The latter organism is found in 70% to 90% of older cystic fibrosis patients. P. aeruginosa infections are remarkably persistent and cause severe, extensive lung damage. Antimicrobial therapy is indicated in patients with clinical symptoms (fever, weight loss, changes in sputum and auscultation) and should be selected on the basis of cytobacteriologic studies of sputum. Oral antibiotics are usually successful in eradicating S. aureus and H. influenzae. Conversely, intravenous therapy is required in most cases of P. aeruginosa infection. Fifteen-day courses are given repeatedly, either on a routine basis every three months, or whenever new clinical symptoms develop. Antimicrobials usually fail to eradicate P. aeruginosa even when significant clinical improvement occurs. Two-drug therapy and judicious use of the various available anti-microbial agents should delay development of resistant strains, an event which is nearly inevitable as antimicrobial treatments are repeated.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
AB  - Tazobactam (YTR 830), a new beta-lactamase inhibitor, was evaluated for its effect in combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum, but beta-lactamase sensitive, penicillin, against 14 common bacteria. A total of 1,086 clinical isolates from different clinical specimens were tested for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. Their susceptibilities to piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam in a ratio of 8:1 by the agar dilution method were evaluated. The percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 14.5% to 100% in these tested species. In general, the beta-lactamase producers were more resistant to piperacillin than the beta-lactamase nonproducers with higher minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). For the beta-lactamase producers, tazobactam decreased the MICs of piperacillin prominently in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Salmonella species and Bacteroides fragilis, with a 4-fold or greater decrease in MIC50, MIC90 and the geometric mean of MIC. For Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MICs did not change after adding tazobactam. For other species, there was a moderate decrease in MICs. We conclude that tazobactam is an effective beta-lactamase inhibitor for increasing the antimicrobial activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase producing strains of many species of bacteria.
TI  - Historic aspects of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy.
AB  - The earliest preparations of immunoglobulins (Ig) decreased the susceptibility of agammaglobulinemic patients to infections caused by pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae, meningococci, streptococci, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Intramuscular administration of such preparations was painful and traumatic, especially for children. Ethanol-fractionated Ig could not be administered intravenously (IV) because the IgG molecules tended to aggregate and thus were more likely to produce anaphylactoid reactions. New Ig preparations, isolated at low pH (e.g., pH 4) in the presence of traces of pepsin to inhibit reaggregation, were well tolerated when administered IV. Thus a new era of treatment and prophylaxis of disease using IV Ig (IVIG) was launched. The IVIG preparations revolutionized the management of virtually all immunodeficiency syndromes characterized by failure of antibody responses. Amelioration of antibody deficiency secondary to certain chronic diseases or surgical trauma can be achieved with these preparations. Newer uses of IVIG include treatment of some autoimmune diseases; in some conditions, the beneficial influences may be attributable to antiidiotype antibodies present in the IVIG. Another likely explanation is that IVIG inhibits damage to cells and tissues by antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity or blocks phagocytosis that is facilitated by Fc receptor mechanisms. The value of IVIG in preventing infection in patients undergoing bone marrow or organ transplantation and in the treatment and prophylaxis of life-threatening infections in neonates and premature infants also is reviewed.
TI  - Microbiology of chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  - To better understand the factors involved in chronic sinusitis in childhood, we cultured the sinuses, middle meatus, and nasopharynx in 39 children requiring surgical intervention. Sixty-nine percent of these patients had other medical problems, including asthma (49%) and immunologic compromise (18%). We cultured coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 18 patients, Streptococcus viridans in 14 patients, normal flora in 10 patients, Staphylococcus aureus in nine patients, group D streptococcus in five patients, Corynebacterium in five patients, Haemophilus influenzae in three patients, Neisseria in three patients, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces, and an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus in one patient each. Cultures yielded no growth in nine patients. A strong association between cultures of the middle meatus obtained ipsilaterally and cultures of the maxillary (83%) and ethmoid sinuses (80%) occurred. A poor correlation was found between cultures of the nasopharynx and maxillary (45%) and ethmoid sinuses (49%). All seven patients who had both maxillary and ethmoid sinus cultures showed the same organisms in both sinuses. Only 41% of organisms were found on both sides when procedures were performed bilaterally. Cultures of the middle meatus appear to be sensitive and specific for organisms within sinuses. The presence of predominantly nonvirulent organisms in low titers suggests that additional factors other than bacterial overgrowth contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis in children.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of ofloxacin against recent isolates from patients with community-acquired infections].
AB  - In order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (OFLX) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. The following conclusions were reached. 1. Comparison of the MIC distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of OFLX-resistant isolates with the passage of time of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella ssp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Most common elevations of MIC values against these bacteria were observed in MIC80 and MIC90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in MIC50 values. However, MIC50's of OFLX against Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. Most of the OFLX-resistant strains of S. aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (MRSA). Furthermore, MIC80 of OFLX against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. Susceptibility of Streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. The results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. Bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of OFLX-resistant strains even in 1990 were Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Campylobacter spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. 4. Recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of OFLX-resistant strains among many bacteria. However, the bacteria which contained high percentages of OFLX-resistant strains except for MRSA were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of MIC values were only observed in MIC80 and MIC90. These results suggested that OFLX preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.
TI  - In vitro activity evaluations of cefdinir (FK482, CI-983, and PD134393). A novel  orally administered cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefdinir, a so-called third-generation oral cephalosporin was tested in vitro against over 700 pathogens from patients with bacteremia. Cefdinir was very active against the Enterobacteriaceae with a 50% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC50) value range of less than or equal to 0.03-8 micrograms/ml. The enteric species having the highest MIC90S (greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml) were Citrobacter freundii, and the enterobacters, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens. Cefdinir was generally two- to fourfold less active than cefixime, but markedly more potent with a wider spectrum compared with older oral cephalosporins, cefaclor or cefuroxime. In contrast to cefixime, cefdinir inhibited Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 1 micrograms/ml) and other staphylococci. Pneumococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and pathogenic Neisseria spp. (MIC90S, 0.12-0.5 micrograms/ml) were cefdinir susceptible, but Pseudomonas aeruginosa, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and Bacteroides fragilis gr. strains were resistant. Cefdinir was generally bactericidal with a minimal inoculum effect at 10(6) colony-forming units per spot. Cefdinir beta-lactamase hydrolysis by some recently described extended broad spectrum beta-lactamases was suspected. Cefdinir exhibited a wide, balanced spectrum for an oral cephalosporin indicating possible clinical use against susceptible pathogens in respiratory tract, urinary tract, genital and cutaneous infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of a new cephalosporin ME-1206 compared with other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ME-1206, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin that can be  orally absorbed when converted to an ester, was compared with that of other beta-lactams. ME-1206 inhibited 50% of the Enterobacteriaceae at 2 micrograms/ml, similar to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefixime. It did not inhibit, MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml, Enterobacter species or Citrobacter freundii resistant to cefotaxime and ceftazidime, and it was less active than cefotaxime and ceftazidime against Serratia marcescens. Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Moraxella catarrhalis were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml of ME-1206 inhibited hemolytic streptococci groups A, B, C, and G, MIC90 0.06 micrograms/ml, but it did not inhibit enterococci. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonads were resistant to ME-1206. MICs and MBCs of ME-1206 for susceptible species were within a dilution. ME-1206 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1 or TEM-2, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and TEM-5. ME-1206 was hydrolyzed by beta-lactamases of Morganella, Proteus vulgaris, and K1 of Klebsiella oxytoca, but minimally by the P99 beta-lactamase of Enterobacter cloacae. ME-1206 is comparable in in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability to many of the current cephalosporins.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of ME1207, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - ME1207 is the prodrug of ME1206. Its in vitro antibacterial activity was compared with that of cefteram, cefpodoxime, cefixime, and cefaclor against various clinical isolates. ME1206 was more active than the other cephems tested against staphylococci, streptococci, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Flavobacterium meningosepticum and had the most potent activity against Haemophilus influenzae and Neiserria gonorrhoeae. The drug also showed a wide spectrum of activity against other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, except methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Alcaligenes xylosoxydans.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefpiramide to fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In the subjects of 835 strains of 37 clinically isolated microbial strains, which were separated and identified among materials collected from patients with various infections and which were sent from medical therapeutic institutions throughout Japan in 1990, for the purpose of examining the antimicrobial activity of cefpiramide (CPM), its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), together with those of other cephem antibiotics, was determined, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. Microbial strains in which no CPM-resistant strains emerged were Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Anaerobic Gram-positive cocci. 2. In comparison with reports by many researchers at the former half of the 1980s, microbial stains suggesting an increase in resistance to CPM were Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Haemophilus influenzae, but also in other microbial strains the resistance to CPM was observed in high ratios. 3. Among strains used in the test, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, cephamycin and oxime type cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli of Enterobacteriaceae, and new quinolone-resistant microbes were observed in high ratios; therefore, it was considered that CPM could not exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these strains because of many resistant strains being complicated among these "CPM-resistant strains". 4. It was discussed that "the resistance mechanism observed throughout beta-lactam drugs as a while and the study themes in the dimension including social circumstances where resistant strains emerged", as pointed out by the authors in 1989, increased the significance of these days in the evaluation of timecourse changes in microbes resistant to specific drugs including CPM. 5. There are many unfavorable conditions in the antimicrobial activities of CPM to clinically isolated strains in recent years. However, it was jointly confirmed that CPM maintained effective antimicrobial activities to the majority of clinically isolated strains. Furthermore, when it was additionally considered that CPM was one of not many cephem drugs having persistent blood levels, a conclusion was drawn that CPM was one of clincally useful cephem drugs even at present.
TI  - [Bacteriological study on fosfomycin against organisms clinically isolated from paranasal sinusitis].
AB  - Multi-center bacteriological and clinical studies on fosfomycin (FOM) nasal solution were performed in subjects with paranasal sinusitis from January, 1988 to May, 1990. In these studies, we were exclusively responsible for bacterial isolation from clinical sources, bacterial identification and the determination of drug susceptibility. Before local administration of FOM nasal solution, many strains of various bacterial species were isolated from sources totalling 396 cases involved in phase II clinical studies, dose-finding and open clinical studies. From antibacterial activities of FOM against those isolates, we obtained the following conclusions. 1. Among the 447 isolates, Streptococcus spp. occupied 25.7%, Staphylococcus spp. 21.7% and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci (GPC) 13.6%, showing high detection frequency of aerobic and anaerobic GPC. Next to these, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp. and Branhamella catarrhalis also were often obtained. 2. After exclusion of possibly contaminating strains which might have entered into cultures at samplings or transfers, the MIC50 and the MIC80 of FOM against the remaining 354 isolates were determined to be 12.5 and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively, indicating that local use of FOM would be fully effective to eradicate most of the bacteria. 3. FOM nasal solution showed sufficient eradication efficacy against most clinical isolates of possible causative organisms of paranasal sinusitis, and appeared to be useful as a topical preparation for the treatment of this disease.
TI  - Early bacteriologic, immunologic, and clinical courses of young infants with cystic fibrosis identified by neonatal screening.
AB  - To understand better the events associated with the initiation of lung disease in young children with cystic fibrosis (CF), we prospectively performed a longitudinal study examining the early bacteriologic, immunologic, and clinical courses of 42 children with CF diagnosed after identification by neonatal screening. Serial evaluations included history and physical examination, chest radiographs, throat cultures for bacteria, and determinations of serum immunoglobulin levels and circulating immune complexes. At a mean follow-up age of 27 months, 19% of the children had serial throat cultures positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; the first positive culture was found at a mean age of 21 months. In three infants the initial P. aeruginosa isolates were mucoid. As determined by typing with a DNA probe, serial P. aeruginosa isolates from each patient were identical over time but were genetically distinct from isolates recovered from other patients. Of 11 infants with P. aeruginosa, nine (82%) had previous isolates of Staphylococcus aureus or Haemophilus influenzae; all had received prior antibiotic therapy. In comparison with other infants with CF, children with P. aeruginosa grown on serial throat cultures more frequently had daily cough (p less than 0.01), lower chest radiograph scores (p less than 0.05), and elevated levels of circulating immune complexes (p less than 0.01). None of the study infants had persistent hypogammaglobulinemia or hypergammaglobulinemia. We conclude that (1) S. aureus and H. influenzae remain the isolates most frequently recovered from infants with CF; (2) initial recovery of P. aeruginosa by throat culture is often preceded by the onset of chronic respiratory signs; (3) elevations of circulating immune complexes can occur early, often after the initial recovery of P. aeruginosa; and (4) early P. aeruginosa isolates are genetically distinct, demonstrating the lack of cross-colonization in this newborn population.
TI  - In-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of SR 44337, a new long acting cephalosporin.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of SR 44337 was compared with that of other broad-spectrum  parenteral cephalosporins, plus imipenem and co-amoxiclav. SR 44337 showed good activity against the Enterobacteriaceae, with MIC90s of less than 0.5 mg/L against all species tested, with the exception of Citrobacter spp. (MIC90 2 mg/L) and Serratia spp. (MIC90 4 mg/L). Of the agents tested, only ceftriaxone showed consistently greater activity against this family of organisms. SR 44337 had higher activity than ceftriaxone against Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and was the most active agent tested against Neisseria meningitidis (MIC90 0.004 mg/L). All strains of N. gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae and the streptococci (excluding the enterococci) were susceptible to less than or equal to 0.25 mg/L of SR 44337, which was also the most active cephalosporin tested against Staphylococcus aureus. SR 44337 was stable to hydrolysis by the TEM-1, SHV-1 and P99 beta-lactamases, and was more stable than ceftriaxone to the K-1 beta-lactamase.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of sparfloxacin (AT-4140, CI-978, PD 131501) compared with numerous other quinolone compounds.
AB  - Sparfloxacin (AT-4140, CI-978, PD 131501) was tested against over 800 recent bacteremic strains and compared with ciprofloxacin and six other fluoroquinolones. The 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) ranges for the Enterobacteriaceae species were (a) sparfloxacin, 0.03-1 microgram/ml and (b) ciprofloxacin, 0.015-0.25 microgram/ml. Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were very susceptible to sparfloxacin (MIC90s, 0.004- less than or equal to 0.03 microgram/ml) and the other comparison drugs. Staphylococcus aureas and other staphylococci were generally susceptible to the tested fluoroquinolones but very susceptible to sparfloxacin and WIN 57273. All beta-hemolytic streptococci, enterococci, and pneumococci had sparfloxacin MICs of less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. Sparfloxacin was quite active against anaerobic bacteria including Bacteroides fragilis gr. and Gram-positive strains (MIC90s, less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml). The most resistant enteric bacilli were among Serratia marcescens and the Proteae, especially the Providencia spp. (two- to eightfold higher MICs). Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were also susceptible to sparfloxacin (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml). Magnesium ions, CO2 incubation, and low pH had some adverse effect on sparfloxacin MICs, and resistance development was documented among current clinical isolates of staphylococci, pseudomonas, and some enteric species.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of E-1040, a novel thiadiazolyl cephalosporin compared with other parenteral cephems.
AB  - E-1040, a new parenteral fourth-generation cephalosporin, was tested against greater than 600 bacteremic pathogens and compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefpirome. E-1040 activity against Staphylococcus aureus was comparable (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml) to ceftazidime, but inferior to cefotaxime (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml) and cefpirome (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml). beta-Hemolytic streptococci and most Gram-positive anaerobes were also susceptible to E-1040. Some strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci, all oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp., enterococci, and Bacteroides fragilis group strains were resistant to E-1040 (MIC90, greater than 64 micrograms/ml). Comparative tests for E-1040 and the three other cephalosporins against pseudomonads and nonenteric Gram-negative bacilli showed E-1040 to be generally most active. The E-1040 MIC90 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1 microgram/ml and for ceftazidime it was 4 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria spp. has E-1040 MIC90s ranging from 0.12 to 2 micrograms/ml. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, strains resistant to penicillin, did not have markedly elevated E-1040 MICs compared with penicillin-susceptible strains. Enterobacteriaceae species had all MICs of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for E-1040 and cefpirome, indicating activity against strains producing stably derepressed beta-lactamases. E-1040 appeared to be beta-lactamase stable, little influenced by testing systems or media, and was bactericidal. E-1040 seems to have promise as a parenteral beta-lactam for use on strains resistant to "third-generation" cephalosporins and other families of drugs such as aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1988)].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from respiratory infectious diseases were collected in cooperation with institutions located throughout Japan, since 1981, and Ikemoto et al. have been examining sensitivities of the isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, relationships between the isolates and the backgrounds of the patients and so forth each year. We report here the research results for the year 1988. In 18 institutions around the entire Japan from October 1988 to September 1989, 554 strains of bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 439 patients with respiratory infectious diseases and assumed to be the etiologic bacteria. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics against 68 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 102 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 120 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 86 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 65 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 18 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and so forth, were determined, and the drug sensitivities of these strains were examined except for the strains which died during transportation. The drug sensitivities of the main strains were almost the same as those determined last year for each drug. However, S. aureus strains for which MICs of methicillin were higher than 12.5 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) accounted for 38.2%, and the frequency of drug resistant bacteria increased over last year's 18.2%. Also, we examined changes in the backgrounds of patients, the infectious diseases, and the etiologic bacteria and so forth. As to patient backgrounds, there were many infectious diseases found in a high age bracket, and the patients over age 60 accounted for 57.2% of the diseases. In the distribution by disease, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for greatest numbers of cases 32.1% and 31.4%, respectively, followed by bronchiectasis and bronchial asthma. As for frequencies of etiologic bacteria by disease, S. aureus (22.5%) and S. pneumoniae (15.4%) in pneumonia, S. pneumoniae (25.7%) and H. influenzae (24.1%) in chronic bronchitis, H. influenzae (32.5%) and P. aeruginosa (23.8%) in bronchiectasis, and H. influenzae (31.4%), S. pneumoniae and B. catarrhalis (20.0%) in bronchial asthma were the most frequent. Regarding effects of administration of antibiotics and isolates obtained on each day after infection, those bacteria which were isolated before antibiotic administration and which decreased after administration included S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and B. catarrhalis. Frequencies of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, however, increased after antibiotic administration. Also, when dosing continued for more than 15 days, the frequency of P. aeruginosa increased rapidly.
TI  - Secretory IgA- and IgG-coated bacteria in chronically discharging ears.
AB  - SIgA- and IgG-coated bacteria obtained from 17 discharging middle ears (14 patients, 9 male, 5 female, age range from 1 to 79 years) were evaluated using an immunofluorescence assay. Simultaneously, quantitative and qualitative bacteriological analyses of the middle ear effusions (MEEs) were performed. MEEs containing Staphylococcus aureus harboured bacteria which were intensely coated with both SIgA and IgG antibodies. In contrast, MEEs containing Pseudomonas aeruginosa displayed minimal, if any, SIgA- and IgG-coated bacteria. Two young patients harboured bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae and S. aureus/Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively) which were heavily coated with IgG, but not with SIgA. Immunoglobulin-coating of bacteria involved in otitis media is of the utmost importance in eradication of the infection.
TI  - Enzymatically deacylated Neisseria lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inhibits murine splenocyte mitogenesis induced by LPS.
AB  - Acyloxyacyl hydrolase is a leukocyte enzyme that selectively removes the secondary acyl chains from the lipid A moiety of gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). As predicted by the reported contribution of secondary acyl chains to the bioactivities of lipid A analogs, enzymatic deacylation of Salmonella typhimurium Rc LPS substantially reduces its potency in the dermal Shwartzman reaction and in several in vitro assays that measure responses of human endothelial cells and neutrophils, whereas the potency of this LPS for inducing murine splenocyte mitogenesis is affected much less. In the experiments described here, we studied the impact of acyloxyacyl hydrolysis on the bioactivities of several LPS that differ from Salmonella LPS in carbohydrate and lipid A structures. Deacylated LPS from Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and S. typhimurium were similarly reduced in potency in the Limulus lysate test (30- to 60-fold reduction in potency relative to the corresponding mock-treated LPS), and the ability of all of these deacylated LPS to stimulate neutrophil adherence to human endothelial cells was reduced by a factor of 100 or more. For LPS from E. coli, H. influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the impact of deacylation on spleen cell mitogenesis was also similar to that observed for S. typhimurium LPS: deacylation reduced potency by less than 15-fold. Unexpectedly, the potency of Neisseria LPS in the murine splenocyte mitogenicity test was reduced over 100-fold by deacylation, and deacylated Neisseria LPS could block the mitogenic activity of Neisseria and Salmonella LPS. These studies indicate that the contribution of secondary acyl chains to the bioactivities of a given LPS cannot be predicted with confidence from the reported structure-activity relationships of lipid A or from the behavior of other deacylated LPS.
TI  - Antimicrobial treatment of otitis media.
AB  - The major pathogens causing acute otitis media (AOM) are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, with Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus less frequently isolated. The same organisms and Staphylococcus epidermidis are found in chronic otitis media with effusion. In chronic suppurative otitis media, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S aureus are most frequently found. Antimicrobial agents found to be most effective in treating AOM are amoxicillin, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, erythromycin-sulfisoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and cefaclor. Cefuroxime axetil and cefixime are alternatives for which there are less data. Currently, about 20% of AOM cases are caused by beta-lactamase-producing strains (usually H influenzae or M catarrhalis) that are resistant to amoxicillin, thus favoring the use of the other agents listed. Concentrations of antibiotics in middle ear infections range from 10% to 76% of peak serum levels for the listed agents and are higher in AOM than in chronic otitis media with effusion, emphasizing the importance of adequate dosing for successful treatment.
TI  - In-vitro activity of WIN 57273 compared to the activity of other fluoroquinolones and two beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - WIN 57273, a new fluoroquinolone, was four to 128-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria. The MIC90 for Staphylococcus aureus was 0.015 mg/l and for S. epidermidis, 0.03 mg/l. All Lancefield group A, B, C, & G streptococci, Streptococcus bovis and S. pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l compared to 0.5 mg/l for tosufloxacin and 2 mg/l for ciprofloxacin. For anaerobic bacteria WIN 57273 had an MIC90 for bacteroides of 1 mg/l, and for Clostridium spp. 0.015.mg/l. WIN 57273 was less active than ciprofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae, with an MIC90 of 1 mg/l, including aminoglycoside and cephalosporin-resistant isolates. The MIC90 of WIN 57273 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 2 mg/l, compared to 0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin. Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Legionella spp. were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l. WIN 57273 was more active against Gram-negative bacteria at acid pH, but activity was decreased by magnesium ions and an increase in inoculum. Resistant strains were selected after passage on antibiotic-containing agar.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of the fluoroquinolones PD 117596, PD 124816, and PD 127391.
AB  - Three new aminopyrrolidine-substituted fluorocyclopropyl quinolones--PD 117596, PD 124816, and PD 127391--were tested for in vitro antibacterial activity against 349 bacterial strains, which are primarily clinical isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) in micrograms/ml required for greater than or equal to 90% of strains were 0.03-0.06 for staphylococci (26 strains); 0.06-0.25 for Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis (80); less than or equal to 0.015 for Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (42); 0.06 for Enterobacteriaceae (97); 0.125-0.25 for Acinetobacter spp. (14); 0.5 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20); 0.125-1.0 for Bacteroides fragilis (13); and 0.25-0.5 for anaerobic cocci (11). These activities were generally superior to that of ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ampicillin, penicillin G, oxacillin, cefazolin, ceftazidime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, aztreonam, piperacillin, amikacin, spectinomycin, doxycycline, erythomycin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin. The activities of the new quinolones were generally unchanged with light, 50% human serum, aerobic/anaerobic atmosphere, 5% sodium choate, cation supplementation, and 100-fold increased or decreased inoculum; as with other quinolones, potency was measurably diminished with decreasing pH (pH less than or equal to 6.0) and in 100% urine.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of lomefloxacin.
AB  - Lomefloxacin has marked activity against Gram-negative bacilli including Enterobacteriaceae, non-fermenting strains and Haemophilus influenzae with 98% of all isolates tested having MICs of 0.25 mg/l or less. Sixty-eight per cent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were sensitive to 1 mg/l with a few strains resistant to 8 or 16 mg/l. Gram-positive cocci were more resistant, particularly streptococci, where the MICs vary between 1 and 8 mg/l. Bactericidal activity was similar to inhibitory activity and the effect of increasing serum concentrations and bacterial inocula was minimal. The MIC and MBC were increased in the presence of urine, particularly at an acid pH 5. Comparative MICs showed that lomefloxacin was more active than ofloxacin and pefloxacin, similar to norfloxacin but less active than ciprofloxacin for Gram-negative bacteria but not for Gram-positive cocci. Comparative studies with sensitivity disc concentrations showed that a 5 micrograms disc was more satisfactory than the 10 micrograms disc as the zone sizes were more suitable for routine testing. Solutions of lomefloxacin showed instability in bright sunlight when 52% of activity was lost in 1 h. Similar instability was shown in impregnated discs which lost up to 40% activity in 6 h exposure. Lomefloxacin showed a wide range of activity against Gram-negative bacteria including multiresistant strains and Pseudomonas spp. Gram-positive bacteria were less susceptible, with streptococci more resistant than staphylococci. Lomefloxacin is well absorbed after oral administration giving high blood and urine concentrations and its prolonged half-life means once daily dosing in the treatment of many types of bacterial infection may be possible.
TI  - [Combined antibacterial activity of aztreonam and clindamycin against clinically  isolated strains].
AB  - It has been reported in some studies that the combination of aztreonam (AZT) and  clindamycin (CLDM) have high clinical effectiveness in the treatment of intractable infections. We, therefore, studied combined in vitro antibacterial activity of these 2 compounds using many freshly isolated strains. 1. AZT and CLDM in combination had synergistic effects on Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, which are sensitive or quasi-sensitive to CLDM, in the presence of CLDM at MIC or sub-MIC. 2. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are not sensitive to CLDM, the 2 drugs in combination showed synergistic effects on some species and additive or slightly additive effects on most species in the presence of CLDM at those concentrations which are usually maintained in blood. 3. The 2 drugs showed no antagonism.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of GR69153, a novel catechol-substituted cephalosporin.
AB  - GR69153 is a C-7 catechol cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MICs for 50% of strains tested [MIC50s], 0.008 to 0.5 micrograms/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC50, 4 micrograms/ml), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC50, 0.25 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50, 0.03 micrograms/ml), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC50, 0.03 micrograms/ml), and Acinetobacter spp. (MIC50, 2 micrograms/ml). Potent GR69153 activity was also demonstrated against Moraxella catarrhalis, pneumococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, gram-positive anaerobes, and most species of coagulase-negative staphylococci. The activity of GR69153 was generally two- to fourfold greater than that of ceftazidime. Resistance level GR69153 MICs for 90% of strains tested (greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) were found most often among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp. and Morganella morganii strains. GR69153 did not significantly inhibit enterococci, Xanthomonas maltophilia, the Bacteroides fragilis group, Corynebacterium jeikeium, or Listeria monocytogenes. GR69153 was bactericidal and was generally beta-lactamase stable, and MICs were only slightly increased by high inoculum concentrations. Activity was enhanced in an iron-deficient medium, and a modest MIC difference attributed to iron availability was noted between standard agar and broth test results. GR69153 was confirmed to be a potent, catechol-substituted cephalosporin with a spectrum slightly wider than that of ceftazidime, but it was less active than cefpirome or imipenem against some gram-positive pathogens and anaerobes.
TI  - Differentiation of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides and Haemophilus species in gram-stained direct smears.
AB  - The accuracy of examination of the Gram-stained direct smear to classify presumptively Gram-negative rods into three morphotype groups, that is, (a) Enteric bacteria, (b) Pseudomonas, and (c) Bacteroides or Haemophilus, was evaluated. Randomly selected clinical strains (4-9) each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Ps. aeruginosa, B. fragilis, and H. influenzae were used to produce peritonitis or subcutaneous abscesses in mice. A Gram-stained direct smear was prepared from exudate collected from each animal. The direct smears were examined to classify bacteria observed into one of the three morphotype groups. The percent accuracy was 82, 56, and 95, respectively, and 76 overall. The assumption was made that classification was based primarily on differences in length and width of the organisms. To test this hypothesis, we prepared scanning electron photomicrographs from each specimen of exudate and measured the lengths and widths of bacteria. Examination of the Gram-stained direct smear was more accurate for classification of enteric bacteria, H. influenzae, or B. fragilis. Electron microscopy was more accurate for classification of Ps. aeruginosa. The higher length-width radio should be helpful in recognizing Ps. aeruginosa in direct smears.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluation of Ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with high antipseudomonal activity.
AB  - Ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Streptococcus pyogenes, with MICs for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with MIC90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. Serratia marcescens was less susceptible to Ro 09-1428, with a MIC90 of 25 micrograms/ml. The most distinctive feature of Ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with MIC90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, and C. freundii were inhibited by Ro 09-1428, while those of S. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. Ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci. PBP 3 was the most sensitive target in E. coli and P. aeruginosa. The response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that Ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. In accordance with its in vitro activity, Ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. The results indicate that Ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against P. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of C. freundii and E. cloacae.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefpirome in pediatrics and a study on the penetration into cerebrospinal fluid].
AB  - Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new cephem antibiotic, was investigated for its penetration into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and its clinical efficacy against bacterial infections. 1. CSF concentrations of CPR following intravenous injection was investigated in 2 patients with purulent meningitis. In one of them, the concentrations were 2.11 micrograms/ml and 1.31 micrograms/ml on 3 and 8 days, respectively, after start of administration. In the other patient, they were 24.2 micrograms/ml, and 1.35 micrograms/ml on 2 days and 7 days after administration, respectively. 2. Antibacterial activities of CPR against clinical isolates, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, except those against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were clearly superior to those of ceftazidime. 3. Clinical efficacies evaluated in 15 patients were "excellent" in 9, "good" in 5 and "unknown" in 1. The overall efficacy rate was 93.0%. 4. Clinical efficacies were "excellent" in 1 patient with bacteremia, "excellent" in 6 and "good" in one of 7 patients with pneumonia, and "good" in both of the 2 patients with purulent meningitis. Clinical efficacies against other diseases were "excellent" or "good", in 1 patient with pyothorax, 1 patient with purulent lymphadenitis, and 2 patients with facial cellulitis. In 1 patient with biliary tract infection, the results of treatment with CPR were "unknown" due to insufficient clinical data. 5. No adverse reactions were observed except in 1 patient who showed an increase in platelet count.
TI  - Potential role of fluoroquinolones in the treatment of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - The search for new antimicrobial agents in the treatment of bacterial meningitis  is justified by a rate of mortality that currently remains unacceptably high and by the emergence of bacterial resistance. Because of their excellent in vitro activity against gram-negative organisms and good penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid, the new fluoroquinolones may have a potential role in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) infections. Although there are few reports on the use of fluoroquinolones in treatment of patients with CNS infections, experience to date indicates that pefloxacin, the most intensively studied agent, and ciprofloxacin provide effective treatment for patients with meningitis caused by susceptible pathogens. Since they cannot be used in patients whose skeletal growth is incomplete, the place of the fluoroquinolones in the treatment of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis is obviously very limited. Neisseria meningitidis is still exquisitely sensitive to penicillin G and ampicillin, and there is thus no reason to replace these agents by fluoroquinolones, except when patients are allergic to beta-lactam agents, or when parental administration is impossible. A potential use of the new fluoroquinolones would be in the treatment of meningitis due to gram-negative bacilli, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter.
TI  - Parapneumonic empyema in children: decortication hastens recovery in patients with severe pleural infections.
AB  - The medical records of 61 children 0 to 18 years of age treated for empyema complicating pneumonia from 1977 to 1989 were reviewed with attention to clinical presentation, bacteriology, treatment and outcome. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common infecting organism, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, other streptococcal species, anaerobes, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Eikenella corrodens. No organisms were recovered in 39% of patients. Twelve patients were treated successfully with antibiotics and thoracentesis alone, 23 patients underwent close tube thoracostomy and 26 required decortication. A thickened pleural "peel," scoliosis and opacification of a hemithorax on chest radiograph, as well as low pleural pH and glucose concentration, were associated with a poor response to medical management. A scoring system was developed to define the severity of pleural disease. In patients with severe pleural infections, decortication allowed more rapid defervescence (2.2 vs. 6.5 days) and earlier hospital discharge (4.4 vs. 12.4 days) than did closed tube thoracostomy (P less than 0.001).
TI  - Bacteremia during diarrhea: incidence, etiology, risk factors, and outcome.
AB  - To determine the importance of bacteremia in hospitalized patients with diarrhea  in Bangladesh, from September 1982 through August 1983 the authors obtained blood for culture from 1,824 patients who were suspected of having sepsis (44% of all admissions). Nontyphoid bacteremia occurred in 243 patients. The most common pathogens were the Enterobacteriaceae (n = 66 episodes), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 65), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non-glucose-fermenting bacilli (n = 50), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 40), and Haemophilus influenzae (n = 16). When compared with an equal number of control patients without bacteremia, bacteremic patients were significantly (p less than 0.05) more likely to be under 1 year of age (46.5% of bacteremic patients vs. 30.0% of control patients) and more often had abdominal tenderness (20.1% vs. 11.5%), hypoproteinemia (a serum protein level less than 60 g/liter) (58.9% vs. 42.9%), and a prior intravenous infusion (49.0% vs. 30.9%). The case-fatality rate was 29.7% in bacteremic patients versus 7.8% in controls (relative risk (RR) = 3.8, p less than 0.001). Factors that were associated with an increased risk of death in bacteremic patients were infection with a Gram-negative pathogen (RR = 2.48), decreased peristalsis (RR = 2.66), hypoproteinemia (RR = 3.36), hypothermia (RR = 2.54), and hypotension (RR = 2.19). Bacteremia appears to be an important link between diarrheal illness and death in Bangladesh. In children with diarrhea who are suspected of being septic, early implementation of antimicrobial therapy that is effective against the broad range of pathogens identified appears to be indicated.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its pharmacokinetics, bacteriological and clinical effects in the field of pediatrics. 1. CPR was very active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae among Gram-positive cocci. Antibacterial activities of CPR were also strong against Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa among Gram-negative rods. 2. The plasma concentration 15 minutes after a bolus intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg was 80.4 micrograms/ml, and the T 1/2 (beta) was 1.03 hours. Plasma concentrations after intravenous drip infusion over 30 minutes of 20 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg were 48.3 and 117 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, and T 1/2 (beta) for these dosage were 1.14 and 1.45 hours. 3. The urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 45.2-63.9% for CPR. 4. Clinical efficacies of CPR were excellent in 31 patients and good in 30 patients with an efficacy rate of 98.4%. In bacteriological examinations, causative organisms were eradicated with an eradication rate of 95.7%. 5. As side effects, diarrhea was observed in 5 patients and loose stool in 1 patient with an incidence of 8.2%. Abnormal values were found in some patients in clinical laboratory tests for eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and an elevation of GOT, GPT and triglyceride. These findings indicate that CPR will be useful against bacterial infections in pediatrics.
TI  - In vitro activity of a catechol-substituted cephalosporin, GR69153.
AB  - The in vitro activity of GR69153, a new catechol-substituted cephalosporin, was compared with those of ceftazidime, imipenem, meropenem, and ceftriaxone against 604 recent clinical isolates and other strains with known mechanisms of resistance. The MICs of GR69153 for 90% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested were less than 0.5 micrograms/ml, with the exceptions of those for Serratia spp. (4 micrograms/ml), Citrobacter spp. (2 micrograms/ml), and Enterobacter spp. (8 micrograms/ml). Ninety percent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to less than or equal to 1 microgram of GR69153 per ml. With the exception of methicillin-resistant strains, 90% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were susceptible to less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, and GR69153 was four- to eightfold more active than ceftazidime and ceftriaxone against these strains. Isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin susceptible) were highly susceptible (MIC for 90% of the strains, less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml). GR69153 was stable to hydrolysis by the TEM-1 and TEM-5, SHV-1 and SHV-2, and K1 beta-lactamases, but some susceptibility to hydrolysis by the TEM-3, TEM-9, and P99 enzymes was observed. The protein-binding activity of GR69153 was 74.5 to 66.8%, depending on the concentration, and serum had little effect upon activity.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of GR69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  - GR69153, a new parenteral cephalosporin, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, shigellae, and salmonellae at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml (MIC90). It had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and E-1040. Against cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens, MICs ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to GR69153, and for this organism the MIC90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the E-1040 MIC90, but most Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. GR69153 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. For Staphylococcus aureus GR69153 MICs were similar to those of ceftazidime and E-1040. Enterococci and listeriae were resistant to GR69153, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. The activity of GR69153 was not affected by serum. GR69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, and BRO-1, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-9, and morganellae. GR69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. It is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. GR69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.
TI  - Microbiological studies of decubitus ulcers in children.
AB  - Specimens from 58 children with decubitus ulcers were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Aerobic bacteria only were present in 29 (50%) ulcers, anaerobic bacteria only were recovered in 5 (9%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were present in 24 (41%). A total of 132 isolates (79 aerobes, 53 anaerobes) were recovered, an average of 2.3 isolates per specimen (1.4 aerobes, 0.9 anaerobes). The smallest number of isolates was recovered in ulcers of the skull (1.7 per site), and the highest number of isolates was found in ulcers of the buttocks (4.1 per site). The predominant isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (25 isolates), Peptostreptococcus species (22), Bacteroides fragilis group (10), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7). Forty-two of the organisms isolated from 38 (66%) patients produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. Most of the S aureus isolates were recovered from ulcers of the hand and the leg. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the ulcer predominated in the wounds next to these areas. Enteric gram-negative rods, group D streptococci, and B fragilis group predominated in ulcers of the buttocks. Group A streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, and Fusobacterium species were most frequently recovered in ulcers of the skull. The polymicrobial etiology of decubitus ulcers in hospitalized children and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomical site of the ulcer are demonstrated.
TI  - Cystic fibrosis: infection.
AB  - Recurrent and chronic pulmonary infection is still the major cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis. Although respiratory viruses are responsible for some of the acute exacerbations of the pulmonary disease, bacteria, and in some patients Aspergillus fumigatus, are the most important pathogens. Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae are the most prevalent pathogens in cystic fibrosis of childhood, whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa and in some centres also Pseudomonas cepacia predominate in older children and adult patients. The chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is peculiar, since it is predominantly an endobronchial infection in small bronchioles caused by mucoid, alginate producing strains which gradually lose most of the O-antigenic determinants of the lipopolysaccharide. Although P. aeruginosa produces a number of other toxins which may play a role initially, most if not all of the pathology is caused by immune complex mediated chronic inflammation. The bacteriological results of antipseudomonas chemotherapy are disappointing, as these bacteria are virtually never permanently eliminated. The clinical results of repeated maintenance chemotherapy every 3 months are, however, good, since it is possible to preserve lung function for years and keep the patients alive. Antiinflammatory treatment with steroids for years is used in some patients with benefit.
TI  - Open randomized controlled parallel study of ofloxacin versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment of lower respiratory tract and urinary infections.
AB  - A total of 60 patients with lower respiratory tract or urinary tract infections were enrolled in an open, randomized, controlled, parallel study comparing 300 mg ofloxacin (OFX) b.i.d. with trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole (TMP 800 mg + SMX 160 mg), 1 tablet, b.i.d. The signs and symptoms of low respiratory tract infection were cured in 12 patients (80%) of the OFX group and improved in 2 other patients (13%); at the end of therapy, the 2 germs that persisted were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Branhamella catarrhalis. Clinical cure was achieved in 13 patients (86%) in the TMP-SMX group, while 2 patients were considered as failures (14%); after therapy, the 3 organisms that persisted were 2 S. pneumoniae and 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As far as urinary tract infections are concerned clinical cure and complete eradication of bacteria were achieved in 14 patients in the OFX group (93%); the germ that persisted was Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU), but the patient was asymptomatic. In patients of the TMP-SMX group the urinary infections were cured in 11 subjects (73%); the germs that persisted were 2 E. coli and 1 Proteus mirabilis. Adverse effects were reported for 3 patients (10%) in the OFX group and 4 patients (13%) in the TMP-SMX group. The measurement of serum and intracellular (polymorphonuclear cells and lymphocytes) levels of OFX and TMP-SMX and the assessment of the host's immunocompetence ruled out the possibility of any immunotoxicological side effect.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of PD 131628, a new 1,8-naphthyridine anti-infective agent.
AB  - PD 131628 is a new aminopyrrolidine-substituted fluorocyclopropyl naphthyridine quinolone which possesses high in vitro activity against a wide spectrum of bacterial species. The MICs for greater than or equal to 90% of strains were 0.125 to 0.25 microgram/ml for staphylococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae; 0.5 micrograms/ml for S. agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis; 0.125 micrograms/ml for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp.; 0.5 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and less than or equal to 0.03 micrograms/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In these in vitro comparisons with ciprofloxacin, PD 131628 is more active against gram-positive organisms, approximately equivalent against gram-negative organisms, and, like most other quinolones, relatively inactive against gram-negative anaerobes. In most instances, the in vitro potency of PD 131628 exceeded those of widely used compounds: ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ampicillin, penicillin G, oxacillin, cefazolin, ceftazidime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, aztreonam, piperacillin, amikacin, spectinomycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin.
TI  - Acute osteomyelitis in children. Reassessment of etiologic agents and their clinical characteristics.
AB  - One hundred thirty-five children with acute osteomyelitis were identified by chart review during a 7-year period, January 1, 1980, through December 31, 1986. Bacteriologic causes were detected in 75 (55%) of the patients. Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified in 34 (25%), 16 (12%), and eight (6%) children, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus occurred in all age groups, H influenzae type b occurred only in children younger than 3 years and was the number one cause of disease in this group. Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurred exclusively in children older than 9 years. Children with H influenzae type b had clinical and laboratory findings that were almost indistinguishable from a matched group of children with osteomyelitis due to other known bacteria, although children with H influenzae type b tended to have more joint effusions (63% vs 27%), less lower extremity disease (22% vs 70%), and fewer positive cultures from bone or joint aspirates (41% vs 89%). Unlike most pediatric cases of osteomyelitis, the ones due to P aeruginosa did not represent the hematogenous route of infection; penetrating injury to the foot was present in every case. Children with P aeruginosa infections were older than 9 years (100%), predominantly male (88%), often afebrile (83%), and never bacteremic. These data provide guidelines for the initial work-up and management of osteomyelitis in children.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity pattern; experience at University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi  Arabia.
AB  - Results of sensitivity testing were discussed based on examination of 5192 isolates of the various bacteria isolated from clinical specimens from King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were sensitive to penicillin and erythromycin. The sensitivity pattern of Staphylococcus aureus was also predictable as they were fairly sensitive to both methicillin (98%) and erythromycin (96%). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (27%) showed a high level of resistance to penicillin. The resistance of Haemophilus influenzae to ampicillin and chloramphenicol was low. Brucella species was sensitive to tetracycline and rifampicin; resistance to streptomycin and cotrimoxazole was minimal being 1% and 6% respectively. The resistance of E. coli, Klebsiella species and Proteus species to second and third generation cephalosporins and amikacin was fairly low ranging from 1.3% to 3%. The gentamicin resistance for these organisms was also within the acceptable range (3%-10%). Gentamicin and amikacin resistance for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was low (2-8%). Salmonella typhi was sensitive to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and chloramphenicol. Salmonella enteritidis, Shigella species, and enteropathogenic E. coli were highly resistant to various antibiotics. Campylobacter jejuni was sensitive to gentamicin but 6% of isolates were resistant to erythromycin. Ninety six percent of Gram-negative rods except P. aeruginosa isolated from urine of patients having urinary tract infections were sensitive to amoxycillin-clavulanic acid. In addition, P. aeruginosa showed fairly low resistance to norfloxacin which is given orally to treat cystitis caused by this organism.
TI  - Microbial-host interactions in the airways in chronic respiratory infection.
AB  - The pathogenic events that take place in chronic respiratory infection highlight  the successful microbial strategy of survival by persistence, or colonization. Microorganisms implement their strategy of persistence by two principal tactics: (1) sabotage of the host's bronchial defenses (ie, direct microbe-mediated damage to the host), and (2) subversion of the host's normally protective defenses into damaging host tissue itself (ie, indirect host-mediated damage provoked by the microbe). Among the various ways in which microorganisms directly damage host defenses and facilitate their own persistence in the respiratory tract are inhibition of ciliary function, inhibition of mucociliary transport, alteration of ion transport in respiratory epithelium, stimulation of mucus production, and damage to respiratory epithelium. Patients with chronic respiratory infection suffer a vicious circle of events leading to progressive lung damage and cardio-respiratory failure. Treatments to break this circle include antimicrobial therapy to reduce microbial colonization and anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive therapy to modulate damaging host responses.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of ceftibuten against multiply-resistant microorganisms from Belgium.
AB  - To study the activity of ceftibuten, we obtained multiply-resistant isolates from approximately 20 hospitals in Belgium. Against Enterobacteriaceae, all of the tested comparative compounds were more active than cefaclor, and ceftibuten and tigemonam were the most active of the agents tested. Ceftibuten MIC50s were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml for most enteric bacilli species and 85% of strains were susceptible (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). This level of activity compared favorably to that recorded for cefaclor (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml), cefetamet (less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml), and cefteram (less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml), that is, 37%, 69%, and 59%, respectively. Ceftibuten, cefetamet, cefteram, and tigemonam were highly active against isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. None of the comparative agents were as active as cefaclor against staphylococcal isolates. Against streptococci, cefteram was the most active, and tigemonam the least active of the agents. The MIC90s of ceftibuten for strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were 2 micrograms/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. Strains of Streptococcus agalactiae were resistant to both ceftibuten and tigemonam; cefaclor and cefteram inhibited 100% of isolates of this species. Strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were consistently resistant to all of the compounds. Overall, ceftibuten exhibited potent activity against many multiply-resistant clinical isolates.
TI  - Fleroxacin combined with rifampin.
AB  - We determined the effect of the combination of rifampin and fleroxacin against Enterobacteriaceae and streptococcal species. None of the 65 isolates tested by checkerboard assay demonstrated synergy, 12% of isolates showed an additive effect; 86.7% were indifferent, and only 1 isolate showed antagonism. The mean FIC was 1.2. When using 2 and 8 micrograms/ml of rifampin, fleroxacin MICs of 285 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, staphylococci, streptococci, Bacteroides, and Clostridium were not increased, but synergy was not demonstrated. Time-kill studies against Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis failed to show increased killing when the two agents were present at one-half the MBC. The fleroxacin-rifampin interaction is one of indifference but provides coverage for species not adequately inhibited by fleroxacin.
TI  - [RU 51807 (cefpodoxime proxetil). In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of  a new orally administered active cephalosporin].
AB  - Cefpodoxime proxetil (RU 51807) is an enterally absorbed ester prodrug which is rapidly cleaved in vivo after oral administration, with release of the active free acid metabolite cefpodoxime. The in vitro antibacterial activity of the sodium salt of cefpodoxime (RU 51746) against approximately 800 clinical isolates was evaluated comparatively with other orally active beta-lactams. RU 51746 was found to be active against enterobacteria normally susceptible to third generation cephalosporins, with MIC50 values ranging from 0.02 mg/l (Providencia sp) to 5 mg/l (C. freundii). RU 51746 was also active against H. influenzae, including beta-lactamase producing strains (MIC50 0.04 mg/l), oxa-S S. aureus (2,5), beta-hemolytic streptococci (0.05) and S. pneumoniae (0.002). Oxa-R staphylococci and P. aeruginosa were resistant to RU 51746 (MIC50 greater than 40 mg/l for both organisms). The antibacterial activity of RU 51746 was bactericidal in nature and independent from test conditions. The molecule was stable to all the beta-lactamases studied, with the exception of cefuroximase (type Ic). RU 51746 exhibited no strong inhibitory effects on these enzymes, except with Enterobacter P99 (type Ia). A good correlation was found between in vivo activity of RU 51807 and in vitro activity of RU 51746. Cefpodoxime proxetil was found to be more effective than cefaclor in mice with experimental septicemia caused by various streptococci, with a DP50 ratio in the 10-100 range. This advantage was again evidenced for septicemias due to various enterobacteria. In contrast, cefaclor proved more effective in experimental staphylococcus infections. In mice with experimental pneumonia, cefpodoxime proxetil caused sharp falls in K. pneumoniae lung counts. Six days after induction of the infection, 60% of animals under cefpodoxime proxetil had sterile lungs, versus 25% of animals under amoxicillin.
TI  - Microbiology of airway disease in patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Individuals with cystic fibrosis have abbreviated life spans primarily due to chronic airway infection. A limited number of types of organisms are responsible for these infections, with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa being of primary importance. In the pre-antibiotic era, greater than 90% of deaths due to infection were caused by S. aureus and death usually occurred in the first 2 years of life. With the advent of effective antistaphylococcal therapy, life spans increased and P. aeruginosa became the pathogen of primary importance. P. aeruginosa isolates recovered from patients with cystic fibrosis have a unique phenotypic characteristic referred to as "mucoid." The mucoid phenotype is due to the production of a mucoid exopolysaccharide. A mucoid exopolysaccharide is believed to play a central role in the establishment of chronic pseudomonal lung infection in these patients. A third organism, Pseudomonas cepacia, has recently been detected in the airways of older patients with cystic fibrosis and is associated with increased mortality. The virulence of P. cepacia is not understood, but the organism is extremely refractory to antimicrobial therapy. Other bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, appear to play a secondary role in airway infection. Aspergillus fumigatus is the most important fungal agent causing allergic bronchopulmonary disease. The role of viruses has only recently been examined. At least in some patients with cystic fibrosis, respiratory syncytial virus may be important in predisposing to subsequent bacterial infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluorinated quinolone, compared with other antimicrobials.
AB  - A total of 3,144 clinical isolates from 3,011 consecutive patients were tested against lomefloxacin by the agar dilution method. They consisted of 1,380 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, 527 pseudomonads, 47 Haemophilus influenzae, 53 Acinetobacter, 42 Brucella melitensis, 903 staphylococci and 192 strains of enterococci. In vitro activity of lomefloxacin was compared with ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, beta-lactams and aminoglycosides. Over 98% of Enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to lomefloxacin with an MIC of 0.06-4.0 micrograms/ml. It also inhibited 93 and 85% clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Xanthomonas maltophilia, respectively. All isolates of Haemophilus, Brucella and Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to this fluoroquinolone. However, only 43% of the 192 strains of enterococci exhibited in vitro susceptibility. Lomefloxacin was found to be comparable to ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin in its in vitro activity, and superior to most penicillins, cephalosporins and aminoglycosides against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria except enterococci.
TI  - Ampicillin-sulbactam and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid: a comparison of their in vitro activity and review of their clinical efficacy.
AB  - Sulbactam (SB) and clavulanic acid (CA) are irreversible inhibitors of the beta-lactamases in the Richmond and Sykes classes II-VI. When combined with ampicillin and ticarcillin, SB and CA, respectively, extend the spectrum of activity of these penicillins to include some beta-lactamase-producing aerobes (Enterobacteriaceae, Hemophilus influenzae, staphylococci) and anaerobes (Bacteroides fragilis group) which would otherwise be resistant. Neither effectively inhibits the class I beta-lactamases frequently produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter, and Serratia, in part explaining the resistance observed with these organisms. Clinically, both agents were as effective as the comparative therapies in all but two of the trials reviewed. Given the current data, the decision to add these agents to the formulary should be based on hospital resistance patterns and on the cost of these antimicrobials in comparison to conventional therapies.
TI  - [Tuberculosis sequelae: secondary bacterial infections].
AB  - Bacterial infections is one of the most important complications in the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. We reported the causative microorganisms in these cases with special reference to various clinical features and presented the recommended treatment and prophylaxis against respiratory bacterial infections in the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis sequelae. In 1988 and 1989, 63 patients with tuberculosis sequela were demonstrated to have been infected with respiratory pathogenic bacteria by the quantitative sputum culture method (greater than or equal to 10(7)/ml) in Tokyo National Chest Hospital. The male/female ratio of these patients was 3.5, and their average age was 62.5 years. Causative microorganisms of the secondary infections in the patients with tuberculosis sequela were essentially similar in those with other lower respiratory tract infections, i.e., chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, diffuse panbonchiolitis, chronic pulmonary emphysema, etc. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other glucose-nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli (GNF-GNB), and glucose-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli (GF-GNB) were the major pathogenic bacteria responsible for the chronic respiratory failure and/or fatal outcome in the post-tuberculous patients. Patients with complications, including aspergillosis, atypical mycobacteriosis, bronchial asthma, and so forth, showed no specific causative microorganism for the secondary infections except frequent isolation of Haemophilus influenzae. Our clinical observations clearly demonstrated that there were differences between the causative microorganisms in patients hospitalized during 1988 to 1989 and those in patients without admission. Gram-negative bacilli, including P. aeruginosa, GNF-GNB and GF-GNB, and Staphylococcus aureus were predominant in hospitalized patients. On the contrary, Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis were major pathogenic bacteria in patients without hospitalization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Survey on clinical isolates from 13 hospitals in Akita Prefecture--changes in frequency and susceptibility of isolates by scale of hospital. Survey Group for Clinical Isolates, Chemotherapy Research Committee of Akita Prefecture].
AB  - Isolates from various clinical materials in 13 hospitals in Akita prefecture and  their drug susceptibility were investigated by the Chemotherapy Research Committee of Akita Prefecture during the period from Dec., 1987 to Feb., 1988. The results were as follows: 1. The total number of isolates was 8,387, including Staphylococcus aureus (18.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.9%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%) and Enterococcus faecalis (6.6%). S, aureus and P. aeruginosa were detected more frequently in the larger hospitals. 2. The detection frequency of S. aureus from the sputum, throat swab and pus exudate was also very high. There was a diversity in isolates from the urine and the frequency of Escherichia coli was low. More than half of the isolates from the blood were S. epidermidis and S. aureus. Many kinds of bacteria were detected from pleural fluid and ascites, but the isolate showed no particular tendency. 3. The susceptibility of S. aureus to oxacillin were variable in hospitals, and the susceptibility to cefazolin were even lower. Low susceptibility were also seen with norfloxacin. S. aureus showed the highest susceptibility to minocycline. The susceptibility was lower for inpatients than for outpatients. P. aeruginosa showed low susceptibility to cefsulodin. The number of ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae isolates tended to decrease. Enterobacter cloacae showed a low susceptibility for cephems. Serratia marcescens showed low susceptibility to many drugs. Based on the above results, we concluded that attention should be paid to S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and Enterobacter in clinical practice.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - In-vitro activity of sparfloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial agent.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of sparfloxacin (AT-4140), a new difluorinated quinolone, was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, temafloxacin and selected members of other groups of antimicrobial agents, against 651 recent distinct clinical isolates and strains with known mechanisms of resistance. Three strains of Chlamydia trachomatis were also studied. The MICs for 90% of the Enterobacteriaceae were between 0.06 and 1 mg/l; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa the MIC90 was 2 mg/l. Sparfloxacin was 16-fold more active against Acinetobacter spp. than ciprofloxacin. For Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus, spp. and Enterococcus faecalis the MIC90 was between 0.25 and 1 mg/l; sparfloxacin was four-fold more active against Str. pneumoniae than ciprofloxacin. Ninety percent of strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis and Neisseria spp. were inhibited by less than 0.03 mg/l; for Bacteroides fragilis the MIC90 was 1 mg/l. The three strains of Chl. trachomatis were susceptible to 0.06-0.12 mg/l sparfloxacin, which was 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin. There was cross resistance among the quinolones, but not between the quinolones and other groups of antimicrobials. The protein binding of sparfloxacin was 40% and serum had little effect on its activity.
TI  - In vitro activity of tosufloxacin, a new quinolone, against respiratory pathogens derived from cystic fibrosis sputum.
AB  - By using broth microdilution methods, the in vitro activity of tosufloxacin (A-64730), a new quinolone, was compared with those of other agents, including five quinolones, against geographically diverse cystic fibrosis sputum isolates obtained from 26 cystic fibrosis centers in the United States. These included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, conventional as well as especially resistant (ceftazidime, aztreonam, gentamicin, and/or tobramycin) isolates: Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas cepacia; Staphylococcus aureus; and Haemophilus influenzae. Tosufloxacin MICs for 50 and 90% of isolates of standard P. aeruginosa were 0.5 and 2.0 mg/liter, for resistant P. aeruginosa they were 4.0 and greater than 16.0 mg/liter, for E. coli they were less than or equal to 0.016 mg/liter, for P. cepacia they were 4.0 and 8.0 mg/liter, for S. aureus they were 0.063 and 0.063 mg/liter, and for H. influenzae they were less than or equal to 0.016 and 0.032 mg/liter, respectively. Tosufloxacin activities against standard and resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were similar to those of comparative quinolones. Against E. coli, tosufloxacin activity was similar to those of other quinolones. Against S. aureus, tosufloxacin activity was similar to those of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and cephalexin, but tosufloxacin was more active than other agents. Against H. influenzae, tosufloxacin activity was similar to those of other quinolones. There was minor diminution of activity at pH 8.2 but major diminution of activity at pH 5.2 and at inoculum sizes of greater than or equal to 10(7) CFU/ml. Activity was unaffected by sputum but was enhanced by serum and by the omission of cation supplementation. Tosufloxacin has consistent activity against common cystic fibrosis pathogens. Its high degree of activity against S. aureus with activity maintained against P. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacteria of interest suggests that further in vitro studies and assessment of activity in in vivo models of cystic fibrosis pulmonary infections are warranted.
TI  - Pefloxacin therapy for nosocomial infections in the intensive care unit.
AB  - Nosocomial infections occurring in an intensive care unit (ICU) are commonly caused by aerobic Gram-negative bacilli or Staphylococcus aureus, which are frequently multi-resistant and difficult to treat and contribute significantly to the patients' morbidity in the ICU. Pefloxacin, with its wide range of antimicrobial activity, lack of serious side-effects and advantageous kinetics, is a useful drug for use in this group of critically ill patients. Pefloxacin has achieved a greater than 70% clinical cure rate and a microbiological response of over 80% in cases of nosocomial pneumonia in the ICU. Failure and superinfection has occurred with the development of resistance, particularly in Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a small number of cases, but this can be prevented by combination antimicrobial therapy. Serious side-effects, including confusion, psychiatric disturbance and other neurological abnormalities were rare and resolved on withdrawal of the drug. Drug interactions occur with cimetidine and theophylline but are usually not clinically relevant; significant interaction with warfarin occurs and the dose of warfarin needs careful adjustment. Pefloxacin is a valuable drug for use in bacteriologically proven sensitive infections and combination with aminoglycosides or beta-lactam agents should prevent the development of resistance.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new quinolone, fleroxacin, against respiratory pathogens from patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - We evaluated fleroxacin, a newer fluoroquinolone, against isolates from sputum from patients with cystic fibrosis. These isolates included rough and mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli. Selected isolates were tested by the broth microdilution method to examine the influence of various pHs, inoculum sizes, and biological fluids (serum or sputum from patients with cystic fibrosis). Fleroxacin MICs for 50 and 90% of isolates of P. aeruginosa were 2.0 and 4 micrograms/ml, those for P. cepacia were 2 and 16 micrograms/ml, those for S. aureus were 0.5 and 1 microgram/ml, those for H. influenzae were 0.06 and 0.06 micrograms/ml, and those for E. coli were 0.01 and 0.03 micrograms/ml, respectively. Fleroxacin activity against mucoid P. aeruginosa was similar to the activities of enoxacin and ofloxacin but eightfold lower than that of ciprofloxacin. It was twofold more active than norfloxacin and enoxacin but was twofold less active than ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and nafcillin against S. aureus. Fleroxacin inhibitory activity against P. cepacia was two- to fourfold lower than that of ciprofloxacin but eightfold greater than those of the other quinolones tested. Alterations in pH, diluent, and inoculum size did not significantly affect fleroxacin activity. These results, combined with available pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution data, support the need for clinical evaluation of fleroxacin in pulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis.
TI  - [Pathogenesis of bacterial respiratory infection and new approach of the treatment].
AB  - Causative agents of respiratory infections has been changed because of increase in number of aged people and compromised host and the rapid development of new chemotherapeutic agents. Especially Branhamella catarrhalis (B. catarrhalis), which is very unique and has become a common respiratory pathogen, since 1980, in my department. Attachment ability of B. catarrhalis to oropharyngeal cells coincided with the acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory infections by this bacterium and the same phenomenon in pneumococcal infections was also established. In the hospital for aged people, two major pathogens Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) are specially seen. In these patients, the two major ones were isolated from the oropharynx. Non-typable Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) is also very important in Japan like USA. Recurrent infection with this pathogen occurred due to the change of OMPs during the time period of more than one month. Complement and some amount of ceftadizim were inactivated by destroyed neutrophils in vitro. This result may explain one of the cause of intractability of P. aeruginosa infection. Monoclonal antibody against P. aeruginosa showed effectiveness in P. aeruginosa pneumonia model in mice. Intraabdominal administration of fibronectin also was effective for staphylococcal pneumonia in rat. Oropharyngeal pathogens like S. aureus, S. pneumonia, B. catarrhalis, H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa were killed by 100-500 times diluted solution of 7% povidonjod solution. Moreover the frequency of recurrence of infection by these bacteria were decreased by gargling this solution 3-4 times/day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Deacylation of structurally diverse lipopolysaccharides by human acyloxyacyl hydrolase.
AB  - Acyloxyacyl hydrolase, a leukocyte enzyme previously has been shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of secondary (acyloxyacyl-linked) fatty acyl chains from the nonreducing glucosamine of the lipid A region of rough Salmonella typhimurium lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We describe here the activity of this enzyme toward smooth S. typhimurium LPS and LPS from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Acyloxyacyl hydrolase released the secondary acyl chains from all of these lipopolysaccharides, regardless of the location of the acyloxyacyl linkage on the diglucosamine backbone or the structure of the acyl chains. The two acyloxyacyl linkages present in each LPS molecule apparently were hydrolyzed separately, so that free fatty acids released from the different sites accumulated at different rates. The purified enzyme also removed greater than 90% of the secondary acyl chains in each LPS, indicating that the enzyme acts not only on intact LPS but also on LPS molecules that have only one secondary acyl chain. The enzyme did not release the glucosamine-linked 3-hydroxyacyl chains. The specificity and versatility of the enzyme for cleaving acyloxyacyl linkages suggest that it may be a useful reagent for studying the structure and bioactivities of lipopolysaccharides with diverse carbohydrate and lipid A structures.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to estimate effective administrative dose of minocyclin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in disc susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of minocycline (MINO) against various clinical isolates, 270 strains obtained in 1988, were determined and the reliability of the MINO disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the disc tests, which is widely used in Japan, and that of a 3 category system used in the USA and Europe, were also evaluated to determine which system would be more suitable for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. In this study, MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. MIC80 values of MINO against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae were all less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml. Those against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were 0.39, 6.25, 3.13, 25, 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. MIC80 values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp. were 50, 100, 50 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. The inhibition zones obtained with the disc method were compared with MICs. The results of MINO disc susceptibility test either with 200 micrograms disc (Showa) or 30 micrograms disc (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method in estimating approximate values of MICs. In the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in MIC values proposed are ( ) MIC less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 2-10 micrograms/ml, (+) greater than 10-50 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 50 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs showed false positive in 26.6% and 20.5% of the samples, and false negative in 5.8% and 23.6% of the samples, respectively. The disc results of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, etc. were relatively well classified, but those of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Proteus spp. were not, showing more false positive results. Changing the lower 2 MIC break points in the 4 category system to: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, the false positive results with both 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs were reduced to 12% and 6.2%, respectively. The false negative results were 5.8% and 23.6%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (IV). Antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in the Tohoku District of Japan].
AB  - We determined the MICs of ampicillin, methicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefteram,  ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against a total of 1,448 strains from 11 species: 464 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 306 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 114 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 37 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 329 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 32 strains of Escherichia coli, 66 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 26 strains of Enterobacter cloacae, 20 strains of Serratia marcescens, 12 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 42 strains of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, isolated from the throat swab and the sputum of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections who visited 21 private clinics in Tohoku district of Japan during the period from January to April in 1989. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were more active against S. aureus, B. catarrhalis, P. aeruginosa and A. calcoaceticus than other antibiotics. Ampicillin and cefteram were more active against S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes than other antibiotics. New-quinolones and cephems of new-generation were active against H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and S. marcescens. Of 30 strains of S. aureus which were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin, only one strain was resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to methicillin. Twenty strains (6.5%) of S. pneumoniae and 49 strains (14.9%) of H. influenzae were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin. Of 101 strains of H. influenzae of which their beta-lactamase activity was determined by Nitrocephin-method, 27 (26.7%) were beta-lactamase-positive strains. The above results indicated that MRSA is only rarely found in primary care clinics but the incidence of ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae in primary care clinics is almost the same as that of the intensive care clinic, i.e. medical school-affiliated hospitals. Therefore caution should be exercised as regards antibiotic resistance of the causative organism even in primary care clinics.
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (III). Distribution of  bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in the Tohoku District of Japan].
AB  - The bacteriology of the isolates from the throat swab and the sputum respectively of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in Tohoku district of Japan during the period from January to April in 1989 was documented. Of the 2,539 patients, 1,694 had an acute upper respiratory infection, 609 had acute bronchitis, 46 had acute pneumonia, 84 had acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory infections and 106 had respiratory infections without diagnosis registered. 1887 (74.3%) strains of potential pathogens were recovered from 1507 (59.4%) of the 2539 cases. The rate of recovery of potential pathogens was very high in patients of the younger age. These patients had elevated body-temperature. There were statistically significant differences in recovery rate when classified by diagnosis, prefecture and the period of investigation. Of the 1,887 strains, 996 (52.8%) were gram-positive and 891 (47.2%) were gram-negative bacteria. The rate of recovery of gram-negative bacteria was high in patients who were less than 10 years old and more than 51 years old, in patients with pneumonia and chronic respiratory infections, and in patients with fever. Of the 1,887 strains, those which exceeded 100 were Staphylococcus aureus (481 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (340 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (329 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (117 strains) and Acinetobacter spp. (100 strains). Species other than those mentioned above had less than 100 strains. In this group there were 39 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 32 strains of Escherichia coli, 97 strains of Klebsiella spp., 40 strains of Enterobacter spp., 25 strains of Serratia spp., 12 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 43 strains of Pseudomonas putida. There was a remarkable difference in recovery rate of each species when classified by diagnosis, age class, prefecture and the period of investigation, respectively. The above results indicated that gram-positive bacteria are more frequent than gram-negative bacteria, that enterobacteriaceae and glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria are only rarely found in primary care clinics, and that the bacteriology in primary care clinic is different from that of medical school-affiliated hospitals.
TI  - [Norfloxacin: a broad-spectrum quinolone for superficial eye infections].
AB  - Norfloxacin is a synthetic antibiotic belonging to the fluoroquinolone class. At  present, an oral formulation is available and indicated for the treatment of urinary tract infections. Because of the properties of norfloxacin, a 0.3% norfloxacin ophtalmic solution may be used by ophtalmologists. The molecular target of norfloxacin is DNA gyrase that regulates DNA replication. Norfloxacin is a broad spectrum antibiotic. A flurin atome in position 6 is responsible for the broad spectrum of activity as compared with the first generation quinolones. MICs of norfloxacin against Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterbacteriaceae are low or intermediate. Norfloxacin is a bactericidal drug of which MBCs are equivalent to or twice as high as MICs against the majority of organisms. The proportion of norfloxacin resistant strains is limited and, at present, no plasmid resistance has been observed. This explains the activity of norfloxacin against clinical isolates whose drug resistance is plasmid-mediated. Norfloxacin resistance is chromosomic, but the mutation rate is low. There is no cross-resistance between quinolones and other classes of drug, with the exception of drug resistance related to changes in the bacterial outer membrane proteins. A low decrease in norfloxacin susceptibility is observed in case of resistance to first generation quinolones. The above-mentioned properties make norfloxacin in ophtalmic solution a first line drug for treatment of superficial ocular infections and a second line drug for treatment of infections due to organisms resistant to other drugs.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin Bay  v 3522.
AB  - The activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. Bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to MICs of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. It was more active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. Groups B, C and G streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the MI"90 for Streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most Bacteroides spp. were resistant. The MIC90 for beta-lactamase positive Escherichia coli (producing primarily TEM-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. Bay v 3522 was destroyed by TEM-1, SHV-1, TEM-3 and P99 beta-lactamases.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpirome and cefepime, two new cephalosporins.
AB  - In in vitro tests the broad-spectrum cephalosporins cefpirome and cefepime were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, although often less so against strains resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and ticarcillin-clavulanate, and against most strains of Acinetobacter spp. and Aeromonas hydrophila. They were also active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although strains with non-plasmid mediated beta-lactam resistance were sometimes less sensitive. Other Pseudomonas spp. varied in their sensitivity. Both agents were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, but beta-lactamase-producing Branhamella catarrhalis were somewhat less sensitive. Neisseria gonorrhoeae were susceptible, although non-beta-lactamase producing penicillin-resistant strains had higher MICs. Gardnerella vaginalis was also susceptible and Campylobacter coli/jejuni usually susceptible. Both antibiotics had good activity against Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci except for methicillin-resistant strains and Staphylococcus haemolyticus which were of borderline sensitivity. All streptococci were sensitive, with the exception of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci and enterococci against which cefpirome had greater activity than cefepime. Both antibiotics had little useful activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group or Bacteroides oralis group but were active against most other anaerobes. Clostridium difficile and some other Clostridium species were resistant.
TI  - [The antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolone agents against pathogenic organisms in respiratory tract infections and its clinical effect].
AB  - The efficacy rate, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), and resistance of fluoroquinolone agents against causative organisms in respiratory tract infections from January to March, 1988 were investigated. Of 333 pathogenic strains 85% consisted of 5 major causative organisms of respiratory tract infection (Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus). In 61 (59 cases) of these 333 strains, including 3 cases of acute pharyngitis, 5 of acute bronchitis, 3 of pneumonia, and 48 of chronic lower respiratory tract infection fluoroquinolone agents were administered. The efficacy rate was 76.3% in all cases, and 75% in cases with chronic lower respiratory tract infection. The fluoroquinolone agents were 100% effective in H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis, though the efficacy rate was 67% in S. aureus and 40% in P. aeruginosa. The susceptibility of all strains to fluoroquinolone agents were investigated. There was no resistant strain in H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis, though resistant strains to fluoroquinolone agents have increased in S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. The efficacy rate was investigated using the MIC of administered fluoroquinolone agent against causative organisms. It is surmised that the efficacy of that agent has an MIC of 1.56-3.13 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Temafloxacin in acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - Temafloxacin hydrochloride, a new fluoroquinolone, was given orally in doses of 300 or 600 mg twice daily for ten days to 36 patients, all hospitalized because of severe acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. Sputum cultures before, during and after treatment showed that the infection was eliminated in 12/18 evaluable patients given 300 mg and in 13/16 receiving the 600 mg doses. Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae were effectively eliminated, but only half the Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections were eradicated. MICs for most pathogens were 1 mg/l or less (including the majority of the pneumococci) but the MICs for Ps. aeruginosa ranged from 0.5 to greater than 16 mg/l, those for 10 of the 22 strains being greater than 2 mg/l. Pharmacokinetic studies on serum and sputum specimens showed serum Cmax values of 3.5 and 6.0 mg/l, the sputum Cmax being 2.35 and 4.17 mg/l after the different doses. No interaction with concomitant theophylline could be found. Two patients complained of moderate nausea or water-brash. Temafloxacin can be considered safe and effective at these dosages, but for Ps. aeruginosa infections higher dosages need to be investigated.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of six new oral cephem antibiotics.
AB  - Six newly developed oral cephem antibiotics, which included 5 with an aminothiazolyl side chain, viz., cefixime, cefotiam hexetil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefteram pivoxil, ceftibuten, and one with a conventional side chain design, BMY 28100, were tested for their antimicrobial activities. Three traditional oral beta-lactam antibiotics, ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, were used as reference antibiotics. The 5 aminothiazolyl cephems were more active than the reference drugs against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. All 6 new drugs showed poor activity against clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococci. They were better than cephalexin and cefaclor, but slightly poorer than or the same as ampicillin in activities against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Cefotiam hexetil, BMY 28100, and cefpodoxime proxetil were also more active than cephalexin against Staphylococcus aureus. Although the 6 tested new oral cephems demonstrated little difference in their activities against different bacteria, they all showed greater antimicrobial activity than the traditional oral antibiotics now in clinical use.
TI  - In vitro activity of E-1040, a 3-substituted cephalosporin, against pathogens from cystic fibrosis sputum.
AB  - On the basis of preliminary in vitro data, we evaluated E-1040, a new cephalosporin, against 188 cystic fibrosis (CF) sputum isolates obtained from 26 CF centers in the United States. These isolates included mucoid and nonmucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli. In addition to MICs measured under standard conditions, selected isolates were tested at various pH values, inoculum sizes, and diluent (CF serum and sputum) conditions. E-1040 activities (MICs for 50 and 90% of the strains) against the isolates were as follows: P. aeruginosa (mucoid and nonmucoid), 1 and 4 micrograms/ml; P. cepacia, 4 and 16 micrograms/ml; S. aureus, 8 and 8 micrograms/ml; H. influenzae, 1 and 4 micrograms/ml; and E. coli, less than or equal to 0.12 and less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml. E-1040 activity against mucoid P. aeruginosa was 4-fold greater than that of aztreonam, 16-fold greater than that of ceftazidime, and 32-fold greater than that of piperacillin. E-1040 was similar to other broad-spectrum cephalosporins against S. aureus, H. influenzae, and E. coli. Bactericidal activity was less than or equal to 1 dilution of MIC for 88% of the strains, although kinetic studies with mucoid strains of P. aeruginosa demonstrated effective killing only at eight times the MIC. Variations in pH from 5 to 8, in inoculum size from 10(3) to 10(7) CFU/ml, and in diluent (CF serum or CF sputum) did not affect E-1040 activity.
TI  - [Synergy between sulbactam and ampicillin or cefoperazone in antimicrobial activity against beta-lactamase producing microorganisms. Results with the use of microdilution broth method].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of sulbactam (SBT) with ampicillin (ABPC) or with cefoperazone (CPZ), in other words, the effects of SBT, an beta-lactamase inhibitor, against beta-lactamase producing strains of clinical isolates, were studied using microdilution broth method. 1. beta-Lactamase producing strains such as Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae decompose benzylpenicillin (PCG) which is one of substrates of the acid-metry disc method and show a strong reaction, while they do not decompose cefazolin (CEZ), another substrate, showing no or weak reaction. Thus, it is suspected that beta-lactamases produced by these organisms are mainly penicillinase (PCase). MIC-distributions of ABPC and CPZ against these clinical isolates which seemed to produce PCase shifted to lower MIC ranges with MIC's reduced to 1/4 or below when 0.025 to 0.39 microgram/ml of SBT was added. 2. It appears that beta-lactamase produced by Proteus vulgaris may be oxyiminocephalosporinase (CXase), because P. vulgaris showed strong reaction on CEZ, but moderate reaction on PCG in the acid-metry disc method. MIC-distribution of ABPC and CPZ against P. vulgaris shifted to a lower range with MIC's of 1/4 or below when 0.20 to 0.39 microgram/ml of SBT was added. 3. All the test strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed strong reaction on CEZ but only 56% of the test strains showed reaction on PCG. It appears that the beta-lactamases which showed strong reaction on CEZ is cephalosporinase and is encoded in chromosome, while those beta-lactamase that showed strong reaction on PCG is encoded in a plasmid which was acquired secondarily by P. aeruginosa. MIC-distribution of CPZ against P. aeruginosa shifted to a lower range with MIC values of 1/2 or below with the addition of SBT at 1.56 micrograms/ml. 4. It appears that the synergy of SBT with ABPC or with CPZ against the PCase or CXase producing strains may occur in the presence of SBT at a concentration far less than that reported previously.
TI  - Stability of viable-bacterium counts in liquid media used for preparation of inocula and subsequent impact on antimicrobial susceptibility test results.
AB  - We evaluated the consequences of prolonging the time between initial bacterial inoculum suspension preparation and susceptibility test inoculation. Extending the current National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-recommended time of 15 min between suspension preparation and test inoculation should allow laboratories more flexibility to optimize efficiency from the standpoint of workflow. We assessed the length of time for which viable-bacterium counts remain stable in three liquid media at room temperature. Fifty isolates were examined in water, saline, and cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broth (CSMHB). Disk diffusion and microdilution MIC tests were performed on nine of these. Our results suggest that directly prepared inoculum suspensions of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococci, and enterococci can be held for up to 6 h in water or saline prior to inoculation of disk diffusion and MIC tests without compromising test accuracy. The same organisms can be held for at least 1 h in CSMHB. Viridans group streptococci can be held for up to 6 h in saline and CSMHB and for up to 3 h in water. Similarly, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates may be held in CSMHB for up to 3 h. Because of an early decrease in viable-bacterium counts in water and saline with some H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae isolates, we recommend that National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards recommendations be followed for these species.
TI  - [A clinical study on ceftazidime in the treatment of intractable respiratory infections].
AB  - Ceftazidime (CAZ) was administered to 51 patients (37 males, 14 females) with respiratory infections including severe cases, accompanied by various underlying respiratory diseases. The clinical efficacy and side effects of CAZ were investigated. The mean age and body weight of these 51 cases were 62.6 years and 48.0 kg, respectively. CAZ was administered by intravenous drip infusion (daily dose of 2-4 g) for a mean of 14.7 days to a mean total dose of 56.7 g. Clinical efficacy rates were 64% (18 of 28 cases), 80% (16 of 20 cases) and 67% (2 of 3 cases) for airway and intermediary regional infections, pneumonia (including lung abscess) and pyothorax, respectively. In the bacteriological study, efficacy rates and bacterial eradication rates were 69% and 67%, 33% and 20%, 100% and 100%, and 100% and 100% for infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (6 cases), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6 cases) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4 cases), respectively, and bacterial eradication was achieved in both of 2 cases of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 2 cases of Haemophilus influenzae, and 1 case each of Peptococcus sp., Fusobacterium necrophorum and Serratia marcescens. Side effects observed were eruption in 1 case (2%) and elevated GOT, GPT and Al-P values in 1 case (2%), but these cases tended to recover after CAZ treatment was discontinued.
TI  - Medical management of chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma in children.
AB  - To determine whether systemic administration of antibiotics may eliminate or reduce the need for tympanomastoid surgery in chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma, we undertook a randomized, prospective study comparing three regimens: (1) daily suction and debridement, with intravenous administration of mezlocillin until 3 days after the discharge stopped, (2) daily suction and debridement, with intravenous use of ceftazidime until 3 days after the discharge stopped, and (3) daily suction and debridement without antibiotics. No topical antimicrobial agents were used during the study. Fifty-one patients were included, and 48 children completed the study. The duration of discharge from the ear before treatment was 2 to 123 months (median 20 months). In 26 patients (51%), the disease was bilateral. Aerobic cultures, obtained with the Alden-Senturia middle ear aspirator, yielded Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 98%, enteric gram-negative bacilli in 33%, staphylococci in 25%, and Haemophilus influenzae in 12%. The first 33 patients were randomly assigned to one of the three regimens. In the 21 patients treated with suction and antibiotics (either mezlocillin or ceftazidime), the discharge stopped completely, versus in only 1 (8%) of 12 patients in the suction-only regimen (p less than 0.01). Therefore the following 18 patients were randomly assigned to one of only two groups, which included the two suction-and-antibiotic regimens. In all patients treated initially with antibiotics, discharge stopped after 4 to 18 days (mean 12.0 days), but 25% needed treatment for greater than 14 days. Amoxicillin prophylaxis was administered to 27 (56%) of the patients after completion of therapy. All patients were followed for 6 months. Drainage recurred in 12 (25%) patients during the first 3 months after the study. The recurrence rate was not affected by the antibiotic regimen, the patient's age, the duration of drainage before initiation of antibiotic therapy, or prophylaxis. We conclude that intravenous wide-spectrum antibiotic therapy in conjunction with daily suction and debridement is efficacious for the treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies on norfloxacin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Bacteriological and clinical studies on norfloxacin (NFLX) were carried out in the field of pediatrics, and the results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. The MICs of NFLX against clinically isolated organisms were determined to compare with MICs of nalidixic acid, amoxicillin, cefaclor, erythromycin and fosfomycin. NFLX had low MICs against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and, particularly, showed higher antimicrobial activity to Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae and Campylobacter jejuni than any other drugs tested. 2. Seventeen pediatric patients (11 cases of enteritis, 4 cases of urinary tract infections, 1 case of tonsillitis and 1 case of pyoderma) were treated orally with NFLX in daily doses ranging from 3.1 to 16.7 mg/kg t.i.d. for 6-14 days. Rates of clinical effectiveness and bacterial elimination were 94.1% and 58.8%, respectively. 3. None of the treated children showed clinical symptoms indicating the occurrence of side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings except 1 patient with eosinophilia. These results indicate the usefulness of NFLX in the treatment of bacterial infections in the pediatric field.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of norfloxacin in children].
AB  - Oral new quinolone, norfloxacin (NFLX, AM-715), was evaluated for its safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics in children. 1. NFLX was effective in 88.0% of 25 cases infected with Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, and other bacteria. 2. After single oral administration of 50 mg and 100 mg NFLX tablet at fasting, mean peak values of serum concentration were 0.35, 0.48 microgram/ml and T1/2 values were 2.2, 2.7 hours, respectively. 3. No adverse reactions suggestive for arthropathy were encountered with NFLX therapy with daily doses of 4.6-35.7 mg/kg (maximum 600 mg per day) and duration of 3 to 19 days. From these preliminary data, NFLX seems to have a place in the treatment of pediatric infectious diseases.
TI  - [Activity of cefuroxime against bacterial strains isolated from acute otitis media].
AB  - The acute otitis media is a frequent infantile disease and, in 80% of cases, a bacterial strain can be isolated from the otorrhoea. Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the two major species isolated from auricular exudate, and represent two thirds of all isolated strains, with the others comprising Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae and corynebacteria. The treatment of this disease is based principally on beta-lactams (aminopenicillins, cephalosporins) administered by the oral route. Cefuroxime is a cephalosporin which is absorbed via the digestive tract in the form of cefuroxim-axetil. The activity of this compound was studied against 210 strains isolated from otorrhoea, collected from children who presented an acute otitis media during the first half of 1989. These strains were: 112 strains of H. influenzae, of which 23 produced a beta-lactamase; 21 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae; 3 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes; 10 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis of which 9 produced a beta-lactamase; 18 strains of S. aureus; 14 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, and 32 strains of corynebacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefuroxime-axetil was measured by dilution in agar. The MICs of cefuroxime against H. influenzae were low and similar (MIC 50 = 1 mg/l; MIC 90 = 1 mg/l) regardless of whether the strain secreted a beta-lactamase. Overall, 90% and 98% of the 210 strains tested here were inhibited by 1 and 4 mg/l of cefuroxime respectively. These results show that the antibacterial spectrum of cefuroxime-axetil appears to be ideally suited to the bacterial strains isolated from acute otitis media.
TI  - Therapeutic studies of cefepime (BMY 28142) in murine meningitis and pharmacokinetics in neonatal rats.
AB  - Cefepime (BMY 28142) was compared with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and moxalactam for efficacy in treating experimental meningitis in mice and neonatal rats. Mice were infected intracranially with Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and treated intramuscularly. Five- to eight-day-old neonatal rats were injected intracisternally with Haemophilus influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and S. agalactiae and treated intraperitoneally. Cefepime was found to be the most active compound against induced meningitis in mice infected with S. agalactiae. Cefepime was as active as cefotaxime against Staphylococcus aureus meningitis, slightly more active than cefotaxime against S. pneumoniae and E. coli, and as active as ceftazidime against K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa meningitis. Cefepime was found to be the most active compound against S. pneumoniae and S. agalactiae meningitis in neonatal rats. Against H. influenzae, cefepime was as active as moxalactam and cefotaxime. Ceftazidime was the least active compound. The pharmacokinetics of cefepime in neonatal rats were similar to those of ceftazidime. Both compounds penetrated well into cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissues of uninfected neonatal rats. Relative concentrations were twice as high as those of cefotaxime and moxalactam.
TI  - Serious pediatric infections.
AB  - Third-generation cephalosporins are important additions to the range of antibiotics available for treating children with serious bacterial infections. They are highly active against the common pathogens, which cause bacterial meningitis in children. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae type b resistant to both ampicillin and chloramphenicol, and Streptococcus pneumoniae relatively resistant to penicillin remain susceptible to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, as well as the other more common gram-negative bacilli isolated from neonates and children are susceptible to these agents. However, Listeria monocytogenes is not cephalosporin-sensitive. Ceftazidime is the only third-generation cephalosporin useful for treating serious infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in children. As with other beta-lactam antibiotics, the clearance of cephalosporins is prolonged in neonates, particularly premature babies. Cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are equivalent to ampicillin and chloramphenicol for the treatment of bacterial meningitis in children over two to three months of age with respect to neurologic outcome and safety, despite the in vitro activity of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone being much greater than the standard antibiotics for the meningeal pathogens. Cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are effective in the treatment of serious gram-negative infections in children. In many instances, ceftriaxone can be administered once daily, which allows for more convenient therapy, particularly on an outpatient basis. Although controversial, ceftazidime has been used as single-agent therapy for empiric treatment of neutropenic immunocompromised children with fever.
TI  - Length of hospital stay in veteran surgical service patients with nosocomial infections.
AB  - Four hundred ninety-nine nosocomial infections (with 657 isolates) in 288 Surgical Service patients were monitored from February 1986 to June 1987 (17 months) to determine the influence that pathogen or site of infection had on the length of hospital stay. Patients with upper respiratory and skin infections were more likely to have significantly longer length of stay than those with infections in other sites. Infections with Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more likely to yield longer culture to discharge periods than other organisms in certain settings. Extended lengths of stay were common in patients with nosocomial infections.
TI  - Effect of bacterial products on neutrophil migration in vitro.
AB  - Chronic bronchial inflammation is associated with migration of large numbers of granulocytes into the bronchial tree. A study was designed to find out whether products of bacteria commonly isolated in chronic bronchial infection stimulate neutrophil migration in vitro. Neutrophils from healthy donors were studied by a modified Boyden chamber technique. Bacterial culture filtrates stimulated neutrophil migration over a wide dilution range and the chemotactic activity was heat stable. Culture filtrates derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae were significantly chemokinetic and directionally chemotactic, whereas filtrates from Staphylococcus aureus were only chemotactic. Gel filtration of S aureus and P aeruginosa culture filtrates yielded high, medium, and low molecular weight fractions showing chemotactic activity. S pneumoniae and H influenzae yielded fractions with only low molecular weight chemotactic activity. Neutrophil chemotactic responses, occurring in response to all bacterial species tested, appear to represent a defence mechanism by the host. Chemoattractant activity may, however, contribute to bronchial damage mediated by products released from continuously attracted, activated neutrophils.
TI  - The emergence of bacterial resistance in hospitals--a need for continuous surveillance.
AB  - The antibiotic sensitivities of a total of 220,000 isolates from 44 hospitals collected over 2.5 years were monitored by computer. Gram-negative organisms account for 63% of the total, the most common being Escherichia coli (43%). Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated Gram-positive organism (44%). The organism most commonly isolated from blood was E. coli; this organism was susceptible to ceftazidime (100%), ampicillin (47%), gentamicin (99%) and co-trimoxazole (85%). The organism most frequently isolated from sputum was Haemophilus influenzae; this organism was susceptible to ceftazidime (99%), cefuroxime (99%), ampicillin (89%) and erythromycin (78%). A 15-fold increase in the use of ceftazidime over the past 4 years has not been accompanied by increased resistance in common pathogens. Analysis shows that the susceptibility of E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to ceftazidime has remained constant throughout the duration of this survey. The data collected from this type of survey can be used to determine local trends in antibiotic susceptibility and hence aid the rational use of antibiotics in hospitals.
TI  - [Clinical and pharmacokinetic studies on aztreonam in neonates].
AB  - Clinical and pharmacokinetic studies on aztreonam (AZT) were performed in neonates. The results are summarized as follows: A total of 6 cases consisting of 5 mature and 1 low-birth-weight infants was clinically evaluated. AZT 20 mg/kg was administered 2-3 times daily, via 1 hour intravenous drip infusion for 6-21 days. Concomitantly, vancomycin (VCM) 15 mg/kg was administered to 1 case 3 times daily, via 1 hour intravenous drip infusion for 3 days and ampicillin (ABPC) 20-50 mg/kg to 3 cases 3 time daily via 30 minutes intravenous drip infusion for 2-6 days. Of the 6 bacterial infection cases (1 with sepsis and purulent meningitis, 2 with sepsis, 2 with urinary tract infection and 1 with perirectal abscess), clinical effects of AZT were evaluated in 4 cases (2 each with sepsis and urinary tract infection) as "excellent" in all the cases. All of the causative organisms (Escherichia coli in 3 and Enterobacter cloacae in 1) were eradicated by the treatment with AZT. Neither clinical side effect nor abnormal laboratory test value caused by AZT was observed. MICs of AZT against 10 clinical isolates (Staphylococcus aureus 1, E. coli 4, Klebsiella pneumoniae 1, E. cloacae 1, Haemophilus influenzae 1 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2) from neonatal patients with bacterial infections were examined. As results, AZT showed very good antibacterial activity comparable or even superior to cefoperazone, cefotaxime, latamoxef; however, the activity against P. aeruginosa was inferior to imipenem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bacterial pneumonia in solid organ transplantation.
AB  - Approximately 4% of recipients of solid organ transplants in the United States develop bacterial pneumonia in the posttransplant period, often in the first 3 months following transplantation. The incidence of bacterial pneumonia is highest in recipients of heartlung (22%) and liver transplants (17%), intermediate in recipients of heart transplants (5%), and lowest in renal transplant patients (1 to 2%). The crude mortality of bacterial pneumonia in solid organ transplantation has exceeded 40% in most series. Beyond those risk factors identified for nosocomial pneumonia, the occurrence of primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, graft rejection, maintenance antirejection therapy with prednisone, azathioprine, and antilymphocyte globulin, antirejection therapy with high-dose corticosteroids or OKT3 and splenectomy have been associated with a significantly increased risk of bacterial pneumonia in these patients. In the first 3 months posttransplant, gram-negative bacilli, Staphylococcus aureus and Legionella predominate and mortality is very high, in excess of 60%. Thereafter, bacterial pneumonias are caused primarily by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae, with considerably lower mortality. Bacterial pneumonia must be suspected in any transplant patient presenting with fever and cough, especially associated with dyspnea or infiltrates on chest radiograph. If large numbers of bacteria and polymorphonuclear leukocytes are not visualized in respiratory secretions the work-up should proceed directly to fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and/or protected brush specimen to establish the microbiologic diagnosis as accurately as possible. For presumptive gram-negative bacillary pneumonia, the initial regimen must be effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Prevention of bacterial pneumonia in transplant patients must begin with immunization against S pneumoniae and Influenza A, and include precautions taken to prevent nosocomial pneumonia. It further may include measures to prevent CMV infection and the use of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis during the first year posttransplantation. Ultimately, novel technologies such as selective antimicrobial decontamination and/or protective isolation during the early postoperative period may prove effective.
TI  - [Clinical and ultrastructural study on primary ciliary dyskinesia].
AB  - We evaluated laboratory and radiological findings and examined tracheobronchial cilia by transmission electron microscopy in 9 patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), in order to elucidate the clinical pictures of PCD and the relationship between PCD and diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) which was proposed as a new disease entity in Japan in 1969. The clinical pictures of our PCD patients were almost the same as that already described in several articles in Europe and North America; early onset of respiratory symptoms, high incidence of chronic sinusitis and otitis media exudative as well as infertility, continuous infections in the lower respiratory tracts (Hemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa etc.). Tracheobronchial cilia obtained by brushing technique were immotile (6 out of 8 patients) or dyskinetic (2 out of 8 patients). Ultrastructural study of cilia revealed the lack of dynein arms in all patients: the lack of both outer and inner arms (4 patients), the lack of outer arms (2 patients), the lack of inner arms (2 patients). Chest X-ray films revealed situs inversus in six out of nine patients. According to the radiological findings (chest X-ray film, CT-scan, bronchogram), the patients were divided into three groups; I: localized bronchiectasis (5 patients), II: diffuse micronodular lesions without definite bronchiectasis (3 patients), III: diffuse micronodular lesions with bronchiectasis (1 patient). Two patients of the second group satisfied the clinical diagnostic criteria for DPB (Chest 83:63, 1983). In conclusion, PCD can cause a variety of respiratory tract lesions such as bronchiectasis, DPB and other types of peripheral airway disorders.
TI  - Bacterial reservoirs in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - To establish whether colonisation of the upper respiratory tract or bacterial contamination of inhaler devices or solutions predisposes to colonisation of the lower respiratory tract in patients with cystic fibrosis, bacterial isolates from groups of children who were positive (n = 13) or negative (n = 18) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied. Cultures of swabs from inhaler devices, toothbrushes, and upper airways were compared with cough swabs or sputum cultures. No pathogens were obtained from inhaler equipment administering unit dose medications. Upper airway carriage of Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae was identified in both groups but correlated poorly with sputum isolates. P. aeruginosa was found only in the upper respiratory tract of children with established colonisation of the lower airways. No P aeruginosa isolates were obtained from the upper airways of the group with negative sputum, including one patient who became colonised by P aeruginosa during the study. Our results did not support the suggestion that colonisation of the upper respiratory tract by P aeruginosa predisposes to colonisation of the lower airways. Failure to isolate pathogenic organisms consistently from the upper airways in patients with positive sputum argues against a local epithelial factor predisposing to bacterial colonisation.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of sulbactam/cefoperazone in lower respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Clinical evaluation, safety and kinetics in serum of sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) in patients with lower respiratory tract infections have been studied in a multicenter trial participated by 28 institutions in Kyushu area during a period of 13 months from March 1987 to March 1988. 1. Mean peak serum levels of SBT and CPZ in 35 patients up to 4 hours after intravenous infusion of 2 g of SBT/CPZ were 38.2 +/- 17.3 micrograms/ml for SBT and 104.3 +/- 31.4 micrograms/ml for CPZ. Serum half-lives of SBT and CPZ were 0.76 hour and 1.53 hours, respectively. These results were in similar ranges to those reported elsewhere for SBT/CPZ. 2. Serum half-lives of SBT and CPZ after intravenous infusion of 2 g of SBT/CPZ were not significantly prolonged in patients with moderate liver or kidney dysfunctions. 3. Clinical efficacy rates of SBT/CPZ in 217 patients were 93.1% (81/87) for pneumonia, 93.3% (14/15) for lung abscess, 78.9% (15/19) for acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, 57.1% (4/7) for diffuse panbronchiolitis, 72.4% (21/29), 74.4% (32/43) and 100% (9/9) for infections concurrent to bronchiectasis, chronic respiratory disease and pulmonary emphysema, respectively. Those were 50% (1/2) for bronchitis associated with lung cancer and 66.7% (4/6) for empyema. The overall efficacy rate was 83.4% (181/217). 4. Clinical efficacy rate of SBT/CPZ for pneumonia in patients with underlying diseases such as lung cancer, pulmonary tuberculosis and pneumoconiosis, etc, was 85.3% (29/34) and was not significantly different from the efficacy rate of 98.1% (52/53) in patients without these underlying diseases. 5. Of 30 patients who failed to respond of previous antibiotic treatments, 21 were effectively treated by SBT/CPZ. 6. Bacteriological eradication rates against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 42.9% (9/21), 87.5% (14/16) and 100% (5/5), respectively. The overall eradication rate in all cases including polymicrobial infections was 72.8% (67/92). 7. The high levels of peak serum concentration of CPZ, and the difference between serum levels of SBT and of CPZ seemed to contribute to the high clinical efficacy. 8. Adverse reactions occurred in 2.8% (6/217) of the patients, and consisted primarily of rash and diarrhea. Laboratory abnormalities were observed in 8 patients during the study. These were elevations of S-GOT and S-GPT, and eosinophilia. 9. SBT/CPZ is a very useful drug in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections as it has become available just in time when increase in resistant organisms to beta-lactams is notable.
TI  - Therapy of otitis media.
AB  - The epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, complications and sequelae, and therapy of otitis media are reviewed. Otitis media is one of the most common infections in infants and children. Epidemiologic studies have identified season of the year, bottle versus breast feeding, socioeconomic status, race, sex, and daycare attendance as factors associated with the occurrence of otitis media. The condition is believed to arise secondary to eustachian tube dysfunction in the presence of viral or bacterial invasion of the nasopharynx. Diagnosis is often made by direct observation of the tympanic membrane with an otoscope. If untreated, the infection can spread to other structures in the aural cavity or even to the brain and meninges. The most frequent complication of otitis media is hearing loss, which may result in speech and learning difficulties. Oral antimicrobial agents--notably ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, bacampicillin, cyclacillin, erythromycin ethylsuccinate-sulfisoxazole, cefixime, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole--are the mainstay of treatment. Selection of the agent should be based primarily on its spectrum of activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Other considerations include the presence of beta-lactamase-producing strains of H. influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis, adverse effects, cost, and compliance. In cases of recurrent otitis media, antimicrobial prophylaxis or surgery may be indicated. Chronic otitis media with effusion may be treated with oral antimicrobials, but surgery may also be necessary. Chronic suppurative otitis media often requires hospitalization and intravenous antimicrobial therapy with agents effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Oral antimicrobial agents represent the treatment of choice for otitis media, but such therapy addresses only one of the several etiologic factors identified.
TI  - [Evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the treatment of respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) was administered to 55 patients with respiratory tract infections (RTI). A clinical evaluation of IPM/CS was carried out in 51 patients, 28 with pneumonia, 4 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with pyothorax, 6 with bronchitis, 9 with bronchiectasis, 1 with diffuse panbronchiolitis and 2 with RTI with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the clinical efficacy rate was 78.4%. Causative organisms were isolated in 23 strains out of 20 patients, such as Staphylococcus aureus 4 strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis 1 strain, Streptococcus pneumoniae 1 strain, Branhamella catarrhalis 1 strain, Haemophilus influenzae 2 strains, Klebsiella pneumoniae 4 strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 6 strains, Pseudomonas sp. 1 strain, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus 1 strain, Acinetobacter sp. 1 strain and glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative rod 1 strain. An eradication rate of 70.6% was obtained. An overall eradication rate of main causative organisms in RTI including S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and K. pneumoniae was 75.0%. Clinical adverse effects were observed in 5 patients, and these were eruption in 2, itching in 1, vomiting in 1 and drug fever in 1. Abnormalities in laboratory test results were observed in 8 patients. These disappeared or returned to normal values after completion or discontinuation of IPM/CS administration. IPM/CS appears to be a useful antibiotic for the treatment of RTI, especially severe infections.
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (II). Distribution and  antibiotic sensitivity to 45 agents of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting a doctor in private practice].
AB  - The bacteriology of the isolates from the sputum or the throat swab of patients with respiratory infections visiting a doctor in private practice in Sendai city during the period from March in 1988 to February in 1989 was documented, and their sensitivity to 45 antimicrobial agents was determined. Of the 568 patients, 514 cases had acute pharyngitis, 8 cases each had acute tonsillitis and acute bronchitis, 7 cases were acute pneumonia, 6 cases had herpangina, 18 cases had hand-foot-mouth disease with the signs of respiratory infections, 5 cases had varicella with the signs of respiratory infections and 2 cases were mumps with the signs of respiratory infections. Three hundred strains of potential (greater than or equal to 10(7) CFU/ml) pathogens were recovered from 293 of the 568 cases, which consisted of 124 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 58 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 45 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 26 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 9 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 13 strains of other species, not including non-fermentile gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Staphylococcus aureus and other strains were documented simultaneously in 6 out of 7 cases in which multi-organisms were recovered. Many strains of Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from young patients throughout the year. On the other hand many strains of Branhamella catarrhalis were isolated from elderly patients in winter. The sensitivity of 45 antimicrobial agents of 231 of 300 strains was determined by sensitivity disks (EIKEN, Japan). No strain of the Haemophilus influenzae in this study was resistant to ampicillin. None of the Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes was resistant to ampicillin or cefazolin. None of the Staphylococcus aureus was resistant to cloxacillin, cefazolin, gentamicin or ofloxacin. We conclude from the above results that antibiotic-resistant strains are found presumably only in a very few cases in primary care clinic.
TI  - Clinical experience with parenteral and oral ofloxacin in severe infections.
AB  - This study included 107 patients who were given ofloxacin at daily doses of 400-800 mg for 10 days to 12 months for treatment of a variety of infections. 77 patients were given ofloxacin orally and 30 received it intravenously. Infections treated were bronchopneumonia (29), chronic bronchitis with acute exacerbation (15), chronic osteomyelitis with exacerbation (20), soft tissue infections (13), complicated urinary tract infections (7), chronic prostatis with exacerbation (7), malignant external otitis (4), or other infections (12). Pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (39), Acinetobacter spp. (9), various Enterobacteriaceae (30), Haemophilus influenzae (26), pneumococci (1) and Staphylococcus aureus (4). MICs of ofloxacin ranged from less than 0.06-2 mg/l. Clinically, 69% of the patients were cured, 18% improved and 13% failed to respond. Bacteriologically, pathogens were eradicated in 70%, persisted in 16% and relapsed in 14%. Resistance during therapy developed almost exclusively in P. aeruginosa strains (17.9%). The following adverse reactions were reported: gastrointestinal disturbances (6), rash plus facial oedema (1), abnormal liver function tests (5) and leukopenia (1). It is concluded that ofloxacin is suitable for treatment of a variety of infections, ranging from serious life threatening infections in ICU patients to chronic ones that require prolonged therapy.
TI  - Overview of experience with ofloxacin in respiratory tract infection.
AB  - Ofloxacin is highly active against common respiratory pathogens including Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis and has clinically applicable activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Sputum, lung tissue and bronchial mucosal concentrations of ofloxacin equal or, in most cases significantly exceed the MICs of such pathogens. These in vitro attributes are reflected in the results of the worldwide ofloxacin clinical trial program which achieved overall response rates of 98% in lower respiratory tract infections, 83% in pneumonias and 87% to 95%, in open and comparative studies respectively, in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (CB). Overall bacterial eradication rates ranged from 70% for pneumococci and 84.5% for B. catarrhalis to 88.5% for H. influenzae. In lower respiratory infection ofloxacin gave equal or superior clinical results to amoxycillin or erythromycin therapy together with an overall bacterial eradication rate of 100%. Clinical results comparable with standard agents were also obtained in pneumonia, cure rates ranging from 77-89% at various dosages. Eradication rates proved greatest for H. influenzae (92%) and were satisfactory for Klebsiella spp. (80%), although less so for pneumococci (73%). Bacteriological eradication rates in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis ranged from 68% for pneumococcal infections, to 85% in B. catarrhalis and 94% in H. influenzae infections. Ofloxacin compared favourably with pivampicillin, co-trimoxazole and doxycycline clinically. A daily oral ofloxacin dose of 400 mg produced a good clinical response in 92% of patients or more. The available clinical data therefore substantially confirm the claim of ofloxacin to offer an effective alternative in many forms of acute bacterial respiratory infection, especially where H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis are involved.
TI  - Multicenter in vitro comparison of piperacillin and nine other antibacterials against 1,629 clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial spectrum of activity of piperacillin was compared with that of  other antibiotics against isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus sp, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides bivius, and Clostridium difficile obtained from laboratories at hospitals in St. Louis, in Memphis, and in Newark, New Jersey. Of the 1,629 isolates tested, 91% were susceptible to piperacillin, 90% to mezlocillin, 87% to ticarcillin/clavulanate and imipenem, 83% to ceftazidime, 81% to cefoperazone, 80% to ciprofloxacin, 77% to ceftriaxone, 71% to aztreonam, and 51% to cefoxitin.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1987)].
AB  - Since 1981, in cooperation with research institutions across the nation, Ikemoto, et al. have been collecting clinical isolates from patients with respiratory tract infections and conducting an annual retrospective survey of patients' background factors and of isolated strains and their sensitivities to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics. In the period from October, 1987 to September, 1988, 17 institutions participated in the survey and a total of 706 strains which were demonstrated to be causative organisms were isolated from 562 patients with respiratory tract infections. Strains were mostly isolated from the sputum. The taxonomic breakdown of these strains was: Staphylococcus aureus (69 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (120), Haemophilus influenzae (170), Mucoid-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (42), Non-mucoid-producing P. aeruginosa (87), Escherichia coli (11), Klebsiella pneumoniae (35), Brahamella catarrharis (72), etc. Of these strains, 629 were used to determine MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics for susceptibility analyses. Relationships between patient backgrounds and diagnoses and between infections diseases and causative organisms were also investigated. Most of the major causative organisms, such as H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa, showed no substantial changes from previous years, with regard to their sensitivities to antibiotic agent, but S. aureus, particularly methicillin/cephem-resistant strains of S. aureus (MCRSA) showed somewhat lower sensitivity to beta-lactams, and as in recent years, to ofloxacin, a new quinolone drug, as well. Regarding background factors of patients, the age distribution was heavily concentrated in age brackets of 50 years and older, thus patients in these age group accounted for 75.2% of all the patients, which was comparable to 73.5% in 1985 and 77.9% in 1986. Among infections encountered, bacterial pneumonia was most frequent at 28.3%, followed by chronic bronchitis (27.2%) and bronchiectasis (16.0%). Bacterial pneumonia was actually the most frequent, throughout the entire age groups accounting for 34.3% of patients up to 29 years, 26.6% in the group of 30-69 years and 30.7% in patients aged 70 years and older. Chronic bronchitis was next most frequent and accounted for 20.0%, 26.4% and 30.7% among the three age groups, respectively. Breaking down clinical isolates by diagnosis, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa were isolated frequently from most of the infectious diseases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - The role of bacterial adhesion in cystic fibrosis including the staphylococcal aspect.
AB  - The bacteriology of cystic fibrosis shows a unique and predictable progression of colonizing micro-organisms. The reason for this sequence is still not known, but thought must be given to the idea that it may be related to the genetic disorder in some way. If this were to be true, an understanding of the colonization mechanisms at all stages in this progression could provide valuable insights for the development of novel therapies. As far as can be ascertained from published studies, mucus is the site of colonization in cystic fibrosis. While there is no doubt that the major pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, adheres to injured cells more avidly than to intact cells, the overwhelming evidence indicates that it also attaches more avidly to mucus than to intact airway cells by means of specific adhesin-receptor mechanisms. Studies with Staphylococcus aureus, the other major pathogen, are also in progress. These indicate that this organism also has an affinity for mucus. At this time the studies suggest a lesser affinity than P. aeruginosa, at least with adult mucins. These two organisms do not however appear to share the same receptor. In addition to these two major pathogens, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, pathogens of lesser importance also adhere to mucus. Therefore adhesion to mucus or mucins may be a recurring theme in all airway colonization. A knowledge of the factors which control these tropisms ought to provide insights into the bacterial specificity seen in cystic fibrosis and other diseases.
TI  - Bacterial agents associated with bronchopulmonary disorders in eastern Nigeria.
AB  - Altogether 16,539 sputum specimens were examined microbiologically from 1980 to 1984. Out of these 12,588 were screened by Ziehl-Neelsen's staining technique and 782 were (6.3%) found AFB-positive. Age and sex distributions of the AFB-positive individuals were statistically significant (at 0.05), incidence being most prevalent among those 20 years and above (90.2%) and among males (61.2%). From other specimens cultured, non-AFB organisms were isolated at the following frequencies: coliform-like organisms (15.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (55.5%). Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.3%), Streptococcus pyogenes (3.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.4%), Haemophilus influenzae (3.0%). Proteus Spp. (0.7%) and Escherichia coli (0.5%). The antibiogram of these isolates revealed a high incidence of multiple antibiotic resistance, a situation that has most probably arisen from the high degree of antibiotic misuse in Nigeria.
TI  - Receptors for human plasminogen on gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A total of 188 strains representing 11 species of gram-negative bacteria were examined for the ability to interact with human plasminogen. Highly purified human plasminogen was labeled with 125I, and its uptake by different bacterial strains was measured. All 14 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and all 13 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis tested were positive with respect to plasminogen uptake. Also, eight species belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae were tested, and of those, Proteus mirabilis demonstrated the most substantial uptake, with 28 of 39 strains taking up more than 10% of the plasminogen. Ten strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also tested, of which seven showed uptake values higher than 10%. With H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis strains, Scatchard analysis indicated a two-phase receptor interaction, one more-avid receptor with a Kd of 6 to 8 nM and 2,000 to 2,500 sites per bacterium and a second receptor with a Kd of 50 to 80 nM and 9,000 sites per bacterium. With Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, a single receptor interaction was detected with a Kd of 60 nM and the number of sites was estimated as 8,000 per bacterium. Scatchard analysis with strains of P. mirabilis indicated binding of a less-specific nature. However, plasminogen uptake by this species could be reduced by 50% by the addition of 2 mM unlabeled plasminogen. This estimate of Kd, as well as uptake studies with plasminogen fragments, suggests different properties of this receptor. With all receptor types, the addition of plasmin-aprotinin complex inhibited plasminogen uptake, which demonstrates that both forms of the molecule react with the same receptors. Plasminogen uptake could be eliminated by the addition of lysine or epsilon-aminocaproic acid, which suggests that the lysine-binding sites of the plasminogen molecule are involved in the receptor-ligand interaction.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and susceptibility testing of ofloxacin. Current  status.
AB  - The fluoroquinolone, ofloxacin, exhibits a broad antibacterial spectrum. Based on our data and a review of the literature, ofloxacin inhibited essentially 100 percent of staphylococci, including oxacillin-resistant strains, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria spp. and Branhamella catarrhalis. Ninety-five percent of Enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to ofloxacin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococci were less susceptible: 79 and 63 percent, respectively, were susceptible (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC], less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml); 15 and 25 percent, respectively, were intermediate (MIC, 4 micrograms/ml); 3 and 6 percent, respectively, were resistant (MIC, more than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). Clostridium spp., including Clostridium difficile, were resistant to ofloxacin, but other anaerobic species, including the Bacteroides fragilis group (over 90 percent) were either susceptible or intermediate to ofloxacin. Ofloxacin is bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations of ofloxacin rarely exceed the MICs by one doubling concentration. A modest inoculum effect has been observed with ofloxacin: MICs with inocula of 10(7) colony-forming units/ml are often two- to fourfold higher than those with inocula of 5 x 10(5) colony-forming units/ml. Susceptible organisms exposed serially to increasing concentrations of nalidixic acid developed increasing resistance to not only nalidixic acid, but also to all other quinolones, including ofloxacin. Correlations of disk diffusion inhibitory zone diameters using the 5-micrograms ofloxacin disk with ofloxacin MICs have been performed, and the disk diffusion zone diameter breakpoints recommended are: susceptible, greater than or equal to 16 mm; intermediate, 13 to 15 mm; resistant, less than or equal to 12 mm. Quality control parameters also are summarized.
TI  - Intravenous ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime in serious infections. A prospective, controlled clinical trial with third-party blinding.
AB  - Oral ciprofloxacin has been shown to be effective in the treatment of infections  due to gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods. The efficacy and safety of intravenous ciprofloxacin was compared with that of intravenous ceftazidime in the treatment of 59 patients with well-documented serious infections in a prospective, controlled, randomized study with a third-party blinding. Thirty-three patients were treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin (200 mg every 12 hours, plus a daily extra placebo dose); 26 patients were treated with ceftazidime (1 g every eight hours). The severity of the infections, underlying diseases, and demographic features were comparable in both groups, although there were more men in the ciprofloxacin group. For ciprofloxacin/ceftazidime treatments, respectively, the evaluated infections were: pyelonephritis (16 patients/nine patients), pneumonia (three/five), soft-tissue infections (four/zero), spontaneous peritonitis (five/two), primary bacteremia (three/eight), and other (two/two). Isolated pathogens included: Escherichia coli (22/12), Klebsiella sp. (five/four), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two/three), Haemophilus influenzae (one/one), Proteus mirabilis (two/zero), Proteus vulgaris (one/zero), Salmonella sp. (zero/two), Plesiomonas shigelloides (one/zero), and others (one/four). The clinical responses were cure or improvement in 31 ciprofloxacin cases/21 ceftazidime cases; failure, zero/four; and indeterminate, two/one. The bacteriologic responses were eradication in 28 ciprofloxacin cases/22 ceftazidime cases; persistence, one/three; and indeterminate, four/one. Mild intolerance occurred in three ciprofloxacin cases and two ceftazidime cases. A mild increase in serum hepatic enzymes was observed in two patients in each group. Superinfections occurred in five patients: enterococcal septicemia (zero/two) and urinary tract infections (one/two). The results presented suggest that intravenous ciprofloxacin is an effective and safe antimicrobial agent for the treatment of serious infections, with an efficacy comparable with that of ceftazidime, a broad-spectrum cephalosporin. An additional advantage seems to be a lower rate of superinfections.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin (intravenous/oral) versus ceftazidime in lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of intravenous ciprofloxacin was compared with intravenous ceftazidime in 80 hospitalized patients with lower respiratory tract infection. There were 40 patients in each treatment group. Patients and physicians were blinded to the randomized scheme for treatment groups until patient consent was obtained. The 37 evaluable ciprofloxacin-treated patients received 200 mg every 12 hours intravenously as initial therapy and 29 completed their course receiving oral ciprofloxacin. The 34 evaluable ceftazidime-treated patients received 1 to 2 g intravenously every eight to 12 hours. The two groups did not differ with respect to patient age, infection severity, and admitting diagnosis. Clinical outcomes were similar with greater than 95 percent of treatments in each group being successful. Headache was the most commonly reported complaint (four patients) in the ciprofloxacin group. Three patients experienced substantial increases in serum theophylline concentrations while receiving ciprofloxacin. The predominant pathogens isolated were Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and susceptibility rates for all organisms were similar for both drugs. The mean peak serum concentration at steady state while receiving intravenous ciprofloxacin was 2.3 micrograms/ml, and the mean trough concentration was 0.5 micrograms/ml. Patients randomly assigned to ciprofloxacin therapy received 2.6 fewer days of intravenous antibiotic therapy than those receiving ceftazidime. This 80-patient comparative trial demonstrates that ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime are similar in efficacy and safety when treating gram-negative lower respiratory tract infections. There appears to be potential for cost-reducing benefits through decreased length of intravenous therapy and earlier hospital discharge.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in patients with bacteremic infections. The Spanish Group for the Study of Ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of 68 episodes of bacteremia were studied. Patients were treated intravenously (30 cases), orally (13 cases), or with sequential intravenous/oral therapy (25 cases). Intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. According to the criteria of McCabe and Jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. The clinical condition of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or good in 28. Sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. The causative micro-organisms were: Escherichia coli (18 episodes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), Acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), Salmonella sp. (seven episodes), Enterobacter sp. (six episodes), Proteus sp. (four episodes), Serratia sp. (four episodes), Haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), Klebsiella sp. (three episodes), Staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and Morganella morganii (two episodes). Overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). Bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). Five organisms persisted: Acinetobacter sp. (two patients), P. aeruginosa (one patient), Enterobacter sp. (one patient), and Serratia sp. (one patient). Side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). Superinfecting organisms and sites were as follows: Enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); Candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); Acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); Staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and Clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). Ciprofloxacin administered either intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.
TI  - Intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime in the treatment of serious infections.
AB  - Seventy-one adult patients with 72 infections were treated, by random selection,  with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin or intravenously administered ceftazidime. Twenty-seven additional patients with 29 infections who were not appropriate for random assignment were treated in an open study with intravenously administered ciprofloxacin only; the latter infections were generally more serious or were caused by ceftazidime-resistant organisms. The most common doses were ciprofloxacin, 200 mg intravenously and 500 mg orally every 12 hours and ceftazidime, 1 to 2 g intravenously every eight to 12 hours. Forty-seven ciprofloxacin-treated infections and 31 ceftazidime-treated infections were evaluable for determination of efficacy. Infections included lower respiratory tract (21 infections), urinary (37 infections), skin/soft tissue (14 infections), bacteremia/endocarditis (four infections), colitis (one infection), and mastoiditis (one infection). Median minimal inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were, respectively: for Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis, no more than 0.06 and no more than 0.25 micrograms/ml; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml; for Enterococcus faecalis, 1 and more than 32 micrograms/ml; and for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 and 8 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin, 200 mg intravenously, yielded mean serum concentrations 0.5 and eight hours post-intravenous infusion of 2.3 and 0.7 micrograms/ml, respectively. Satisfactory clinical responses were achieved in 17 (81 percent) of 21 patients with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin, 22 (71 percent) of 31 patients with ceftazidime, and 20 (77 percent) of 26 patients with intravenous ciprofloxacin. The most common treatment failures occurred in complicated skin/soft-tissue infections treated with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin, complicated urinary tract infections treated with ceftazidime, and necrotizing P. aeruginosa pneumonia treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin; the pneumonia patients all had respiratory failure and had been previously unresponsive to treatment with other appropriate drugs. Serious adverse reactions were observed in three patients, seizures with intravenous ciprofloxacin in two patients, and Clostridium difficile diarrhea with ceftazidime in one patient. We conclude that sequential intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were comparable in efficacy and safety; the ability to change from intravenous to oral therapy is a major convenience. Intravenous ciprofloxacin was useful for more serious infections, often caused by ceftazidime-resistant organisms.
TI  - Ticarcillin/clavulanic acid combination. Treatment of bacterial infections in hospitalized children.
AB  - Eighteen patients 2 months to 11 years of age with culture proven bacterial infections were treated with parenteral ticarcillin/clavulanic acid in a noncomparative study. Seven patients had pneumonia, two had tracheobronchitis, three had soft tissue abscess, two had periorbital cellulitis, three had urinary tract infection and one had purulent bursitis. Four of the 18 were bacteremic. Organisms treated included Staphylococcus aureus (6), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Haemophilus influenzae (2), Branhamella catarrhalis (2), Escherichia coli (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Streptococcus pyogenes (1) and Serratia marcescens (1). Thirteen of 15 (87%) organisms tested were beta-lactamase positive. Therapy was given intravenously in six doses per day at 310 mg/kg. Duration of treatment ranged from 5 to 28 (mean 11) days, with an average time of 4 days to clinical improvement. Seventeen patients (94%) were clinically cured. One patient with recurrent aspiration pneumonia due to mixed infection with multiple gram-negative enteric bacilli failed therapy. Adverse effects were minimal and transient. Notably, mild to moderate thrombocytosis occurred in four (22%) patients that resolved uneventfully. We conclude that ticarcillin/clavulanic acid is safe and effective therapy for serious infections in hospitalized children.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1986)].
AB  - Enlisting the help of various research institutions across the nation, Ikemoto et al. have been pooling cultures of clinical isolates of respiratory tract infections and mapping out the correlations between patient backgrounds and the causative bacteria and the changes in the sensitivity spectra of the bacteria to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents annually since 1981. The following is a report of the 1986 findings. During the period from September, 1986 to March, 1987, 558 cases of respiratory infections were reported at 17 institutions across the nation and a total of 657 apparent causative strains were isolated from sputum samples. Of these strains, 75 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 108 of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 150 of Haemophilus influenzae, 107 of Pseudomonas aeruiginosa (non-mucoid production type), 21 of P. aeruginosa (mucoid production type), 32 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 of Escherichia coli, and 55 of Branhamella catarrhalis were subjected to MIC determination of various antibacterial and antibiotic agents to map drug sensitivities. In addition, diagnoses, age distributions by diagnoses, frequencies of infectious diseases, types of isolated bacteria, and usage statuses of the antibacterial and antibiotic agents the times of at isolation were also investigated. MIC determinations were carried out to investigate susceptibilities of causative organisms of respiratory tract infections to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents. From the 558 cases of respiratory tract infections, 657 strains were detected at concentrations not less than 10(4-6)/ml and identified to be the causative organisms. Of these strains, 603 could be used for MIC determination. An overwhelming majority of major causative bacteria, inclusive of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae, showed sensitivity patterns similar to the sensitivity patterns found a year earlier, P. aeruginosa alone, however, showed some increase in its susceptibility to penicillin and cephem antibiotics. Regarding patient backgrounds, the age distribution was heavily biased towards the higher end of the scale, which patients with ages of 50 or higher accounting for 77.9%, compared to 73.5% in 1985. When the patients were classified by diagnoses, chronic bronchitis, bacterial pneumonia and bronchiectasis accounted for the majority of the infections: 28.7%, 23.3%, and 19.0%, respectively. The percentages of chronic bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia 28.7% and 23.3%, respectively, were somewhat higher in 1986 than in 1985. The disease which was comparatively frequent in all age groups was bronchiectasis, which accounted for 44.0% in patients with ages 29 years or lower, 18.4% in patients between 30 years and 69 years, and 16.7% in patients with ages 70 years or higher. The next most frequent infection was bacterial pneumonia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Ticarcillin/clavulanate in severe infections in patients with varying renal function.
AB  - The therapeutic efficacy of ticarcillin/clavulanate was assessed in 71 patients with severe infections: 38 acute pyelonephritis, 16 septicaemia and 19 miscellaneous infections. The patients were classified according to their renal function in: Group A, normal (16 cases); B, mild renal impairment (RI) with creatinine clearance (Clcr) between 80 and 40 ml/min (18 cases); C, moderate RI with Clcr between 40 and 15 ml/min (12 cases); D, severe RI with (Clcr) between 15 and 5 ml/min (13 cases) and E, terminal with (Clcr) less than 5 ml/min (12 cases). A total of 105 microorganisms (48.6% resistant to ticarcillin): 31 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18 Escherichia coli, 21 other Enterobacteriaceae, 2 Haemophilus influenzae, 10 Bacteroides spp., 14 enterococci, 8 staphylococci and 1 streptococcus, were isolated. All except six Ps. aeruginosa were sensitive to ticarcillin/clavulanate, using 75:10 microgram discs. Bacteriological eradication was obtained in 97% of the cases on the third day and at the end of treatment, and in 82% of the cases after one month. In all the assessable cases, the clinical symptoms disappeared on the third day except in one patient who developed a resistant strain (Klebsiella oxytoca). The wide range of bacteria assessed and the clinical-bacteriological success rates demonstrated that the ticarcillin/clavulanate combination had an efficacy/safety profile that could be considered excellent. Tolerance was good and side effects were not observed. This study confirms the practical efficacy of the recommended dosages derived from our previous kinetic studies in RI.
TI  - Potential role of fluoroquinolones in pediatric infections.
AB  - The fluoroquinolones are new, broad-spectrum, bactericidal antimicrobial agents structurally related to nalidixic acid. They are well absorbed after oral administration, with serum and tissue levels generally in excess of the minimal inhibitory concentrations for susceptible organisms. Their spectrum of activity includes serious pediatric pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The potential uses of fluoroquinolones in pediatric diseases include acute and chronic pulmonary infections in children with cystic fibrosis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcal infections, meningitis with resistant bacteria, and prophylaxis in leukemic and immunocompromised children. The toxicity of some quinolone derivatives that involve developing cartilage in sensitive animal species has to be studied further. Clinical trials of fluoroquinolones from Europe and the United States in children show no cartilage or joint toxicity. For the time being and until more clinical experience with fluoroquinolones in children is obtained, their use should be limited to specific cases of therapeutic failure or multiple resistance to other antibiotics.
TI  - Cefixime. A review of its antibacterial activity. Pharmacokinetic properties and  therapeutic potential.
AB  - Cefixime, previously designated FK027, FR17027 and CL284635, is an orally active  cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity in vitro. It is particularly active against many Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae. Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Branhamella catarrhalis, and is resistant to hydrolysis by many beta-lactamases. Cefixime has little activity against Staphylococcus aureus and is inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefixime is distinguished by its 3-hour elimination half-life which permits twice daily, or in many instances once daily, administration. Comparative trials, though few, indicate that the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of cefixime 200 to 400mg daily administered as a single dose or in 2 divided doses, is comparable with that of multiple daily doses of co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim + sulphamethoxazole) or amoxycillin in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection, with that of amoxycillin, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid and cefaclor in acute lower respiratory tract infections, and with that of amoxycillin and cefroxidine in adult patients with acute tonsillitis or pharyngitis. Several comparative trials in children with acute otitis media demonstrate the similar effectiveness of cefixime 8 mg/kg daily (in 2 divided doses, or as a single daily dose), cefaclor 20 to 40 mg/kg daily and amoxycillin 40 mg/kg daily in 3 divided doses. The most frequently reported adverse effects, diarrhoea and stool changes, are usually mild to moderate in severity, transient, and mostly occur in the first few days of treatment with cefixime. Thus, cefixime is an effective orally active cephalosporin with a relatively long elimination half-life permitting a simplified treatment regimen. It is a suitable alternative to cefaclor or amoxycillin in acute otitis media and acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and to amoxycillin or co-trimoxazole in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral penem ALP-201 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new penem derivative ALP-201 against 226 aerobic and 350 anaerobic clinical bacterial isolates was determined using agar dilution techniques. For comparison amoxicillin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, doxycycline, erythromycin, imipenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were also tested with aerobic bacteria, and cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole and piperacillin with anaerobic bacteria. ALP-201 was found to be highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, Propioni-bacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium difficile were resistant to ALP-201. When tested against aerobic bacteria using a high inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of ALP-201 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to the inhibitory activity. Further investigations are warranted with ALP-201, which is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.
TI  - Evaluation of intravenous ciprofloxacin in patients with nosocomial lower respiratory tract infections. Impact of plasma concentrations, organism, minimum inhibitory concentration, and clinical condition on bacterial eradication.
AB  - Fifty patients with gram-negative lower respiratory tract infections were treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin to evaluate efficacy and safety. Relationships between individual pharmacokinetics and clinical and bacteriologic outcome were studied. Ciprofloxacin concentrations in plasma were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Respiratory secretion cultures were obtained daily to determine the eradication day of the infecting organism. Susceptibility (minimum inhibitory concentration) to ciprofloxacin and other antimicrobials was determined using standard microdilution techniques. The mean age of the patients was 70 years. They had multiple underlying diseases, and two thirds of them were ventilator dependent at entry. Approximately 50% of the patients had failed previous treatment for the same infections. Patients infected with Enterobacteriaceae or Haemophilus influenzae with minimum inhibitory concentrations of less than 0.25 mg/L responded well to intravenous ciprofloxacin therapy (200 mg every 12 hours). The organisms were eradicated from sputum cultures usually within 1 day after ciprofloxacin therapy was started. Most clinical failures occurred in patients who were infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and had multiple underlying diseases. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from 10 patients with pneumonia, 2 patients with lung abscess, and 1 patient with bronchiectasis. The Pseudomonas isolate acquired resistance during ciprofloxacin treatment in 7 patients with pneumonia and in all of the remaining 3 patients. We conclude that ciprofloxacin is safe and effective at a dosage of 200 mg administered intravenously every 12 hours for nosocomial lower respiratory tract infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae or Haemophilus species. Many patients who had failed previous antibiotic treatment for Enterobacteriaceae infections had good clinical response to ciprofloxacin therapy. Studies using either higher dosages of ciprofloxacin or combination therapy should be conducted to determine if acquired resistance can be avoided in Pseudomonas infections.
TI  - In-vitro activity of meropenem against clinical isolates obtained in Canada.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, gentamicin and, where appropriate, other antibiotics against recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. Meropenem inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens and Providencia stuartii at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and was four- to 16-fold more active than imipenem against these species. Against the enteric pathogens Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei, Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter jejuni, meropenem was four- to eight-fold more active than imipenem, inhibiting all isolates at less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l. Meropenem was also more active than imipenem against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) but had similar activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group (MIC90 0.25 mg/l), against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 2 mg/l) and against streptococci. Imipenem was four-fold more active than meropenem against Acinetobacter spp. and two- to eight-fold more active against all species of staphylococci tested. Both meropenem and imipenem were inactive against Ps. (Xanthomonas) maltophilia.
TI  - Pulmonary diseases in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus in  Zimbabwe, Central Africa.
AB  - During the 11 month period up to 30 September 1987, 37 patients (26 male, 11 female, mean age 27 years) with respiratory symptoms who were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, were studied prospectively on 40 occasions to determine the cause of any pulmonary complications. HIV was heterosexually transmitted. Predominant symptoms were cough (89%), fever (89%), weight loss (83%), and dyspnoea (60%). Transnasal fibre-optic bronchoscopy (with bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial brushings and transbronchial lung biopsies) was performed on 35 patients, twice on 3 patients. 'Tru-cut' lung biopsies were obtained from 2 patients who died before bronchoscopy. Pulmonary tuberculosis was the commonest disease, being found in one-third of the patients (12 of 37). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from 4; the remainder of the plates were contaminated. Pneumocystis carinii was present in 8 patients: as the sole pathogen in 3, with Streptococcus pneumoniae in 4, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, and one also had tuberculous lymphadenitis. Endobronchial Kaposi's sarcoma was seen in 6 of 7 patients with skin nodules. Bacterial pathogens isolated included Staph. aureus (5), S. pneumoniae (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Haemophilus influenzae (2), H. parainfluenzae (1) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). Invading Aspergillus fumigatus was diagnosed by lung biopsy in one. No diagnosis was reached for 8 patients. It is concluded that in Central Africa pulmonary complications in AIDS patients are similar to those in Europe and North America but the incidence of different pathogens depends on the prevalence of pathogens in the community. M. tuberculosis is probably the commonest pathogen. This study has confirmed that P. carinii pneumonia does occur, but occurs less frequently.
TI  - Circulating immune complexes, antibodies to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pulmonary status in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Serum samples from 37 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), whose lungs were colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were tested in a 1 yr prospective study to examine a possible relationship between levels of circulating immune complexes (CIC) and the following parameters: level of specific antibodies to P. aeruginosa; relative importance of P. aeruginosa mucoid and non-mucoid strains isolated from sputum; the forced expiratory volume (FEV1; percentage predicted); the chest X-Ray score (Brasfield system) and the clinical score (Shwachman system). Reactivity of CIC against P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli antigens were also assayed. We found that the FEV1, the chest X-Ray and the clinical scores were significantly lower in patients with high levels of CIC than in those with normal levels of CIC (p less than 0.001 for each). We also found that the level of IgG antibodies against P. aeruginosa was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) in patients with high levels of CIC than in those with normal levels of CIC. 78% of patients with high levels of CIC had predominantly mucoid P. aeruginosa isolates whereas only 21% of patients with normal levels of CIC had also predominantly mucoid P. aeruginosa isolates. Specific antibodies to P. aeruginosa were detected in all CIC isolated by polyethylene glycol precipitations from CF patients exhibiting both high levels of CIC and inferior pulmonary status. Our findings support the hypothesis that a high level of CIC in association with an aggressive humoral response to P. aeruginosa correlates with defective pulmonary status in cystic fibrosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of BO-1341, a new antipseudomonal cephalosporin.
AB  - BO-1341, a new antipseudomonal semisynthetic cephalosporin, was evaluated for in  vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities in comparison with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. The in vitro activity of BO-1341 was generally superior or comparable to the activities of the reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae. BO-1341 was highly active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC for 90% of the strains tested, 1.56 micrograms/ml), Pseudomonas maltophilia (MIC for 50% of the strains tested, 1.56 micrograms/ml), and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (MIC for 90% of the strains tested, 3.13 micrograms/ml). Furthermore, BO-1341 was highly active against P. aeruginosa isolates resistant to the other antibiotics. Of 199 P. aeruginosa isolates tested, only 2 were resistant to BO-1341. These two strains were also resistant to ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and nonenteric streptococci were also susceptible to BO-1341, but Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Bacteroides fragilis were not susceptible to the compound. The protective efficacy against experimental infections in mice caused by nine strains of gram-negative bacteria, including P. aeruginosa, reflected the potent in vitro activity.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of QA-241, a new tricyclic quinolone derivative.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibilities of 1,310 clinical isolates to QA-241, a novel tricyclic quinolone, were evaluated in comparison with susceptibilities to norfloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, and ciprofloxacin. The MICs of QA-241 for 90% of staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis isolates, and streptococcal species ranged from 1.56 to 6.25 micrograms/ml, and the activity of QA-241 was similar to those of norfloxacin and enoxacin but two to four times less potent than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. At the concentration of less than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml, QA-241 inhibited 90% of Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and gram-negative enteric bacteria except for Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii. QA-241 was moderately active (MIC for 90% of strains tested, 6.25 to 12.5 micrograms/ml) against S. marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Bacteroides fragilis. The antibacterial activity of QA-241 was roughly comparable to that of enoxacin but two to four times less potent than that of ofloxacin. In systemic infections in mice with gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods, the efficacy of QA-241 was generally greater than that of norfloxacin and similar to those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. In urinary tract infections in mice with Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, QA-241 was as active as ofloxacin and more active than norfloxacin but less active than ciprofloxacin. In pulmonary infections in mice with Klebsiella pneumoniae, the effectiveness of QA-241 was similar to that of ofloxacin.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of piperacillin-tazobactam and ticarcillin-clavulanate.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ticarcillin, piperacillin, clavulanic acid, tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and piperacillin-tazobactam against 819 bacterial isolates were compared. The two beta-lactamase inhibitors, clavulanic acid and tazobactam, had little useful antibacterial activity but enhanced the activities of the penicillins against beta-lactamase-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus; all strains were susceptible to both combinations. Both enzyme inhibitors also enhanced the activities of the penicillins against most strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter diversus, Proteus spp., Providencia spp., and Bacteroides spp. and against occasional strains of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., and Serratia marcescens. Clavulanic acid frequently enhanced the activity of ticarcillin against Xanthomonas maltophilia, and tazobactam frequently enhanced the activity of piperacillin against Morganella morganii. Enhancement was observed primarily with strains relatively resistant to the penicillins. In general, clavulanic acid was more effective than tazobactam in enhancing penicillin activity against Klebsiella spp., C. diversus, X. maltophilia, and Bacteroides spp., whereas tazobactam was more effective against Escherichia coli and Proteeae. There was little or no enhancement of activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, or Acinetobacter anitratus. Clavulanic acid occasionally antagonized the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, but those strains were still considered susceptible to the combination. Tazobactam never antagonized the activity of piperacillin. In a direct comparison of the activities of ticarcillin-clavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam, the two were equally active against H. influenzae, B. catarrhalis, and S. aureus; the latter was more active against E. faecalis. For relatively susceptible strains of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, neither combination was predictably more active than the other, but relatively resistant strains were generally more susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam was more active than ticarcillin-clavulanate against A. hydrophila, P. aeruginosa, and P. cepacia, similar in activity against A. anitratus, and less active against X. maltophilia and Bacteroides spp.
TI  - Activity of CM-40874 against Enterobacter resistant to third generation cephalosporins.
AB  
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091 [7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-8-chloro-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro- 4-oxo- 3-quinoline carboxylic acid hydrochloride], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, beta-lactams, and gentamicin. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml. For many species AM-1091 was 2-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 2- to 32-fold more active than ofloxacin. It inhibited Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Klebsiella species resistant to ceftazidime and gentamicin. Ninety percent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, so for this species AM-1091 was twofold less active than ciprofloxacin. AM-1091 was more active against Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia, inhibiting isolates resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. Most Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml. The MICs for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis isolates were 0.06, 0.06, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. AM-1091 inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.25 micrograms/ml and was more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against gram-positive species. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the Bacteroides species at 0.5 micrograms/ml. The frequency of spontaneous resistance was less than 10(-10) for most organisms, but resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculturing. Although AM-1091 had lower in vitro activity at pH 5.5 and in the presence of high concentrations of Mg2+, it still inhibited most organisms at </= 0.5 micrograms/ml under these conditions. AM-1091 rapidly killed Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa and had a prolonged postantibiotic suppressive effect on these bacteria.
TI  - Penetration of newer cephalosporins into cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - A review of the world literature on the penetration (ratio of concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid to concentrations of serum) and attainable antibiotic concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid in humans for cefuroxime, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefmenoxime, cefamandole, cefoperazone, moxalactam, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone indicates that, with the exceptions of cefamandole and cefoperazone, all agents appear equivalent. We conclude that the choice of cephalosporin for the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis should depend mainly on the potency of the agent for the specific meningeal pathogens in question. For the treatment of common meningeal pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis) and for gram-negative bacilli, mainly Escherichia coli and Klebsiella (excluding Pseudomonas aeruginosa), the cefotaxime-ceftriaxone group of cephalosporins has accrued the most clinical experience and the most pharmacokinetic data, while for P. aeruginosa the major interest has centered on ceftazidime.
TI  - Vasculitis complicating cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Twelve patients with skin vasculitis complicating cystic fibrosis are described.  Seven of these were proven histologically and of these two had systemic vascultitis. Staining of vasculitic tissue by the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique using both monoclonal and polyclonal antisera directed against Haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa did not consistently reveal any bacterial antigens in these tissues. In one patient the vasculitis appeared secondary to ranitidine. There was no evidence of autoimmune disease in any of the patients. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were detected in the serum of 40 per cent of the patients with vasculitis complicating cystic fibrosis but in none of 61 controls with cystic fibrosis (but without vasculitis) matched for age and sex and with similar bacteriological flora of sputum.
TI  - In vitro activity of sulbactam in combination with various beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - Forty-three strains (beta-lactamase positive and negative) from the species of Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumanii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied for synergy between sulbactam and several beta-lactam antibiotics. Using a checkerboard method, synergy was observed with 10 to 55% of the beta-lactamase negative strains. Synergy was more frequent with the strains producing beta-lactamase. Using the killing curve method, synergy was also observed between sulbactam and beta-lactam antibiotics against some beta-lactamase negative strains. In addition, the regrowth of a resistant subpopulation was prevented by sulbactam.
TI  - A case of diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) with benign monoclonal IgA gammopathy and IgA nephropathy with monoclonal IgA deposition.
AB  - A case of diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB), associated with benign monoclonal IgA gammopathy and IgA nephropathy is described. The IgA deposition in the glomeruli of the patient was identified as consisting mainly of the monoclonal IgA having the same idiotype as that of serum monoclonal IgA. Recurrent infections of Hemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the respiratory tract might have enhanced IgA-mediated immunity at the mucosal surface of the bronchiole, and ultimately induced monoclonal IgA gammopathy and IgA nephropathy.
TI  - In vitro activity of PD 117596-2, a broad-spectrum difluoroquinolone.
AB  - The activity of PD 117596-2, a novel quinolone, was compared to that of other quinolones, ceftazidime, imipenem and gentamicin. PD 117596-2 inhibited most Enterobacteriaceae at concentrations less than 0.25 micrograms/ml, being equal or superior in activity to ciprofloxacin and 2- to 4-fold more active than ofloxacin. It inhibited ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp. and Serratia marcescens. The MIC90 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including strains with imipenem MICs of 8 micrograms/ml and gentamicin MICs greater than 16 micrograms/ml, was 0.25 micrograms/ml. PD 117596-2 was more active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas cepacia and Pseudomonas maltophilia, and it inhibited Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae at less than 0.03 micrograms/ml. PD 117596-2 inhibited staphylococci at 0.5 micrograms/ml, being 2-fold superior to other quinolones, and with an MIC of 0.25 micrograms/ml was more active against group A, B, C and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae. MICs for Bacteroides spp. were 2 micrograms/ml compared to 8-32 micrograms/ml for other agents. The frequency of spontaneous resistance was low (less than 10(-10]. Differences in MICs and MBCs were within one dilution, and there was a minimal effect of inoculum size. Although PD 117596-2 was less active at pH 5.5, MICs were less than 0.5 micrograms/ml.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates to aztreonam].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of 9 antibiotics including aztreonam (AZT) against clinically isolated Gram-negative bacteria were determined using MIC-2000 plus system. Bacteria were isolated from clinical materials in Saga Medical School during a period from May 1987 to March 1988. Summarized results were as follows: 1. AZT showed excellent antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp. and Haemophilus influenzae, and MIC80 values of AZT against these organisms were lower than 0.20 microgram/ml. 2. Antibacterial activities of AZT were superior to cephem antibiotics compared against Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. 3. The MIC50 and MIC80 of AZT against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 12.5 micrograms/ml and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. 4. AZT did not show any antibacterial activity against Acinetobacter sp. and Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial properties of cefetamet and in vivo activity of its orally absorbable ester derivative, cefetamet pivoxil.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefetamet, the microbiologically active metabolite of the orally administered prodrug cefetamet pivoxil, was compared with that of cephalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime and amoxicillin. Cefetamet was highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria spp., Vibrio spp., Haemophilus influenzae and streptococci other than enterococci. Cefetamet inhibited cefaclor-resistant species such as Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Providencia rettgeri and Serratia marcescens. Staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and cephalosporinase-overproducing strains of Enterobacter cloacae were resistant to cefetamet. The superior activity of cefetamet compared with older oral beta-lactam antibiotics against a large number of gram-negative pathogens correlated with enhanced stability towards beta-lactamases. In accordance with the in vitro findings, cefetamet pivoxil showed good activity in experimental infections in the mouse and rat, suggesting satisfactory bioavailability in these animals after oral administration.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Ro 23-9424, a novel ester-linked codrug of fleroxacin and desacetylcefotaxime.
AB  - Ro 23-9424 is a novel ester-linked codrug of fleroxacin (Ro 23-6240; AM-833) and  the cefotaxime metabolite desacetylcefotaxime. Its potency was determined against over 1,000 organisms and found to be intermediate between those of the two components. More than 99% of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by greater than or equal micrograms of Ro 23-9424 per ml; its MIC for 50% of strains tested ranged from greater than or equal to 0.06 to 1 micrograms/ml. Staphylococci, streptococci, Branhamella catarrhalis, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Bacillus spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and the pathogenic Neisseria spp., including oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactamase-producing strains, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, were also inhibited by Ro 23-9424. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp., and Bacteroides fragilis group isolates were more refractory to Ro 23-9424 (the MIC for 90% of strains tested was less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml). Overall, Ro 23-9424 inhibited 97% of the aerobic strains, compared with 90% for ceftazidime and 92% for cefoperazone. Ro 23-9424 was bactericidal, was relatively stable to inoculum effects on MICs at 10(7) CFU/ml, and was determined to be highly active against organisms resistant to fluoroquinolones or ceftazidime. Preliminary quality control guidelines were determined, and a 30-micrograms disk concentration appears to be the most usable form.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new fluorinated 4-quinolone, QA-241.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, QA-241, 9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-5-methyl-8(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl) -1,7-dioxo-1 H,5H-benzo[ii]quinolizine-2-carboxylic hydrochloride, was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamicin. QA-241 inhibited 90% of isolates of Enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. It was two-fold and four- to 16-fold less active than ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. QA-241 was less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas species than ciprofloxacin. Most Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.03 microgram/ml. The MIC for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, was 1 microgram/ml, as was that for S. epidermidis. For streptococci, including Streptococcus faecalis, the MIC90 was 4 micrograms/ml. QA-241 had minimal activity against anaerobic species. The frequency of spontaneous resistance was less than 10(-9) for members of the Enterobacteriaceae. However, resistant strains could be isolated by repeated subculture. Similar to other quinolones, its activity was less at an acid pH and in the presence of high Mg2+ concentrations. QA-241 showed a good postantibiotic suppressive effect on Escherichia coli.
TI  - Lomefloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone. Studies on in vitro antimicrobial spectrum,  potency, and development of resistance.
AB  - Lomefloxacin (NY-198; SC-47111), a potent new difluoroquinolone, was studied to compare its in vitro activity with that of other antimicrobials against 2194 clinical isolates. Lomefloxacin showed excellent inhibitory and bactericidal activity against strains of Enterobacteriaceae and inhibited greater than 99% of the isolates at a concentration of 4 micrograms/ml or less. Lomefloxacin exhibited good-to-moderate activity against strains of Acinetobacter (MIC90 4 micrograms/ml) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 8 micrograms/ml), but poor activity for Pseudomonas cepacia (MIC90 greater than 16 micrograms/ml). Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates, both oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were susceptible (MIC90 1 micrograms/ml) to lomefloxacin and the other fluoroquinolones. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae, (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml) Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.03 micrograms/ml), and Branhamella catarrhalis (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.03 micrograms/ml) were highly susceptible to lomefloxacin. Streptococcal isolates, especially viridans streptococci, were considerably less susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. Overall, lomefloxacin had comparable activity to norfloxacin, fleroxacin, and ofloxacin, and against many facultative anaerobes lomefloxacin was more active than imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, aztreonam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. Development of resistance to lomefloxacin by spontaneous mutation was low and comparable to that of other fluoroquinolones. Growth in subinhibitory concentrations resulted in increased resistance to fluoroquinolones for selected test strains.
TI  - Two Haemophilus influenzae Rd genes that complement the recA-like mutation rec-1.
AB  - Two Haemophilus influenzae Rd genes each complemented the pleiotropic defects of  the recA-like mutation rec-1. One gene, fec, was isolated on a 3.6-kilobase-pair EcoRI restriction fragment by complementation of the Fec- phenotype of bacteriophage lambda. The other gene, rec, was identified on a 3.1-kilobase-pair EcoRI fragment by Southern hybridization by using recA-like gene probes from Erwinia carotovora and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO. In a rec-1 strain of H. influenzae, the cloned genes restored resistance to UV irradiation, transformation by chromosomal DNA, and spontaneous release of HP1 prophage to wild-type levels. The fec and rec genes were located on the cloned segments by insertion and deletion mutagenesis and subcloning. The restriction endonuclease cleavage maps of the two DNAs were similar but not identical. Southern hybridization demonstrated that the two EcoRI restriction fragments contained homologous DNA sequences, but a fec gene-specific probe was prepared. Each gene encoded a 38,000-dalton polypeptide.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - The in vitro activity of tigemonam: a comparison with other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The activity of tigemonam was compared with that of aztreonam, cefuroxime, cephalexin, amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium, gentamicin, and ofloxacin, using an agar dilution method. Tigemonam was active against strains containing known beta-lactamases of Tem and Oxa types, but strains containing broad-spectrum (group IV) enzymes were less susceptible. The MIC90 of tigemonam against the common Enterobacteriaceae was less than or equal to 0.25 mg/L. The MIC90S against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were 0.5 and 0.06 mg/L, respectively. Pseudomonas, staphylococci, and Bacteroides sp. were less susceptible (MIC90 greater than 128 mg/L). Protein binding in human serum was found to be 62.5%; the presence of serum had only a modest effect on the activity of tigemonam.
TI  - Opsonic activity of a new intravenous immunoglobulin preparation: Pentaglobin compared with sandoglobulin.
AB  - Standard preparations of immunoglobulin for intravenous use consist predominantly of IgG (greater than 95%). We have compared the ability of a standard preparation (Sandoglobulin) with that of a new preparation (Pentaglobin, containing 12% IgM and 12% IgA) to improve the opsonic activity of antibody-deficient human sera in vitro. Panhypogammaglobulinaemic sera were poorly opsonic for five of six organisms tested, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae, but opsonized Staphylococcus aureus almost normally. Both immunoglobulin preparations significantly improved the opsonic activity of the antibody-deficient sera for most organisms. The major difference between the two preparations was the ability of Pentaglobin to supply opsonins for P. aeruginosa, E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, while Sandogloblin was significantly more potent in opsonins for Haemophilus influenzae. Pentaglobin demonstrates significant in vitro opsonic activity, particularly for enterobacteria (coliforms) and P. aeruginosa. Its content of IgM antibodies appears to confer special properties on Pentaglobin not seen with standard preparations of immunoglobulin for intravenous use. Its place in clinical practice remains to be determined but it may have a possible role in augmenting host defence mechanisms in Gram-negative septicaemia.
TI  - Coumamidines, new broad spectrum antibiotics of the cinodine type. III. Microbiologic activity of coumamidine gamma 1.
AB  - The coumamidines are novel antibiotics with activity against a wide spectrum of aerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. All microbiological studies were performed on coumamidine gamma 1. The MIC90s (micrograms/ml) of coumamidine are as follows: Staphylococcus aureus 1.0, Streptococcus pyogenes 8, Enterobacteriaceae 2.0, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli 1, Legionella pneumophila 8, Haemophilus influenzae 0.5, Neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. Coumamidine had MICs ranging from 8 to greater 0.5, Neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. Coumamidine had MICs ranging from 8 to greater than 64 for most anaerobes, except some Peptostreptococcus strains. The aminoglycoside super-sensitive strain, P. aeruginosa BMH 10, was also super-sensitive to coumamidine (MIC 0.2 micrograms/ml). Coumamidine was rapidly bactericidal for S. aureus. The viable bacterial count in logarithmic phase cultures was reduced to less than 10 cfu within 2 hours after exposure to 4 times the MIC (3.12 micrograms/ml) of coumamidine. The frequency of resistance development was less than 1 X 10(-9) for Escherichia coli and S. aureus when selected at 4 and 8 times the MIC. The Cmax in mouse serum after a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg/kg of coumamidine was 4.5 micrograms/ml and t1/2 was 1 hour. Coumamidine is stable in serum. In mouse protection tests against S. aureus NCTC 10649 the ED50 was less than 0.6 mg/kg/day when it was administered subcutaneously at 1 and 5 hours after infection. Coumamidine was not absorbed after oral administration. The antibacterial spectrum, bactericidal activity, stability in serum and low frequency of resistance make this an interesting new class of antibiotics.
TI  - In-vitro activity of a new penem FCE 22101.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of a new penem FCE 22101 was evaluated in comparison with other antimicrobial agents against 966 aerobic and anaerobic Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. FCE 22101 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, H. ducreyi, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis and group B streptococcus at concentrations of 0.12-4.0 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant with MIC90 of greater than 32 mg/l. Streptococcus faecalis displayed MIC90 of 16 mg/l. Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium spp., Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited at concentrations of 0.25-2.0 mg/l. beta-Lactamase-producing or methicillin resistant bacteria did not have significantly elevated MICs. FCE 22101 was generally less active than imipenem but more active than other beta-lactam antibiotics examined.
TI  - [Therapy of chronic recurrent respiratory tract infections].
AB  - In 1987, the most frequently identified pathogens in chronic respiratory tract infections in our clinic were Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Branhamella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Recurrent infection is a common phenomenon in patients with chronic respiratory tract infections, including chronic bronchitis, chronic bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis. H. influenzae is the most common pathogen in such patients. Macrolides, tetracyclines and new quinolones were effective to protect against recurrent infection of H. influenzae and these finding suggested that L-forms of H. influenzae may be significant in the recurrence of infection in patients with chronic respiratory tract infection. Bacterial colonization of the oropharynx is the initial event in most lower respiratory tract infections. Gargling protects against bacteria colonization of the oropharynx and occurrence of acute exacerbation.
TI  - Role of fluoroquinolones in lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Oral quinolones such as ciprofloxacin are promising agents in the treatment of serious bronchopulmonary infections due to susceptible gram-negative micro-organisms such as Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and even Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Their moderative activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae may limit the use of these agents in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and in the empiric management of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Further prospectively designed studies are needed to address this issue. The ability of quinolones to effectively penetrate bronchial mucosa and to be concentrated within macrophages may afford additional advantage to these agents. They should not be used as a sole agent in the treatment of aspiration pneumonia nor anaerobic pleuropulmonary disease. Quinolones are very active in experimental models of Legionnaire's disease and deserve further clinical study. Ciprofloxacin is a promising alternative to standard parenteral drugs in the management of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in adults with cystic fibrosis. The potential for drug interactions with theophylline must be kept in mind for patients on both of these drugs.
TI  - [The ratios and kinds of clinical bacteria isolated in Taiwan's large-size hospitals].
AB  - The prevalence of clinical bacteria, as isolated from Linko Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital (2,300 beds) in the period January 1985 to December 1986 and from Taipei Veterans General Hospital (2,300 beds) during the period January 1986 to December 1986, was analyzed with the following findings: (i) The isolation ratio of anaerobic and aerobic or facultative bactria during the period of investigation were 7.8% (5,513/70,799) and 92.2% (65,286/70,799), respectively. (ii) Of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were Gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were Gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) Of these Gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were Enterobacteriaceae were Enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious Gram negative bacilli. (iv) The more common species among the members of Enterobacteriaceae were Escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and Klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). The other common species included Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii and Proteus vulgaris. The frequencies of Salmonella species and Shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. The most common isolate among other glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli was Aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). The finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) Vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in Taiwan. (v) Of these glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) Acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) Pseudomonas species. (vi) The most common bacteria among fastidious Gram negative bacilli was Haemophilus influenzae, 96.2% (1,154/1,200). (vii) Of these Gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) N. meningitidis. (viii) The more common isolates of Gram positive bacilli included Bacillus species and Corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) Of these Gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively. The most common isolate among Gram positive cocci was Staphylococcus aureus, 30.2% (5,994/19,847); the next, enterococcus, 24.9% (4,936/19,847); then S. epidermidis, 22.2% (4,390/19,847). The less common isolates were Streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and S. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Cefixime, in-vitro activity, pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of cefixime was studied with clinical isolates and compared with that of other agents. Cefixime exhibited good activity against the Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase producing strains. Activity was also high against Streptococcus pneumoniae and group A and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci. Staphylococcus aureus, faecal streptococci, anaerobic bacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not susceptible. Activity against susceptible isolates was comparable to cefotaxime and was normally superior to cefuroxime, cephalexin and amoxycillin. The pharmacokinetics of cefixime were studied in six healthy male volunteers, each receiving a 400 mg oral dose following an overnight fast. Tissue penetration of the antibiotic was estimated with a cantharides-induced blister method. The mean serum elimination half-life was 3.8 h, the mean peak concentration was 3.7 mg/l. Penetration into tissue fluid was rather slow [Tmax 6.7 h) but percentage penetration was high (132.6%). Urinary excretion was low with a 24 h recovery rate of less than 20%, though the concentrations achieved in urine exceeded the MICs of most common urinary tract pathogens for up to 24 h post-dose.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of SM-7338, a carbapenem antibiotic with stability to dehydropeptidase I.
AB  - SM-7338, a new carbapenem antibiotic, was demonstrated to have potent antibacterial activity against a broad spectrum of aerobes, including Staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria spp., members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp., and gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes in a collection of 1,102 unselected clinical isolates. At a concentration of 0.5 micrograms/ml, SM-7338 inhibited 90% of these strains. The spectrum of activity of ceftazidime and cefotaxime was more limited, and many of the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. were resistant to these agents, piperacillin, or gentamicin. A collection of ofloxacin-resistant strains was inhibited by SM-7338 or imipenem at 4 micrograms/ml. SM-7338 was more active than metronidazole and clindamycin against anaerobes. Of the carbapenems, imipenem had greater activity against staphylococci but SM-7338 was much more active against Haemophilus, Branhamella, and Neisseria spp. and all genera of Enterobacteriaceae tested. The MIC of SM-7338 for 90% of these strains ranged from less than or equal to 0.008 to 0.13 micrograms/ml. When tested against 124 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, SM-7338 inhibited 76% at 0.5 microgram/ml but imipenem inhibited only 15% at this concentration. Both carbapenems exhibited similar activities against Bacteroides spp., but SM-7338 was more active than imipenem against Clostridium spp. The MBC of SM-7338 was most commonly the same as or twice the MIC. SM-7338 and imipenem showed excellent activities against bacteria elaborating chromosome- or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, including those conferring resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins. The activity of SM-7338 was generally unaffected by the culture medium used, pH, 25% human serum, and inoculum size, but the susceptibility of Xanthomonas maltophilia was medium dependent.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a new difluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a new difluoroquinolone, was compared with that of norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and ceftazidime against a total of 577 recent clinical isolates. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure, and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) CFU) were used throughout. Lomefloxacin inhibited most species of the Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains) and Haemophilus influenzae at less than or equal to 1 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC 90, 4 mg/l) was somewhat more resistant, and Pseudomonas maltophilia (MIC 90, 16 mg/l) and the Bacteroides fragilis group (MIC 90, 32 mg/l) were considerably more resistant. Overall, lomefloxacin was as active as norfloxacin, but was two- to eightfold less active than ciprofloxacin against most species tested.
TI  - [Broncho-alveolar lavage by fibroscopy in immunodepressed children].
AB  - Thirty broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) were performed in order to investigate 30 infectious episodes in immunocompromised children. Twenty patients were previously treated by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation and 6 other patients by conventional methods. A specific etiologic diagnosis was obtained in 16 of 30 episodes (56%), 22 microorganisms were identified by BAL. The most frequently involved microorganism was Candida albicans and the other agents were as follows: 3 cytomegalovirus, 2 Pneumococcus, 2 Pneumocystis carinii, 1 Aspergillosis, 1 syncytial respiratory virus, 1 myxovirus, 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 1 Haemophilus influenzae and 1 Escherichia coli. In 5 cases, more than 2 agents were involved. This study emphasizes the diagnostic interest of BAL for infectious diseases of the immunocompromised child. BAL appears to be a non invasive, rapid and reproducible method, and a useful therapeutic approach in the treatment of infectious episodes occurring in grafted children where several microorganisms could be involved at the same time.
TI  - Aztreonam in the treatment of gram-negative meningitis and other gram-negative infections.
AB  - Ninety patients (41 males, 49 females) with a diagnosis of meningitis, urinary tract infection (UTI), gastroenteritis or other miscellaneous gram-negative infections were enrolled. Their ages ranged from 7 days to 10 years, with a mean age of 4 months. 58 (63%) patients had an etiology confirmed by either positive culture (52; 89%) or latex agglutination (6; 10%). 41 of these patients had meningitis diagnosed by positive CSE culture (38) or by positive CSF latex agglutination (3); 27/41 patients also had positive blood cultures. Aztreonam MIC100 for 27 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, all ampicillin-sensitive, was 0.19 micrograms/ml; 4 Salmonella sp., 1 Neisseria meningitidis and 1 Serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by 0.19 micrograms/ml, and the MIC100 for 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 Proteus vulgaris and 2 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were 0.045 and 0.19, 0.022 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Endobronchial infection in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - In symptomatic patients with cystic fibrosis, the recovery of bacteria in an inflammatory exudate from the lower respiratory tract is strong evidence of endobronchitis. It is not known when this chronic infection begins, the etiologic agents during infancy or the mechanism of evolution from Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antibiotic administration to "suppress" the infection in relatively well patients is an unproven benefit. During an exacerbation of bronchitis, administration of appropriate antibiotics decreases sputum bacterial density and is accompanied by decreased amounts of indicators of inflammation in sputum: pulmonary function improves, particularly that reflecting medium to small airway status. In the future aggressive diagnostic procedures will be followed by therapeutic and prophylactic antibiotic administration conducted in a manner to minimize emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Adjunctive therapy, to minimize those aspects of the host response which inflict lung damage, will become standard.
TI  - [Clinically relevant pathogens isolated from blood cultures of inpatient treated  children (1972 to 1985)].
AB  - Blood cultures are extremely useful in diagnosing various bacteremic diseases in  childhood. The results obtained in this study are presented in relation to two periods of equal length (1972-1978, 1979-1985). At the present time there are about 22 relevant isolates from blood cultures per 1000 admitted children and year in the Department of Pediatrics, and about 3 isolates per 1000 admitted children and year in the Department of Pediatric Surgery, respectively. From newborns we isolated most frequently E. coli, Staph. aureus, B-Streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and yeasts. From children beyond the first month of life Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci, Neisseria meningitidis, and Staph. aureus were the most frequent identified etiologic agents. The main factors influencing the spectrum of agents causing bacteremia are: age of patients, status of hospitals, and applicated diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin in vitro compared with that of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin, a pseudo-disaccharide aminoglycoside antibiotic, was compared with those of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin using clinical isolates of four Gram-positive and sixteen Gram-negative bacteria. Dactimicin was more active than the reference amino-glycosides against Serratia marcescens, especially gentamicin-resistant Serratia sp., Proteus vulgaris, P. rettgeri and Klebsiella oxytoca, but less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. Dactimicin was equally active as the references excepting netilmicin against Gram-positive bacteria and some Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogens, E. cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Campylobacter jejunii. Dactimicin was active against resistant strains possessing various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes including AAC(3)-1, by which dactimicin was acetylated.

TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. It displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (CFIX), cefaclor (CCL) or cephalexin (CEX) against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci including Staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the Streptococcus group. Moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, FK482 had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of CFIX but superior to that of CCL or CEX. However, it was clearly inferior to CFIX in activity against Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strains of S. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to FK482. All tested strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to CCL and CEX were susceptible to FK482, as were all the strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (AMPC). FK482, like CFIX, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except Bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of CCL or CEX. The antibacterial activity of FK482 against CSH2 strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. FK482 showed higher affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (3, 2 and 1) of S. aureus than did CFIX, CCL and CEX. FK482 also showed very high affinity for the PBPs (2 and 3) of E. faecalis and PBPs (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of E. coli. The bactericidal activity of FK482 against S. aureus was almost as strong as that of AMPC and superior to that of CCL or CEX. Against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, FK482 was similar to CFIX and superior to CCL and CEX in bactericidal activity.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of cefpodoxime, cefixime, and ceftriaxone.
AB  - Cefpodoxime, cefixime, and ceftriaxone inhibited Branhamella catarrhalis at less  than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, beta-hemolytic streptococci at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml, Neisseria meningitidis at less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml, and Haemophilus influenzae (other than beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant isolates) at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml. The MICs for 50% of isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae other than Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml for all three cephalosporins. The MICs of each cephalosporin for 90% of staphylococci, enterococci, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were greater than 16 micrograms/ml. Inoculum effects were noted with cefpodoxime and cefixime with beta-lactamase-positive H. influenzae.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin and other antimicrobials against 597 microorganisms causing bacteremia.
AB  - The in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a new fluorinated quinolone antimicrobial, was compared to that of enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and tobramycin against 597 microorganisms isolated from bacteremic patients at a university hospital. Overall, lomefloxacin had activity similar to that of enoxacin and norfloxacin but less than that of ofloxacin. Lomefloxacin had excellent activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae, and good activity against staphylococci, including oxacillin-resistant strains, as well as many strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. maltophilia, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus anitratus ssp anitratus.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of monobactams against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of monobactam antibiotics (carumonam (CRMN) and aztreonam (AZT] against Gram-negative bacilli isolated from inpatients in the latter half of 1987 were investigated using penicillin (PC: piperacillin (PIPC], cephems (CEPs: ceftazidime (CAZ), cefotaxime (CTX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefsulodin (CFS], carbapenem (imipenem (IPM] and pyridonecarboxylic acids (norfloxacin (NFLX) and ofloxacin (OFLX] as reference antibiotics. A total of 400 strains of 13 species, i.e. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae, were used as test strains. 1. CRMN and AZT, both monobactam antibiotics, were roughly comparable in their activities and no resistant strain to these antibiotics were found among isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., M. morganii, P. rettgeri or H. influenzae and few resistant strains were observed among isolates of S. marcescens. On the other hand, isolates of C. freundii, Enterobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa included rather numerous strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. Among these cases, whereas R strains, i.e. resistant strains showing MICs greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion of strains resistant to PC and CEPs, I strains, i.e. intermediately resistant strains showing MICs between 12.5 and 25 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion of strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. 2. Strains resistant to PIPC, a PC, were detected with high and more or less uniform frequencies over the entire spectrum of the isolates examined. 3. Antibacterial activities of CEPs varied against different bacterial species. While strains resistant to CTX, CAZ and LMOX were commonly detected with high frequencies among isolates of C. freundii, Enterobacter spp. and S. marcescens, large percentages of LMOX-resistant strains of C. freundii and Enterobacter spp. were of the I type. CTX-resistant strains were also found among isolates of P. vulgaris and M. morganii. Proportions of CEP-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were 28% for CFS and 12% for CAZ. 4. No or few strains among the isolates of 13 species investigated were resistant to IPM, a carbapenem antibiotic, which showed the most stable antibacterial activity, but it was less active than monobactam antibiotics and CEPs against Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis and H. influenzae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Bacterial keratitis after penetrating keratoplasty.
AB  - Bacterial keratitis continues to be a serious problem in developing countries. The authors studied 881 patients who had undergone penetrating keratoplasty (total of 947 procedures) from January 1983 to March 1986 at the King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, Riyadh, Saudia Arabia. All patients were followed for at least 6 months. Clinical evidence of bacterial keratitis developed in 113 (11.9%) eyes with penetrating keratoplasties in 108 patients. The causative organisms among those patients included: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 29 (26%); Staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 (21%); Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 13 (12%); Staphylococcus aureus, 5 (4%); Hemophilus influenzae, 5 (4%); Moraxella spp, 5 (4%); alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, 5 (4%); and other bacteria, 27 (25%). In addition, postoperative epithelial defects that required hospital admission for treatment developed in 21 (2.2%) patients. Herpetic keratitis developed in three (0.3%) patients and fungal keratitis developed in 1 (0.1%). Statistically significant predisposing risk factors included: trichiasis (P less than 0.0001), epithelial defects (P less than 0.0001), soft contact lens wear (P less than 0.0001), and eroding sutures (P less than 0.0001). The authors believe that the incidence of postoperative bacterial keratitis can be minimized or avoided by appropriate selection of patients for penetrating keratoplasties as well as good preoperative and postoperative management of associated ocular conditions.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cefoperazone. Evaluation of disc susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - To interpret of the cefoperazone (CPZ) disc susceptibility test, a 4 category system is used in Japan, but a 3 category system is used in the U.S.A. and Europe. In the 4 category interpretation system of Showa CPZ disc the following classification is used: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3 approximately 15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15 approximately 60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. In the 3 category system the classification used is as follows: susceptible MIC less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible MIC greater than 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, resistant MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, or susceptible MIC less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible MIC greater than 32 approximately 64 micrograms/ml, resistant MIC greater than 64 micrograms/ml, depending on dose levels, 1 or 2 g. Reliability of the CPZ disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate MICs by classifying the test results into 4 categories was studied using discs containing 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 and 75 micrograms. The MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. A good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters and MICs, showing reliability of the test using these discs. The results obtained with discs containing 30 or 75 micrograms of CPZ were well categorized into the 4 groups mentioned above. Some strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, however, showed false positive results. When different break points of inhibitory zone diameters than those used for other bacteria were used for P. aeruginosa, and E. faecalis was excluded from the test, an excellent correlations were obtained. With 30 or 75 micrograms discs, it was unable to subclassify strains against which MICs of CPZ were below 3 micrograms/ml. However, with discs containing 1 to 10 micrograms, it was possible to separate the strains against which MICs were less than 0.5 microgram/ml. The fact that most frequent values of MICs of CPZ against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes etc. were less than 0.5 microgram/ml supports the usefulness of low dose discs. According to recently ongoing concepts on the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics and their penetration into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding appear to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. Only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except into hepatic biliary system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cefuzonam. Evaluation of disc susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - In vitro activities of cefuzonam (CZON) against 273 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of MIC's and the results of disc susceptibility test. The MIC's were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6)CFU/ml. The MIC80's of CZON against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Haemophilus influenzae and Citrobacter spp. were less than 0.20 microgram/ml. The MIC80's against Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes were both 6.25 micrograms/ml, and that against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100 micrograms/ml. The MIC80's against Staphy-lococcus epidermidis were 25 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Approximately 70% of strains of S. aureus were inhibited at concentrations less than 1.56 microgram/ml. For the interpretation of the CZON Showa 30 micrograms disc susceptibility test a 4 category system was used. In the 4 category system for Showa disc containing CZON, the following classification inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC less than 60 micrograms/ml. Reliability of the CZON disc tests in estimating approximate MIC values was studied using Showa 30 micrograms discs and discs prepared in this laboratory containing 1-10 micrograms CZON. A good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters and MIC's, showing the reliability of the disc method. The results of the test using Showa 30 micrograms disc against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups except those against P. aeruginosa. Some strains of P. aeuruginosa showed false positive results, exhibiting relatively larger inhibitory zone diameters compared with MIC's against these organisms. As CZON is not effective against P. aeruginosa a much better overall correlation between MIC's and the disc test would result when P. aeruginosa was excluded. With Showa 30 micrograms discs of various cephalosporins, sub-classification of strains with MIC less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. In this study, however, it was demonstrated that differentiation of strains with MIC's less than 0.5-1.56 micrograms/ml was possible when discs containing 1-10 micrograms of CZON were used. According to recent concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Efficacy and safety of cefpirome (HR810).
AB  - Sixty adult patients with suspected systemic bacterial infections were treated with cefpirome 1 g or 2 g twice daily for 5-22 days. Forty-seven patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy. Diagnoses in evaluable patients were urinary tract infections (20), pneumonia (10), soft tissue infections (17), and bone and joint infections (4); four patients had two infections each. Nine patients were bacteraemic and all were cured; the responsible bacteria were Escherichia coli (6), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), and Haemophilus influenzae (1). One patient with a soft tissue infection failed to respond clinically to cefpirome. Bacteriologically, 41 of 48 isolated pathogens (85%) were eradicated. In wound cultures, three strains of Staphylococcus aureus and one each of Ps. aeruginosa and Str. faecalis persisted. One Enterobacter sp. relapsed in urine. Of isolated strains, only Str. faecalis and methicillin resistant Staph, epidermidis were resistant to cefpirome. Staph, aureus strains were inhibited in vitro by 0.25 to 2 mg/l of cefpirome in agar dilution. Adverse effects, probably or possibly related to cefpirome, were skin reactions (3), fever (1), Clostridium difficile diarrhoea (2), and disturbed taste sensation (1). Tolerance was good. Cefpirome is suitable for large-scale comparative trials.
TI  - Effect of excimer laser on microbiological organisms.
AB  - The effect of radiation emitted from an excimer laser filled with argon fluoride  gas at 193 nm on Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger (collectively labeled "the microorganisms") was examined. Colonies were subjected to a variable number of radiation pulses from the excimer laser applied after a 36-hour period of incubation at 37 degrees C, at which time the colonies were fully grown and showed no viability. The lack of viability was confirmed with a subculture from each area that received radiation; all subcultures were negative. The characteristics of the radiation paralleled those used by Serdavic, Darrell, Krueger, et al in 1985.(1) This radiation treatment is believed to be within a therapeutic range, which suggests that the excimer laser, pending further investigation, may be useful in the treatment of corneal infections.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of fleroxacin, a new fluorinated quinolone.
AB  - The in-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activities of fleroxacin were compared with those of other new quinolones including NY-198. Fleroxacin showed potent activity against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae, and good activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococci. Against these bacteria, the activity of fleroxacin was roughly comparable to that of norfloxacin, enoxacin, NY-198, and ofloxacin, but slightly less than that of ciprofloxacin. Fleroxacin strongly inhibited DNA supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase purified from Escherichia coli which may explain its high antibacterial activity. The protective effects of a single oral dose of fleroxacin in mice were greater than those of norfloxacin and comparable to or greater than that of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and NY-198 against systemic infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Esch. coli and Ps. aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens.
TI  - An in vitro evaluation of HRE 664, a novel penem antibiotic.
AB  - HRE 664 is a novel parenteral penem with a broad antimicrobial spectrum. In this  study, HRE 664 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml, oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci at less than or equal to 0.13 microgram/ml, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, enterococci at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, and streptococci at less than or equal to 0.13 microgram/ml. All strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant (MICs were greater than 32 micrograms/ml). HRE 664 exhibited a minimal inoculum effect and good bactericidal activity with all organisms tested except an oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. With the latter, there was a marked inoculum effect and no on-scale bactericidal endpoints. No measurable hydrolysis of HRE 664 occurred with any of the five Gram-negative bacterial beta-lactamases tested. When stored at -20 degrees C, HRE 664 showed no significant loss of activity for up to 6 wk, but detectable deterioration occurred thereafter. At -60 degrees C, no loss in HRE 664 potency was observed for up to 12 wk. Proposed HRE 664 MIC quality control parameters are: 0.03-0.13 microgram/ml for S. aureus ATCC 29213, 0.25-1.0 micrograms/ml for Escherichia coli 25922, and 2.0-8.0 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212.
TI  - In vitro activities of PD 117,596 and reference antibiotics against 448 clinical  bacterial strains.
AB  - The in vitro activity of PD 117,596, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic, was tested against 448 bacterial isolates (15 genera) by agar dilution (inoculum, 10(4) CFU per spot). The activity of PD 117,596 was compared with that of 15 antibiotics against 327 gram-negative strains and with that of 8 other antibiotics against 121 gram-positive strains. PD 117,596 demonstrated the best activity against Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, and Branhamella catarrhalis (MICs for 90% of the isolates [MIC90S], 0.008 to 0.25 microgram/ml). PD 117,596 (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml) was at least twofold more active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas spp. PD 117,596 and ciprofloxacin were similar in activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Legionella pneumophila, and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 0.002 to 0.125 microgram/ml). PD 117,596 was more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcal groups A, B, C, and G, S. pneumoniae, and enterococci (MIC90S, 0.06 to 0.125 microgram/ml). Against Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, PD 117,596 (MIC90S, 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml) was 4- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and was most active against Corynebacterium spp. PD 117,596 appears to be the most active fluoroquinolone to date, with excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria and enhanced activity against gram-negative aerobic-facultative bacteria.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of tigemonam, a new monobactam.
AB  - The in-vitro activity against Gram-negative aerobic bacterial pathogens of a new  oral monobactam, tigemonam, was compared with those of amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, aztreonam, cefaclor, ceftazidime, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin, by an agar-dilution method. Tigemonam inhibited 90% of strains tested of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., Salmonella spp., Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis at concentrations of 0.25 mg/l or below. The MIC90 for Enterobacter spp. was 16 mg/l and for Citrobacter 4 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant to tigemonam but susceptible to aztreonam. In comparison with the other oral antibiotics tested, tigemonam was generally more active. Tigemonam showed minimal inoculum dependence, between 10(2) and 10(6) cfu per spot. It is concluded that tigemonam is a candidate for clinical trials in patients with infections caused by Gram-negative aerobes other than pseudomonas and acinetobacter.
TI  - [Clinical experience with ofloxacin in the treatment of chronic respiratory tract disease aggravated by acute infection].
AB  - We studied the clinical usefulness of ofloxacin (OFLX) in 13 patients with chronic respiratory tract diseases aggravated by acute infections with identified causative bacteria. 1. Overall clinical efficacies were: highly effective 5, effective 6, slightly effective 2, and ineffective none, showing an efficacy rate of 84.6%. 2. In 6 patients with fever of over 37 degrees C, time lengths in days for symptoms to have been alleviated due to OFLX treatment were; 1 day: 4 cases, 3 days: 1 case and 5 days: 1 case (2.0 days on average). 3. As to bacterial transitions, in 9 of 10 patients Haemophilus influenzae was eliminated and in 1 patient it was substituted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In 3 patients Branhamella catarrhalis was eliminated and in 1 patient, the number of P. aeruginosa was reduced. OFLX is expected to have a potent bacteriological effect on H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis. 4. As to side effects, 1 of the 13 patients (7.7%) complained of discomfort in the epigastrium. This discomfort disappeared when a gastric mucosa protective agent was administered. There was no abnormality in laboratory test values. Judging from the above results, we consider OFLX a useful drug for the treatment of patients with chronic respiratory tract diseases aggravated by acute infections.
TI  - [Recent trend of incidence of respiratory pathogenic bacteria and its susceptibility to antimicrobial agents: studies in the year 1984-1986].
AB  - Based on a quantitative analysis of sputum cultures, pathogenic bacteria in respiratory ailments isolated in our laboratory during 1984 to 1986 were classified and analyzed. During the study period, the most frequently isolated agent was Haemophilus influenzae followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Branhamella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. They together consisted of 70 approximately 74% of all the respiratory pathogenic bacteria isolated in our study. Susceptibilities of above pathogens to antimicrobial agents were investigated using the agar dilution method. Results are summarized as follows. 1. Ratio of proportion of beta-lactamase producing strains among non beta-lactamase producing strains of H. influenzae markedly decreased in 1986 (6/70, 8.6%) as compared to previous years (11/73, 15.1% in 1984 and 8/49, 16.3% in 1985). In consequence, MIC90 values for penicillins reduced considerably in 1986. Among the antibiotics examined cefmenoxime (CMX) and cefotaxime (CTX) were the most active agents against H. influenzae. A development of resistance to other cephems and new quinolones (norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin) was not evident during the 3-year survey. 2. Against S. pneumoniae, benzylpenicillin was still the most active agent despite gradual increase of frequency of isolation. Ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), CMX and CTX were also potent against S. pneumoniae. S. pneumoniae were frequently isolated from patients treated with new quinolones or minocycline (MINO). This phenomenon may be explained by higher MIC values of these agents against S. pneumoniae. 3. Of B. catarrhalis strains isolated, more than 80% were beta-lactamase positive, although MIC90 were not so high (1.56 micrograms/ml for ABPC and 0.20 micrograms/ml for PIPC). Among the antibiotics tested, latamoxef was the most active agent against B. catarrhalis and inhibited all the strains at a concentration of 0.05 micrograms/ml or less. No resistant strains were observed against cephems, new quinolones, erythromycin or MINO. 4. P. aeruginosa appeared to be rapidly developing resistance against new quinolones in patients with chronic P. aeruginosa respiratory infections who had been treated with these agents. In treating chronic respiratory infection due to P. aeruginosa, one must be watchful of rapid development of resistance by the organism or its replacement with S. pneumoniae.
TI  - A Belgian multicentre in-vitro study of ofloxacin.
AB  - In a large multicentre study, the susceptibility of 2171 bacterial isolates to ofloxacin and other antibiotics has been examined by the Kirby-Bauer method. Susceptibility to ofloxacin (breakpoint less than or equal to 2 mg/l) was observed in 99.2% of 1104 strains Enterobacteriaceae, 88.9% of 217 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 93.6% of 31 other Pseudomonas spp., 96.3% of 27 Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, 99.2% of 118 Haemophilus influenzae, 97.4% of 423 staphylococci, 79.4% of 107 Streptococcus faecalis and 98.7% of 142 other streptococci. There was no relationship between resistance to ofloxacin and resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides or other antibiotics tested within the same bacterial species.
TI  - Many pulmonary pathogenic bacteria bind specifically to the carbohydrate sequence GalNAc beta 1-4Gal found in some glycolipids.
AB  - Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death from infectious disease in the United States. To examine the possible role of carbohydrates as adhesion receptors for infection, several pulmonary pathogenic bacteria were studied for binding to glycosphingolipids. Radiolabeled bacteria were layered on thin-layer chromatograms of separated glycosphingolipids, and bound bacteria were detected by autoradiography. The classic triad of infectious bacteria found in cystic fibrosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus, along with other bacteria commonly implicated in typical pneumonia, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and certain Escherichia coli, bind specifically to fucosylasialo-GM1 (Fuc alpha 1-2Gal beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta 1-4Cer), asialo-GM1 (Gal beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta-1-4Galc beta 1-1Cer), and asialo-GM2 (GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1Cer). Bacteria maintained in nutrient medium bind better than the same cells suspended in buffer. They do not bind to galactosylceramide, glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, trihexosylceramide, globoside, paragloboside, Forssman glycosphingolipid, or several other glycosphingolipids tested, including the gangliosides GM1, GM2, GM3, GD1a, GD1b, GT1b, and Cad. The finding that these pathogens do not bind to lactosylceramide suggests that beta 1-4-linked GalNAc, which is positioned internally in fucosylasialo-GM1 and asialo-GM1 and terminally in asialo-GM2, is required for binding. beta-N-Acetylgalactosamine itself, however, is not sufficient for binding, as the bacteria did not bind to globoside, which contains the terminal sequence GalNAc beta 1-3Gal. These data suggest that these bacteria require at least terminal or internal GalNAc beta 1-4Gal sequences unsubstituted with sialyl residues for binding. Other bacteria, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella species, and some E. coli, do not bind to the GalNAc beta 1-4Gal sequence. The biological relevance of these data is suggested by our finding that substantial amounts of asialo-GM1 occur in human lung tissue.
TI  - Hemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis.

TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo activities of T-3262, a new pyridone carboxylic acid.
AB  - T-3262[p-toluenesulfonic acid salt of dl-7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1, 4-dihydro-4-oxo-1, 8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid monohydrate] is a new pyridone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The activity of T-3262 against most Enterobacteriaceae was comparable with that of ciprofloxacin except Proteus spp. and Providencia rettgeri and exceeded that of ofloxacin and norfloxacin. The activity of T-3262 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was comparable with that of ciprofloxacin, and T-3262 was more active than the other new quinolones against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Branhamella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae, and also against staphylococci, streptococci, and Bacteroides fragilis. The protective effects of a single oral dose of T-3262 on systemic infection in mice were greater than norfloxacin. T-3262 was as effective as ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against systemic infections in an animal model with Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and more active against Ps. aeruginosa infections. T-3262 showed excellent activity against staphylococcal and streptococcal infections.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of PD127,391, a new quinolone.
AB  - MICs of PD127,391 a new 4-quinolone, and of CI934 and ciprofloxacin, two previously reported 4-quinolones, were determined for common clinical bacterial isolates by an agar-dilution method. PD127,391 was the most active drug against Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp (MICs less than 0.12 mg/l) and as active as ciprofloxacin against Aeromonas spp. (MICs less than 0.008 mg/l) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MICs less than 1 mg/l). It was more active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas spp. including Ps. maltophilia (MICs less than 0.25 mg/l). All three drugs had high activity, with PD129,391 again the best, against Haemophilus influenzae Brahmamella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. PD127,391 was much more active than the other drugs against Campylobacter coli/jejuni (PD127,391 MICs less than 0.03 mg/l) and Gardnerella vaginalis (PD127,391 MICs less than 0.25 mg/l). PD127,391 inhibited all staphylococci at less than 0.06 mg/l and streptococci at less than 0.5 mg/l, thus being more active than CI934 or ciprofloxacin. PD127,391 was much more active against anaerobic cocci, Bacteroides spp. and clostridia (including Clostridium difficile) (MICs less than 1 mg/l) than was CI934 (MICs less than 16 mg/l) or ciprofloxacin (MICs less than 64 mg/l). No bacterium that we examined required more than 1 mg/l of PD127,391 for inhibition, and there was no cross resistance with unrelated antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro activity of PD 127,391, an enhanced-spectrum quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of PD 127,391, a dihalogenated quinolone, was compared with those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, and cefuroxime against 525 recent isolates and well-characterized antimicrobial agent-resistant strains. The MICs of PD 127,391 against 90% of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides fragilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria sp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae were less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml. Some 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococci were susceptible to 0.25 micrograms of PD 127,391 per ml. Against most strains, PD 127,391 was 2- to 8-fold more active than ciprofloxacin, but it was 64-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against B. fragilis. Strains of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae which were resistant to nalidixic acid were less susceptible to all of the quinolones tested, including PD 127,391. The MIC and minimum lethal concentration of PD 127,391 against three strains of Chlamydia trachomatis were each 0.06 microgram/ml, and the MIC against 90% of 21 strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was 1 microgram/ml. PD 127,391 was less active at pH 5, its maximal activity being at pH 7 to 8. The presence of urine at pH 5.9 decreased the bactericidal activity. The protein binding of PD 127,391 was 2 to 7%, and serum had little effect on activity.

TI  - In vitro activity of U-76,252 (CS-807), a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - U-76,252 is the prodrug of U-76,253. MICs of U-76,253 were 0.015 to 0.06 microgram/ml for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of Streptococcus spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Proteus mirabilis; 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml for Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Citrobacter diversus; 1 to 8 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus spp.; and 2 to greater than 16 micrograms/ml for other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Aeromonas hydrophila; for 72% of the latter group, MICs were less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. MICs for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis were greater than 16 micrograms/ml.

TI  - Cyclohexane triones, novel membrane-active antibacterial agents.
AB  - The cyclohexane triones are a novel group of synthetic antibacterial agents that  are active against gram-positive bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae, and Mycobacterium smegmatis. In general, these compounds behaved in a manner similar to that of hexachlorophene, inhibiting the transport of low-molecular-weight hydrophilic substances into bacteria. Unlike cationic detergents, such as chlorhexidine, they did not cause disruption of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane over a short time period. The most potent antibacterial cyclohexane trione studied had a reduced ability to inhibit solute transport in comparison with certain less active analogs. Cyclohexane triones may express more than a single type of antibacterial effect.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new fluorinated 4-quinolone, T-3262 (A-60969).
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, T-3262 [A-60969; DL-7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1-, 4-dihydro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid monohydrate], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamicin. T-3262 inhibited 90% of isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. It was two to four times more active than ofloxacin and similarly or slightly less active than ciprofloxacin. Ninety percent of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited at 0.5 micrograms/ml. It was 4- to 8-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 8- to 16-fold more active than ofloxacin against Pseudomonas cepacia and Pseudomonas maltophilia, which were resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. Most Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml. The MIC for 90% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, was 0.12 micrograms/ml; that for Staphylococcus epidermidis was 0.5 micrograms/ml, as was that for Enterococcus faecalis. It inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis isolates at 2 micrograms/ml, considerably more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. The frequency of spontaneous point mutational resistance was less than 10(-10) for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. Resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculture. Similar to other quinolones, its activity could be affected by culture conditions. T-3262 showed a postantibiotic suppressive effect on Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus.
TI  - [Clinical and fundamental studies on intravenous drip infusion of gentamicin in the pediatric field. Pediatric study group of gentamicin].
AB  - A multiclinic study of gentamicin (GM) given by intravenous drip infusion was carried out by the Gentamicin Pediatric Study Group. The results are summarized as follows: 1. Upon intravenous drip infusion of GM at a dose range of 2.0-2.5 mg/kg over a period of 0.5-1 hour, therapeutically effective serum concentrations of 4-12 micrograms/ml were obtained. These values are similar to reported values in previous studies using GM intramuscular injection. 2. High urinary concentrations were observed up to 6 hours after administration, and the urinary recovery rate was approximately 60%. 3. Of a total of 142 cases collected, 117 cases were evaluated. Efficacy rates by diseases were: 100% in pneumonia (30/30), 98.3% in urinary tract infections (59/60), and 92.3% in other infections (skin and soft tissue) (12/13), with an overall efficacy rate of 94.9% (including 77 "excellent" cases). 4. Bacteriological examinations showed high eradication rates with the use of GM; i.e., 80% with Staphylococcus aureus (8/10), 60% with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3/5), 100% with Haemophilus influenzae (7/7) and 97.8% with Escherichia coli (44/45), achieving an overall eradication rate of 92.4%. In mixed infections, the eradication rate was 85.7% (6/7). 5. No ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity or allergic reactions was observed. Abnormal laboratory findings observed were: GOT elevation in 3.1% of cases, GPT elevation in 3.9%, platelet increase in 1.5% and eosinophil increase in 0.8%, thus an overall rate of the appearance of abnormality was 5.6%. The above results indicate that an intravenous drip infusion of GM is a useful method for treating infections in pediatrics.
TI  - In vitro activity of lomefloxacin (SC-47111; NY-198), a difluoroquinolone 3-carboxylic acid, compared with those of other quinolones.
AB  - Lomefloxacin (SC-47111; NY-198) is a new difluoroquinolone agent. It inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Aeromonas spp., Yersinia spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Lomefloxacin inhibited 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 4 micrograms/ml. Lomefloxacin was equal in activity to norfloxacin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae but was twofold less active against Proteus spp., Providencia spp., Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. Ofloxacin was generally 2- to 4-fold more active, and ciprofloxacin was 4- to 16-fold more active. Lomefloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, but MICs for 90% of streptococcal species tested were 8 micrograms/ml. In the presence of 9 mM Mg2+, MICs for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were increased, as they were when they were tested in urine. A single-step increase in resistance to eightfold above the MIC occurred at a frequency of less than 10(-10), but serial transfer of bacteria in the presence of the agent produced MIC increases. Lomefloxacin had activity and properties comparable to those of many of the new quinolones.
TI  - The epidemiology of respiratory tract pathogens in southern Netherlands.
AB  - Results of sputum cultures and susceptibility tests have been reviewed for the years 1977-1986, with approximately 1,700 positive cultures per year. Haemophilus influenzae always occupied the first place, being grown in 65% of positive specimens in 1977 and 37% in 1986. Streptococcus pneumoniae occupied the second place, rising from 17 to 27% in the same period, during which Branhamella catarrhalis rose from 5 to 26%. Based on the frequency of occurrence of individual bacterial species in the sputum cultures and on the percentage of strains resistant to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, doxycycline, erythromycin and ofloxacin, theoretical chances of failure of blind therapy were calculated and found to be most advantageous for ofloxacin and cotrimoxazole. No explanation could be given for the increase in beta-lactamase production by B. catarrhalis, but the disappearance of Haemophilus parainfluenzae may have been due to improvements in the identification procedure.
TI  - In vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial agent, in comparison with those of other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of lomefloxacin (SC-47111; NY-198), a new difluorinated quinolone, was compared with those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fleroxacin, amoxicillin, cefuroxime, and trimethoprim against 585 recent clinical isolates and other strains with known mechanisms of resistance. The MICs of lomefloxacin against 90% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci were between 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml. Ninety percent of Neisseria sp. and Haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml, and streptococci (including Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococci) and Bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to 8 micrograms/ml. Lomefloxacin was comparable in activity to fleroxacin and ofloxacin, but it was less active than ciprofloxacin. There was cross-resistance between the quinolone group of antimicrobial agents. The protein binding of lomefloxacin was 15.4%, and serum had little effect on the activity of the compound. However, urine at pH 5.0 decreased the activity by two- to eightfold compared with that at pH 7.0
TI  - Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in head and neck infection.
AB  - We have summarized our experience in recovery of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (BLPB) in head and neck infection (HNI). These HNI include conjunctivitis, serous and chronic otitis media, cholesteatoma, chronic mastoiditis, chronic sinusitis, adenoiditis, recurrent tonsillitis in children and adults, peritonsillar abscess, and retropharyngeal abscess. Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were found in 262 (51%) of 513 patients with HNI; 72% had aerobic BLPB and 57% had anaerobic BLPB. The infections, where these organisms were most frequently recovered, were adenoiditis (85% of patients), tonsillitis in adults (82%) and children (74%), retropharyngeal abscess (71%), and chronic otitis media (57%). The predominant BLPB were Staphylococcus aureus (49% of patients with BLPB), the Bacteroides-melaninogenicus group (28%), the Bacteroides fragilis group (20%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%), Hemophilus influenzae (5%), and Branhamella catarrhalis (3%). The high incidence of recovery of BLPB in head and neck infections may have important implications on the antimicrobial management of these infections.
TI  - A survey of clinical experience with ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin is a new quinolone antimicrobial agent with activity against a broad spectrum of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci. The efficacy and safety results of 80 clinical studies of the oral form of ciprofloxacin are reported. Drug safety was assessed in 2236 courses in 2203 adult patients treated primarily in the United States. Data from 1676 courses were suitable for analysis of drug efficacy. The unit dose for most patients ranged from 250 mg to 750 mg (median, 500 mg), usually given every 12 hours. The duration of treatment ranged from 3 to 231 days (median, 10 days). Predominant among 1722 infections were those of the urinary tract (43%), skin structures (29%), and respiratory tract (19%); the remainder were bone and joint infections (5%), bacteremias (2%), and intra-abdominal (1%), gastrointestinal (1%), and pelvic infections (less than 1%). Signs and symptoms of infection resolved in 79% of all cases; a further 15% improved, and 5% failed to improve. Pathogens were eradicated in 89% of urinary tract infections and persisted in 5%; 80% of patients still had sterile urine at the 3-to 6-week follow-up. In 81% of nonurinary tract infections, pathogens were eradicated; they persisted in 11%, and superinfection occurred in less than 5%. After treatment, 89% of the 2253 causative organisms were eradicated and 2% were reduced to clinically insignificant counts; 8% persisted. Of 411 isolates of P. aeruginosa, 77% were eradicated, as were 97% of 421 Escherichia coli and 80% of 248 Staphylococcus aureus isolates. Also eradicated were 95% of 166 Klebsiella, 96% of 139 Proteus mirabilis, 100% of 20 other Proteus, 94% of 123 Enterobacter, 100% of 68 Haemophilus influenzae, 96% of 49 Citrobacter, 89% of 45 Serratia, 95% of 41 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 91% of 43 Salmonella, 100% of 38 Morganella morganii, and 100% of 35 Providencia isolates. Adverse reactions were judged probably or possibly drug-related in 14.8% of courses; drug treatment had to be stopped prematurely in 3.5%. The most frequent reactions were gastrointestinal complaints (chiefly nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), metabolic disorders (elevated SGOT, SGPT, serum creatinine, or blood urea nitrogen), and nervous system effects (dizziness, light-headedness, restlessness, tremor, and headache). Crystalluria, judged to be related to ciprofloxacin, occurred in two patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - The new monobactams: chemistry and biology.
AB  - The discovery of the monobactams led to the successful development of aztreonam as the first of this novel class of beta-lactam antibiotics to enter the clinical field. Continued structural modification on the monobactam nucleus has resulted in two additional compounds from this class that show interesting biologic properties. The first, SQ 83,360, is like aztreonam in exhibiting high activity against members of the Enterobacteriaceae but has the added characteristic of being exceptionally active against strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Also, significant gains are made with SQ 83,360 in activity against Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter. The second compound, tigemonam, is also like aztreonam, having good activity against Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae and showing good beta-lactam stability. Tigemonam differs from aztreonam in being well absorbed orally by experimental laboratory animals.
TI  - Enoxacin: in-vitro and animal evaluation as a parenteral and oral agent against hospital bacterial isolates.
AB  - Enoxacin was evaluated in in-vitro tests and in studies of effectiveness and blood concentrations in the mouse. Enoxacin was active against both susceptible and multiresistant hospital isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and staphylococci. Less susceptible were streptococci and anaerobes. Of nine quinolones tested, only norfloxacin was equivalent in vitro. The MBCs of enoxacin were one- to twofold greater than the MICs, and enoxacin was rapidly bactericidal. No single-step resistant mutants could be detected at 10 mg/l against large inocula and six to 11 steps were required for selection of resistant clones. In systemic mouse infections, enoxacin was effective in a single oral or subcutaneous dose against one strain each of Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia rettgeri and Ps. aeruginosa, and two Staphylococcus aureus strains. Single oral and subcutaneous enoxacin doses (50 mg/kg) gave peak mouse blood levels of 4.9 and 9.5 mg/l and an elimination half-life of 1.8 h.
TI  - Enoxacin in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: a comparison with amoxycillin.
AB  - A total of 43 hospitalized adult patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or bronchiectasis due to Gram-negative bacteria were randomized to receive either enoxacin (400 mg bd) or amoxycillin (1,000 mg tid) for 7-12 days. Micro-organisms isolated included 24 Haemophilus influenzae (three beta-lactamases positive), 11 Branhamella catarrhalis (six beta-lactamase positive), two Pseudomonas aeruginosa and two Neisseria meningitidis in 37 evaluable patients. In the enoxacin group (23 patients) 82.6% of the patients were clinically cured or improved against 93% of patients in the amoxycillin group (14 patients). In the enoxacin group 76% of the pathogens were eradicated with two failures (P. aeruginosa), one relapse (H. influenzae) and three superinfections (Streptococcus pneumoniae). In the amoxycillin group, 71% of the pathogens were eradicated with 29% relapses. The differences between the two groups were not statistically significant. An increase in theophylline concentration occurred in 15 of 16 patients receiving simultaneous administration of theophylline, without clinical evidence of toxicity when theophylline dosage was reduced and enoxacin continued. Enoxacin appears to be as effective as amoxycillin in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to susceptible Gram-negative bacteria.

AB  - Collaborated studies on species of respiratory tract infection (RTI)-related organisms for their identification and drug susceptibilities have been carried out since 1981 at about 20 centers in Japan. On this occasion, the data obtained between 1982 and 1985 were reanalyzed to determine whether or not drug susceptibilities differed depending upon diseases, from which the organisms were isolated. The results summarized below were obtained in this study. 1. Among Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa examined, differences in drug susceptibilities according to different diseases were found among S. aureus and also mucoid strains of P. aeruginosa. 2. Susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics was definitely lower in S. aureus strains isolated from pneumonia than in those isolated from chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasia. 3. The isolation frequency of methicillin-and cefazolin-resistant strains of S. aureus was 30.3% and 25.9%, respectively, and was especially high among strains isolated from pneumonia. The antibiotic potency of minocycline against S. aureus, including methicillin resistant S. aureus, was the strongest among 9 drugs examined; S. aureus maintained relatively sufficient sensitivity to dicloxacillin among beta-lactam antibiotics. 4. Mucoid producing strains of P. aeruginosa isolated from chronic bronchitis had slightly lower drug susceptibility than those isolated from bronchiectasia. 5. When drug susceptibilities of H. influenzae were compared among groups separated according to diseases using MIC50, MIC80 and MIC90 as indicators, there were no clear differences. The isolation frequency of ampicillin (ABPC)-resistant strains, however, was clearly different among diseases; namely, resistant strains were the most and the least frequently isolated from chronic bronchitis and from pneumonia, respectively. In addition, the drug susceptibility of H. influenzae isolated in 1985 was analyzed in relation to the production of beta-lactamase. As a result, it was suspected that some factors, other than beta-lactamase, participated in the mechanism of ABPC-resistance. 6. These results suggest that drugs to be used for the chemotherapy of RTI should be selected considering the fact that drug susceptibilities of the pathogens differ, even among the same species, according to diseases.
TI  - Imipenem-cilastatin in the treatment of respiratory infections in patients with chronic airways obstruction.
AB  - Chest infections with organisms resistant to conventional antibiotics are common  in patients with chronic lung disease. We have studied the use of imipenem in 40 (28 M 12 F) patients admitted for treatment of chest infections. Patients were treated with imipenem 0.5 g four times daily by intravenous infusion for 6.3 +/- 1.6 (S.D.) days. Forty-six respiratory pathogens were cultured from 36 patients including 18 Haemophilus influenzae, 6 H. parainfluenzae, 6 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 8 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 6 Branhamella catarrhalis. Forty-three of the 46 isolates were sensitive to imipenem, 28 to ampicillin, 33 to tetracycline and 35 to cotrimoxazole. Thirty-eight of the 40 patients improved clinically, and 34 of the 36 patients with positive sputum culture had no pathogens in their sputum after treatment. Twenty patients developed minor phlebitis at the infusion site but there were few other side effects. Imipenem may prove useful in the treatment of chest infections, particularly when the organism is resistant to conventional antibiotics.
TI  - A-61827 (A-60969), a new fluoronaphthyridine with activity against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - A-61827 (A-60969 is the hydrochloric salt of A-61827) is a new aryl-fluoronaphthyridine which is active against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The MICs of A-61827 for 90% of strains (MIC90) of staphylococci and streptococci were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml and were generally 1 to 4 twofold dilutions less than those of ciprofloxacin for these bacteria. The MIC90S of A-61827 for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. Ciprofloxacin was 1 to 3 twofold dilutions more active than A-61827 against these gram-negative bacteria. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Campylobacter jejuni, and Haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to less than 0.06 microgram of A-61827 per ml. The MIC90 of A-61827 for Legionella pneumophila was 0.25 microgram/ml. A-61827 was as potent or 1 to 2 twofold dilutions more potent than ciprofloxacin against these organisms. The MIC90 of A-61827 for all anaerobic bacteria was less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml compared with less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. In mouse protection tests, A-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium and 5 to 10 times more active than ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. A-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin against P. aeruginosa in a mouse pyelonephritis model and more active than ciprofloxacin and metronidazole in a mouse Bacteroides fragilis abscess model. After oral administration of 100 mg/kg to mice, the peak concentrations of A-61827 and ciprofloxacin in serum were 2.3 and 2.4 micrograms/ml and the half-lives in serum were 3.9 and 1.2 h, respectively.
TI  - Comparative activity of the 4-quinolones.
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the 4-quinolones ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, difloxacin, A-56620, and CI-934 are consistent world-wide, with allowances for differences in acquired resistance. MICs of these drugs for Enterobacteriaceae correlate with those of nalidixic acid, but resistance to the quinolones is rare if a breakpoint of greater than 2 mg/L is accepted. Most intestinal pathogens are sensitive. Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other Pseudomonas species except Pseudomonas maltophilia are usually sensitive. Ciprofloxacin is generally the most active of the 4-quinolones against these organisms. All of the new agents have antistaphylococcal activity, but that of norfloxacin and ofloxacin is borderline. Against streptococci, including enterococci and pneumococci, the drugs' activity is moderate or poor. Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis are very sensitive. Gonococci and meningococci are also highly sensitive to the new agents, but activity against Chlamydia trachomatis and the mycoplasmas is borderline. The organisms associated with nonspecific vaginal infection are not very sensitive. Anaerobes except Bacteroides ureolyticus and Clostridium perfringens are mostly resistant.
TI  - Bacteriological and clinical evaluation of cefotetan in the treatment of severe infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  - The authors studied 302 hospitalized patients, 164 males and 138 females aged 15-88 years (average 66 years), with severe infections. Cefotetan was administered to 278 of them at the dose of 1 or 2 g, b.i.d. or a single daily dose i.m. Other patients [24] were treated with a continuous intravenous infusion of cefotetan (3 g daily in 5% dextrose). Of these patients 121 were treated for urinary tract infections (UTI); 114 for respiratory tract infections (RTI); 41 for liver biliary duct infections (BDI); 17 for skin or skin structure infections (SKI); 6 for fever of unknown origin and 3 for sepsis. The following Gram-positive organisms [156] were isolated: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus group D; and the following Gram-negative organisms [122]: Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia spp., Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The overall eradication rate for Gram-positive organisms was 74% and for Gram-negative organisms it was 88%. The clinical response was satisfactory in 87.7% of patients (specifically, cefotetan was effective in 90% of UTI, 84.2% of RTI, 97.5% of BDI and 82.3% of SKI). The drug was well tolerated and side-effects (such as skin rash, diarrhoea, purpura and pain at the site of injection) occurred in only 4% of patients treated with cefotetan. In conclusion, cefotetan appears to be safe and highly effective for the treatment of severe infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Pulmonary epithelial permeability in bronchiectasis.
AB  - We measured pulmonary epithelial permeability in 17 non-smoking patients with generalized bronchiectasis, of whom six had cystic fibrosis, by determining the half-time clearance from lung to blood (T1/2LB) of inhaled 99mTc-labelled diethylene triamine pentaacetate. Their age range was 15-79 years and the range of their FEV1 measurements was 20-87% of the predicted normal. Sputum obtained by prestudy chest physiotherapy revealed significant colonies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in six, Haemophilus influenzae in three, Staphylococcus aureus in three and Pasteurella mitocida in one patient, while in the remainder there was normal flora only. Lung clearance was significantly faster in the 13 culture-positive patients (mean T1/2LB = 28 minutes) compared with the four culture-negative patients (mean T1/2LB = 54 minutes). There was no correlation between T1/2LB and prestudy FEV1. The study was repeated in six patients following a course of antibiotics. In two patients only was the sputum cleared of organisms and in those the lung permeability decreased significantly. There was no change in lung permeability in the four patients in whom it was impossible to eradicate the sputum organisms. Thus, in our patients with generalized bronchiectasis, lung permeability was increased only in those with both purulent sputum and significant colonization of the respiratory tract by bacterial pathogens. However, this increase in lung permeability was not associated with worse lung function.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - In vitro activity of fleroxacin (Ro23-6240), a new fluorinated 4-quinolone against isolates from cancer patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Fleroxacin (Ro23-6240; AM 833), a new fluorinated 4-quinolone, was compared to that of ciprofloxacin, enoxacin and A-56620, against 747 isolates from cancer patients. Fleroxacin inhibited more than 90% of Enterobacteriacea isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. It was also extremely active against Aeromonas hydrophila and Haemophilus influenzae isolates with MIC90 values of 0.12 and 0.06 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for Acinetobacter spp. was 1.0 micrograms/ml, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas fluorescens 4.0 micrograms/ml, and for other Pseudomonas spp., 8.0 micrograms/ml. Staphylococcus aureus isolates including methicillin-resistant strains were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml. The MIC90 for three different species of coagulase-negative Staphylococci was 1.0 microgram/ml. Streptococcal species required 8-16 micrograms/ml for inhibition. Fleroxacin was also active against group JK-diphtheroids and Bacillus cereus. The overall activity of fleroxacin was similar to that of enoxacin and less than that of A-56620 and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - In vitro studies of fleroxacin (Ro 23-6240), a new trifluorinated quinolone derivative.
AB  - The in vitro activity of fleroxacin (Ro 23-6240) against 441 bacterial isolates was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, amoxycillin, cefadroxil, cefuroxime and tobramycin. An agar dilution method was used for the determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Ciprofloxacin showed the highest activity against the Enterobacteriaceae, 95% of the isolates were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l, but fleroxacin and ofloxacin were also highly active (MIC 90% = 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively). Ciprofloxacin was the most active agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC 90% = 0.12 mg/l), whereas the activities of fleroxacin and ofloxacin were more variable. Tobramycin was highly active against P. aeruginosa, 75% of the isolates were inhibited by 0.5 mg/l or less. The quinolones and tobramycin exhibited high activity against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, the great majority of the isolates being susceptible to 0.5 mg/l or less of any agent. All the quinolones showed high activity against Staphylococcus aureus, but fleroxacin was less active against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus than were the other derivatives. The pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates were markedly less susceptible to fleroxacin than to the other quinolones tested (MIC range 4-32 mg/l). All isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by the lowest concentration of the quinolones employed in the study (0.03 mg/l). Cefuroxime was also highly active against N. gonorrhoeae, whether the strains were beta-lactamase-producing or not, but was somewhat less active against H. influenzae. The quinolones displayed moderate and similar activity against Bacteroides fragilis isolates (MIC range 1-16 mg/l). The MICs of fleroxacin against gram-negative rods were generally 4-16 times higher at pH 8.8 than those obtained at pH 5.8 and 7.3. The activity against gram-positive cocci was not markedly influenced by changes in pH.
TI  - [Short-term complications of transtympanic aerators].
AB  - Three hundred and thirteen transtympanic aerators (TTA), including 309 T-tubes, were inserted between november 1985 and April 1987 at the Bretonneau hospital, Paris. Twenty-three (7%) were expelled spontaneously, 16 (5%) became obstructive and in 6 cases a change of TTA was required. The commonest complication was otorrhea. Younger children tended to develop early otorrhea. There were 7 cases (2%) of early otorrhea and 50 (16%) of secondary otorrhea. By contrast the onset of secondary otorrhea was independent of age. A relationship with penetration of water into the middle ear through the TTA could not be confirmed. At the present time the authors permit bathing without any special precautions. In parallel, between november 1985 and august 1987, 84 bacteriological samples were obtained in cases of otorrhea related with a TTA, whether or not the latter had been inserted at Bretonneau. Predominant organisms were Hemophilus influenzae (30%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (30%) and Staphylococcus (18%). On the basis of results of antibiotic sensitivity studies using the organisms discovered in these samples, the authors suggest local therapy based upon polymyxin or rifamycin as treatment of first choice.
TI  - The use of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - The use of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis patients was investigated. Therapy was successful in six patients and unsuccessful in three patients. In one patient therapy had to be stopped because serum transaminase levels showed a 5- to 8- fold increase. During therapy resistance developed in Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Respiratory infections: clinical experiences with the new quinolones.
AB  - Nearly 300 patients, admitted to hospital with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic respiratory disease, have been treated with various newer quinolones: 26 patients received enoxacin, 50 pefloxacin, 80 ciprofloxacin and 143 ofloxacin. Dosages varied from 400 mg once daily to 1000 mg twice daily. orally for five to 10 days. Patients were evaluated bacteriologically and clinically before, during and after treatment. Nearly all infections associated with Haemophilus influenzae and/or Branhamella catarrhalis were successfully eradicated. Some Streptococcus pneumoniae infections relapsed, some could not be eradicated, and a number of patients developed new infections with these organisms. Approximately half of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections were eradicated. Nearly all patients received concomitant theophylline but this only caused serious problems in those given 600 mg doses of enoxacin twice daily. Five patients given ciprofloxacin had to discontinue because of unwanted effects (mostly hallucinations), one patient given pefloxacin had gastric pain and two patients given ofloxacin developed a skin rash. Apart from the theophylline interaction, the unwanted effects did not appear to be dose-related. The best overall clinical results were noted after 800 mg doses of ofloxacin once daily for seven days.
TI  - Altered antibody isotype in cystic fibrosis: impaired natural antibody response to polysaccharide antigens.
AB  - Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have impaired natural (preinfection) IgG2 antibody responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide. To investigate the basis for this defect, we measured natural IgG and IgG1-4 antibody levels to Haemophilus influenzae type b polyribophosphate (PRP) and tetanus toxoid by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 24 adult CF patients and 20 normal controls. Immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain allotypes were determined on 146 Caucasian CF patients and 96 controls. The tetanus toxoid-specific IgG response was predominantly IgG1. CF and control subjects had similar IgG and IgG1 antibody levels. The PRP-specific IgG response was predominantly IgG2. In contrast to tetanus toxoid results, CF patients had lower geometric mean level of PRP-specific IgG compared to normal controls (p = 0.0036). ELISA results were confirmed by liquid-phase 3H-PRP-binding assay: CF patients had a geometric mean serum antibody level of 395 versus 922 ng/ml in controls (p = 0.0044). PRP-specific IgG2 levels were also depressed in CF patients (p = 0.03). CF patients had a lower prevalence of the A2m(2) allotype than the local racially matched control sample (p less than 0.025). Other allotype prevalences including G2m(n) and Km(1) were similar. Impaired IgG2 antibody responses to microbial polysaccharide surface antigens in CF patients might predispose them to persistent endobronchial infection and lead to production of nonopsonizing isotype responses. The potential role of A2m(2), coded for in the H chain locus on chromosome 14, is unknown, but could be related to mucosal IgA2 antibody responses.
TI  - Changes in expression of bacterial surface antigens induced by antibiotics and their influence on host defenses.
AB  - Concomitant with the discovery that a number of antibiotics were able to induce profound morphological changes (increased septation, thickened walls, filamentation) at low concentrations their ability to inhibit bacterial protein/polysaccharide synthesis was determined. In particular toxin and extracellular enzyme biosynthesis could be repressed by the lincosamines, fusidic acid, erythromycin and streptomycin in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Several of these exoproducts act as antigens associated with microbial virulence and are therefore of importance in pathogenicity. Likewise structural components such as fimbriae in Escherichia coli, M protein in Streptococcus pyogenes, protein A in Staphylococcus aureus and capsule in Bacteroides fragilis and Haemophilus influenzae were not synthesised when the producer bacteria were grown in low concentrations of antibiotic. These products, through their importance as impedins of opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by white blood cells, are important determinants in the host-parasite relationship. By their loss during drug exposure, potentiation of opsonophagocytosis occurred leading to more rapid killing of the pathogen. The immunogenicity of the antibiotic-damaged bacteria was also changed under these circumstances.
TI  - SIGNAL blood culture system for detection of bacteremia in neonates.
AB  - In the SIGNAL (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, United Kingdom) blood culture system, gas produced by bacterial metabolism displaces medium from the culture bottle into an upper reservoir via a hollow needle. Displacement of media may provide a visual indication of the presence of both aerobic and anaerobic organisms in a single medium. The single-bottle SIGNAL system was compared with paired BACTEC 16B and 7D (Johnston Laboratories, Inc., Towson, Md.) radiometric system bottles by using bacterial inocula and conditions which simulated those found in neonatal and pediatric populations. The single SIGNAL bottle was a good as the combined BACTEC media for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, but was slower for Candida spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, group B streptococci, alpha-streptococci, and pneumococci. The SIGNAL system failed to detect four of five isolates of Neisseria meningitidis and four of eight anaerobic organisms. The SIGNAL system is not suitable for neonatal blood cultures at its present state of development.
TI  - Disk diffusion susceptibility testing and broth microdilution quality control guidelines for BMY-28100, a new orally administered cephalosporin.
AB  - The BMY-28100 30-micrograms-disk test was evaluated by using 615 clinical isolates. Regression analyses and error rates were determined, leading to the recommendation of greater than or equal to 18-mm zone diameters (MIC correlate, greater than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) for susceptibility and less than or equal to 14-mm zone diameters (MIC correlate, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) for resistance. Nearly all false-susceptible disk test results were among the Providencia spp. and the beta-lactamase-positive Haemophilus influenzae strains. Susceptibility disk test results for these species should be interpreted with caution. The following broth microdilution MIC quality control guidelines were determined from results of a multilaboratory trial: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 1.0 to 4.0 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, 4.0 to 16 micrograms/ml; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, 0.25 to 1.0 microgram/ml; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, greater than 32 micrograms/ml.
TI  - In vitro activity of a new broad spectrum, beta-lactamase-stable oral cephalosporin, cefixime.
AB  - Cefixime is a new orally absorbed iminomethoxy, aminothiazolyl cephalosporin. It  inhibits the majority, 90%, of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. It inhibits 90% of the other members of the Enterobacteriaceae at concentrations less than 1 microgram/ml, with the exception of some strains of Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii and Morganella morganii, Cefixime does not inhibit enterococci, Listeria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Bacteroides spp. or staphylococci. In general, cefixime has in vitro activity superior to cephalexin, cephradine, cefadroxil and cefaclor against all bacteria with the exception of staphylococci. Cefixime is not destroyed by most of the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases and its activity is not reduced by serum, blood or urine. Cefixime overall has excellent in vitro activity against the commonly encountered respiratory and urinary tract pathogens.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the two new oral cephalosporin metabolites RO 19-5247 and RO 15-8074.
AB  - A total of 629 clinical strains of gram positive and gram negative bacteria were  tested for their susceptibility to RO 19-5247, RO 15-8074, and other antimicrobial agents. Both RO 19-5247 and RO 15-8074 had good activity against strains of Enterobacteriaceae; however, resistance was found among some strains of Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Klebsiella and Morganella spp. Both compounds showed moderate to poor active against Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococci and Streptococcus faecalis. Against strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococci (not enterococci), each compound was highly active in vitro. RO 19-5247 and RO 15-8074 had comparable activity to cotrimoxazole, ceftazidime and ceftizoxime. Each new compound had considerably better activity then did cefaclor and amoxicillin/potassium clavulanate.
TI  - Prospective randomized controlled study of ciprofloxacin versus imipenem-cilastatin in severe clinical infections.
AB  - In a randomized prospective study, 66 patients with serious bacterial infections--mainly lower respiratory tract infections--were treated with either imipenem plus cilastatin (32 patients) or ciprofloxacin (34 patients); 30 patients in each group were evaluable for efficacy. Substantial underlying disease was present in most of the patients; pathogens isolated prior to treatment (77 isolates) consisted mainly of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and streptococci. Of the etiologic bacteria, 67% were eradicated by ciprofloxacin treatment and 79% by imipenem therapy; however, two patients (6.7%) failed in the ciprofloxacin group, and six patients (20%) did not respond to imipenem treatment (P = 0.25). All patients with therapeutic failures suffered from severe fatal underlying diseases, which had substantial impact on the outcome of treatment. Therapeutic drug monitoring in the ciprofloxacin patients revealed higher concentrations in serum at days 4 and 8 in comparison with day 1 of treatment, indicating that steady-state conditions were reached between days 1 and 4. The total number of side effects was relatively high--eight imipenem patients (25%) and six ciprofloxacin patients (18%) had reactions. Treatment had to be discontinued due to adverse reactions for three ciprofloxacin patients and two imipenem patients. Major side effects in both groups were gastrointestinal and central nervous system-related symptoms. In terms of clinical and bacteriological efficacy and safety, there was no statistical difference between the two groups, and both groups gave good to excellent results for bacterial infections that were difficult to treat.
TI  - Recovery of beta-lactamase producing bacteria in pediatric infections.
AB  - The presence of beta-lactamase producing bacteria (beta LPB) was investigated in  specimens obtained from 1469 children who presented with infections of the skin and soft tissue (648), upper respiratory tract (514), pulmonary sites (137), surgical sites (113), and other (57). Of 4989 bacterial isolates recovered, 910 (18%) were beta LPB, 492 (54%) aerobes, and 418 (46%) anaerobes. The beta LPB were recovered in 751 (51%) of the children. The most frequently recovered beta LPB was Staphylococcus aureus, which was recovered in 356 (47%) patients. Most isolates were recovered from patients with skin and soft-tissue infections (68% of patients), upper respiratory tract infections (49%), and pulmonary infections (35%). Bacteroides fragilis group was isolated in 35% of patients with beta LPB, mostly from surgical infections (98% of patients), pulmonary infections (36%), skin and soft-tissue infections (25%), and upper respiratory tract infections (20%). Twenty-five percent of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus group produced beta-lactamase. These organisms were recovered in 15% of patients with beta LPB. They were recovered in upper respiratory tract infections (38% of patients), pulmonary infections (22%), and skin and soft-tissue infections (7%). Other beta LPB were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8% of total patients with beta LPB), Escherichia coli (4%), Bacteroides oralis (3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), Haemophilus influenzae (2%), Proteus (1%), and Branhamella catarrhalis (1%). The role of beta LPB in the failure of penicillin to eradicate many of the infections is discussed.
TI  - Bacterial capsular polysaccharides--biochemistry, immunity and vaccine.
AB  - The biochemical basis of immunogenicity to bacterial capsular polysaccharides (PSs) has been extensively studied. Antibody responses to PS antigens can be greatly affected by their physico-chemical properties, e.g. molecular size, specific determinants, conformation etc. At present, three bacterial PS vaccines, including meningococcal, pneumococcal, and H. influenzae type b, have been licensed in the U.S.A. Many other PSs, such as group B Streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella, are still in various stages of vaccine development. Studies on the type distribution of pneumococcal isolates from Asian populations showed that the types included in the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine were considerably fewer in Asia than that observed in the U.S.A.: the proportion of types was 62.9% in Taiwan, 72.9% in Japan and 87.9-92.8% in the U.S.A. A large number of pneumococcal types found in Taiwan and Japan, such as 15A, 23A, 24F and 34, are not present in the pneumococcal vaccine. Immunization with one type of group 9 or 19F PS induced a poor antibody response to the other type. All 9N, 9V, 19F and 19A PSs are required in the vaccine to induce sufficient antibodies against group 9 and 19 infection. Extensive cross-reactions have been found between pneumococcal PSs and PSs from other bacteria. Klebsiella K2 PS could enhance the magnitude of the antibody response to 19F PS. The structure of streptococcal 14636/74 was found to be identical to pneumococcal 19F PS. A difficult problem in the development of vaccines against bacterial diseases is the poor immune response of young children to purified PSs. Antibodies against the PSs can be elicited when PS antigens are conjugated to a protein carrier. In mice, the maternal immunization with pneumococcal PS during pregnancy or before mating, did not cause suppression or other observable harmful effect, rather it may provide sufficient antibodies for protection against infection during early life.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetics and clinical effects of aspoxicillin in pediatric patients].
AB  - Since the efficacy and the safety of aspoxicillin (ASPC, TA-058) have been established on adult patients and the need of ASPC use on pediatric patients was anticipated, we performed a 16 center study on the clinical utility of ASPC in pediatric patients. 1. Pharmacokinetics ASPC was intravenously administered to 45 patients at a dose of 10, 20 or 40 mg/kg by one shot. Serum concentrations of ASPC were dependent of dose levels, and maximum levels of 58.4-230.8 micrograms/ml and half-lives (beta) of 1.08-1.16 hours were observed. Urinary recovery rates were 62.7-67.2% in 6 hours. Results obtained upon drip infusions (0.5-1 hour) were similar to one shot injections. 2. Clinical results (1) Clinical effectiveness Of 318 evaluable patients including 175 boys and 143 girls, 18.2% were nurslings and 61% were young children under 4 years of age. One hundred eighty six patients from whom causative organisms were isolated were classified as A group. Among them were 5 patients suffered with sepsis, but the ASPC treatment eradicated all the bacteria but Salmonella java in 1 case. All of 4 patients with meningitis were cured and all causative organisms (3 cases with Haemophilus influenzae and 1 case with Gram-positive coccus) were eradicated. Cure rates were 90% for 130 patients with respiratory tract infection, 88.6% for 35 with urinary tract infection, 85.7% for 7 with skin soft tissue infection and 89.8% for all the A group patients. Meanwhile, no causative organisms were isolated from 132 patients (B group patients) but cure rate of 91.7% was obtained for this group. No statistical difference was observed between A and B groups. For all the patients (318), the cure rate was 90.6%. (2) Bacteriological effects Of 63 Gram-positive bacteria isolated as pathogens, 58 strains were eradicated. Of 117 Gram-negative bacterial, 101 were eradicated. The eradication rate on all 180 strains was 88.3%. Overall, ASPC showed excellent effects against Streptococcus. Among strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 18 of 20 strains were eradicated. Of 59 strains of H. influenzae, 52 were eradicated and 3 decreased. Among strains of Escherichia coli, 25 of 28 strains were eradicated. Of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 strains were decreased and one was unchanged. (3) ASPC was effective in 93.3% of 30 patients with serious infections and 79.2% of 72 patients with underlying diseases. Cure rates for patients with and without underlying disease were significantly different statistically (chi 2: P less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Pulmonary infections in children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Bronchopulmonary infections continue to be the major determinant of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The basic pathogenesis of disease includes abnormal secretions and impaired mucociliary clearance. Colonization of the tracheobronchial tract with bacteria is then associated with a cycle of infection, inflammation and airway obstruction eventually leading to respiratory insufficiency. Early clinical features include persistent cough and failure to thrive. Hyperinflation and bronchial thickening are early radiographic changes suggestive of CF. Staphylococcus aureus is commonly the initial respiratory pathogen. Subsequently, Hemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonize the respiratory tract. In addition, respiratory viruses and other pathogens such as Legionella and mycoplasma are implicated in the etiology of pulmonary infections. The culture of respiratory secretions such as sputum are important guidelines to the etiology of pulmonary infection in CF. The laboratory must be aware of the pathogens that are typical of this disease and use appropriate techniques and media. In large part, advances in treatment in CF over the past two decades are due to the availability of increasingly potent antibiotic agents. However, effective treatment must be multifaceted and include a variety of nonantimicrobial therapies. Different approaches to the antibiotic therapy of pulmonary infection in CF, including prevention, suppression, and definitive treatment are discussed. In addition to traditional antibiotic therapy, a variety of newer methods of therapy in CF are discussed. These include oral antipseudomonal antibiotics, corticosteroid therapy, aerosolized antibiotics, and continuous antimicrobial prophylaxis.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical bacterial isolates to aztreonam].
AB  - In vitro activities of 7 antimicrobial agents against organisms (474 strains) isolated from patients with various infections in Ehime University Hospital from May to July 1986 were investigated. Summarized results are as follows: 1. Aztreonam (AZT) showed potent activities against Escherichia coli, Citrobacter sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae. 2. Antimicrobial activities of AZT were especially superior against Proteus sp. to the third generation cephem antibiotics. 3. Enterobacter sp. seemed more susceptible to AZT than to cephem antibiotics, but minimum inhibitory concentrations of AZT against may isolates of Enterobacter sp. were in wide ranges.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1985)].
AB  - It has been more than 4 years since third-generation cephems were introduced into clinical practice. The range of our drug selection definitely tends to increase, because we today have more antibiotics with wider spectrum, antibiotics with strong activities only against Gram-negative strains, such as monobactams, and those with tremendously high activities such as quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives, in comparison to those we had in the past. Among isolates obtained mainly from sputa of 567 patients with lower respiratory tract infections at 16 institutions throughout Japan between September of 1985 and March of 1986, 741 strains were determined to be causative organisms. MIC's of various antimicrobial agents were determined against 67 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 100 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 199 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 92 strains of non-mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 40 strains of mucoid P. aeruginosa, 29 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 strains of Escherichia coli and for 42 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis out of the above 741 strains to determine their drug sensitivities. As for types of lower respiratory tract infections found in 1981--1983, 57.9--64.5% of the infections were chronic respiratory infections; i.e., chronic bronchitis, chronic bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis. These chronic infections, including diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB), were found in 63.1% of lower respiratory tract infections in 1984. Their incidence dropped to 54.0% in 1985, even though DPB was included; i.e., the incidence of chronic bronchiolitis was 5.5%, that of DPB was 7.1%, and that of bronchial asthma associated with lower respiratory tract infections in 1985 was 8.8% which was twice as much as that found in 1981--1984. Although bacterial pneumonia was found in 24.8% of all the cases in 1981, its incidence was reduced to 11.0% in 1983, 15.1% in 1984, and 17.6% in 1985. This reduction seemed to have resulted from gradual decreases in the occurrence of bacterial pneumonia among the young population. As with usual years, a high incidence rate in a total lower respiratory tract infections in 1985 was found among older patients; namely, 73.5% was at the age of 50 or over (417/567). Next, we determined relationships between clinical isolates and isolates from respiratory infections, including chronic bronchitis, chronic bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis and DPB. H. influenzae was isolated from 50.5% of patients with these infections in 1981; however, the detection rate decreased by about 20% to 29.7% in 1985. P. aeruginosa was consistently isolated, between 24.1% and 30.4% every year.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of CGP 31608, a new penem antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new penem antimicrobial agent, CGP 31608, was compared with those of imipenem, SCH 34343, and several other antimicrobial agents against approximately 600 bacterial isolates. CGP 31608 was active against gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC for 90% of the isolates [MIC90], 0.25 microgram/ml) and penicillin-susceptible streptococci (MIC90s, less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml). Penicillin-resistant streptococci (including enterococci) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were more resistant to the penem. Activities of CGP 31608 against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were remarkably uniform, with MIC90s of 8 to 16 micrograms/ml. CGP 31608 was at least as active as imipenem and ceftazidime and more active than piperacillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Drug activity was not influenced by the presence of any of 10 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases. Against strains of Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and P. aeruginosa with derepressible chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, the presence of cefoxitin did not induce increased resistance to CGP 31608. The new drug was also active against anaerobes (MIC90s, 0.25 to 8 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90s, 0.5 to 1.0 micrograms/ml), and Legionella spp. (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml). CGP 31608 showed an antibacterial spectrum similar to those of imipenem and SCH 34343 (except that the latter is not active against P. aeruginosa) but was generally less potent than these drugs. However, CGP 31608 demonstrated more activity (MIC90) than imipenem against P. aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of CS-807, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - CS-807 is a new oral prodrug of R-3746, a cephalosporin derivative, with potent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The susceptibility of about 1,200 clinical isolates to R-3746 was determined by the agar dilution method. Ninety percent or more of pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, indole-positive and indole-negative Proteus spp., Providencia rettgeri, and Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations ranging less than or equal to 0.01 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. Furthermore, at a concentration of 3.13 micrograms/ml, 50% or more of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens strains were also inhibited. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Xanthomonas maltophilia were resistant to R-3746. The activity of R-3746 was scarcely influenced by several growth conditions. R-3746 was highly resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases derived from various species of bacteria. Killing-curve studies demonstrated bactericidal activity of R-3746 at concentrations above the MIC. R-3746 showed high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 1, 3, and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus and 1A, 1Bs, and 3 of Escherichia coli. Systemic infections in mice caused by various pathogens, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, responded well to therapy with oral doses of CS-807.
TI  - Rational parameters for antibiotic therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Data from the literature and the authors' experiences were used to review aspects of antibiotic therapy of patients with cystic fibrosis; attention was paid to in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility tests and assessment of therapy directed against mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The heterogeneity of P. aeruginosa within single sputa with respect to antibiotic susceptibility is stressed. Quantitative viable counts of bacteria based on an analysis of homogenised sputum is recommended. The mode of in vivo growth of mucoid P. aeruginosa is discussed to explain the survival of hypersusceptible P. aeruginosa in vivo, and the clinical benefit observed in the absence of a significant reduction of the pathogen. The value of ceftazidime in the treatment of exacerbations due to Haemophilus influenzae is emphasised. The social benefits from oral administration of ciprofloxacin also emphasises that the patient's quality of life must also be considered.
TI  - Selective procedure to isolate haemophilus influenzae from sputa with large quantities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The identification of respiratory pathogens (e. g. Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae) is impaired by the presence of large quantities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as is the case in the sputum specimens of cystic fibrosis patients. A procedure has been evaluated whereby the selective inhibition of the proliferation of P. aeruginosa is achieved by a broad spectrum pyocin, whereas the growth of H. influenzae is not influenced. This technique has been tested over a two year period resulting in a significantly augmented rate of identification of H. influenzae.
TI  - Qualitative and quantitative microbiological analysis of sputa of 102 patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - A microbiological analysis of 102 patients suffering from cystic fibrosis was conducted over a 22 month period. 20 microbial species with the following incidence were identified: Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 83.4%; Candida albicans: 29.4%; Staphylococcus aureus: 24.5%; Staphylococcus epidermidis: 11.8%; Haemophilus influenzae: 11.8%; Streptococcus pneumoniae; 6.9%; Pseudomonas maltophilia: 6.8%; Aspergillus fumigatus: 5.9%. Other species were present in less than 5% of the patients. In the majority of specimens with P. aeruginosa, more than one type (up to six) was detectable. These strains were identical in colony appearance, O-serotype and pyocin-type. Quantitative analysis revealed concentrations of colony-forming units of 10(7) to 10(9) for P. aeruginosa, 10(6) to 10(8) for P. maltophilia, 10(4) to 10(7) for S. aureus, 10(4) to 10(6) for S. epidermidis and 10(4) to 10(7) for C. albicans in the majority of specimens. Significant differences were observed in the time periods during which the pathogens persisted in the patients. Maximum persistence was observed for P. aeruginosa. P. maltophilia and A. fumigatus had about similar persistence rates, which were lower than those for P. aeruginosa but above those for S. aureus and H. influenzae. S. epidermidis was eliminated within shorter periods than S. aureus. C. albicans, although the second most frequent microorganism identified, showed a very low persistence rate. The microbiological analysis confirms results from other research centers (high incidence of P. aeruginosa), but reveals significant regional differences as well (Pseudomonas cepacia not detectable, higher incidence of P. maltophilia and C. albicans). This underlines the necessity for detailed qualitative and quantitative microbiological analysis of sputa from cystic fibrosis patients as a prerequisite for rational analysis of etiological, epidemiological and therapeutical aspects of cystic fibrosis.
TI  - The time course of hydrolysis of a beta-lactam antibiotic by intact gram-negative bacteria possessing a periplasmic beta-lactamase.
AB  - An equation is derived from first principles for describing the change in concentration with time of a beta-lactam antibiotic in the presence of intact Gram-negative bacteria possessing a beta-lactamase located in the periplasmic space. The equation predicts a first-order decline in beta-lactam concentration of the form [S] = [Si]e lambda t, where [S] is the exogenous concentration of beta-lactam, [Si] is the value of [S] at time zero, t is the time from mixing of cells and antibiotic and lambda (less than 0) is the decay constant. The value of lambda is exactly described by the theory in terms of experimentally measurable quantities. Quantitative data concerning cephaloridine hydrolysis by intact cells of Haemophilus influenzae agreed well with the theory, as did data concerning the uptake of 2-nitrophenyl galactoside by intact cells of Escherichia coli. Cephalosporin C hydrolysis by intact cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa did not progress as predicted by the theory. The theory is applicable to any substrate which is acted on by an enzyme that is located solely in the periplasmic space and that obeys the Michaelis-Menten equation of enzyme kinetics.
TI  - [Bacteriological study of acute otitis media in children. Therapeutic consequences].
AB  - One hundred children presenting with acute otitis media underwent a bacteriological study of otitis exudate over a 18 month period. The bacteria found were as follows: Streptococcus pneumoniae (24), Haemophilus influenzae (19), Staphylococcus aureus (12), Streptococcus pyogenes (7), Branhamella catarrhalis (3), and 18 Gram negative bacilli (including 7 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 11 enterobacteriaceae). One pathogenic bacterium was isolated in 56 cases, 2 or more in 12 cases and none in 32 cases. In the age categories 0-1 year (47 cases) and 1-3 years (31 cases), S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were the main organisms found, followed by S. pyogenes in children older than 3 years (22 cases). With respect to the antibiotics used for treating otitis, 5/22 S. pneumoniae and 4/17 H. influenzae were erythromycin resistant (9/17 had an intermediate susceptibility) and 7/19 H. influenzae and 1/17 S. pneumoniae were cotrimoxazole resistant. None of the S. pneumoniae and 2/19 H. influenzae were ampicillin resistant. These 2 H. influenzae and 2/3 B. catarrhalis were beta-lactamase producers. They were sensitive to the combination of amoxicillin with clavulanic acid.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of oral ciprofloxacin in the treatment of serious respiratory infections.
AB  - Fifty-two patients with serious respiratory infections were treated with orally administered ciprofloxacin; 42 patients were evaluable for the efficacy analysis and all were evaluable for determining adverse reactions. Cures were achieved in 24 patients with infections (14 with bronchitis, 10 with pneumonia) caused by Hemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Branhamella catarrhalis, and pathogens were rapidly eradicated from respiratory secretions. Seventeen patients had infections (seven bronchitis, 10 pneumonia) caused by Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa; many of these patients were critically ill and were enrolled in the study because their pathogens were resistant to multiple drugs or because their infections had not responded to alternate antimicrobial therapy. All patients had favorable clinical responses, and members of the Enterobacteriaceae were rapidly eradicated from respiratory secretions. However, five of 12 strains of P. aeruginosa persisted during treatment; minimal inhibitory concentrations for these strains increased 4- to 16-fold as infections continued to resolve. One patient with Staphylococcus aureus infection also showed a response. Ciprofloxacin probably caused nausea, vomiting, or both in three of the 52 patients and possibly contributed to similar symptoms in another three patients (6 to 12 percent). Other possible adverse reactions, including central nervous system symptoms, were also observed but were not clearly drug-related.
TI  - [Recent trend of childhood bacterial meningitis in Japan (1979-1984). Part 4. A classification of prognosis and antibiotic treatment based on causative agents].
AB  - Nine hundred seventy cases of childhood bacterial meningitis treated at 107 institutions in Japan from 1979 through 1984 were studied using questionnaire. The number of cases that underwent antimicrobial monotherapy remained nearly constant during the study period, but cases of therapies with beta-lactam combined with aminoglycosides (AGs) decreased in number and a gradual increase in the use of beta-lactam combined with non-AGs antibiotics including beta-lactam (Non AGs) was observed. A trend showing decrease in case fatality rate (CFR) was observed except that CFR for Gram-positive bacterial infections treated with beta-lactam + AGs remained at a same level. Cases treated with antibiotics were classified into 3 groups according to major etiological pathogens. Cases with Staphylococcus aureus gave a poor prognosis, among 27 total cases, CFR was 28.6% (2/7) with monotherapy, 50.0% (6/12) with beta-lactam + AGs and 37.5% (3/8) with beta-lactam + Non AGs (P less than 0.1). Among 100 cases of group B Streptococcus (GBS), CFR was 20.0% as a whole, 17.3% (9/52) for monotherapy and 34.5% (10/29) for beta-lactam + AGs (P less than 0.1). Among 198 cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae, CFR was 12.1% as a whole, and was 12.3% (18/146) with monotherapy. CFR for the cases treated with beta-lactam + AGs was 20.8% (5/24) and with beta-lactam + Non AGs was 3.6% (1/28) (P less than 0.1). CFR for 292 cases of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis was fairly low, and was 6.1% (9/148) with monotherapy, 7.4% (5/68) with beta-lactam + AGs and 3.9% (3/76) with beta-lactam + Non AGs, thus very slight differences were observed among the 3 groups of treatment. Among 111 cases of Escherichia coli, monotherapy and beta-lactam + Non AGs gave 6.5% (2/31) CFR, and 5.6% (1/18) CFR, respectively, whereas beta-lactam + AGs showed CFR of 19.4% (12/62), demonstrating a significant difference tendency (P less than 0.1). Similar tendencies were observed in the cases of Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. Contrary to the high CFR observed with the beta-lactam + AGs treatment, significantly low CFR was frequently obtained in cases treated with a combination of penicillins with cephalosporins including latamoxef or beta-lactam with chloramphenicol. Infections with GBS, E. coli, and P. mirabilis occurred largely in the age between 0 to 6 months and CFR was especially high in the very young.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Differences in antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates in Saudi Arabia and the United States.
AB  - In vitro antimicrobial susceptibilities of 3,530 clinical isolates at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center (KFSH), in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, were compared with those of 11,041 bacterial isolates at two hospitals of comparable size in the United States. The gram-negative bacteria, especially Escherichia coli, Proteus-Morganella group, Enterobacter sp, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were generally more resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, gentamicin, piperacillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at KFSH than in the United States. A larger number of isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were more resistant to cephalosporin, chloramphenical, gentamicin, piperacillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at one of the tertiary care hospitals in the United States. Hemophilus influenzae and gram-positive cocci exhibited similar susceptibilities toward commonly used antibiotics at all three institutions.
TI  - Development of an immunoglobulin A-specific anti-Haemophilus influenzae antibody  assay for detection of antibody in human mucosal secretions.
AB  - A micro-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for quantitation of immunoglobulin A-specific anti-Haemophilus influenzae antibody is described and characterized. It had a sensitivity of 27 ng/ml, which is appropriate to detect antibody levels in normal saliva. Specificity for H. influenzae was achieved with the H1H2 group of antigens. Absorption studies for a range of bacteria showed little cross-reactivity, with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Absorption studies involving various antigen preparations obtained from H. influenzae indicated that the H1H2 antigen group included significant amounts of surface antigen. An analysis of saliva from normal subjects and patients with chronic obstructive lung disease showed significant differences in levels of antibody, highlighting the potential value of the assay.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of pefloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin against 256 clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of four new fluoroquinolone carboxylic acids, pefloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin, against 256 clinical isolates was investigated by means of an agar dilution method. Generally, all quinolones tested had a high activity against Gram-negative bacteria. More than 90% of Enterobacteriaceae strains were inhibited by a quinolone concentration of 0.4 microgram/ml. Also strains usually resistant to conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, and sometimes to third-generation cephalosporins, like Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp, and Yersinia spp. were susceptible to the tested quinolones. Ciprofloxacin was 5 to 25-fold more potent on a weight basis against Enterobacteriaceae than the other quinolones. Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Haemophilus influenzae were extremely susceptible to the new quinolones. Ciprofloxacin was about 10 times more potent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa than the other quinolones, and was the only quinolone that was sufficiently active against all tested P. aeruginosa strains (MIC less than or equal to 0.4 microgram/ml). The activity against Gram-positive bacteria was considerably lower. All the quinolones investigated had an acceptable activity against many of the methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. The majority of the Streptococcus spp. tested was quinolone-resistant, and was Listeria monocytogenes. Generally, it was evident that ciprofloxacin was more potent on a weight basis than the other quinolones, but this difference was counterbalanced by a higher achievable serum concentration for ofloxacin. Some of the investigated fluoroquinolones might constitute valid therapeutical alternatives to beta-lactam antibodies and aminoglycosides in the treatment of serious bacterial infections.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new monobactam, B0-1165.
AB  - B0-1165 is a 1-carboxy-1-cyclopropoxyamino,4-fluoromethyl monobactam. It inhibited the majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Yersinia enterocolitica, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Salmonella and Shigella species at less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml. Overall, its in vitro activity was similar to that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime, with minor differences in the MICs for individual isolates. Enterobacter species and Citrobacter freundii which were derepressed for beta-lactamase production and had higher MICs of aztreonam and ceftazidime had MICs that ranged from 4 to 32 micrograms/ml. B0-1165 had activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of aztreonam but lower than that of ceftazidime and carumonam. Pseudomonas maltophilia and other Pseudomonas species were resistant or had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, as did Acinetobacter species. B0-1165 did not inhibit streptococcal, staphylococcal, or anaerobic species, such as Clostridium and Bacteroides species. B0-1165 was not hydrolyzed to any appreciable extent by common plasmid- and chromosomally Richmond-Sykes type 1a-, 1c-, and 1d-mediated beta-lactamases. It inhibited the Enterobacter cloacae P99 and inducible Pseudomonas aeruginosa beta-lactamases. B0-1165 was a poor inducer of beta-lactamase, but exposing E. cloacae and C. freundii to B0-1165 selected for resistant isolates. Overall, B0-1165 had in vitro properties similar to those of other monobactams currently available or under investigation.
TI  - In vitro activity of the new 4-quinolone compound Ro 23-6240.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new 4-quinolone Ro 23-6240 was compared with that of pefloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, nalidixic acid and gentamicin against a total of 397 recent clinical isolates. An agar dilution procedure was used to determine MICs and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) CFU) were used throughout. Ro 23-6240 inhibited most species of the Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains) at less than or equal to 1 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was somewhat more resistant (MIC 90 4 mg/l) and the Bacteroides fragilis group were considerably more resistant (MIC 90 32 mg/l). Overall Ro 23-6240 was as active as pefloxacin but was two- to eight-fold less active than ciprofloxacin against most species tested.
TI  - Review of the 4-quinolones.
AB  - Improvements in antimicrobial activity and pharmacokinetics have moved the 4-quinolones into the forefront of antibiotic research. The 4-quinolones are analogues of nalidixic acid, and there are presently at least six agents in this group under investigation in the United States. It is difficult to generalize their clinical usefulness, since these agents exhibit different pharmacokinetic profiles, antimicrobial activity (with varied minimum inhibitory concentrations among similar organisms), and dosage regimens. The 4-quinolones are potential therapeutic alternatives for infections caused by a variety of organisms. They include: Neisseria gonorrhoeae; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Haemophilus influenzae; Staphylococcus aureus; common enteric pathogens (salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, etc); and intracellular bacteria (legionella, chlamydia, mycobacteria, etc). Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, and sexually transmitted diseases. Future studies will undoubtedly demonstrate effectiveness in numerous additional infectious processes. The purpose of this article is to compare the 4-quinolones in regards to pharmacokinetics and spectrum of activity and review the clinical studies involving these agents.
TI  - Imipenem and cilastatin in acute osteomyelitis and suppurative arthritis. Therapy in infants and children.
AB  - Twenty-five infants and children with acute osteomyelitis (n = 7), suppurative arthritis (n = 11), or both (n = 7) were treated with imipenem and cilastatin sodium. Patients ranged in age from 5 months to 11.3 years. Needle aspiration of infected sites was performed in all patients, and 11 (44%) required further surgical drainage. Imipenem and cilastatin sodium in a dosage of 100 mg/kg/d was used for children 3 years of age or younger, while older ones received 60 mg/kg/d intravenously, divided in four equal doses. Bacterial pathogens were identified in 15 patients (60%): Staphylococcus aureus in five, Haemophilus influenzae b in four, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in two, Streptococcus pneumoniae in one, group A Streptococcus in one, Kingella kingae in one, and Citrobacter amalonaticus in one. All isolates were susceptible to imipenem in vitro. Imipenem and cilastatin therapy was continued for a median of six days followed by treatment with appropriate orally administered antibiotics. Median peak serum bactericidal titers after imipenem and cilastatin infusions were 1:512 for S aureus, 1:32 for H influenzae b, 1:512 for streptococci, and 1:16 for gram-negative rods. All but one patient with P aeruginosa osteomyelitis responded favorably to imipenem and cilastatin. The median duration until resolution of symptoms was six days. Imipenem and cilastatin infusions were well tolerated, and side effects included maculopapular rash in one patient, watery diarrhea in one, and mild transient elevation of alanine aminotransferase levels in three. Because of imipenem and cilastatin's unusually broad spectrum of activity and its relative safety, this drug combination can be used for the initial, empiric therapy of acute bone and joint infections in pediatric patients.
TI  - [Refractory respiratory tract infections. 5. Persistence of chronic airway infections. a. Mechanism of etiology and persistence].
AB  
TI  - Ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, two fluoroquinolone antimicrobials.
AB  - The chemistry, mechanism of action, antimicrobial spectrum, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and dosage and administration of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin are reviewed, and mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance and drug and laboratory interactions are described. Norfloxacin is the first antimicrobial in the fluoroquinolone class to be marketed in the United States; ciprofloxacin is under investigation in clinical trials. The fluoroquinolones are structurally related to nalidixic acid. The activity and spectrum are enhanced by the addition of 6-fluoro and 7-piperazino substituents. Quinolone antimicrobials appear to inhibit DNA gyrase, an enzyme specific and essential for all bacteria, as their primary mechanism of action. As a result, DNA synthesis is inhibited. Ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin are active against gram-negative enteric bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Ciprofloxacin has good activity against Staphylcoccus spp., including methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus. Norfloxacin generally is less potent than ciprofloxacin, particularly against Ps. aeruginosa and Staph. aureus. Peak concentrations occur about one to two hours after an oral administration of either drug. Both drugs are widely distributed in body fluids and tissues and are eliminated by renal excretion, metabolism, and biliary excretion. Dosage reductions are required in severe renal dysfunction. Ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin are effective agents for treating urinary-tract infections, including infections caused by Ps. aeruginosa. The recommended dosage of norfloxacin for urinary-tract infections in adults is 400 mg orally every 12 hours; the drug should be given for 7 to 10 days in uncomplicated infections and for 10 to 21 days in complicated ones. The fluoroquinolones may be useful for treating chronic bacterial prostatitis. Ciprofloxacin is potentially useful for treating sexually transmitted diseases. Ciprofloxacin is active against N. gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains and strains that are resistant to tetracycline, and Chlamydia spp. Use of ciprofloxacin for treating gastrointestinal infections and for selective decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract is promising. In open studies, ciprofloxacin has been effective against a variety of infections caused by susceptible organisms. Resistance to ciprofloxacin has developed during treatment of infections caused by Ps. aeruginosa, Staph. aureus, and Serratia marcescens. The most frequently reported adverse effects of either drug are gastrointestinal complaints, headache, and dizziness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of CGP 31608, a new penem.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CGP 31608, a semisynthetic penem derivative, was compared with that of Sch 34343, imipenem, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, and ceftazidime and other beta-lactams, when appropriate, against 628 recent isolates and other beta-lactam-resistant strains. The MICs of CGP 31608 against 90% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria spp., Bacteroides spp., Clostridium spp., staphylococci, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were between 0.25 and 8 micrograms/ml. The susceptibility of beta-lactamase-producing strains and known porin mutants of the Enterobacteriaceae suggests that CGP 31608 is resistant to many important beta-lactamases (including the mutationally derepressed chromosomal enzymes) and is not excluded from the bacterial cell in strains expressing these known porin mutations. Generally, CGP 31608 was less active than imipenem, Sch 34343, and the cephalosporins, except against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The activity of CGP 31608 against Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains) was greater than that of the cephalosporins. The major target site in Escherichia coli K-12 for CGP 31608 was penicillin-binding protein 2. The serum protein binding of 5 micrograms of CGP 31608 per ml was 14%, and serum had little effect on activity.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of tigemonam, a novel oral monobactam.
AB  - Tigemonam, a novel, orally administered monobactam, exhibited potent and specific activity in vitro against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Its activity was variable to poor against gram-positive bacteria, Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobes. Within its spectrum of activity, tigemonam was far superior to oral antibiotics currently available, including amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefaclor, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. In addition, tigemonam was superior to cefuroxime, which is under development as an oral pro-drug, and more active than cefixime against several genera of the Enterobacteriaceae. The activity of tigemonam against the enteric bacteria, Haemophilus species, and Neisseria species was, in general, comparable to that of the quinolone norfloxacin. The excellent activity of tigemonam against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria reflected its marked stability to hydrolysis by isolated enzymes. The expanded spectrum of activity against gram-negative bacteria observed with tigemonam thus extends oral beta-lactam coverage to include members of the Enterobacteriaceae that are intrinsically or enzymatically resistant to broad-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins.
TI  - Roxithromycin (RU 28965) in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The clinical efficacy of roxithromycin, administered at the daily dosage of 300 mg (150 mg every 12 hours), was evaluated in 25 patients with respiratory tract infections, mostly infectious exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. Pathogens isolated before treatment were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus beta-haemoliticus, Haemophilus influenzae. Clinical cure or improvement was achieved in 21 out of 22 evaluable patients. The eradication rate was 91%. Tolerability was good: two patients reported gastrointestinal side effects which caused treatment discontinuation. These preliminary data suggest that roxithromycin may have a place in the treatment of respiratory infections.
TI  - [Prevention of gram-negative and gram-positive infections using 3 intravenous immunoglobulin preparations and therapy of experimental polymicrobial burn infection using intravenous Pseudomonas immunoglobulin G and ciprofloxacin in an animal model].
AB  - Three immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous infusion were compared in vivo  to determine their relative protective capacity against several gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. Polyglobin N is a conventional IgG concentrate. Psomaglobin N is identical in formulation to Polyglobin N but is prepared from the plasma of donors who have naturally high levels of antibody to lipopolysaccharide antigens of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. IgGMA is a conventional IgG concentrate containing 12% IgG and 16% IgA. In a murine model of burn wound sepsis the three IgG preparations were similarly protective against three or ten strains of P. aeruginosa. Psomaglobin N and Polyglobin N were significantly (p less than or equal to 0.015) more protective than IgG-MA against six of ten and three of ten strains of P. aeruginosa, respectively. In a murine model of Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 pneumonia, the three Ig preparations were similarly protective. IgG-MA was significantly more protective (p less than or equal to 0.025) than Psomaglobin N and Polyglobin N against Salmonella typhimurium in murine peritonitis. However, the mean protective dose (PD50) of the two later preparations was less than or equal to 20 mg/kg body weight. In models of peritonitis both Psomaglobin N and Polyglobin N were more protective than IgGMA (p less than or equal to 0.004) against Haemophilus influenzae b, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens 06:H3 and group B Streptococcus types 1b and 1c. Psomaglobin N and ciprofloxacin were employed to treat established polymicrobial murine burn wound sepsis resulting from contamination of the burn site with mixtures of P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Psomaglobin N or albumin was given once 16 h after challenge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. A-56620 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, Staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. A-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. Difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than A-56620. Both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC 0.015 micrograms/ml) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MK less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). Both agents were more active against streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. They inhibited Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. These agents show overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.
TI  - Lectins for the identification of ocular bacterial pathogens.
AB  - In a preliminary in vitro investigation, fluorescein-conjugated lectins were used in the identification of bacteria commonly involved in ocular infections. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Strep. pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Hemophilus influenzae, and Proteus mirabilis were incubated with each of eleven lectins using a slide technique. Bacterial fluorescence was readily observed with a fluorescence microscope. All clinical isolates bound wheat germ agglutinin. The Gram-positive isolates bound Concanavalin A, while the Gram-negative isolates did not, with rare exceptions. Streptococcal species isolates reacted with Dolichos biflorus agglutinin, while staphylococcal species isolates did not. Lectins may be useful in furthering the initial identification of causative organisms in bacterial ocular infections.
TI  - [Significance of Haemophilus influenzae and other microorganisms for the pathogenesis and therapy of chronic respiratory infection].
AB  - The host's respiratory defence mechanisms are transformed to chronic inflammatory reactions by the persistence of microorganisms and hence inflict damage on the host's own tissues. This change primarily reduces the capability of the mucociliary defence mechanisms. Such impairment can result from modifications to the mucus's physical chemical properties after an infection, or from damage to the ciliary epithelium. Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae cause ciliary dyskinesia and eventually lead to the destruction of the ciliary epithelium. Encapsulated type b H. influenzae strains appear to slow down the cilia most markedly. There is a fundamental difference between acute and chronic infections. In the case of acute infections the patient's normal defence mechanisms are usually intact. In chronic infections the chronic inflammatory response to the microorganisms causes the disease to progress. In such cases treatment must be considerably more aggressive since the host's "cleansing" capability is diminished. Thus, antibiotics must be applied which can effectively penetrate the bronchial tree and which also remain stable and bioactive in the presence of beta-lactamase producing microorganisms such as H. influenzae. It is conceivable that, in the future, antibiotic therapy will have to be combined with antiphlogistic agents.
TI  - Penetration of ofloxacin into bronchial secretions.
AB  - The penetration of ofloxacin into bronchial secretions was evaluated in 16 patients after administration of a single oral dose of ofloxacin 400mg. Bronchial secretions were aspirated at bronchoscopy after 1 to 6 hours and serum was collected simultaneously. Ofloxacin concentrations were measured by a microbiological assay method. Considerable individual variations in serum and bronchial aspirate concentrations were recorded: bronchial aspirate concentrations varied between 1.1 mg/L and 4.5 mg/L but exceeded 1.5 mg/L in 14 of 16 patients between 1 and 6 hours. The ratio between simultaneous mean bronchial aspirate and serum concentrations ranged between 0.53 in the second hour and 0.92 in the fourth hour. It is likely that inhibitory activity will be sustained over at least 6 hours against most potential respiratory pathogens including Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Gram-negative bacilli, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa may have minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values lower than ofloxacin concentrations achieved in bronchial secretions, although some isolates are less sensitive. Clinical studies should establish the relevance of pharmacokinetic data to respiratory infections caused by organisms of borderline susceptibility.
TI  - Efficacy and tolerance of oral ofloxacin in treating various infections.
AB  - 66 patients were given daily doses of ofloxacin between 400 and 800 mg for 10 days to 6 months. They were suffering from exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (15), soft tissue phlegmon (11), complicated urinary tract infections (7), bronchopneumonia (7), chronic osteomyelitis in exacerbation (8), chronic prostatitis in exacerbation (5), lower urinary tract infections (3), chronic otitis media (3), acute otitis (3), acute bronchitis (1), lung abscess (2) or liver abscess (1). Pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24), Haemophilus influenzae (16), Proteus mirabilis (6), Escherichia coli (6), Enterobacter cloacae (6), Providencia stuartii (2), Serratia marcescens (2), Citrobacter diversus (1), Salmonella enteritidis (1), Acinetobacter anitratus (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1). In 35 patients (53%), several aggravating factors coexisted. MICs of ofloxacin ranged from less than or equal to 0.06 to 2 mg/L. Clinically, 65% of the patients were considered as cured, 17% improved and 18% failed to respond. Bacteriologically, pathogens were eradicated in 62%, persisted in 16% and relapsed in 22%. Adverse reactions included gastrointestinal disturbances (4), rash plus facial oedema (1), abnormal liver function (2) and leucopenia (1).
TI  - Ofloxacin in respiratory tract infection. A review of the results of clinical trials in Japan.
AB  - An open clinical study of ofloxacin in respiratory tract infections was conducted with patients receiving daily doses of ofloxacin 300 mg, 400 mg or 600 mg. The duration of treatment was 6 to 14 days for 70% of the patients. Ofloxacin was effective in 668 of 828 patients analysed (80.7%). Of 293 patients with upper respiratory infections, the efficacy rate was 85.3%. In 535 cases with lower respiratory infections, ofloxacin was effective in 78.1%. It is noteworthy that a 70% efficacy rate was obtained in 80 cases with intractable chronic diffuse panbronchiolitis primarily associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There was no difference in the efficacy rate among various daily doses or severity of infections. In lower respiratory infections the bacterial eradication rate was 80.9% for Gram-positive aerobes (including 80% for Staphylococcus aureus and 76.5% for Streptococcus pneumoniae) and 72.1% for Gram-negative aerobes (including 92.6% for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 32.3% for P. aeruginosa and 97.1% for Haemophilus influenzae). Although there were no serious cases, adverse reactions were noted in 46 of 843 patients (5.5%): 38 cases (4.5%) of gastrointestinal tract reactions (nausea, vomiting, heartburn, etc.), 4 cases (0.5%) of hypersensitivity (e.g. eruption) and 19 (2.3%) of central nervous system effects (e.g. dizziness). Abnormal changes in laboratory findings included elevations of AST (1.2%) and ALT (1.5%) and an increase in the eosinophil count (1.7%).
TI  - Treatment of respiratory tract infections with cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  - Infections of the respiratory tract are among the most common causes for antibiotic prescribing. Their diagnosis within the community is generally limited to clinical criteria, and microbiological information is frequently lacking. Hospitalised patients with respiratory tract infections are more likely to undergo diagnostic sampling, but difficulties remain in reliably defining a microbial aetiology, thereby providing a confident basis for antibiotic selection. In considering the role of the cephalosporins in the treatment of respiratory tract infections, over 500 published articles have been reviewed. The pharmacokinetic considerations are discussed and the limitations of existing methodology are emphasised. Individual agents are reviewed by site of sepsis and conclusions are drawn from both comparative and non-comparative studies and in relation to currently recommended regimens. Although oral cephalosporins are widely used to treat upper respiratory tract infections, none is considered ideal, especially where Haemophilus influenzae is pathogenic. In the case of lower respiratory tract infections the beta-lactamase stable parenteral cephalosporins have become widely used to treat pneumonia in hospitalised patients, especially where Gram-negative enteric bacilli are of aetiological importance. However, the lack of activity of these drugs against Legionella spp., Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Coxiella burnetii must be emphasised. Another area of increasing use is in the treatment of infective exacerbations in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis of the lungs where Pseudomonas aeruginosa is pathogenic; ceftazidime in particular has proved a useful alternative to earlier antipseudomonal penicillin antibiotics.
TI  - Cephalosporins in the treatment of meningitis.
AB  - The synthesis of new cephalosporin antibiotics has provided agents which can effectively be used to treat most of the different forms of meningitis. None of the first generation cephalosporins can be considered acceptable as agents to treat meningitis. Cefuroxime can be used to treat meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis in children. Agents such as cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are appropriate for neonatal meningitis due to Escherichia coli and group B streptococci, but not Listeria monocytogenes. Cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftizoxime and ceftazidime have all proved effective as therapy of meningitis in children and adults when the pathogens are pneumococci, H. influenzae or N. meningitidis, but they have not been shown to yield an improved mortality or lower morbidity in spite of much greater cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) bactericidal titres. Cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime have been effective as therapy of meningitis due to E. coli, K. pneumoniae and Proteus species, but failures have occurred with all of the cephalosporins when used to treat meningitis due to Enterobacter spp. and Serratia marcescens. Only ceftazidime yields adequate CSF concentrations to treat meningitis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Overall, the cephalosporins can now be considered a major component of the therapy of acute bacterial meningitis irrespective of the age group to be treated.
TI  - [Incidence of deep respiratory tract infections].
AB  - The distribution of respiratory tract infections (RTI) among the general population is not uniform. The incidence in neonates and the elderly (older than 65) is 2 to 3 times higher than that in adults. Examinations to determine the responsible pathogen are conducted in less than 1% of cases of RTI. The overall incidence of Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae in hospitalized patients amounts to 13 to 27%. The incidences of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in intensive care units are approximately 20% each. The management of the disease should be based on an aetiological diagnosis, and must take the individual patient's condition into account. Examination of the sputum or bronchial rinsing fluid is still the most reliable form of diagnosis, however, a sufficient number of quantitative methods must be applied. In hospitalized--and especially intensive care--patients these methods are often successful in isolating H. influenzae and pneumococci which we cannot afford to ignore as pathogens.
TI  - [Prevention of gram-negative and gram-positive infections with 3 intravenous immunoglobulin preparations and therapy of experimental polymicrobial burn infection with intravenous Pseudomonas immunoglobulin G and ciprofloxacin in an animal model].
AB  - Three immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous infusion were compared in vivo  to determine their relative protective capacity against several gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. Polyglobin N is a conventional IgG concentrate. Psomaglobin N is identical in formulation to Polyglobin N but is prepared from the plasma of donors who have naturally high levels of antibody to lipopolysaccharide antigens of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. IgGMA is a conventional IgG concentrate containing 12% IgG and 16% IgA. In a murine model of burn wound sepsis the three IgG preparations were similarly protective against three or ten strains of P. aeruginosa. Psomaglobin N and Polyglobin N were significantly (p less than or equal to 0.015) more protective than IgGMA against six of ten and three of ten strains of P. aeruginosa, respectively. In a murine model of Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 pneumonia, the three Ig preparations were similarly protective. IgGMA was significantly more protective (p less than or equal to 0.025) than Psomaglobin N and Polyglobin N against Salmonella typhimurium in murine peritonitis. However, the mean protective dose (PD50) of the two later preparations was less than or equal to 20 mg/kg body weight. In models of peritonitis both Psomaglobin N and Polyglobin N were more protective than IgGMA (p less than or equal to 0.004) against Haemophilus influenzae b, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens 06:H3 and group B Streptococcus types 1b and 1c. Psomaglobin N and ciprofloxacin were employed to treat established polymicrobial murine burn wound sepsis resulting from contamination of the burn site with mixtures of P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Immunological research and criteria for determining the etiology of acute bronchitis in young children].
AB  - In the determination of the etiology of acute bronchitis in children, a complex of microbiological and immunological methods should be used. The isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae at a concentration of greater than or equal to 10(4) cels/ml from tracheobronchial washings is the early and most significant method for the determination of the etiology and therapy of acute bronchitis. On the basis of microbiological and immunobiological criteria, the etiological role of S. pneumoniae has been determined in 78% of patients and that of H. influenzae, in 48% of patients, mainly in association with pneumococci.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of LY164846, a new oral cephalosporin, and recommendations for disk diffusion tests.
AB  - LY164846 is a new oral cephalosporin with a limited spectrum of antimicrobial activity that includes staphylococci (other than methicillin-resistant), streptococci (other than enterococci), Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase-negative and beta-lactamase-positive), Branhamella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase-negative and beta-lactamase-positive), and Neisseria species (beta-lactamase negative and beta-lactamase-positive). The tentative recommendations for susceptibility breakpoints are less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml and greater than or equal to 19 mm for susceptible, 8 micrograms/ml and 15-18 mm for intermediate, and greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 14 mm for resistant.
TI  - Evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin against nosocomial infections and multiresistant pathogens.
AB  - Thirty-five patients suffering from soft tissue infections (12), upper UTIs (6),  bronchopneumonia (6), septicaemia (2), chronic osteomyelitis (2), intra-abdominal abscess (2), liver abscess (1), lung abscess (1), acute cholangitis (1), thoracic empyema (1) and chronic prostatitis (1) were given imipenem/cilastatin for 6-21 days. In 22 patients several aggravating factors coexisted, while infection in 16 patients was polymicrobial. The following pathogens were implicated: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21), Escherichia coli (15), Enterobacter cloacae (6), Proteus spp. (3), Klebsiella pneumoniae(3), Citrobacter freundii (1), Salmonella enteritidis (1), Acinetobacter spp. (4), Haemophilus influenzae (2), Bacteroides fragilis (1) and Peptococcus saccharolyticus (1) with MICs to imipenem ranging between 0.5 and 8 mg/l. A successful clinical response was observed in 91.4% of the patients, while pathogens were eradicated in 75.9%, persisted in 24.2% and recurred, in 9.1% of patients, with development of resistance to imipenem in two Ps. aeruginosa strains. Against 150 multiresistant strains of Ps. aeruginosa, 40% of which were resistant to amikacin, 86.4% and 88.9% were found sensitive to ceftazidime and imipenem respectively. It is concluded that imipenem provides the possibility of treating successfully multiresistant and polymicrobial infections with a single antimicrobial.
TI  - Bacteria associated with obstructive pulmonary disease elaborate extracellular products that stimulate mucin secretion by explants of guinea pig airways.
AB  - Certain cell-free filtrates from broth cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Hemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae stimulate secretion of glycoconjugates by explants of guinea pig trachea. The stimulatory effect is not related to toxicity or damage to the respiratory mucosa, as well as could be determined by ultrastructural examination of the explants after exposure. Bacteria isolated from patients with a history of chronic obstructive lung disease (P aeruginosa from cystic fibrosis, H influenzae, and S pneumoniae from chronic bronchitis) do not demonstrate increased frequency of positive strains or greater stimulation of secretion than organisms isolated from other individuals. At least three stimulatory substances are found in cell-free filtrates of P aeruginosa. They appear to be proteins of molecular weight 60,000-100,000 as determined by gel filtration. Within the crude filtrate, they are relatively stable to heat, proteolysis, and storage at 4 C and in liquid nitrogen. The stimulatory activity is not lost upon subculture of the bacteria. When isolated from the filtrate by column chromatography, they become labile to heat and trypsin. Isolated active fractions show proteolytic activity coinciding with mucin-stimulating capacity, suggesting a relationship with Pseudomonas proteases. Stimulatory substances released by S pneumoniae and H influenzae appear to be different from those elaborated by Pseudomonas. They are extremely labile to heat and storage, and the capacity to stimulate secretion is lost on subculture. Preliminary gel filtration indicates the S pneumoniae stimulatory substance(s) is in a molecular weight range of 100,000-300,000 daltons, while that of H influenzae is between 50,000 and 200,000. The results suggest bacteria which chronically infect or colonize respiratory airways of individuals suffering from obstructive lung disease can elaborate extracellular product(s) capable of stimulating secretion of mucin. Thus, the bacteria themselves may contribute to local manifestations and, ultimately, to the pathogenesis of obstructive disease.
TI  - Oral ciprofloxacin therapy of infection caused by multiply resistant bacteria other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Of 125 patients treated with ciprofloxacin at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, New York, 34 had infections due to bacteria other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mean age of the patients was 50 years (19-88 years) and most had significant underlying disease. There were nine lower respiratory infections, eight urinary tract infections, eight soft tissue infections, three osteomyelitis, and three intra-abdominal infections. The pathogens were: Escherichia coli, 7 (mean MIC 0.07 mg/l); Serratia marcescens, 6 (0.2 mg/l); Enterobacter spp., 5 (0.1 mg/l); Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 (0.1 mg/l); Proteus mirabilis, 3 (0.06 mg/l); Cutrobacter freundii, 2 (0.06 mg/l), Staphylococcus aureus, 3 (0.5 mg/l); and one each of Acinetobacter anitratus. Haemophilus, influenzae, Salmonella enteritidis, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, and Streptococcus faecalis. Of these organisms 81% were resistant to ampicillin, 70% to carbenicillin, 22% to gentamicin, 49% to cefazolin and cephalexin, and 25% to cotrimoxazole. Ten patients had concomitant Ps. aeruginosa infections. Patients were treated orally with 500 mg or 750 mg ciprofloxacin every 12 h. The overall clinical response rate was 88%, and the bacteriological response 76%, and 65% if Ps. aeruginosa is included. Resistance to ciprofloxacin developed in one Staph. aureus and one Ser. marcescens (MIC greater than 2 mg/l). Toxicity was minor. Ciprofloxacin was effective and safe therapy of infections due to Gram-negative bacteria resistant to many of the currently available oral and parenteral agents.
TI  - Aztreonam therapy for serious gram-negative infections in children.
AB  - Fifty-nine children were enrolled in an open trial of aztreonam, a monocyclic beta-lactam, therapy for serious gram-negative infections. Thirty-six infections were microbiologically evaluable and received five or more days of therapy. Patients' ages ranged from 3 days to 12 years, and diagnoses included pyelonephritis or cystitis (20), deep soft tissue or joint infection (seven), septicemia (four), pneumonia (three), peritonitis, and epiglottitis. Causative bacteria included Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae. The standard regimen was 30 mg/kg every six or eight hours intravenously. All isolates were aztreonam-susceptible and were eradicated during therapy. Two patients had microbiologic relapses: a patient with Salmonella choleraesuis meningitis who was initially treated for only ten days and a patient with E coli pyelonephritis. Clinical cure was achieved in 31 of 36 children. Pharmacokinetic studies performed in six children demonstrated no difference in serum concentrations or pharmacokinetic variables between day 1 and day 7 of therapy. Although several patients had transient eosinophilia (eight), elevated levels of aminotransferase (seven), or thrombocytosis (ten), no clinically significant adverse effects were noted. In this initial, uncontrolled study, aztreonam was effective and safe in the treatment of a variety of serious gram-negative infections in children.
TI  - The comparative in-vitro activity of eight newer quinolones and nalidixic acid.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activity of nalidixic acid and the 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, A-56619, A-56620 and CI-934 was assessed by determination of MICs. The 4-quinolones were all highly active against most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, including nalidixic acid-resistant strains. Ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.002-2 mg/l) was the most active and A-56619 (MICs 0.008-32 mg/l) was the least active. A-56619, A-56620, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and CI-934 were highly active against Acinetobacter strains, pefloxacin and enoxacin were slightly less active, and a few strains were resistant to norfloxacin. All the compounds, including nalidixic acid, were active against Aeromonas strains (MICs 0.001-0.12 mg/l). Ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.06-1 mg/l) was the most active compound against Pseudomonas aeruginosa; A-56619 and CI-934 (MICs 1-16 mg/l) were the least active against this species. All the compounds were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae but the activity of all the compounds was poor against most isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis. All the 4-quinolones were active against staphylococci and CI-934 (MICs 0.03-0.25 mg/l) was the most active. CI-934 (MICs 0.06-2 mg/l) was also the most active compound against all streptococci. Most streptococci were sensitive also to ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.25-4 mg/l) but there were many isolates resistant to the other 4-quinolones. Against the anaerobic bacteria CI-934 was again the most active compound, particularly against the Gram-positive anaerobic cocci. Pefloxacin, enoxacin and norfloxacin had poor activity against most anaerobes. Ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, A-56619 and A-56620 had good to moderate activity against all species of anaerobes except the Bacteroides fragilis group, against which none of the compounds was very active.
TI  - [Treatment of bronchopulmonary infections in patients during artificial respiration with imipenem/cilastatin].
AB  - In an open prospective study the efficacy and tolerance of imipenem/cilastatin was investigated in 24 critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation with nosocomial respiratory tract infection. Nine patients had previously received antibiotic therapy which had failed. Imipenem was given in a dose of 1-3g/24 h over 5-37 (mean 11) days. Seven patients were additionally treated with aminoglycosides, one patient with erythromycin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Hemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli were the most frequently isolated pathogens from tracheobronchial secretions. 91% of the infections without and 77% with involvement of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were successfully treated. All of the gram-positive and 85% of the gram-negative pathogens (Pseudomonas not included) were eliminated in the course of therapy. By contrast, 64% of the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa persisted; half of these became imipenem-resistant. Nine patients showed adverse reactions including one case of pseudomembranous colitis which were reversible. Imipenem/cilastatin proved highly effective and was relatively well tolerated; limitations in the efficacy were seen in cases of infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - The anti-microbial activity, beta-lactamase stability, and disk diffusion susceptibility testing of carumonam (RO 17-2301, AMA-1080), a new monobactam.
AB  - Carumonam, a new monobactam, was found to have an anti-microbial spectrum similar to aztreonam. Its spectrum includes Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, pathogenic Neisseria species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and some streptococci. Staphylococcus species, enterococci, and many other nonenteric gram-negative bacilli were not inhibited. Enterobacteriaceae resistant to cefoperazone (minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs] greater than or equal to 32 mg/L) were more likely inhibited by carumonam (52% at less than or equal to 8.0 mg/L) than aztreonam (39%) or ceftazidime (35%). Dilution test methods on agar or in Mueller-Hinton broth produced similar results. Carumonam minimum bactericidal concentrations were usually the same or one dilution above the MIC. Carumonam and aztreonam were very stable to most chromosomal (P99, K1, K14) and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (TEM, OXA, PSE). The Klebsiella oxytoca enzymes hydrolyzed aztreonam at rates greater than or equal to fivefold higher than carumonam but at a rate less than 1% that of cephaloridine. The aztreonam MICs for these Klebsiella stains were greater than or equal to 32 mg/L, but the hydrolysis rates do not fully explain the high-grade resistance to aztreonam. In vitro susceptibility tests with 30-micrograms carumonam disks were found to be very predictive. Similar regression statistics were observed for aztreonam and cefotaxime. Recommendations for carumonam susceptibility testing are susceptible greater than or equal to 21 mm (less than or equal to 8.0 mg/L) and resistant less than or equal to 14 mm (greater than or equal to 32 mg/L). Cross-resistance analysis favors the independent testing of carumonam or aztreonam against gram-negative species other than Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Sulbactam/ampicillin vs. chloramphenicol/ampicillin for the treatment of meningitis in infants and children.
AB  - Eighty-one patients ages one month to 14 years with meningitis were randomized to receive either sulbactam (50 mg/kg per day) and ampicillin (400 mg/kg per day; 41 patients) or chloramphenicol and ampicillin (40 patients). The groups were comparable in terms of sex and degree of illness; however, more patients treated with chloramphenicol/ampicillin than patients treated with sulbactam/ampicillin were younger than 12 months of age (78% vs. 56%). Pathogens were isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 65 (80%) of the 81 patients. In the sulbactam/ampicillin group, there were 18 Haemophilus influenzae isolates (one resistant to ampicillin), five Streptococcus pneumoniae, five Neisseria meningitidis, one Klebsiella pneumoniae, one Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one Listeria. In the chloramphenicol/ampicillin group, there were 19 H. influenzae isolates, 10 S. pneumoniae, three N. meningitidis, one Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and one Citrobacter. Of 63 patients with assessable CSF pathogens, one (3%) of 29 treated with sulbactam/ampicillin died (S. pneumoniae) and six (18%) of 34 treated with chloramphenicol/ampicillin died (two, H. influenzae; three, S. pneumoniae; and one, Citrobacter). Twelve percent in the sulbactam/ampicillin group and 18% in the chloramphenicol/ampicillin group had neurologic sequelae. No clinically significant reactions or toxicities were noted. Sulbactam/ampicillin was as effective as chloramphenicol/ampicillin in the treatment of meningitis.
TI  - In vitro activity of DQ-2556, a new cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of DQ-2556, a new semisynthetic cephalosporin, was compared with that of ceftazidime and cefotaxime. The activity of DQ-2556 against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae was roughly comparable to that of cefotaxime. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, DQ-2556 was slightly less active than ceftazidime. DQ-2556 was more active than the reference cephalosporins against staphylococci. Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were also highly susceptible to DQ-2556.
TI  - Pseudallescheriasis in northern Britain.
AB  - Five cases of Pseudallescheria boydii infection are reported from the northern part of the United Kingdom. None of the patients had travelled abroad. Three cases of otitis in which P. boydii was associated with bacterial infections were diagnosed within a 6-month period. A lady who had diabetes mellitus presented with a pulmonary fungus ball in a pre-existent cavity caused by a previous bacterial infection. After minor trauma at the site of an old skin graft, a farmer's wife developed an ulcer on the dorsum of the right ankle. Precipitating antibodies were demonstrated except in two of the cases of ear infection. The management of the individual cases is discussed.

TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of two oral cephalosporins, ceftetrame (Ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (Ro 15-8074).
AB  - Ceftetrame (Ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (Ro 15-8074), two new orally administered aminothiazolyl imimomethoxy cephalosporins, inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml but were less active against staphylococci than were cephalexin and cefaclor. They did not inhibit S. faecalis, S. faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium JK species, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including ampicillin-resistant isolates, were inhibited at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml. Both agents inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, Shigella species, Citrobacter diversus, and Aeromonas hydrophila resistant to ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, although many isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime were not inhibited by these agents. A marked inoculum effect was noted for Enterobacteriaceae carrying the Richmond-Sykes type 1A chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, but plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases did not hydrolyze the compounds. Both drugs inhibited the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of E. cloacae, P99.
TI  - Sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14C-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
AB  - Bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. In order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14C-taurocholate (TC) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. The results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. Supernatants from Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14C-TC uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. Streptococcus faecalis (Enterococcus), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from Proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). Bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- SEM) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14C-TC uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). The results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Cefoperazone for empiric therapy in patients with impaired renal function.
AB  - Thirty-five patients with serious infections and impaired renal function were treated empirically with 2 to 8 g of cefoperazone per day. Infections included sepsis in 14, nonbacteremic urinary infections in nine, pneumonia in five, intra-abdominal infection in five, fasciitis in one, and malignant otitis externa in one. The average age of this group was 64.3 years, 25 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases, and their average serum creatinine level was 5.2 mg/dl. Infections were caused by Enterobacteriaceae in 23 patients, Streptococcus faecalis in five, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in four, Staphylococcus aureus in four, Hemophilus influenzae in three, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Clostridium sordelli in one each. Overall, 32 patients had clinical and microbiologic cures, two had improvement, and one had failure. Hypoprothrombinemia occurred in 18 of 28 patients not given vitamin K for prophylaxis and occurred more often in those with serum albumin concentrations below 3.5 g/dl. Prothrombin times returned to normal within 36 hours of treatment with vitamin K, although two patients experienced mild hematemesis. In anicteric patients with liver function abnormalities, 2 g every 12 hours produced peak and trough serum concentrations that averaged 254 and 125 micrograms/ml, respectively, compared with 179.5 and 19.5 micrograms/ml, respectively, in five with normal liver function test results. In jaundiced patients treated with 1 g every 12 hours, trough concentrations were comparably elevated. Serum concentrations did not correlate with hypoprothrombinemia, but high levels throughout the dosing interval may have contributed to the excellent cure rate in this study.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of CI-934 compared with that of other new 4-quinolones and  nalidixic acid.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of CI-934, a new 4-quinolone compound, was compared with that of the other new 4-quinolones, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin, and also with that of nalidixic acid. CI-934 was more active than any of the other 4-quinolones tested against Gram-positive aerobic organisms including Staphylococcus aureus (MICs 0.06-0.25 mg/l), beta-haemolytic streptococci (MICs 0.12-0.5 mg/l), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MICs 0.25-0.5 ml/l), viridans streptococci (MICs 0.06-0.5 mg/l) and most enterococci (MICs 0.12-0.5 mg/l), although some ampicillin-resistant isolates of Str. faecium were slightly less susceptible (MICs 2 mg/l). All three of the newer 4-quinolones tested were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas sp., Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MICs mostly less than 1 mg/l). The other Gram-negative aerobes tested were in general somewhat less susceptible, although for Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MICs seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. CI-934 was more active than enoxacin against Gardnerella vaginalis (MICs 1-8 mg/l) although it was a little less active than ciprofloxacin. Bacteroides species (including about half of the fragilis group) were susceptible to CI-934 (MICs mostly 1-8 mg/l): ciprofloxacin had similar activity but enoxacin was less active. Other anaerobes tested were mostly highly susceptible to CI-934 (MICs 1 mg/l or less) but were somewhat less susceptible to enoxacin and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Conformity of bacterial growth in sputum and contamination free endobronchial samples in patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - The use of sputum cultures to guide the antimicrobial treatment of patients with  cystic fibrosis has been questioned. Bacterial growth and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of 33 culture pairs from sputum and contamination free endobronchial swabs from 14 patients with cystic fibrosis were compared. As expected, Pseudomonas aeruginosa of the mucoid and non-mucoid type, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae were the organisms most frequently found. Absolute or good agreement was found in 73% of the culture pairs. The accuracy of the sputum cultures improved with the duration of antimicrobial treatment. The extra information gained from the endobronchial culture did not change the antimicrobial strategy from that based on the sputum culture alone. It is concluded that sputum cultures provide accurate information about the bacterial colonisation of the lower respiratory tract in patients with cystic fibrosis and therefore can be trusted both at onset of treatment and during the entire treatment period.
TI  - Infection in patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal genetic disease of Caucasians. The disease affects the exocrine gland secretions throughout the body, and as a result, major pathologic changes develop in the pancreas and in the bronchi. Obstruction of the respiratory airways results in chronic infection, and in time, this leads to progressive deterioration of lung function. In the initial stages of the disease, usually during infancy, infection with Staphylococcus aureus plays an important role. Hemophilus influenzae infections are also common. As the disease progresses, infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa develops. Exacerbation of bronchopulmonary infection is often initiated by respiratory viral or mycoplasmal infection, with superimposed S. aureus and P. aeruginosa infections contributing to the severity of the infection. Frequent courses of antibiotic therapy are usually required, and some patients may have to receive antibiotics continuously. Oral cephalosporins, ampicillin, and the combination of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are commonly used for relatively mild infections. In the treatment of exacerbation of infection, intravenous penicillinase-resistant penicillins and anti-Pseudomonas antibiotics are the drugs of choice. For Pseudomonas infections, ticarcillin, carbenicillin, the ureidopenicillins, and the aminoglycosides are indicated. The combination of an anti-Pseudomonas penicillin and an aminoglycoside are most commonly used. Of the third-generation cephalosporins, ceftazidime appears to be the most efficacious. The quinolones (such as ciprofloxacin) are also active against P. aeruginosa, and preliminary studies of these drugs in patients with cystic fibrosis appear to indicate that they are as efficacious as the already available antibiotics. In many centers, Pseudomonas cepacia has emerged as a serious problem in patients with cystic fibrosis. This organism tends to develop resistance to multiple antibiotics. In some centers, infection with P. cepacia has been associated with a severe, frequently fatal, pneumonia.
TI  - Growth-enhancing effects of culture filtrates of sputum isolates on the L-forms of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The growth-enhancing effects of culture filtrates of respiratory pathogenic bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae, as well as normal floral bacteria other than Neisseria perflava and Branhamella catarrhalis on L-forms of H. influenzae were examined in vitro, using five species of major respiratory pathogenic bacteria and seven species of normal floral bacteria commonly isolated from the sputum of patients with chronic respiratory tract infections. The growth-enhancing factor(s) was present in the filtrates prepared from the culture of respiratory pathogenic Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, the effects of which were as potent as those of a culture filtrate of B. catarrhalis used as the positive control. The culture filtrates of respiratory pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae had weak growth-enhancing effects on H. influenzae L-forms. The culture filtrates of 21 strains of normal floral bacteria isolated from the sputum including alpha-hemolytic Streptococci, non-hemolytic Streptococci, Micrococcus roseus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci, and Neisseria spp. had growth-enhancing effects on the L-forms of H. influenzae. These data elucidate the significance of L-forms of H. influenzae in recurrent infections due to H. influenzae in patients with chronic respiratory tract infections.

TI  - Bactericidal effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids.
AB  - Bactericidal effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids were investigated by using an in vitro killing assay. All gram-positive species tested were extremely susceptible to 10(-5) M arachidonic acid as were Neisseria, Branhamella, and Haemophilus spp. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and and members of the Enterobacteriaceae were resistant. The toxicity of polyunsaturated fatty acids for Staphylococcus aureus was dependent upon time, concentration, and fatty acid unsaturation. Arachidonic acid underwent peroxidation when incubated with S. aureus, but arachidonic acid peroxidation products had low bactericidal activity. Catalase protected S. aureus, whereas superoxide dismutase was ineffective. Scavengers of hydroxyl radicals or singlet oxygen or removal of halide ions had little effect on arachidonic acid-induced killing of bacteria, whereas transition metal chelators and some thiols were highly protective. S. aureus grown in iron-supplemented broth had increased iron content and arachidonic acid susceptibility. Ascorbate also potentiated arachidonic acid-induced killing of S. aureus. These observations indicate that bactericidal effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids are mediated by a peroxidative process involving H2O2 and bacterial iron.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247, two orally administered cephalosporin metabolites.
AB  - The activity of two iminomethoxy aminothiazoly cephalosporins, Ro 15-8074 and Ro  19-5247, was compared with that of other beta-lactams against a total of 491 bacterial strains. Both were highly active (MIC for 90% of the strains tested [MIC 90], less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml) against the majority of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae, being at least 16-fold more active than cephalexin and 8-fold more active than cefuroxime. There was no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and poor activity against Morganella morganii (in the case of Ro 15-8074), Enterobacter sp., and Citrobacter sp. Staphylococcus aureus was moderately susceptible to Ro 19-5247 (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml), but Ro 15-8074 was eightfold less active. The protein binding of the two compounds at 5 micrograms/ml was 9.1% for Ro 15-8074 and 69.9% for Ro 19-5247. The major target site for the two cephalosporins was PBP 3.
TI  - [In vitro activity of carumonam (RO 17-2301) on hospital bacteria].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of carumonam (RO 17-2301), a new synthetic antibacterial agent of the monobactam group, were evaluated by agar dilution for 399 hospital isolates. RO 17-2301 was inactive against Gram positive and anaerobic bacteria. Most Enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by concentrations less than 1 microgram/ml, with mode MICs approximating 0.03 micrograms/ml except for Providencia (0.016), Citrobacter (0.06), Serratia (0.06) and Enterobacter (0.12). A few strains, most of which were Enterobacter or Citrobacter, had high MICs (greater than 8 micrograms/ml). RO 17-2301 was less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mode MIC 2 micrograms/ml) and Acinetobacter (mode MIC 8-16 micrograms/ml). Haemophilus influenzae sp. were sensitive to RO 17-2301 (mode MIC 0.12-0.25), regardless of beta-lactamase production status; MICs ranged from 0.06 to 0.25 micrograms/ml for Meningococci, and from 0.008 to 0.06 for Gonococci except for a few strains that had higher MICs (0.25 to 0.5 and even 4 micrograms/ml). In vitro activity of RO 17-2301 on Gram negative bacteria proved similar to that of third-generation cephalosporins; cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae are resistant to RO 17-2301.
TI  - Comparative activities of the beta-lactamase inhibitors YTR 830, clavulanate, and sulbactam combined with ampicillin and broad-spectrum penicillins against defined beta-lactamase-producing aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The in vitro synergistic activities of the beta-lactamase inhibitors YTR 830, clavulanate, and sulbactam, combined with ampicillin, ticarcillin, mezlocillin, azlocillin, piperacillin, and apalcillin, were determined against 34 strains of members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Haemophilus influenzae with characterized plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases or both. Strains were tested against fixed concentrations of beta-lactamase inhibitors (8 micrograms/ml) combined with doubling dilutions of beta-lactams. Synergy was defined as a fourfold or greater decrease in the MIC of the beta-lactam. Against Enterobacteriaceae producing Richmond and Sykes class III and V plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, synergy was obtained against most strains with YTR 830- and clavulanate-beta-lactam combinations, with sulbactam being less effective. Against Enterobacteriaceae producing class I chromosomal beta-lactamases, combinations containing YTR 830 or sulbactam were more synergistic than combinations containing clavulanate. Against strains producing class V PSE enzymes, all three inhibitors were synergistic with piperacillin and apalcillin against strains producing PSE-1, -3, and -4 enzymes, while the PSE-2-producing strain was resistant to all inhibitors. YTR 830-beta-lactam combinations were also synergistic against strains producing the novel beta-lactamases OHIO-1, TLE-1, AER-1, and ROB-1. Overall, YTR 830 with piperacillin or apalcillin was the most effective combination.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of AM-833, a new quinolone derivative.
AB  - AM-833 showed potent activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria spp., and Haemophilus influenzae and good activity against staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Branhamella catarrhalis. Against these bacteria, its activity was roughly comparable to that of norfloxacin and ofloxacin but was slightly less potent than that of ciprofloxacin. This compound also showed good activity against drug-resistant strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and gentamicin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The protective effects of a single oral dose of AM-833 on systemic bacterial infections in mice were greater than those of norfloxacin. AM-833 was as effective as ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against systemic infections with Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and it showed somewhat higher activity against staphylococcal infections than did the other quinolones. AM-833 exhibited good prophylactic activity against E. coli infections. AM-833 also proved effective against localized infections such acute pneumonia and ascending urinary tract infections in mice. The excellent therapeutic efficacy of AM-833 against these systemic and local infections may be a result of its good oral absorption and high levels in tissues.
TI  - Antimicrobial spectrum of Ro 15-8074/001, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - The activity of Ro 15-8074/001 was compared with that of cefaclor, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin, and ceftriaxone against 225 clinical isolates. It was more active than cefaclor, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae and had activity similar to that of cefaclor against nonenterococcal streptococci. It was not usefully active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, or most isolates of staphylococci.
TI  - In-vitro activity of ticarcillin with and without clavulanic acid against clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ticarcillin with and without clavulanic acid was investigated against 285 freshly isolated clinical strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by the agar-dilution technique on Mueller-Hinton-agar. Clavulanic acid had an excellent or moderate potentiating effect on the in-vitro activity of ticarcillin against staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter spp., Acinetobacter, Haemophilus influenzae and Bacteroides spp. No effect was seen against enterococci, indole-positive Proteus spp., Ent. cloacae, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The effect of clavulanic acid was dose- and inoculum-dependent.
TI  - In vitro activity of DJ-6783 (a keto carboxylic acid) compared with six other orally administered antimicrobial agents.
AB  - DJ-6783 is a new keto carboxylic acid having an expanded antimicrobial activity when compared with nalidixic acid or cinoxacin. Its usable activity includes the following: Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06-4.0 micrograms/ml), Acinetobacter species (MIC90, 0.25-1.0 microgram/ml), Pseudomonas species (MIC90, 1.0-2.0 micrograms/ml), P. aeruginosa (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml), Staphylococcus species (MIC90, 1.0-32 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC900, less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml), and Neisseria species (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml). The Streptococcus species were resistant to DL-6783 with MIC50 ranging from 16 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml. The drug appears to be bactericidal, minimally influenced by increasing inocula, but resistant mutants can be selected by serial subinhibitory concentration passages of strains in DJ-6783. The resulting resistant organisms also have higher MICs to related drugs such as norfloxacin, cinoxacin, and nalidixic acid. DJ-6783 was the most active organic acid not having structural characteristics of the fluorinated 4-quinolones.
TI  - The activity of BMY 28142 a new broad spectrum beta-lactamase stable cephalosporin.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of BMY 28142, an iminomethoxy, aminothiazolyl cephalosporin containing a methyl pyrrolidinio C-3 was compared with that of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, imipenem and tobramycin against various bacteria. BMY 28142 was the most active agent tested against the Enterobacteriaceae inhibiting 90% at less than or equal to 1 mg/l. The in-vitro activity of BMY 28142 was equal to or superior to cefotaxime against the highly susceptible members of the Enterobacteriaceae and several-fold superior to ceftazidime and aztreonam. BMY 28142 inhibited many Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam. BMY 28142 was more active than imipenem against Proteus, Providencia and Morganella species. Ceftazidime and imipenem were more active than BMY 28142 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but it inhibited piperacillin and tobramycin-resistant isolates. BMY 28142 inhibited beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. BMY 28142 was more active than ceftazidime against streptococcal and staphylococcal species, but it did not inhibit or kill most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. BMY 28142 did not inhibit most Bacteroides species. BMY 28142 was not hydrolyzed by common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it bound poorly to Enterobacter beta-lactamase, was a poor inhibitor of the TEM plasmid beta-lactamase and was a poor inducer of beta-lactamases.
TI  - Bacteremia and fungemia in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
AB  - Forty-nine episodes of bacteremia and fungemia occurred in 38 of 336 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome seen at our institution since 1980. There were five types of infections. Infections commonly associated with a T-cell immunodeficiency disorder comprised 16 episodes and included those with Salmonella species, Listeria monocytogenes, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Histoplasma capsulatum. Infections commonly associated with a B-cell immunodeficiency disorder included those with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Infections occurring with neutropenia were caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis. Other infections occurring in the hospital were caused by Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, enteric gram-negative rods, Staphylococcus aureus, and mixed S. aureus and group G streptococcus. Other infections occurring out of the hospital included those with S. aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Shigella sonnei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and group B streptococcus. Because two thirds of the septicemias were caused by organisms other than T-cell opportunists, these pathogens should be anticipated during diagnostic evaluation and when formulating empiric therapy.
TI  - Variation in the potentiation of beta-lactam antibiotic activity by clavulanic acid and sulbactam against multiply antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - Using a broth microdilution method, we studied 120 strains of beta-lactamase-producing clinical isolates to determine the potentiating effect of clavulanic acid and sulbactam (both beta-lactamase inhibitors) on the antibacterial activity of a variety of beta-lactam antibiotics. All antibiotics were tested alone and in combination with each inhibitor simultaneously using low (10(5) cfu/ml) and high (10(7) cfu/ml) inocula. Against the strains of Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae the addition of both inhibitors significantly potentiated the activity of most antibiotics at the low inoculum. At the high inoculum, however, this effect was abrogated against E. coli and most strains of H. influenzae. Antibiotic activity was significantly enhanced by the inhibitors at both inoculum sizes with Bacteroides fragilis. Antibiotic resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was little affected by the inhibitors. Among methicillin-resistant staphylococci, antibiotic potentiation by the inhibitors was more significant for Staphylococcus aureus than the coagulase-negative staphylococci.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - Eighty hospital patients with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis  associated with Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa were treated with ciprofloxacin. The patients were divided into four groups of 20 patients each and administered either 500 mg, 750 mg (two different batches of tablets) or 1000 mg twice daily for ten days. Most of the patients with Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis infections were treated successfully but the results in patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections were less satisfactory. Although the ciprofloxacin MICs for the latter organisms were relatively low, mean serum and sputum concentrations measured on the first day of treatment did not exceed 2-3 mg/l and 1-2.3 mg/l respectively. The overall clinical results for all dosage regimes were only fair, mainly due to failure to eradicate Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Adverse effects (nausea, stomach pain or hallucinations) were seen in eight patients, causing treatment to be discontinued in five. It is concluded that ciprofloxacin is only of limited use in the treatment of respiratory tract infections unless Streptococcus pneumoniae is absent.
TI  - In-vitro activity of newer quinolones against aerobic bacteria.
AB  - Nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. The 4-quinolones were regularly active (MIC90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, different Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Agrobacter spp., Aeromonas spp., Plesiomonas spp., Neisseria meningitidis. Other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Nocardia asteroides, P. maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxydans and Alcaligenes denitrificans. Ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. All the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. The MBC/MIC ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with Streptococcus agalactiae, Str. faecalis and L. monocytogenes. A two- to eight-fold increase of MIC was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. Susceptible bacterial population of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the MIC) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the MIC). Supplementing the media with MgSO4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented agar, with all quinolone or strains. Less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with ZnSO4 or Ca(NO3)2.
TI  - The comparative in-vitro activity of pefloxacin.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activities of pefloxacin, other 4-quinolones and representative beta-lactams and aminoglycosides were assessed by determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Pefloxacin (MICs mostly 0.03-2 mg/l) was highly active against Enterobacteriaceae. Gentamicin had slightly lower activity, and ceftazidime and norfloxacin similar activities to pefloxacin whereas ciprofloxacin was more active. Pefloxacin (MICs 0.03-2 mg/l) was active against Acinetobacter but again ciprofloxacin was more active. Aeromonas was highly susceptible to pefloxacin and norfloxacin (MICs 0.008-0.03 mg/l) as well as to ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.001-0.008 mg/l). Pefloxacin (MICs 1-8 mg/l) had similar activities to ceftazidime and gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa but tobramycin (MICs 0.25-32 mg/l), norfloxacin (MICs 0.25-4 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.06-1 mg/l) were generally more active. Haemophilus influenzae was susceptible to pefloxacin (MICs 0.008-0.06 mg/l) and to norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, all of which were more active than ampicillin or ceftazidime. Gardnerella vaginalis was not very susceptible to pefloxacin (MICs 2-8 mg/l), the other 4-quinolones or gentamicin but ampicillin and ceftazidime were highly active. Neisseria gonorrhoeae was very susceptible to pefloxacin and norfloxacin (MICs 0.016-0.12 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.002-0.008 mg/l). The activity of pefloxacin (MICs 0.25-1 mg/l) was similar to that of ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.12-2 mg/l) but greater than that of norfloxacin (MICs 0.5-4 mg/l) against Staphylococcus aureus. Vancomycin (MICs 1-2 mg/l) had similar activity in vitro but whilst gentamicin was highly active against some isolates, others were resistant. Pefloxacin (MICs mostly 4-32 mg/l) and the other 4-quinolones had lower activity against streptococci (including alpha-, beta-, and non-haemolytic strains, enterococci and pneumococci) than against staphylococci. Benzylpenicillin (or ampicillin in the case of enterococci) were usually more active than any of the 4-quinolones. Bacteroides species, both of the fragilis and melaninogenicus/oralis groups were generally moderately resistant to pefloxacin (MICs 2-32 mg/l) and norfloxacin though ciprofloxacin was more active. Whilst the activity of pefloxacin and the other 4-quinolones was generally somewhat higher against the other anaerobes, ampicillin generally had greater activity.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of SQ 82,291, a new monobactam, in comparison with aztreonam.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of a new monobactam antibiotic, SQ 82,291, was compared with that of aztreonam against 529 strains of aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria. SQ 82,291, which is absorbed orally when administered as an ester, has shown good activity against different bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae. The susceptibility of SQ 82,291 is lower than that to aztreonam in the species that were sensitive and SQ 82,291 showed no activity at all against staphylococci and strict anaerobes (like aztreonam); unlike aztreonam SQ 82,291 was not effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibility of bacterial isolates from patients with respiratory tract infections to beta-lactam antibiotics].
AB  - In vitro susceptibilities of bacterial pathogens to beta-lactam antibiotics were  determined. Bacterial pathogens examined included various isolates from the patients of respiratory tract infections at the hospitals of Kyoto-Shiga area in 1981 and 1983. Major organisms isolated from clinical specimens were Haemophilus spp., Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas spp., S. aureus and Streptococcus spp. An increase in the isolation frequency of P. aeruginosa, a decrease in the isolation frequency of H. influenzae and no change in the isolation frequency of the other organisms were observed between the years 1981 and 1983. Data from susceptibility tests of clinical isolates confirmed that cefazolin (CEZ) and cefotiam (CTM) showed good antibacterial activity against S. aureus and cefmenoxime (CMX) was highly effective on Streptococcus spp., but that the susceptibilities of both organisms to CEZ, CTM, and cefmetazole (CMZ) in 1983 were lower than in 1981. Although CMX also showed good antibacterial activity against Klebsiella spp., there were no changes in the effectiveness of CTM, CMZ, and CEZ between the years 1981 and 1983. The in vitro antibacterial activities of CMX and cefoperazone against Haemophilus spp. were superior to those of the other beta-lactams tested, but there was a decline in the efficacy for CEZ. Although cefsulodin and piperacillin were highly active against Pseudomonas spp., declines in their effectiveness was observed between the years 1981 and 1983.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of a gene encoding nonenzymatic chloramphenicol resistance from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - High-level chloramphenicol resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa may be due to enzymatic inactivation, ribosomal mutation, or a permeability barrier. We investigated the nonenzymatic resistance mechanism encoded by Tn1696, a transposon found in P. aeruginosa. A 1-megadalton DNA fragment from Tn1696 was cloned which mediated expression of chloramphenicol resistance in Escherichia coli. Comparison of the effects of chloramphenicol on in vitro translation revealed no difference between the susceptible recipient strain and the resistant transformant containing the cloned gene. The rate of chloramphenicol uptake was slower in the resistant strain, suggesting a permeability barrier to the antibiotic. In addition, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of outer membranes demonstrated the absence of a 50,000-dalton protein in the resistant strain. DNA homology was evident between Tn1696 and chloramphenicol-resistant isolates of Haemophilus influenzae possessing altered outer membrane permeability. We conclude that chloramphenicol resistance encoded by Tn1696 is due to a permeability barrier and hypothesize that the gene from P. aeruginosa may share a common ancestral origin with these genes from other gram-negative organisms.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of A-56619 (difloxacin) and A-56620: new aryl-fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial potencies of A-56619 and A-56620, two new aryl-fluoroquinolones, were compared with the potency of norfloxacin against a broad spectrum of organisms. Cefotaxime, aztreonam, piperacillin, imipenem, penicillin, and gentamicin were also tested for reference purposes. The MICs required to inhibit at least 90% of the strains tested ranged from 0.25 to 4 micrograms/ml for A-56619 and from 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml for A-56620 for members of the Enterobacteriaceae. A-56619 was generally twofold less potent and A-56620 was twofold more potent than norfloxacin against most aerobic gram-negative bacilli, including members of the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against indole-positive Proteus, Morganella, Providencia rettgeri, and Serratia strains, A-56619 was at least 8- to 16-fold less potent than norfloxacin. A-56619 and A-56620 were four- to eightfold more potent than norfloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and equally potent to fourfold more potent against Streptococcus species, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The MICs of A-56619 and A-56620 were only slightly affected by increased inoculum size or by the addition of various cations at physiologic concentrations. A-56619 was three- to fivefold less active at pH 8.0 than at pH 6.5 or 7.2. A-56620 was twofold less active at pH 6.5 than at pH 8.0 or 7.2 against members of the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; similar pH variations did not affect A-56620 activity against gram-positive cocci. The potencies of A-56619, A-56620, and norfloxacin were less in urine than in Mueller-Hinton broth; however, this effect was more pronounced with norfloxacin. Human serum at a concentration of 50% caused a 4- to 64- fold decrease in the potency of A-56619 and an average 4-fold decrease in the potency of A-56620, compared with no effect on the potency of norfloxacin. A-56619, A-56620, and norfloxacin were bactericidal and, at four times the MIC, reduced the viable cell counts of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by approximately 99.9% within 2 h. A-56619, A-56620, and norfloxacin showed no significant synergistic activity and no antagonism when they were aminoglycoside or beta-lactam antimicrobial agents.
TI  - [Treatment of respiratory tract infections with imipenem/cilastatin in critical patients with respiratory insufficiency].
AB  - In an open prospective study the efficacy and tolerance of imipenem/cilastatin was investigated in 24 critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation with nosocomial respiratory tract infection. Nine patients had previously received antibiotic therapy, eight of them with various other beta-lactam antibiotics which had failed. Imipenem was given in a dose of 1-3 g/24 h over 5-37 (mean 11) days. Seven patients were additionally treated with aminoglycosides, one patient with erythromycin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 14), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 4), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 4) and Escherichia coli (n = 3) were the potential pathogens most frequently isolated from tracheo-bronchial secretions. All of the isolates were susceptible to imipenem. 91% of the infections without and 77% with involvement of P. aeruginosa were successfully treated. Two patients who had not responded to previous treatment succumbed to the consequences of progressive respiratory distress syndrome. All of the gram-positive and 85% of the gram-negative pathogens (Pseudomonas not included) were eliminated in the course of therapy. By contrast, 64% of the isolates of P. aeruginosa persisted; half of these became imipenem-resistant. Nine patients showed adverse reactions including one case of pseudomembranous colitis or laboratory abnormalities which were all reversible. Imipenem/cilastatin proved highly effective and was relatively well tolerated; it is suitable as a single agent for the initial treatment of nosocomial respiratory tract infections in ventilated patients, although only with limitations in cases of infection due to P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Infections of the central nervous system in malignant hemopathies].
AB  - Central nervous system (CNS) infections in immunocompromised hosts are often accompanied by subtle disorders because immunosuppression usually decreases the inflammatory response. CNS infections in immunocompromised patients are usually caused by organisms different from those found in the general population. The organism causing CNS infection in an immunocompromised host can often be predicted if the type of immune abnormality of the patient is known. The common causes of CNS infection in immunocompromised hosts are reviewed here. Meningitis in patients with neutropenia is usually due to enteric Gram negative bacilli that live in the patient's own digestive tract. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is most common and is followed by E. Coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter and Proteus. A major risk in patients with abnormal immunoglobulins or splenectomy is infection with encapsulated bacteria, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis. Meningitis caused by any of the encapsulated bacteria can be fulminant. Listeria monocytogenes is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in patients with impaired cellular immunity. Nocardia asteroides is a leading cause of brain abscess in patients with hematologic malignancy. Most patients have evidence of concomitant pulmonary lesions. Fungi are among the most common organisms involving the CNS in immunocompromised hosts. Susceptible patients include those with lymphoma or leukemia and those who receive therapies aimed at suppressing delayed hypersensitivity. Cryptococcus neoformans is a common fungal cause of CNS infection in immunocompromised hosts. The primary site of infection is the lung. Spread to the CNS is via the blood stream. The clinical course is highly variable: meningitis, meningoencephalitis and focal mass lesions. Candida causes meningitis or meningoencephalitis characterized by multiple small abscesses in neutropenic hosts. Organisms reach the CNS via the blood stream usually from the digestive tract or infected intravenous catheters. Aspergillus causes brain abscess, cerebral infarction and focal meningitis in patients with neutropenia. The primary infection is in the lung. The parasites that infest the CNS of immunocompromised patients are usually those that exploit a T-lymphocyte, mononuclear phagocyte host defect. The most common are Toxoplasma gondii and Strongyloides stercoralis. There have been a few cases of amebiasis with dissemination to the brain in patients with hematologic malignancies. Toxoplasma gondii causes major CNS disease in immunocompromised hosts: meningoencephalitis or mass lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Ceftriaxone therapy in otolaryngological and pulmonary infections.
AB  - The efficacy of ceftriaxone, 1 g given intramuscularly once daily, was evaluated  in 38 patients with pneumonia (n = 11), pulmonary empyema (n = 2), bronchitis (n = 4), tonsillitis (n = 9), sinusitis (n = 7), and otitis (n = 5). Causative organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 11), viridans type streptococcus (n = 1), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 6), group A streptococcus (n = 10), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1), Escherichia coli (n = 2), Proteus mirabilis (n = 1), and Proteus vulgaris (n = 1). Sterilization of infected foci was obtained in 89.4% of those treated, with clinical recovery in 86.8%. The ceftriaxone regimen was well tolerated.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetics of cefoperazone concentration in human lung tissue].
AB  - In 11 patients, the concentration of cefoperazone (CPZ) in the lung tissue were studied after a 2 g intravenous bolus injection. Samples of lung tissue and blood were taken during surgery at 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, and 300 minutes after administration of CPZ. All samples were assayed by the paper disc method using Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 as the indicator strain. All assay results of lung tissue were corrected for the amount of blood contained in the tissue samples by the hemoglobin content in the homogenate of lung tissue. The CPZ levels in the lung tissue were 116.2 micrograms/g at 15 min., 94.1 micrograms/g at 30 min., 74.6 micrograms/g at 60 min., 67.9 micrograms/g at 120 min., 54.6 micrograms/g at 180 min., 29.2 micrograms/g at 240 min. and 22.7 micrograms/g at 300 min. after administration, respectively. These values were higher than MIC90 values of CPZ for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Enterobacteriaceae. The level of CPZ in the lung tissue was higher than 50% of the level in the serum until 180 minutes after administration of CPZ.
TI  - Comparative activity of ofloxacin with reference to bacterial strains isolated in in-patients and out-patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new quinolone derivative, was compared to that of other agents commonly in use against pathogens isolated in the community and in the hospital. None of the community or hospital strains isolated from urinary tract infection showed resistance to ofloxacin, while variable resistance was demonstrable with all other oral agents. Similar results were obtained with pathogens isolated from infected wounds originating in the community and in the hospital. Among pathogens isolated from the respiratory tract, ofloxacin was most active against Haemophilus influenzae, but less active than the penicillin-cephalosporin group against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ofloxacin was active against all but one (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) blood culture isolates. Of 112 strains isolated from community-acquired infections, only one strain was ofloxacin-resistant while resistance to sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim, ampicillin and doxycycline was 34%, 42% and 30%, respectively. Among 219 pathogens originating from nosocomial infections, 3.2% were resistant to ofloxacin compared to 56% for cefazolin, to 7.2% for cefotaxime, 15.8% for piperacillin and 22.3% for gentamicin. These results suggest that ofloxacin has great therapeutic potential for the therapy of bacterial infections originating both in the community and in the hospital.
TI  - Clinical and bacteriological evaluation of Branhamella catarrhalis in respiratory infections.
AB  - The clinical significance of Branhamella catarrhalis in respiratory infections is evaluated. 175 strains were isolated, mainly from the sputum, in 71 patients with respiratory infections. B. catarrhalis was most frequently isolated in mixed infections with Haemophilus influenzae (38.3%), H. influenzae plus Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.3%) or S. pneumoniae (9.7%). The rate of isolation of B. catarrhalis alone was as low as 5.1% and from mixed infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter and/or Klebsiella species it was 36.6%. More than 10(7) cfu/ml of B. catarrhalis were isolated from 71.4% of cases. In 29 cases the organism was determined to be causative according to our criteria, most often in secondary infections in patients with complicated pneumoconiosis, chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis. 29 of 47 strains (61.7%) produced beta-lactamase of the penicillinase type. Against these strains, penicillin antibiotics and first and second generation cephalosporin antibiotics (except cefroxadine) showed weak activity compared with their activity against non-beta-lactamase-producing strains. The third generation cephalosporins showed a uniform spectrum of activity against both groups of organisms.
TI  - Ofloxacin in oral chemotherapy of acute and chronic otitis media.
AB  - After ascertaining the bacterial spectrum in 210 patients with Otitis media acuta, Otitis media chronica mesotympanalis and Otitis media chronica epitympanalis, the clinical efficacy of oral therapy with ofloxacin in 40 patients from each of these groups was assessed. The clinical results are comparable with those following conventional local, oral and intravenous antibiotic therapy. The microbiological analysis of the ear secretions revealed Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae to be the main infectious agents of acute otitis media, whereas in chronic otitis media Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus sp. could be detected in most of the cases. Ofloxacin levels of ear secretions, mucosa specimens of the middle ear and serum were measured in some patients by means of HPLC. In most cases, drug levels exceeded the MICs for the bacteria mentioned above. The correlation with the clinical results is discussed. On the basis of these preliminary results, ofloxacin can be considered as a highly efficient oral substance which is effective against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, two important pathogens of middle ear infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against some selected gram-positive and gram-negative isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were tested against five selected groups of clinical bacterial isolates. Both were active against: Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, irrespective of their resistance to methicillin or gentamicin; Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, irrespective of their beta-lactamase production; members of the Enterobacteriaceae family which were resistant to most oral beta-lactams, and most intestinal bacterial pathogens including Campylobacter, Vibrio, Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia. Ciprofloxacin was found more active than ofloxacin against Pseudomonas with most isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas fluorescens susceptible, while those of Pseudomonas cepacia were resistant.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and its mode of action.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae was comparable to norfloxacin and enoxacin, and far exceeded the activity of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. The activity of ofloxacin was two to eight times less than that of ciprofloxacin. Ofloxacin was more active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp., Legionella spp., and Bacteroides fragilis, than norfloxacin, enoxacin, pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid, and the activity of ofloxacin was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. Ofloxacin was two to seven times more effective than norfloxacin in systemic infections in mice with S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa. Ofloxacin strongly inhibited DNA supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase purified from E. coli KL-16. There is a parallel relationship between antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and its inhibitory action against DNA gyrases from ofloxacin-susceptible and ofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates of E. coli. These results indicate that the high bactericidal action of ofloxacin and the related new quinolone agents can be explained by their potent inhibitory activities against DNA gyrase in bacterial cells.
TI  - Susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria to the synergistic bactericidal action of serum and polymyxin B nonapeptide.
AB  - Polymyxin B nonapeptide was able to sensitize Escherichia coli strains and strains of Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae to the bactericidal action of fresh normal human serum. The degree of sensitization varied significantly within the strains. Strains of Proteus mirabilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and N. meningitidis remained resistant.
TI  - [New oral quinolone compounds in chronic bronchitis].
AB  - Clinical, microbiological and pharmacokinetic results are presented from studies  in 186 patients treated with the new quinolone antimicrobial agents enoxacin, pefloxacin, ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin. Almost all had been admitted to hospital for acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, associated mainly with Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis strains were generally very sensitive to the quinolones and sputum concentrations of 1.3 to 4.5 mg/l exceeded the MICs (geometric mean values 0.07 to 0.44 mg/l) by a factor of more than 10. In contrast, P. aeruginosa was slightly less sensitive (geometric mean MICs 0.4 to 4.4 mg/l) and S. pneumoniae much less so (with geometric mean MICs between 0.84 and 6.7 mg/l) and a number of treatment failures were noted with these organisms. Various unwanted drug effects (mostly upper gastro-intestinal) were seen, particularly with enoxacin. The best clinical results were observed with ofloxacin, even with once daily dosage, but the results with the other quinolones could only be described as moderate.
TI  - Enhancement of growth of aerobic and facultative bacteria in mixed infections with Bacteroides species.
AB  - The potential for mutual enhancement of growth of the Bacteroides fragilis and B. melaninogenicus groups and the aerobic and facultative organisms commonly isolated with them in mixed infections was evaluated. Enhancement was studied by measuring the relative increase in CFU of the two bacterial components inducing subcutaneous abscesses in mice. Of the 42 combinations between three isolates each of the B. fragilis and B. melaninogenicus groups and seven aerobic or facultative organisms, Bacteroides spp. were enhanced in only 8 and inhibited in 4. The aerobic and facultative bacteria were enhanced in 31 of the 42 combinations and depressed in 2. The organisms uniformly enhanced by all of the Bacteroides spp. were group A streptococci and Escherichia coli (all six instances), followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae (five of six instances), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (four instances), group D streptococci (in three instances only by the B. fragilis group), and Haemophilus influenzae (one instance). It is apparent that the growth rate of facultative and aerobic bacteria is enhanced much more in mixed infections with Bacteroides spp. than that of their anaerobic counterparts.
TI  - In vitro activity of CI-934, a quinolone carboxylic acid active against gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
AB  - CI-934 is a totally synthetic difluorinated quinolinecarboxylic acid with an ethyl-amino-methyl pyrrolidine side chain, which has broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, including particular potency directed against streptococci and staphylococci. The CI-934 MIC (micrograms per milliliter) for 90% of the strains tested was 0.4 (range, 0.2 to 0.8) for a group of streptococci (pneumococci, viridans streptococci, Streptococcus faecalis, and Lancefield groups A, B, and C), 0.2 (0.05 to 0.2) for staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), 0.025 (less than or equal to 0.003 to 0.025) for Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 1.6 (0.1 to 25) for Enterobacteriaceae, 25 (3.1 to 25) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 1.6 (0.05 to 3.1) for non-Bacteroides anaerobe species. CI-934 was equally active in vitro against multi-drug-resistant and -sensitive isolates, and cross-resistance was not apparent. Potency increased with alkalinity and was somewhat lower in urine. CI-934 was bactericidal. Inhibitory activity was generally unaffected by anaerobiosis, light, changes in inoculum size or cation concentration, or addition of human serum or sodium cholate.
TI  - Safety and effectiveness of ticarcillin plus clavulanate potassium in treatment of lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The safety and effectiveness of ticarcillin plus clavulanate potassium was evaluated in an open study of 43 patients with community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections. The mean age of the 28 patients in whom bacteriologic evaluations were possible was 55 years; at least two thirds of the patients had a history of alcoholism or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A pathogen was isolated from sputum samples in 23 patients; five of these 23 also had documented bacteremia. There were five additional cases of bacteremia associated with clinical signs and symptoms of pneumonia but with no organisms isolated from sputum cultures. Thirty-five pathogens were isolated from the 33 evaluable infection sites, primarily Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae. S. pneumoniae was the causative organism in all 10 cases of bacteremia. Ticarcillin plus clavulanate potassium (3 g of ticarcillin and 100 mg of clavulanic acid) was administered intravenously for a mean of six days. All 35 organisms isolated before treatment were eradicated. In one patient a superinfection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa developed after treatment with ticarcillin plus clavulanate potassium. A clinical evaluation was possible for 32 of the 33 infection sites; clinical cure was achieved at 31 sites and improvement was seen at the other site. All 43 patients were monitored for adverse reactions by both clinical observation and laboratory tests. In one patient, reversible thrombocytopenia developed that required discontinuation of ticarcillin plus clavulanate potassium. In another patient, there was a slight decrease in the potassium level during therapy. No systemic adverse reactions occurred, nor was there any instance of local effects associated with the intravenous infusion of the drug.
TI  - Lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  - The most important lower respiratory infection is pneumonia, the fourth leading cause of death. Most cases of bronchitis are of viral etiology and are not major problems. Empyema can present an important problem in management. Although the diagnosis of pneumonia is usually relatively straightforward, the specific etiologic diagnosis remains a major problem. Availability of empyema fluid or a positive blood culture result can be helpful in making the etiologic diagnosis, but these are unavailable in most patients. Screening of sputum Gram stains under 100 X magnification is very important; there should be fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells, more than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or both per field of this size. The major causes of pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, anaerobic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, various gram-negative aerobic or facultative bacilli and Legionella. However, many other organisms are capable of causing pneumonia, even in the immunocompetent host. Further adding to the problem is the fact that a number of different organisms are manifesting increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. Our study with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid included seven patients with pneumonia, one with empyema, and one with purulent tracheobronchitis. Organisms recovered from pleural fluid, transtracheal aspiration and sputum or tracheostomy aspirate included multiple anaerobes, pneumococci, S. aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. ozaenae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Neisseria meningitidis and Branhamella catarrhalis. Several of the organisms were ticarcillin resistant. Eight of the patients had cures and the other patient showed improvement. Only minor side-effects were encountered--Coombs' positivity (without hemolysis), eosinophilia, drug fever and one case of questionable neutropenia.
TI  - Contribution of beta-lactamases to bacterial resistance and mechanisms to inhibit beta-lactamases.
AB  - Resistance of bacteria to beta-lactam antibiotics has become a serious problem in the past several decades. Virtually all Staphylococcus aureus, and many Hemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Bacteroides species possess beta-lactamases that hydrolyze penicillins and cephalosporins. The most common plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase is the TEM enzyme (Richmond-Sykes type IIIa), which is present in Hemophilus, Neisseria, and Enterobacteriaceae. One technique to overcome bacterial resistance has been the development of beta-lactamase inhibitors. Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactamase inhibitor that inhibits the beta-lactamases of S. aureus, Hemophilus, Neisseria, Branhamella, Eschericia coli, Klebsiella, and Bacteroides. Clavulanate acts as a "suicide" inhibitor, forming a stable enzyme complex that binds to serine at the active site of the enzyme. Clavulanate readily crosses the outer cell wall of most Enterobacteriaceae to interact with beta-lactamases in the periplasmic space. Clavulanate does not inhibit beta-lactamases such as the Richmond-Sykes type I enzymes found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter species, which are inducible enzymes that function primarily as cephalosporinases.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1983)].
AB  - Bacterial isolates from the patients with pulmonary infections have been collected over these 3 years, in collaboration with investigators at 13 hospitals in various parts of Japan for the study on frequency of isolation of pathogens among the patients and their drug susceptibilities. Possible causative pathogens mainly isolated from sputum in patients with lower respiratory tract infections during period from September 1983 to March 1984, were collected. The frequency of bacterial isolates from the sputum and their drug susceptibility on H. influenzae among the various pathogens are discussed. The kinds of bacterial species isolated from the patients with respiratory tract infections associated with chronic bronchitis, chronic capillary bronchitis or bronchiectasis and their relative frequency of isolation were as follows; Total numbers of bacterial isolates collected from various hospitals were 220 strains in 1981, 168 strains 1982 and 258 strains in 1983. H. influenzae was always isolated with highest frequency of 50.5% in 1981, 45.8% in 1982 and 40.7% in 1983, and followed by P. aeruginosa (24.1%), S. aureus (8.2%), S. pneumoniae (7.3%) and K. pneumoniae (5.9%) and E. coli (4.1%) in 1981; P. aeruginosa (30.4%), S. pneumoniae (11.9%), S. aureus (4.8%), K. pneumoniae (3.0%) and E. coli (1.8%) in 1982; P. aeruginosa (26.7%), S. pneumoniae (10.1%), S. aureus (7.8%), K. pneumoniae (3.5%) and E. coli (3.5%) in 1983. The drug susceptibility test of H. influenzae to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), mezlocillin (MZPC), sulbenicillin (SBPC), gentamicin (GM), amikacin (AMK), cefotiam (CTM), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefoperazone (CPZ), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftizoxime (CZX), cefmenoxime (CMX) and latamoxef (LMOX) was done by using agar micro-broth dilution methods. H. influenzae was most markedly susceptible to cephems of the third generation, especially to CMX, CZX and CTX by which about 95% of H. influenzae tested were inhibited the growth under the concentration with less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml of the drugs. Furthermore, annual changes in susceptibility of H. influenzae to various antibiotics was analyzed over the period from 1981 to 1983. The frequency of S. pneumoniae isolated from patients with chronic bronchitis or bronchiectasis was about 10% in this survey. However, in the case of respiratory infections associated with bacterial pneumonia, the frequencies were as follows; 24.8% (77 cases/311 cases) in 1981, 17.7% (44 cases/248 cases) in 1982, and 11.0% (39 cases/355 cases) in 1983. The frequency of isolation of S. pneumoniae decreased every year.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Comparison of aztreonam and tobramycin in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections caused by gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - A comparison of aztreonam and tobramycin was carried out in 49 hospitalized patients with lower respiratory tract infections caused by gram-negative bacilli. Patients were randomly assigned to the treatment drug. Clindamycin was given concomitantly until the pathogen was identified and the presence of a gram-positive microorganism was ruled out. Samples of sputum were obtained for culture from the lung parenchyma by deep expectoration or transtracheal aspiration. A pathogen was defined as an organism that showed heavy growth and predominated in the culture. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated pathogen, followed by Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis. A variety of less common pathogens were represented. Thirty-five patients were treated with intravenous aztreonam (1-2 g every 8 hr) and 14 with intravenous tobramycin (3-5 mg/kg per day) until they were afebrile and sputum cultures had been free of the pathogen for 48 hr. The minimum duration of treatment was five days. In the aztreonam group, only two (5%) of the 37 gram-negative pathogens--one P. aeruginosa and one Escherichia coli--persisted. In the tobramycin group, seven (50%) of the 14 pathogens persisted. Clinical response paralleled microbiologic response. Adverse effects in both treatment groups were minor and transient. In this trial aztreonam was effective and safe for treatment of lower respiratory tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa and a variety of other gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Aztreonam: antibacterial activity, beta-lactamase stability, and interpretive standards and quality control guidelines for disk-diffusion susceptibility tests.
AB  - In vitro activity of aztreonam was compared with that of ceftazidime, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, piperacillin, and ticarcillin against 656 representative bacterial pathogens. Aztreonam was not active against gram-positive cocci but was as active as the third-generation cephalosporins against the Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Additional data for 5,262 gram-negative bacilli isolated in four separate medical centers documented the low incidence of resistance to aztreonam; 97.2% of 4,312 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and 79% of 854 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms of aztreonam/ml. Additional studies confirmed the stability of aztreonam in the presence of seven different beta-lactamases. For disk-diffusion susceptibility tests, 30-micrograms disks are recommended, with interpretive breakpoints of less than or equal to 15 mm for resistance (MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml), 16-21 mm for intermediate susceptibility (MIC, 16 micrograms/ml), and greater than or equal to 22 mm for susceptibility (MIC less than 8.0 micrograms/ml). For quality control of tests with 30-micrograms disks, zone-size limits for Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) should be 28-36 mm and those for P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) should be 23-29 mm.
TI  - Imipenem/cilastatin for the treatment of infections in hospitalized children.
AB  - Imipenem is the first of a new class of beta-lactam antimicrobial agents with potent in vitro activity against most bacterial pathogens that cause infections in children. We studied, prospectively, the clinical efficacy and toxicity of imipenem/cilastatin in 40 children with proved or suspected bacterial infection. A dose of 100 mg/kg/day of imipenem was given to children younger than 3 years of age, while children older than 3 years of age received 60 mg/kg/day. Twenty-nine organisms were isolated from 26 patients. Infections treated included cellulitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, lymphadenitis, renal infections, wound infections, and pneumonia. Bacteria isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All patients responded favorably to treatment, with defervescence and improvement of symptoms. All of the infecting bacteria were susceptible to imipenem. Imipenem/cilastatin was well tolerated, with no serious side effects, and appeared to be an effective and safe antimicrobial agent in the treatment of the population studied.
TI  - Low frequency of bacterial resistance to enoxacin in vitro and in experimental pneumonia.
AB  - The tendency for bacteria to develop resistance to enoxacin (Cl-919, AT-2266), a  new oxyquinolone derivative, was investigated in vitro and in vivo. The mutation frequencies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., and Haemophilus influenzae to enoxacin, norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, tobramycin, cephalexin, cefotaxime, ampicillin, azlocillin, oxacillin, and ticarcillin were determined by plating large numbers of organisms onto antibiotic-containing agar. Enoxacin resistance developed infrequently. For example, the mutation frequency of Ps. aeruginosa in the presence of enoxacin was 1 in 2.8 X 10(9) cells as compared to 1 in 1.1 X 10(6) for nalidixic acid. The increase in MIC after serial transfer through increasing concentrations of enoxacin ranged from 8-fold for Ps. aeruginosa and Staph. aureus to 256-fold for H. influenzae. Rats with chronic Ps. aeruginosa pneumonia were given subtherapeutic doses of enoxacin daily for ten weeks. Two rats were sacrificed weekly and the homogenized lungs were cultured on agar containing 5 mg/l of enoxacin and on antibiotic-free agar. No organisms resistant to 5 mg/l of enoxacin were recovered. No increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration of enoxacin for the infecting organism was seen.
TI  - In-vitro activity of Ro-15-8074, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of Ro-15-8074, a new oral cephalosporin, was tested against common clinical isolates, and compared with the in-vitro activity of cefaclor, cefadroxil, ampicillin and co-trimoxazole. Its activity against Enterobacteriaceae was better than those of the other antibiotics tested. It was also highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase producing strains. Its activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., was poor. Ro-15-8074 was less active against staphylococci and group D streptococci than were cefaclor, cefadroxil and ampicillin. It was equally or less active than cefaclor, cefadroxil, ampicillin and co-trimoxazole against other streptococci.
TI  - Pefloxacin in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - Forty-three patients admitted to hospital with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis were treated with 400 mg pefloxacin twice daily for ten days. The first 20 patients were given the first dose of the drug as a 60 min intravenous infusion. Serum and sputum concentrations of pefloxacin were measured microbiologically at intervals on the first treatment day and the sputum was cultured before, during, and after the course of pefloxacin. Two patients died from unrelated causes during the follow-up and one refused to continue treatment. All strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis were eradicated at end-of-treatment but eight strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and three of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were cultured and the sputum remained purulent despite the pefloxacin. Peak serum concentrations averaged approximately 4.5 mg/l after the infusion and 5 mg/l on oral administration, the corresponding sputum concentrations being 3.8 and 4.6 mg/l, respectively. MICs for H. influenzae were 0.06 mg/l, or less. Mode MICs for the pre- and post-treatment strains of Str. pneumoniae were 4 and 16 mg/l, and the corresponding values for Ps. aeruginosa were 2 and 16 mg/l. The poor results in pseudomonas and pneumococcal infections could largely be explained by the degree of resistance among these organisms.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of a novel penem FCE 22101 compared to other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - FCE 22101 is a penem antibiotic which inhibits the majority of Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations of 0.5-4 mg/l. It inhibits staphylococci, haemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas species are resistant. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium species are inhibited by less than or equal to 1 mg/l. FCE 22101 is not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chrosmosomal beta-lactamases. It shows minimal discrepancy between MIC and MBC values and there is minimal effect of inoculum size. Although FCE 22101 is generally less active against Enterobacteriaceae than are cefotaxime and ceftazidime, it does inhibit some Enterobacter spp. resistant to these agents. FCE 22101 and imipenem are similar in activity against Gram-positive and anaerobic species.
TI  - Role of cephalosporins in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in adults. Overview with special emphasis on ceftazidime.
AB  - Experience with the use of first-generation cephalosporins in bacterial meningitis has been disappointing; low concentrations were obtained in the cerebrospinal fluid, and therapeutic failures were encountered. Of the second-generation cephalosporins cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin, only cefuroxime has proved efficacy in meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or Hemophilus influenzae. The third-generation cephalosporins offer new advantages in the treatment of meningitis because they are active at the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtainable. Cefotaxime has produced high cure rates in patients with meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or H. influenzae. Several controlled comparative studies indicate that ceftriaxone is as effective as conventional treatment in therapy for neonatal or childhood meningitis caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, or H. influenzae. Moxalactam has been found in uncontrolled studies to be effective when the cause was enteric gram-negative bacilli. Ceftazidime is a new cephalosporin with a high degree of beta-lactamase stability and a broad antibacterial spectrum, which includes Pseudomonas aeruginosa that enters the cerebrospinal fluid. Data from 29 patients who received ceftazidime as monotherapy for bacterial meningitis showed an overall cure or improvement rate of 75.9 percent. Therapy failed in three patients with meningitis caused by gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. agalactiae), and in three with gram-negative organisms. Of 14 patients with Pseudomonas meningitis, 11 showed a cure, as did six of six patients with meningitis caused by Enterobacter, Serratia, or Acinetobacter. More, preferably controlled, studies of the efficacy of ceftazidime in the treatment of meningitis should be undertaken.
TI  - The activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefotetan compared to other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefotetan was assessed against beta-lactamase producing  clinical isolates. The majority of Enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml with 50% of isolates inhibited by less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. Cefotetan inhibited organisms resistant to cefazolin, cefonicid and cefoperazone, but not isolates of Enterobacter, Citrobacter or Serratia resistant to ceftizoxime. Cefotetan inhibited beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, but it did not inhibit Acinetobacter or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefotetan was as active as cefoxitin against anaerobic species such as Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium. Cefotetan was not hydrolyzed by Richmond-Sykes plasmid beta-lactamases of type III such as TEM and SHV, nor by the OXA or PSE beta-lactamases. It also was not hydrolyzed by cephalosporinases of Richmond-Sykes type Ia or Id. Cefotetan inhibited beta-lactamases of the type Ia and Id, but it also induced these beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae and C. freundii.
TI  - Evaluation of aztreonam in the treatment of severe bacterial infections.
AB  - We investigated the clinical efficacy and safety of aztreonam in the treatment of 50 episodes of infection in 46 adult patients. The clinical condition of patients at the beginning of treatment was critical or poor in 28 of the episodes of infection. Episodes treated were 39 urinary tract infections (12 of them with concomitant bacteremia), 2 soft tissue infections, 8 patients with osteomyelitis (1 with concomitant bacteremia), and one episode of pneumonia. Significant isolated microorganisms were aerobic or facultative gram-negative rods and were responsible for the following episodes of infection (number of episodes): members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (49), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), and Haemophilus influenzae (1). The overall rate of clinical response to aztreonam was 94% of the treated episodes. Colonization or superinfection or both occurred in 29 episodes, but only 8 episodes required antimicrobial therapy. Aztreonam seems to be an effective single agent therapy for many bacterial infections. Colonization and superinfection by Candida sp., Streptococcus faecalis or Staphylococcus aureus must be monitored.
TI  - Therapy for lower respiratory tract infections with imipenem/cilastatin: a review of worldwide experience.
AB  - The worldwide experience with imipenem/cilastatin as of November 7, 1983, in the  intravenous therapy for severe and moderately severe infections of the lower respiratory tract is reviewed. Of 204 assessable patients treated in 77 studies conducted by 70 investigative groups (43 in the United States, 27 in other countries), 173 (85%) were cured of their infections or showed improvement. Imipenem was tested against 289 of 303 bacterial pathogens isolated before therapy, and 284 (98%) were found to be susceptible. Principal pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. A total of 76% of infecting pathogens were eradicated during therapy. Of 54 imipenem-susceptible infecting strains of P. aeruginosa, however, 57% were eradicated, 19% acquired resistance to imipenem, and 17% were replaced by new resistant strains of P. aeruginosa. Higher doses of imipenem/cilastatin and/or combined therapy with an aminoglycoside may improve these results. Imipenem/cilastatin compares well with the most active agents available for therapy for lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Assessment of biological activity of immunoglobulin preparations by using opsonized micro-organisms to stimulate neutrophil chemiluminescence.
AB  - We have used the ability of opsonised bacteria to stimulate luminol enhanced chemiluminescence of human neutrophils to examine the opsonic capabilities of normal and hypogammaglobulinaemic sera for four common bacterial pathogens. Preparations of human immunoglobulin modified for i.v. use have then been compared with unmodified Cohn Fraction II for their effectiveness in improving opsonization when added to antibody deficient sera in vitro. Hypogammaglobulinaemic sera exhibited impaired opsonisation of Haemophilus influenzae, and severely antibody deficient sera also opsonized Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa poorly. The opsonization of these organisms was improved by Cohn Fraction II, and by pH 4 and beta-propionolactone treated immunoglobulins, in descending order of effectiveness. Pepsin digested immunoglobulin was inactive, and in some cases impaired opsonic capacity. The opsonisation of Staphylococcus aureus by hypogammaglobulinaemic sera was near normal, and was not improved by any immunoglobulin. This technique, which assesses biological activity of immunoglobulin, is useful in comparing preparations, and may help to establish appropriate dosage and frequency for intravenous immunoglobulin replacement therapy.
TI  - In vitro activity of BMY-28142 against pediatric pathogens, including isolates from cystic fibrosis sputum.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of BMY-28142, a new aminothiazole cephalosporin, was measured by standardized broth microdilution and agar dilution methods against 450 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from pediatric infections, including acute pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis. BMY-28142 activity was compared with that of aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin, and clindamycin. The activity of BMY-28142 in combination with other antimicrobial agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was also determined. Furthermore, the effects of inoculum and pH on BMY-28142 activity were evaluated. BMY-21842 was active against most of the gram-positive and gram-negative isolates, with the exception of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. The combination of BMY-28142 with tobramycin was often synergistic, and combinations of BMY-28142 with either polymyxin B or imipenem were usually antagonistic. BMY-28142 antibacterial activity could be adversely affected at extremes of medium pH and by high inoculum densities.
TI  - Pneumonia treated with imipenem/cilastatin.
AB  - In an open, prospective, multicenter trial the efficacy and tolerance of imipenem/cilastatin for the treatment of bacterial pneumonia was investigated. Forty-three adults were studied: 29 with nosocomial and 14 with community-acquired infections. Significant underlying disease was present in 91 percent of patients. Nosocomial infection was frequently associated with endotracheal intubation (48 percent), prior antibiotic therapy (48 percent), and recent surgery (31 percent). Most frequent sputum isolates included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10, all nosocomial), Hemophilus influenzae (10), Escherichia coli (eight), Staphylococcus aureus (seven), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (six). Treatment with imipenem/cilastatin was associated with clinical cure in 93 percent of patients. Two of three failures and one superinfection occurred in association with isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to imipenem. Overall, six of 10 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated prior to therapy developed resistance to imipenem after an average of 10 days of therapy. Adverse effects occurred in nine patients (21 percent) and included one case of pseudomembranous colitis. Monotherapy with imipenem/cilastatin of serious lower respiratory tract infections was relatively safe and highly effective with the exception of disease associated with P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of Sch 34343, imipenem, cefpirome and cefotaxime.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of Sch 34343 was compared with that of imipenem, cefpirome  and cefotaxime against clinical isolates of important bacterial pathogens. Sch 34343 was very stable to changes in media, human serum concentration, pH and inoculum size. Enterobacteriaceae, including strains resistant to aminopenicillins and established cephalosporins, were susceptible to Sch 34343. In the case of Acinetobacter spp., imipenem was the only highly active antibiotic. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (and most other Pseudomonas spp.) were insensitive to Sch 34343. Activity against Haemophilus influenzae was greater than that of imipenem but less than that of cefotaxime and cefpirome. Sch 34343 activity against Gram-negative anaerobic rods was greater than that of cefoxitin and comparable to imipenem. All methicillin-sensitive staphylococci were inhibited by 1 mg/l of Sch 34343, 0.5 mg/l of imipenem, 2 mg/l of cefpirome and 8 mg/l of cefotaxime. Activity of all four against methicillin-resistant staphylococci was low. Streptococcus faecalis was inhibited by 16 mg/l of Sch 34343 and 2 mg/l of imipenem. The activity of Sch 34343 was not affected by a beta-lactamase inactivating third generation cephalosporins.
TI  - Sch 34343: in-vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility to beta-lactamases.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of the penem Sch 34343 was assessed in comparison with third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam and imipenem. Sch 34343 was active, with MICs generally 2 mg/1 or less, against a broad spectrum of organisms amongst which were staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), streptococci (though enterococci were less susceptible with Sch 34343 MICs mostly 4-8 mg/1), anaerobes (including the Bacteroides fragilis group), Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It was also active against the Enterobacteriaceae though Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia spp. were somewhat less susceptible than other members of this group. Sch 34343 lacked useful activity against most species of Pseudomonas (including Ps. aeruginosa) but was active against Ps. acidovorans and some isolates of Ps. cepacia. Sch 34343 showed a high degree of resistance to plasmid-determined and most chromosomally-determined beta-lactamases; however, it was hydrolysed rapidly by enzymes from some isolates of Aeromonas hydrophila and more slowly by enzymes from Ps. maltophilia and Bact. melaninogenicus subspecies intermedius. We did not observe any reduction in sensitivity to Sch 34343 for most beta-lactamase-producing organisms, including strains of Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii that were resistant to most other beta-lactams.
TI  - In-vitro evaluation of Sch 34343: antimicrobial activity, beta-lactamase stability and inhibition.
AB  - Sch 34343 was compared with representative parenteral beta-lactams including monobactams (aztreonam), 1-oxa-beta-lactams (latamoxef), carbapenems (imipenem) and cephalosporins (cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefsulodin and ceftazidime). Sch 34343 was active against the Enterobacteriaceae (MIC50 range, 0.12-4.0 mg/l) and the facultative Gram-positive cocci (MIC50 range, 0.03-4.0 mg/l), and was comparable to the third-generation cephalosporins and imipenem. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas spp. were not susceptible to Sch 34343. Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria spp. were all susceptible to less than or equal to 2.0 mg/l of Sch 34343. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MIC90, 32 mg/l) appear to be insusceptible to Sch 34343. Sch 34343 inhibited the majority of cefotaxime- and gentamicin-resistant bacteria (MICs less than or equal to 8.0 mg/l). The new penem was stable to hydrolysis by 11 beta-lactamase preparations (both plasmid- and chromosomally-mediated types). Sch 34343 inhibited beta-lactamases as did other newer cephalosporins.
TI  - Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections caused by beta-lactamase-positive Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis.
AB  - Twenty-one adult patients hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections due to Branhamella catarrhalis or Haemophilus influenzae or both were treated with the combination of oral amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate (Augmentin) in an open, noncomparative clinical trial. Diseases included pneumonia, empyema, and exacerbations of bronchiectasis and chronic lung disease. Thirteen of 16 B. catarrhalis and six of nine H. influenzae isolates were beta-lactamase positive. The patients with B. catarrhalis were treated for a mean of 5.3 days, and those with H. influenzae were treated for a mean of 7.0 days. The overall response to therapy was excellent, with 18 of 19 beta-lactamase-producing strains eradicated on therapy. One patient secondarily infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was a clinical failure, and two patients with H. influenzae who became culture positive again after therapy were considered microbiologic failures. Gastrointestinal side effects (especially nausea) were common, although all patients completed a course of therapy. Sputum levels of amoxicillin were surprisingly low (less than 0.05 to 0.54 micrograms/ml), a finding which may explain the high relapse rate (22%) seen with H. influenzae, as these are below the usual MICs of amoxicillin for this organism. The combination of amoxicillin plus potassium clavulanate appears to be an excellent drug for treatment of beta-lactamase-producing strains of these two species, although mild gastrointestinal side effects are common.
TI  - [Cefminox concentration in tissues and clinical efficacy of cefminox in acute peritonitis].
AB  - Cefminox sodium (CMNX, MT-141), a new semisynthetic cephamycin, having marked resistance to beta-lactamase, and a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacterial species, including Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii, CMNX has higher activity in vivo than in vitro. For therapeutic purpose, CMNX was given in a daily dose of 0.5 g (0.5 g X 1) to 2 g (1 X 2) by intravenous drip infusion for 4 to 8 days to 24 cases with acute peritonitis (17 cases with acute appendicitis, 1 with localized peritonitis after gastrectomy, 1 with diffuse peritonitis due to perforative duodenal ulcer and 5 with panperitonitis due to intestinal obstruction). The clinical response was rated excellent in 9 cases, good in 14 cases and fair in 1 case and poor in none. No adverse effect was observed. There were 29 strains isolated organisms included 12 Escherichia coli, some Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These isolated organisms were eradicated after CMNX treatment, except a strain of E. faecalis was decreased. In 19 cases of them, 16 cases with acute peritonitis due to acute appendicitis and 3 cases with acute panperitonitis due to intestinal obstruction, CMNX was administered intravenously in a dose of 1 g (1 case was 0.5 g) before or during the operation, and tissue specimens and body fluids samples were taken during the operation. CMNX concentration was determined to a bioassay with Escherichia coli NIHJ or Vibrio vercolans ATCC 8461 as the test organisms. CMNX concentrations in purulent ascites were 47.2 +/- 38.5 micrograms/ml (n = 23), those in infected appendix wall were 32.2 +/- 21.7 micrograms/g (n = 16), that in pus in appendix were 22.1 +/- 24.3 micrograms/ml (n = 8) and that in other non infected tissues were 24.3 +/- 22.0 micrograms/g (n = 8). CMNX concentrations in infected tissues were higher than the non infected tissues. In the 3 cases with empyemic appendicitis, CMNX levels in pus in appendix were more higher than that in appendix wall itself. Therefore, CMNX sodium appears to be a very useful drug when used for chemotherapy on acute peritonitis.
TI  - [Bacteriologic monitoring of bronchial secretions in surgical intensive care].
AB  - Quantitative bacteriologic monitoring of bronchial secretions obtained by protected distal catheterism was performed in 60 critically ill patients under mechanical ventilation. A number of factors which have significant bearing on bacterial growth in the respiratory tract were demonstrated. A statistical correlation was found between aspiration pneumonia and presence of Enterobacteriaceae, as well as between hospital-acquired pneumonia and recovery of opportunistic pathogens. S. aureus was especially prevalent in patients under corticosteroids. Aminoglycoside treatments increased the frequency of Acinetobacter infections, whereas prevalence of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa appeared unrelated to the use of any specific antibiotic. The value of bacteriology on protected distal catheter bronchoscopy specimens is to allow accurate diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections and provide guidelines for the choice of appropriate antibiotics.
TI  - [Sensitivity to cefotiam of 494 hospital bacterial strains. Determination of minimal inhibitory concentration and comparison with other beta-lactams].
AB  - Susceptibility to cefotiam of 494 bacterial strains was studied by MIC determination using an agar dilution assay. Activity of cefotiam was also compared with that of six other beta-lactams (ampicillin, mezlocillin, ticarcillin, cefalotin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam) using an agar diffusion method. Cefotiam showed a wide antibacterial spectrum including more than 70% of Enterobacteriaceae (except Serratia), beta-lactamase-producing and non-beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae, non-enterococcus streptococci, and penicillinase-producing and non-penicillinase-producing staphylococci susceptible to methicillin. Conversely, cefotiam was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratum, Streptococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Invasion of Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in humans.
AB  - Levels of serum IgG antibodies to somatic antigens of Haemophilus influenzae and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa were determined in 127 healthy people, 37 patients with chronic bronchitis and 20 patients with bronchiectasis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The logarithmic mean titers of antibodies to Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were significantly higher in the patients with chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis than in healthy people. The invasion rate of Haemophilus influenzae was identical in healthy people, chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis, while that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was significantly lower in healthy people than in chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis patients. These results indicate that patients with chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis may often have recurrence and are easily infected because of lowered defense mechanisms in the respiratory tract.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro activity of BMY-28142, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of BMY-28142, a new cephalosporin, was tested by a broth microdilution system and compared with those of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefoperazone, moxalactam, and HR 810 against 747 bacterial isolates, one-third of which were resistant to one or more third-generation cephalosporins. BMY-28142 was the most active drug tested against 326 Enterobacteriaceae with an MIC for 90% of the organisms tested (MIC90) of 1.0 micrograms/ml. Against these Enterobacteriaceae the relative activities were: BMY-28142 greater than HR 810 greater than moxalactam and ceftazidime greater than cefotaxime greater than cefoperazone. For cefotaxime- and cefoperazone-resistant strains, the MIC90 of BMY-28142 was 4.0 micrograms/ml (compared with 0.13 micrograms/ml for susceptible strains). BMY-28142, with an MIC90 of 8.0 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was about half as active as ceftazidime. The relative activities against P. aeruginosa were: ceftazidime greater than BMY-28142 greater than HR 810 greater than cefoperazone greater than moxalactam and cefotaxime. The MIC90 of BMY-28142 against staphylococci was 2.0 micrograms/ml, which was fourfold less active than HR 810, slightly less active than cefotaxime and cefoperazone, and fourfold more active than ceftazidime and moxalactam. BMY-28142 was very active against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 0.06 micrograms/ml), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC90, 0.015 micrograms/ml),aand nonenterococcal streptococci. Its activity against Streptococcus faecalis was poor (MIC90, 64 micrograms/ml). BMY-28142 was stable against the several beta-lactamases tested but exhibited little beta-lactamase inhibitory effect.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (AMA-1080), a new N-sulfonated monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (AMA-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. Carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against Staphylococcus aureus. The MICs of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest MICs of the antibiotics tested. The MIC of carumonam for 90% of Klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. The superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. The MIC of carumonam for 90% of P. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the MICs of aztreonam and ceftazidime. Carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of S. aureus and Bacteroides fragilis. Carumonam was resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal beta-lactamases. It was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of K. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. In general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (MIC); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - The in-vitro activities of enoxacin and ofloxacin compared with that of ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The in-vitro activities of enoxacin and ofloxacin were compared with that of the  other new 4-quinolone, ciprofloxacin. All three compounds were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MICs mostly less than 1 mg/l). The other Gram-negative aerobes tested were in general less susceptible, though for Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas species (including aeruginosa) MICs seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. Ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were more active against Gardnerella vaginalis (MICs 0.5-2 mg/l) than was enoxacin (MICs 8-32 mg/l). Staphylococci were susceptible to ofloxacin (MICs 0.12-1 mg/l) and enoxacin (MICs 0.5-2 mg/l) as well as to ciprofloxacin. Streptococci also were mostly sensitive to the compounds though the MICs of enoxacin (4-64 mg/l) were noticeably higher than those of ofloxacin (1-4 mg/l). Anaerobes were in general susceptible though, as with streptococci, ofloxacin, with activity similar to that of ciprofloxacin, was more active than enoxacin. Variants of Enterobacteriaceae with reduced susceptibility were readily selected in the laboratory with either enoxacin or ofloxacin as the selective agent. The MICs of all the 4-quinolones were usually increased four- to 16-fold for these strains; they could therefore be regarded as remaining susceptible to the newer compounds.
TI  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. The compound was highly active against the common members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. YM-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii. The activity of YM-13115 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. Against Haemophilus influenzae YM-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. YM-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The concentrations of YM-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit Streptococcus faecalis. YM-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. YM-13115 is extremely active against P. aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of cefpirome, a new cephalosporin.
AB  - The activity of the extended spectrum cephalosporin cefpirome (HR 810) was compared with that of other beta-lactams and gentamicin. A total of 524 clinical isolates and strains known to be resistant to certain agents were studied. Against the Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria spp. cefpirome was highly active (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l), generally being as active or slightly more active than ceftazidime and cefotaxime, and 8 to 32 times more active than cefuroxime. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa cefpirome (MIC90 8 mg/l) was four-fold less active than ceftazidime. Staphylococcus aureus was susceptible to cefpirome (MIC90 2 mg/l) and cefpirome was the only cephalosporin tested with significant activity against Lancefield Group D streptococci. Bacteroides spp. (with the exception of Bact. ureolyticus) were resistant to cefpirome. The compound was bactericidal to all the susceptible strains studied with the exception of Lancefield Group D streptococci. The major target site for cefpirome was PBP 3 and the protein binding was low.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of dactimicin, a novel pseudodisaccharide aminoglycoside, compared with those of other aminoglycoside antibiotics.
AB  - When compared with astromicin, amikacin, gentamicin, and sisomicin, dactimicin was similar to astromicin in in vitro activity and was more active than amikacin and gentamicin against the clinical isolates of Serratia marcescens, but less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Dactimicin and astromicin were active against many gentamicin- and amikacin-resistant bacteria expressing aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, with the exception of aminoglycoside 3-acetyltransferase. However, dactimicin was more resistant than astromicin to inactivation by aminoglycoside 3-acetyltransferase, probably owing to the protective action of the formimidoyl group. The in vivo activity of dactimicin, assessed by the 50% effective doses against systemic infections in mice, was similar or superior to that of astromicin and was superior or inferior to that of amikacin depending on the strains tested.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of DN-9550, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - DN-9550 [(6R, 7R)-7-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(1H-imidazol-4-yl) methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-pyridinio)methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia -1-azabicyclo methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate hydrochloride] is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The activity of DN-9550 against most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae was roughly comparable to that of ceftazidime, slightly lower than that of cefotaxime, and far exceeded that of cefoperazone. Against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens, DN-9550 was more active than ceftazidime and cefotaxime. DN-9550 and ceftazidime were significantly more active than cefotaxime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but DN-9550 and cefotaxime were clearly more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci and streptococci. Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were also highly susceptible to DN-9550, but Bacteroides fragilis was generally not susceptible to the compound. DN-9550 was stable to various types of beta-lactamases and had high affinities for penicillin-binding protein 3 of both Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. When DN-9550 was administered subcutaneously to mice experimentally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, its efficacy well reflected its in vitro potency.
TI  - Binding of polymyxin B nonapeptide to gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The binding of the outer membrane-disorganizing peptide polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN) to gram-negative bacteria was studied by using tritium-labeled PMBN. Smooth Salmonella typhimurium had a binding capacity of ca. 6 nmol of PMBN per mg (dry weight) of bacteria, which corresponds to ca. 1 X 10(6) to 2 X 10(6) molecules of PMBN per single cell. The binding was of relatively high affinity (Kd, 1.3 microM). The isolated outer membrane of S. typhimurium bound ca. 100 nmol of PMBN per mg of outer membrane protein (Kd, 1.1 microM), whereas the cytoplasmic membrane bound 9 to 10 times less. Other bacteria which are susceptible to the action of PMBN (Escherichia coli strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae) also bound large amounts of PMBN. The S. typhimurium pmrA mutant, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Proteus mirabilis (all known as resistant to polymyxin and PMBN) bound 3.3, 4, and 12 times less than S. typhimurium, respectively. The binding of PMBN to S. typhimurium was effectively inhibited by low concentrations of polymyxin B, compound EM49 (octapeptin), polylysine, and protamine. Spermine, Ca2+, and Mg2+ also inhibited the PMBN binding although they were ca. 160, 700, and 2,400 times less active (based on molarity) than polymyxin B, respectively. No binding inhibition was found at the tested concentrations of streptomycin, tetralysine, spermidine, or cadaverine.
TI  - Aztreonam in patients with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: failure to prevent emergence of pneumococcal infections.
AB  - A group of 36 patients, all requiring hospital admission because of acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, were treated with 1 or 2 g intramuscular injections of aztreonam for ten days. Patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae infections were excluded from the study. Sputum cultures before treatment revealed the other usual respiratory pathogens but repeat cultures on days 3, 10 and 17 sometimes yielded Str. pneumoniae, occasionally combined with Haemophilus influenzae or Branhamella catarrhalis. Ten patients had to be given other antimicrobial agents for Str. pneumoniae infections which developed during the study or follow-up periods. Pseudomonas aeruginosa failed to respond well to aztreonam. All the H. influenzae strains were sensitive to aztreonam (MIC 0.25 mg/l, or less) but all strains of Str. pneumoniae were resistant (MIC greater than 32 mg/l). Ps. aeruginosa strains were moderately resistant (MIC generally 4-16 mg/l) and Bran. catarrhalis strains only moderately sensitive (MICs generally 0.5-4 mg/l). Peak serum concentrations averaging approximately 37 mg/l were observed after the 1 g injections (55 mg/l after 2 g) and the corresponding mean peak concentrations in the sputum were 1.3 mg/l and 2.5 mg/l, respectively. The penetration from blood to sputum was thus approximately 3.5% and 4.6% after the 1 g and 2 g doses. No unwanted local or general reactions were observed. The disappointing clinical results (only 23 out of 36 patients with excellent or good clinical results) one week after the end of the treatment were mainly due to the emergence of pneumococcal infections during (and immediately after) therapy. Considering that Str. pneumoniae is still one of the most important organisms associated with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and that conventional sputum cultures may not always reveal its presence, there is considerable doubt if aztreonam has any place in the treatment, especially as the results in Ps. aeruginosa infections have also been much poorer than expected.
TI  - Prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Aspiration of the exudate through open perforation was performed in 48 children with chronic suppurative otitis media. Eighty-two aerobic and 93 anaerobic isolates were recovered. Aerobic bacteria only were involved in 22 patients (46%), and anaerobic organisms only were involved in five patients (10%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered from 21 patients (44%). The most common bacteria isolated were Bacteroides melaninogenicus group (40% of patients), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (29%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10%), and Staphylococcus aureus (10%). There were 50 beta-lactamase-producing organisms (26 anaerobes and 24 aerobes) recovered from 33 patients (69%). Forty-four of these bacteria were isolated from the 37 patients recently treated with a penicillin. These included all ten isolates of S aureus and Bacteroides fragilis group, 11 of 19 of B melaninogenicus group, five of the 14 P aeruginosa, three of ten K pneumoniae, three of six of Bacteroides oralis, four of six of Haemophilus influenzae, two of three of Staphylococcus epidermidis, and two of four of Branhamella catarrhalis. The beta-lactamase-producing organisms have a possible role in the failure of penicillin therapy.
TI  - HR 810 and BMY-28142, two new cephalosporins with broad-spectrum activity: an in-vitro comparison with other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of the new parenteral cephalosporins, HR 810 (HR) and BMY-28142 (BMY), was compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics, including cefotaxime, against a total of 315 recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. An agar dilution procedure was used to determine MICs and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. Against all species of the Enterobacteriaceae tested, both HR and BMY were as active as, or slightly more active than, cefotaxime. HR differed from cefotaxime mainly in being eight-fold more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and two-fold more active against Staphylococcus aureus. BMY was also eight-fold more active than cefotaxime against Ps. aeruginosa but was two-fold less active than the latter against Staph. aureus. Both new compounds had good activity against Haemophilus influenzae, including the beta-lactamase producing strains of that species, and both had poor activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group (MIC90 greater than 128 mg/l).
TI  - The pharmacokinetics and serum and urine bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin is an investigational quinolone agent possessing an impressive antibacterial spectrum. Its pharmacokinetics were studied in six volunteers after 250-mg and 500-mg single oral doses, and its bactericidal activity compared to that of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole given to the same volunteers. Mean peak serum levels were 1.45 micrograms/mL and 2.46 micrograms/mL for 250-mg and 500-mg doses, and time to peak was 1 and 1.3 hours. The 12-hour levels were 0.12 micrograms and 0.22 microgram. Half-life (T1/2)alpha were 0.32 and 0.43 with T1/2 beta were 3.97 and 4.15 and volume of distribution (area) were 80L and 90L, respectively. Area under the concentration curve (AUC) was 5.65 h X micrograms/mL and 10.37h X micrograms/mL. Serum clearance was 23L for both doses. Approximately 49% of the 250-mg dose and 43% of the 500-mg dose was recovered in the urine. Bactericidal levels were determined against clinical isolates. Sera at 1.5 hours after the 500-mg dose averaged bactericidal levels of 1:20 or better for an Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis. Urinary bactericidal levels at eight to 12 hours were greater than or equal to 1:157 for E coli, K pneumoniae, gentamicin-piperacillin resistant P aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and 1:20 for Streptococcus faecalis. Serum bactericidal levels were superior, and urine bactericidal levels were superior or equal to the bactericidal levels obtained with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Treatment of gram-negative infections with aztreonam.
AB  - Twenty-one patients with serious gram-negative infections were treated with aztreonam. Twenty of these were clinical and microbiologic cures; there was one clinical improvement with microbiologic persistence. No bacteria became resistant. Cure rates were: bone and joint (11 of 11); skin and soft tissue (six of six); pneumonia (two of two); perinephric abscess (one of one); and intra-abdominal abscess (zero of one). The bacteria responsible for these infections included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), Serratia marcescens (two), Enterobacter gergoviae (three), Enterobacter aerogenes (two), Escherichia coli (one), Citrobacter diversus (one), and Hemophilus influenzae (one). Aztreonam was well tolerated. Significant serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase elevations developed in three patients, but none was symptomatic and all resolved after therapy was stopped. Two patients in whom a rash developed were receiving other antibiotics (vancomycin and metronidazole), making the cause of the rash unclear. Diarrhea developed in a single patient with Pseudomonas osteomyelitis, who also was receiving cefazolin for Staphylococcus aureus superinfection of his decubitus ulcer. Aztreonam was highly effective against gram-negative bacilli, including P. aeruginosa. The only clear-cut side effect was an asymptomatic rise in serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase levels in three patients.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Dynamics of resistance to cephalosporins.
AB  - Bacterial susceptibility to various cephalosporins of nine of the most frequently isolated organisms were analyzed for the five-year period 1980 to 1984. The disk diffusion susceptibility to cephalosporins of 1,640,031 strains of bacteria isolated from 242 hospitals in the United States were compared. No significant change has occurred in the susceptibility of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, or Streptococcus faecalis for this period; Enterobacter aerogenes showed a slight decrease in susceptibility to moxalactam, cephalothin, cefoxitin and cefamandole. Slight increases in susceptibility were observed with Pseudomonas aeruginosa to cefotaxime and moxalactam and for Bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin and cefamandole. Staphylococcus aureus showed slight decreases in susceptibility to cefoperazone and ceftizoxime and slight increase to moxalactam.
TI  - Effect of bacterial products on human ciliary function in vitro.
AB  - Ciliary activity protects the respiratory tract against inhaled particles, including bacteria, by transporting them trapped in mucus towards the pharynx. We have studied the effect of bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) on human nasal cilia, measuring their in vitro ciliary beat frequency by a photometric technique. Supernatant fluids were obtained from 18 hour broth cultures by centrifugation alone, by filtration, and by lysis. Supernatants obtained from Ps aeruginosa and H influenzae caused a significantly lower ciliary beat frequency than controls (broth alone). Slowed cilia were dyskinetic and at times of maximal slowing ciliostasis occurred in some areas of the epithelium. A dose related effect was demonstrated. Abrogation of cilioinhibitory properties was achieved by heating the lysate to 56 degrees C for 30 minutes and by allowing the filtrate to stand at 37 degrees C for 120 minutes. Staphylococcal products were not cilioinhibitory. It is concluded that Ps aeruginosa and H influenzae release a factor (or factors) which causes slowing of human nasal cilia in vitro. The role of this factor in the pathogenesis of infection is discussed.
TI  - A perspective on the present contribution of beta-lactamases to bacterial resistance with particular reference to induction of beta-lactamase and its clinical significance.
AB  - Resistance of bacteria to beta-lactam antibiotics has become a serious problem in the past several decades. Virtually all Staphylococcus aureus, many Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, many Enterobacteriaceae, many Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacteroides species possess beta-lactamases which hydrolyze to varying degree penems, penams, carbapenems, cephems, cephamycins and monobactams. The most common plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase is the so-called TEM beta-lactamase (Richmond Sykes type IIIa) which exists in Haemophilus, Neisseria and many of the Enterobacteriaceae. Techniques to overcome this resistance have been the development of beta-lactamase stable compounds and of beta-lactamase inhibitors. However, inducible chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases in species such as Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Citrobacter and some Serratia have become an increasing problem with more widespread use of beta-lactamase stable cephalosporins.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of the effect of cefotaxime in senile pneumonia caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - 66 patients with predominantly community-acquired pneumonia were treated with cefotaxime. The group consisted of 45 males and 21 females, aged 56 to 90 years, 43 of the patients belonging to the age groups 65-80 years. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in 21 of the 34 patients with gram-positive pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus in six, Staphylococcus epidermidis in five and Streptococcus faecalis in two. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the predominant pathogen in gram-negative pneumonia (eight patients), followed by Enterobacter (n = 6), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 5), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 4), Escherichia coli (n = 3), Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter (two cases each). The in vitro activity of cefotaxime against the isolates was compared to the activity of other beta-lactam antibiotics. Characteristically, the classical signs and symptoms of pneumonia were absent or discrete in some of the elderly patients. There was a delayed clearance of pulmonary infiltrates. 55 of 66 patients responded to cefotaxime within four weeks of treatment; the symptoms were aggravated or remained unchanged in seven patients. Patients with a delayed clinical response displayed decreased peripheral lymphocyte counts and T cell functions in PHA stimulation tests, as well as low immunoglobulin levels. A combination of cefotaxime and gamma-venin cleared the symptoms in some of these patients.
TI  - Detection of beta-lactamase activity with nitrocefin of multiple strains of various microbial genera.
AB  - The production or presence of beta-lactamase(s) was studied by the rapid method utilizing the chromogenic cephalosporin compound nitrocefin in cultures of multiple strains belonging to the same genus as well as groups of microorganisms. The genera were: Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, rare Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. With this sensitive and rapid assay for beta-lactamase, it was possible to verify and separate the beta-lactamase producing cultures from the non-producers and include the useful strains to on-going research, such as beta-lactam screen, beta-lactamase inhibitory study and lytic properties of beta-lactams. The data also provide evidence for the possible role of beta-lactamase(s) in the physiology, biochemistry and pathogenicity of bacterial strains. The nitrocefin method was found a very specific and extremely useful procedure for the detection and estimation of beta-lactamase activity.
TI  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of ceftriaxone in comparison with nine other  antibiotics.
AB  - The results of a large three centre co-ordinated study into the in vitro susceptibility of bacterial clinical pathogens showed no significant evidence of regional variation within the U.K. towards the 10 antibiotics examined. The newer cephalosporins were highly potent and superior to other antibiotics against the Enterobacteriaceae, with ceftriaxone and cefotaxime the most potent. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, gentamicin was the most active, followed by ceftazidime, piperacillin and ceftriaxone; cefotetan was the least active. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus albus were most susceptible to cefuroxime and gentamicin, though most were also susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and cefoxitin. Streptococcus (Groups A and B), Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria spp. were susceptible to most agents other than gentamicin, but ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were overall the most potent. Ceftriaxone was the most active agent against Haemophilus influenzae. The newer agents were variable and relatively poor against anaerobes and only amoxycillin and piperacillin were significantly active against Streptococcus faecalis. The overall resistance level to the third generation cephalosporins was low.
TI  - A multicenter comparison of related pharmacologic features of cephalexin and dicloxacillin given for two months to young children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Twenty-one cystic fibrosis patients under 3 years of age were enrolled in an open multicenter study to assess the feasibility of the study design and to compare selected pharmacologic features of cephalexin or dicloxacillin administered orally for 2 months. Patient tolerance and compliance were significantly less for dicloxacillin (p less than .01 and p less than .001, respectively). Superficial Candida infections were more common in the cephalexin group (p = 0.02), however increased stool frequency and nonspecific diaper rashes were more prevalent in patients receiving dicloxacillin (p less than .05). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from respiratory secretions after 2 months from two dicloxacillin and no cephalexin patients. Areas under the curve and peak serum concentrations were higher for cephalexin (p less than .05 and p = .02), but antistaphylococcal activity in serum was higher for dicloxacillin (p less than .05) due to a lower mean MIC compared to cephalexin. Deep pharyngeal plus routine throat culture yielded more pathogens than either method alone. Express mail and central processing of respiratory specimens was efficient for most organisms, however there was some loss of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Cephalexin was associated with better patient acceptance and compliance despite higher rates of superficial fungal infections as compared to dicloxacillin. Cephalexin, routine bacteriologic throat swabs processed locally or centrally, mail-in urine compliance assessment and a multicenter design are feasible components for a long-term prospective evaluation of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with cystic fibrosis.
TI  - Newly diagnosed cystic fibrosis in middle and later life.
AB  - Four patients with cystic fibrosis diagnosed in middle and later life are presented. All had chronic bronchopulmonary infection with a high sweat sodium concentration, and chest radiographic evidence of upper zone bronchiectasis. Two patients had pancreatic dysfunction. Sputum culture grew mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa in three patients and Haemophilus influenzae in one. Ages at diagnosis were 63, 42, 40, and 35 years. These patients confirm the possibility of occasional longevity in cystic fibrosis and emphasise the need to consider the diagnosis at all ages. They also provide encouragement for younger patients.
TI  - Position of ceftazidime in respiratory diseases.
AB  - Twenty patients (10 males and 10 females), ranging in age from 53 to 81 years, were treated with ceftazidime, 2-3 g/day i.m., for 12 to 15 days. All patients were suffering from moderate to severe infections of the lower respiratory tract (6 cases of pneumonia and 14 cases of acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis). In addition, almost all patients presented severe local and general predisposing factors (three patients with lung cancer, two with bronchiectasis and 14 with respiratory insufficiency). The aetiological agents responsible for the infections were mainly Gram-negative bacteria (6 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4 Haemophilus influenzae, 4 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 3 Proteus strains). The clinical and microbiological results of the treatment were good. With the exception of one case of maculopapular rash, none of the patients complained of adverse reactions and no toxic effects were observed.
TI  - [Lack of specificity of protected distal bronchial samples in the bacteriological diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia caused by gram negative bacilli].
AB  - Lower respiratory tract secretions (LRS) were sampled during a two year period in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation using a method previously described by Matthew et al. Only those LRS positive for gram-negative bacilli were reported in this study. The patients were separated in two groups: those with nosocomial pneumonia due to gram-negative bacilli (NP+ group) and those without (NP- group). The species most often isolated from LRS were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25%), Proteus (20%), Escherichia coli (18%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10%), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (8%) and Haemophilus influenzae (7%). The spectrum of gram-negative species was not statistically different in either group of patients. The numbers of gram-negative bacilli isolated from each LRS were more important in the NP+ group (p less than 0.001), but so was the duration of mechanical ventilation before each LRS (p less than 0.01). In this group also, a specific bacteriological diagnosis with only one species was possible in 3 out of the 13 cases; a tentative diagnosis only was possible in 10 cases: in 6 cases, the responsibility of two (or more) species was suggested. The susceptibility to antibiotics of gram-negative bacilli isolated from LRS was moderate. A third generation cephalosporin together with amikacin seemed to be the best choice of antibiotics when no specific bacteriological diagnosis could be made with the LRS.
TI  - Temocillin. In vitro activity compared with other antibiotics.
AB  - Temocillin is a recently developed penicillin with a methoxy group in the 6-alpha position. The in vitro activity of temocillin was studied using 932 recent clinical isolates of aerobic and anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci, and its activity was compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. Temocillin was active against the Enterobacteriaceae, with narrow ranges of MICs and MIC90 values (less than or equal to 8 mg/L) for all isolates except Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter species. Moreover, the compound was active against 46 multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae strains. The drug was also strongly active against Haemophilus influenzae, with beta-lactamase-producing strains being as susceptible as non-beta-lactamase-producing strains. Temocillin showed no useful activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter or Gram-positive cocci, and had only discrete activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group. In general, temocillin displayed the same spectrum of activity against Enterobacteriaceae as third generation cephalosporins, but with a substantially lower intrinsic activity.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of norfloxacin and other agents against ocular pathogens.
AB  - 302 clinical isolates representing 16 bacterial species most often implicated in  ocular infections were tested in vitro against norfloxacin and a panel of antibacterial agents. On the basis of the 90% minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC90) data, norfloxacin was 4-32 times more active than the next best antimicrobial tested against Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with overall MIC90 less than or equal to 1 mg/l. Norfloxacin was equal in activity to polymyxin B against Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC90 = 1 mg/l), and it ranked second to both polymyxin B against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and cotrimoxazole against Staphylococcus aureus, (MIC90 = 2 mg/l in each case). Along with neomycin and cotrimoxazole, norfloxacin (MIC90 = 1 mg/l) ranked second to gentamicin and tetracycline against Moraxella species. Compared to erythromycin (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l), norfloxacin (MIC90 less than or equal to 16 mg/l) was considerably less active against streptococci. Overall, norfloxacin was the most active agent in both potency and antibacterial spectrum against the test organisms. These results suggest the potential use of norfloxacin in the treatment of superficial bacterial infections of the eye.
TI  - In-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to enoxacin, norfloxacin, gentamicin and new beta-lactams.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of pefloxacin was compared with that of norfloxacin, enoxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 363 recent clinical isolates. An agar dilution procedure was used to determine MICs and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Shigella sonnei, Salmonella typhi, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae at less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l. Serratia marcescens and Providencia stuartii were somewhat more resistant, 2 mg/l of pefloxacin being required to inhibit 90% of isolates of these species. Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 4 mg/l and 90% of isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group at 16 mg/l. The activity of enoxacin was similar to that of pefloxacin, with enoxacin being four-fold less active against Staph. aureus, two-fold less active against the Bacteroides fragilis group and most species of the Enterobacteriaceae, and two-fold more active against Ps. aeruginosa. Pefloxacin showed good activity against gentamicin-resistant Ps. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae and against methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus. Strains with decreased susceptibility to norfloxacin tended to be less susceptible to both pefloxacin and enoxacin.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of recently developed quinolone compounds--with a note on  the frequency of resistant mutants.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of the new quinolone compounds enoxacin, norfloxacin,  ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin was evaluated in 300 Enterobacteriaceae, 50 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 30 Acinetobacter spp., 15 Haemophilus influenzae, 50 Streptococcus faecalis, and 70 Staphylococcus aureus isolates and compared to that of nalidixic acid, gentamicin and various beta-lactam compounds. Moreover, the rate of spontaneous mutants resistant to quinolone compounds was evaluated. In concentrations only insignificantly exceeding the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), mutants could be isolated rather frequently (approx. 10(-6) fold); in concentrations of at least 10 times the MIC resistant mutants were barely detectable. In general, the mutants exhibited a 4- to 8-fold increase of the MIC as compared to the wild strain. In S. faecalis mutants were not detectable, whereas they occurred in low frequency (less than 10(-8) fold) in S. aureus strains. In all mutants there was almost, but not entirely, complete cross-resistance between the quinolone derivatives.
TI  - In vitro activity of ciprofloxacin against pediatric pathogens.
AB  - We tested ciprofloxacin, a new quinoline derivative, against 783 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria utilizing either standardized microbroth or agar dilution methods. Ciprofloxacin activity was compared to that of cephalosporins, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tobramycin, ticarcillin, erythromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. MIC90 values (range) in micrograms/ml were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa = 1 (less than or equal to 0.015-8); Staphylococcus spp. = 0.12 (less than or equal to 0.015-1); Enterobacteriaceae = 0.03 (less than or equal to 0.015-1); Haemophilus influenzae = 0.015 (less than or equal to 0.004-0.03); Streptococcus faecalis = 2 (0.5-4). The MIC90 of ciprofloxacin for 98 tobramycin-resistant isolates was 2.0 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin was stable at temperatures of 35, 22, 4, -20 and -70 degrees C for up to 15 weeks. Varying the inoculum from 10(3) to 10(7) colony forming units per ml or the pH from 6-9 resulted in no increase in the MIC. Of the new quinoline derivatives tested, ciprofloxacin demonstrated consistently superior antibacterial activity. Ciprofloxacin may be particularly effective for oral administration in infections requiring prolonged antibiotic therapy, such as bone, joint, and complicated soft tissue infections, and in pulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis.
TI  - Cefmenoxime: clinical evaluation.
AB  - Cefmenoxime was evaluated in an open trial consisting of 41 patients. Forty infections in 36 patients could be evaluated. Thirteen patients had pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli (two bacteremic), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Streptococcus faecalis; all improved and 12 of 13 were clinically cured, but one relapse (S. faecalis) occurred at two weeks. Six patients with cystitis due to E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, P. aeruginosa, or S. faecalis all improved, but relapse or reinfection, or both, occurred in five due to P. aeruginosa, S. faecalis, C. fruendii, or E. coli. Neurogenic bladder or other complications were present in five of 13 patients with pyelonephritis and five of six with cystitis. Ten patients with pneumonia and one with tracheobronchitis due to Hemophilus influenzae, S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, or Neisseria meningitidis all improved and seven had resolution without relapse, but P. aeruginosa emerged in two patients, one of whom died. Eight soft tissue infections due to Staphylococcus aureus, Peptococcus prevotti, Streptococcus species, or infections of mixed origin resolved in six. Sterility of blood cultures was obtained in one patient with endocarditis due to S. anginosus, but other therapy was substituted. Clinical resolution of the toxic shock syndrome and subsequent negative endocervical cultures for S. aureus occurred in one. Granulocytopenia of unverified cause in four (with less than 1,500 mm3) and two (with less than 2,000 mm3) was reversible. Headache during treatment occurred in six patients and a possible disulfiram-like effect in three. Elevations of serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase and alkaline phosphatase occurred in five, Coombs' positivity in two, and diarrhea in three. Clinical efficacy of cefmenoxime was significant. Possible side effects require further study.
TI  - Cefmenoxime: in vitro activity.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365 or A-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was determined for a broad spectrum of 1,234 organisms isolated as part of a multiclinic study. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefmenoxime required to inhibit at least 90 percent of strains tested (MIC90) ranged from 0.12 to 8 micrograms/ml for Enterobacteriaceae. MIC90S were 0.015 and 0.06 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes, respectively, and 4 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus aureus. Group D streptococci were less susceptible. The MIC90 of cefmenoxime for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Hemophilus influenzae was 0.06 microgram/ml. Cefmenoxime was less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, and Bacteroides fragilis (MIC50 = 16 micrograms/ml).
TI  - In vitro activity of CGP 31523A, a broad-spectrum cephalosporin, in comparison with those of other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CGP 31523A, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefoxitin, cefuroxime, moxalactam, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, and other beta-lactams, when appropriate, against 533 recent clinical isolates and known resistant strains of bacteria. The MICs of CGP 31523A required to inhibit 90% (MIC90S) of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. Of Staphylococcus aureus (excluding methicillin-resistant strains) and Haemophilus influenzae, 90% were susceptible to 0.5 micrograms/ml. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Lancefield group D streptococci were resistant to CGP 31523A (MIC90, greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml). The activity against Bacteroides fragilis was modest (MIC90, 32 micrograms/ml). The susceptibility of known beta-lactamase-producing strains suggested that CGP 31523A was resistant to many beta-lactamases (but not those of Bacteroides fragilis). The serum protein binding of CGP 31523A was about 73%. The primary target site of CGP 31523A in Escherichia coli appeared to be penicillin-binding protein 3.
TI  - Ceftriaxone in acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - A group of 36 patients, admitted to hospital because of acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, were treated with once daily injections of ceftriaxone for 10 days, 17 receiving 1 g injections and 19 patients 2 g doses. At the end of treatment (day 11) six patients remained infected (three with Branhamella catarrhalis and three with Pseudomonas aeruginosa) but during the 7 follow-up days 12 patients developed infections with beta-lactamase producing strains of Bran. catarrhalis, Ps. aeruginosa was cultured from 2 patients and Streptococcus pneumoniae from 3 more. Kinetic studies confirmed the long half-life of ceftriaxone (13 to 14 h in this patient group) and showed average peak serum concentrations of 31 mg/l after 1 g and 43 mg/l after the 2 g dose. The comparable sputum concentrations were 3.5 and 4.8 mg/l, respectively. However, four patients failed to show any ceftriaxone in the sputum despite simultaneous blood concentrations of between 32 and 50 mg/l and in two patients ceftriaxone only appeared in the sputum 12 h after the injection. All except one harboured beta-lactamase-producing Bran. catarrhalis in the sputum, and the possibility of breakdown of ceftriaxone by branhamella beta-lactamases is suggested.
TI  - Imipenem therapy of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Imipenem is the first of a new class of beta-lactam antimicrobial agents with remarkable and extremely potent in vitro activity against most commonly isolated bacterial pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus, members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Hemophilus influenzae. The clinical efficacy and toxicity of imipenem were evaluated in 35 patients with 38 different infections. The overall clinical response was favorable (infections cured or improved) in 89% of the infections (34 of 38). Of the 17 infections with P. aeruginosa, 15 were cured or improved. However, P. aeruginosa isolates resistant to imipenem emerged during the therapy of six infections, and two cases of P. aeruginosa septicemia later relapsed after imipenem therapy. Gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea with or without emesis) occurred in 17% of the patients (6 of 35) but was ameliorated by slowing the rate of intravenous infusion or lowering the dose of imipenem. Except for certain severe P. aeruginosa infections, imipenem is effective and relatively safe therapy for infections caused by susceptible organisms.
TI  - Intravenous antibiotic therapy in ambulatory pediatric patients.
AB  - Eighty-nine pediatric patients (median age, 12.0; range, 1.5 to 18 years) were treated with antibiotics given intravenously by self- or parent administration for a variety of infections, under close physician supervision. Patients with infections involving bone and joint (53), respiratory tract (16), soft tissue (9), abdominal cavity (4), genitourinary tract (4) and bloodstream (3) were treated for a mean period of 19.0 days. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae were the most frequent pathogens. Favorable clinical outcomes occurred in 85 patients (96%). Adverse clinical and laboratory events occurred at a frequency commensurate with that of hospitalized patients. A total of 1700 patient days were managed in this outpatient setting at significant cost savings, and the method allowed early return to school for 83 patients (93%). Intravenous antibiotic therapy in ambulatory patients can provide a successful, safe, cost-effective alternative to inpatient care under conditions of diligent patient screening and physician-centered follow-up.
TI  - The use of penicillins in orthopaedic surgery.
AB  - The main use of the penicillins in orthopedic surgery is in the treatment of infections due to Hemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Group D streptococci (enterococci). Penicillins have antimicrobial activity and have a characteristic pharmacodynamic action, including side effects. The tissue penetration characteristics of the penicillins into synovial fluid and human bone are significant. Semisynthetic penicillins, antistaphylococcal penicillins, and the antipseudomonal penicillins are used for treatment of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. Oral penicillin therapy can be useful in treatment of osteomyelitis.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial properties of BRL 36650, a novel 6 alpha-substituted penicillin.
AB  - BRL 36650 is a new type of penicillin in which a formamido group has been introduced into the 6 alpha-position of the nucleus. The compound is highly active against aerobic gram-negative bacteria and is stable to a wide range of beta-lactamases produced by these organisms. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, BRL 36650 was considerably more active than piperacillin, particularly against beta-lactamase-producing strains, and showed a similar level of activity to moxalactam, aztreonam, and the third-generation cephalosporins cefotaxime and ceftazidime. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas species, BRL 36650 was more active than piperacillin, cefoperazone, and aztreonam and compared favorably with ceftazidime. BRL 36650 was highly active against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, and against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Clinical isolates of Enterobacter species and P. aeruginosa which showed markedly reduced susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and aztreonam were only slightly less susceptible to BRL 36650. Against Bacteroides fragilis and most gram-positive bacteria, BRL 36650 showed only a low level of activity. BRL 36650 was found to be only 35% bound to human serum protein, and the antibacterial activity was little affected by the presence of serum. In contrast, the composition of the test medium influenced the activity of BRL 36650 slightly, and an antagonistic effect could be demonstrated between the compound and a component of certain Mueller-Hinton media.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftriaxone: a review.
AB  - Ceftriaxone possesses potent activity, both in vitro and in vivo, against a broad range of bacteria. MIC50 and MIC90 geometric means were calculated using the results of broth and agar dilution assays performed worldwide. The MIC90 for ceftriaxone overall was 8 micrograms/ml or less for Enterobacteriaceae and 0.024 microgram/ml or less for Neisseria and Hemophilus species. Moderate activity was noted against Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter species (MIC50 12 to 28 micrograms/ml). Ceftriaxone was extremely active against nonenterococcal streptococci (MIC90 0.07 microgram/ml or less) and quite active against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90 5 micrograms/ml or less). Ceftriaxone generally was inactive against enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Activity against anaerobes was good, except for many strains of Bacteroides fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron (MIC greater than 64 micrograms/ml). Ceftriaxone exhibited excellent stability to beta-lactamases. The effect of medium and inoculum on in vitro testing was minimal. Excellent activity was demonstrated in vivo. Against Enterobacteriaceae, nonenterococcal streptococci, and H. influenzae, the PD50 in mice generally was less than 1 mg/kg. S. aureus strains responded moderately (mean PD50 6.5 mg/kg), whereas against most P. aeruginosa strains, PD50s ranged from 5 to greater than 250 mg/kg. The superior pharmacokinetic profile of ceftriaxone compared with that of other new cephalosporins was demonstrated by use of a prophylactic treatment schedule. The ability of ceftriaxone to penetrate the cerebrospinal fluid and provide excellent therapeutic coverage was confirmed in experimental meningitis models.
TI  - Antimicrobial agent susceptibility patterns of bacteria in hospitals from 1971 to 1982.
AB  - Bacterial susceptibility to 16 commonly used antibiotics was analyzed for a 12-year period (from 1971 to 1982, inclusive). Susceptibilities of 5,828,243 strains isolated from a mean of 242 hospitals nationwide and of 194,575 strains isolated at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Mass., and the Bronx Lebanon Hospital Center, New York, N.Y., were compared. Strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed virtually the same susceptibilities to antibiotics throughout the 12-year period, whereas Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant increases in resistance to most antibiotics. The close similarity between antibiotic susceptibilities shown at both the 242 hospitals and the 2 individual hospitals suggests that this analysis accurately reflects trends of bacterial resistance to antibiotics in U.S. hospitals. Since most of the species analyzed produce serious disease and high mortality, their susceptibility to antibiotics is relevant both to physicians treating infectious diseases and to epidemiologists.
TI  - Antibiotic use in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Chronic pulmonary infections contribute significantly to the morbidity and mortality of patients with CF. The primary pathogens are Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and Staphylococcus aureus. Hemophilus influenzae has been isolated from a significant number of patients also. A number of the beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics reportedly have altered pharmacokinetic variables in CF. Therapy of acute pulmonary deterioration consists of intravenous antibiotics for two weeks. Antibiotic selection is based on culture and sensitivity results. Currently, the combination of a broad-spectrum penicillin and an aminoglycoside seems to provide the best results. Prophylactic antibiotics are effective if the primary isolates are sensitive to the agents used. Chronic PA infections are problematic because effective oral agents are not available. Aerosolized antibiotics do not improve results over adequate systemic therapy for acute exacerbations. Questions regarding optimal dosages, frequency, and duration of therapy remain.
TI  - In vitro activity of imipenem--a review.
AB  - A review is given of the microbiological properties of imipenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic with an exceptionally broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. An evaluation of results of numerous in vitro studies reveals that imipenem effectively inhibited growth of 53 of 55 bacterial species, the mean MIC90 being less than 8 mg/l. The MIC90 for cocci, with the exception of Staphylococcus epidermidis, is in the range of 0.01-3.1 mg/l. The MIC90 for all Enterobacteriaceae is equal to or less than 8 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria are generally susceptible to imipenem, only Pseudomonas maltophilia and Pseudomonas cepacia showing intrinsic resistance. Imipenem is currently the most active drug available against anaerobic bacteria, the MIC usually being below 1 mg/l even for Bacteroides fragilis. Rare bacteria such as Nocardia asteroides, Listeria monocytogenes or fast growing Mycobacterium spp. which cause difficult-to-treat infections are also susceptible to imipenem. Increases in inoculum size have only a minimal effect on activity of the drug. In most species the MBC only slightly exceeded the MIC; however in the case of Streptococcus faecalis the MBC value was many times the MIC value. Synergism has been observed in combinations of imipenem with aminoglycosides, and antagonism in combinations with other beta-lactam antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens. Imipenem is stable in the presence of the common chromosomal and plasmid-mediated enzymes. Induction of inactivating enzymes was observed in staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens.
TI  - Rapid procedure for isolation of plasmid DNA and application to epidemiological analysis.
AB  - A rapid and simple plasmid isolation procedure was developed for the epidemiological analysis of plasmid-mediated antimicrobial resistance. By this method, plasmid DNAs ranging in molecular weight between 2.0 and 122 X 10(6) could be detected. Various bacteria, such as strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus, could be analyzed. The plasmid DNA obtained could be directly used for restriction endonuclease analysis without further purification. In addition, this method made it possible to analyze several cultures at the same time.
TI  - Enoxacin: worldwide in-vitro activity against 22451 clinical isolates.
AB  - A worldwide multicentre study involving 31 centres in eight countries was conducted to compare the in-vitro activity of enoxacin with that of other currently available antibiotics. Enoxacin was active against virtually all of the species of Enterobacteriaceae tested (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.25-2 mg/l). It was also effective at inhibiting Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 = 2 mg/l; n = 3540), Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis (MIC90 = 2 mg/l; n = 2635 and 837 resp.), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (MIC90 = 4 mg/l; n = 260), Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae (both MIC90 less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l). The MIC90 for enoxacin against streptococci ranged from 8 to 32 mg/l. Comparison of data from Canada, West Germany, U.K., South Africa and New Zealand showed the MICs for enoxacin to be generally consistent throughout the world. The only exception was for Citrobacter freundii where the MIC90 was significantly higher in the U.K. than in West Germany (P less than 0.05 Mann Whitney U Test). Against susceptible species the activity of enoxacin was generally greater than that of ampicillin, gentamicin and the cephalosporins. Because of the prevalence of resistance to these drugs, there appears to be a continued need for new antibiotics with differing mechanisms of action.
TI  - A comparison of cefotaxime and cefoperazone in respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The clinical efficacy and safety of cefotaxime and cefoperazone were evaluated in a comparative study. There were 18 adult males and 11 females. Their underlying disease was pneumonia (10), pleural empyema (2), bronchiectasis (6), bacterial bronchitis (9), lung abscess (2). Bacterial material included sputum, bronchial secretion gained by bronchoscopy or tracheal aspiration, and pleural punctures obtained up to 24 h before treatment. Most patients had Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae infections, although two patients in the cefoperazone group had infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and another two anaerobic flora. Standard disc diffusion, and agar dilution susceptibilities were performed on all isolates. Patients received either cefoperazone (14) intravenously or intramuscularly in a dose range from 2 to 8 g/day or cefotaxime (15) 1 to 2 g intravenous or intramusculary at dosing intervals of 6 to 8 h (total 3 to 8 g/day), depending on the severity of the disease. Clinical improvement occurred in 14/15 (93%) of patients in the cefotaxime group, and 12/14 (86%) of patients treated with cefoperazone. Two failures in the cefoperazone group were secondary to superinfection (Acinetobacter and Ps. aeruginosa). Bacteriological and symptomatic failure, occurred in one patient with anaerobic lung abscess treated with cefotaxime. The results of this study indicate that cefotaxime is safe and effective in the therapy of acute bacterial lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Treatment of 160 cases of acute bacterial meningitis with cefotaxime.
AB  - One hundred and sixty cases of acute bacterial meningitis were treated with cefotaxime. Patients were between 9 days and 79 years old: 7 new borns, 37 infants, 43 children, 19 adolescents and 54 adults. Fifty-eight patients (36%) were in coma when admitted. Aetiology was determined in 110 patients (68.8%): Neisseria meningitidis in 42, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 36, Haemophilus influenzae in 16, Salmonella spp. in 7, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, Enterobacter spp. in 2 and Haemophilus parainfluenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae in one patient each. All isolates were sensitive to cefotaxime, with MIC's for 26 strains ranging from 0.01 to 0.50 mg/l. One hundred and fifty-six of the 160 patients were treated with cefotaxime alone and the four others with cefotaxime in association with an aminoglycoside in three and rifampicin in one. Cefotaxime was administered by intravenous infusion, in a daily dose 100 to 300 mg/kg. Duration of treatment ranged from 8 days to 6 weeks, with a mean of 15 days. One hundred and forty-nine patients (93.1%) were cured, two after a relapse. Three patients had sequelae. Most (88.5%) had sterile CSF within 72 h after starting treatment. Eleven patients (6.9%) died, eight within the first 48 h. The only side-effects observed were mild transient eosinophilia in some patients and rash and leukopenia in 2 each. The study demonstrates that cefotaxime is effective in the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FR 17027, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FR 17027, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin ester, inhibited group A and B streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the inhibition concentration of amoxicillin and cefaclor, and was more active than cephalexin. It was less active (MIC, 25 micrograms/ml) against staphylococci than was cephalexin, and it did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis or Listeria monocytogenes. FR 17027 inhibited beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis at less than 0.1 micrograms/ml and was more active than cefaclor or cephalexin against these bacteria. FR 17027 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, Providencia rettgeri, and Citrobacter diversus at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, including isolated resistant to amoxicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, but it was less active than ceftizoxime. Some strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes were resistant (MIC, greater than 25 micrograms/ml). FR 17027 did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Pseudomonas species, Acinetobacter species, or Bacteroides species. Activity was minimally affected by growth conditions. FR 17027 was not hydrolyzed by the common beta-lactamases present in many of the pathogens causing respiratory and urinary tract infections in outpatients.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of five quinoline derivatives and five other antimicrobial agents used in oral therapy.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin was compared to those of norfloxacin, pefloxacin, pipemidic acid, nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, cephradine and amoxycillin. Agar dilution tests were performed with 631 clinical isolates from urinary and respiratory tract infections. Ciprofloxacin was found to be the most active drug tested against all gram-negative organisms and streptococci, with the exception of Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. MIC 90 values of ciprofloxacin were as follows: for Enterobacteriaceae, 0.03-0.23 mg/l, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 0.37 mg/l, Haemophilus influenzae, less than 0.015 mg/l, Staphylococcus aureus, 0.75 mg/l, Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1.89 mg/l, and Streptococcus faecalis, 0.95 mg/l. The inhibitory quotients for urine, serum and bronchial secretion showed that ciprofloxacin had the broadest spectrum of all agents tested and covered and clinically significant bacteria.
TI  - Third-generation cephalosporins: a critical evaluation.
AB  - Six third-generation cephalosporins--cefotaxime, moxalactam, cefoperazone, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone, and cefmenoxime--are reviewed; covered are chemistry and structure-activity relationships, mechanism of action, spectra of activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical utility, adverse effects, and cost effectiveness. The third-generation cephalosporins have a similar mechanism of action to that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. None of the agents is particularly active against certain gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; the drugs are effective against gonococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. Several common gram-negative pathogens are susceptible to the third-generation cephalosporins, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus, and Morganella. About 50% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates are susceptible. Only moxalactam has good activity against Bacteriodes fragilis. The pharmacokinetic profiles of the six agents reveal some important differences. The half-life of ceftriaxone allows once-daily dosing in many patients; the half-lives of ceftizoxime and cefoperazone permit dosing every 8-12 hours. Cefoperazone and ceftriaxone are highly protein bound, but the clinical relevance of this is unknown. Generally, the agents penetrate most body tissues and fluids well. Moxalactam and cefotaxime and possibly ceftriaxone effectively penetrate into the cerebrospinal fluid well. The third-generation cephalosporins have become the accepted drugs of choice for the treatment of adult gram-negative bacillary meningitis; as more experience is gained, they are likely to become the drugs of first choice for neonatal (with ampicillin) and childhood (except for moxalactam) meningitis. Serious infections of Enterobacteriaceae can be treated with these agents, thereby avoiding use of the aminoglycosides. Moxalactam is comparable with combination therapy in treating intra-abdominal infections. Adverse effects associated with use of the third-generation cephalosporins are generally similar to those that occur with other beta-lactam antibiotics with the exception of coagulopathies and the disulfiram reaction seen with moxalactam and cefoperazone. Despite the relatively high cost of the third-generation cephalosporins, they are often cost effective because of their reduced dosing frequencies, broad spectra of activity, and effectiveness in serious infections for which more toxic antibiotics have been required in the past.
TI  - Multiple pulmonary complications in a patient with Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
AB  - Since first described in 1922, Stevens-Johnson syndrome has been associated frequently with pneumonia of many etiologies. This "mucosal respiratory syndrome," first reported by Stanyon and Warner in 1945, is associated with "early" pneumonia which resolves 2 to 3 weeks after onset of the rash. In our patient, pneumonia began 10 days after rash onset and was nearly resolved by day 20. The unique feature of this case was the onset of late pulmonary complications 25 days after the appearance of the exanthem, manifesting as acute noninfectious interstitial disease with superimposed airway obstruction.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1982)].
AB  - Two hundred seventy-six bacterial strains were isolated as possible causative pathogens mainly from sputum in 248 patients with lower respiratory tract infections at 12 medical institutions in various parts of Japan during the period from September 1982 to March 1983. Of these, 272 isolates including 28 Staphylococcus aureus strains, 38 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, 107 Haemophilus influenzae strains, 68 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 17 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 9 Escherichia coli strains and 5 strains of other species were tested in vitro for MICs of various antibiotics, and their drug sensitivity distributions determined. Data were also analyzed for distribution of cases by clinical entities, age and sex, interrelations between the types of infections and the species and frequency of isolation of organisms, and relations of the antimicrobial regimens at collection of clinical specimens to the species and frequency of isolation of the organisms. It engenders great interest that there was a significant increase in frequency of S. aureus isolation within 7 days after antibiotic therapy, compared to pretreatment isolation frequency, in the 1982 series. This seems to deserve further investigation in detail. The H. influenzae strains isolated with the highest frequency in 1981 and those in 1982 were examined as to susceptibility to several representative antibiotics, with interdrug comparisons: ABPC vs. SBPC, CTM vs. CMZ, and CMX vs. LMOX. The isolates demonstrated high degrees of susceptibility to these drugs and there was no conspicuous change in bacterial sensitivity to the drugs.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefodizime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefodizime (HR 221), a new  cephalosporin, were compared with those of other cephem antibiotics. HR 221 was highly active against Gram-negative bacteria. The compound inhibited growth of all tested Haemophilus influenzae strains at 0.10 microgram/ml and showed strong activity even against penicillin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains, but it was less effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa than the other antibiotics tested. Against Gram-positive bacteria, HR 221 showed 100% inhibition of growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.39 microgram/ml, and it was slightly less active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90:12.5 micrograms/ml) than other antibiotics such as cefotaxime (CTX). The bactericidal activity of HR 221 against E. coli was dose-related and comparable to that of CTX, cefoperazone and latamoxef. The bactericidal activity of the compound at medium concentrations simulating human serum levels was higher than that of CTX and cefmetazole, and no cell regrowth was noted after beta-lactamase-induced inactivation of the compound. HR 221 was stable to most drug-inactivating enzyme preparations from various bacterial species.
TI  - Interpretive criteria and tentative quality control limits for apalcillin disk susceptibility tests.
AB  - In vitro studies with 661 bacterial isolates were performed to establish interpretive criteria. In addition, a nine-laboratory study was performed to establish quality control limits for tests with 100-micrograms apalcillin disks and to confirm testing criteria for tests with 100-micrograms piperacillin disks. The two drugs were very similar, and nearly identical criteria were recommended for interpretation and for control of the two types of disks. Neither disk is recommended for testing Staphylococcus spp. or Haemophilus spp.; with other microorganisms, zone size limits of less than or equal to 13 mm (resistant) and greater than or equal to 18 mm (susceptible) are proposed for tests with 100-micrograms apalcillin disks.
TI  - Pyridinium 2-azo-p-dimethylaniline chromophore, a chromogenic reagent for beta-lactamase testing compared to nitrocefin.
AB  - Pyridinium-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline chromophore was evaluated as a test tube, filter paper and spectrophotometric assay for detection of beta-lactamases from gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Although useful for detection of TEM beta-lactamases in Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, it was a poor agent for detecting TEM, OXA and PSE enzymes in Enterobacteriaceae. It also proved poor for detecting cephalosporinases in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae, and penicillinases in Staphylococcus aureus when compared to nitrocefin. As a spectrophotometric substrate it was equivalent to nitrocefin and cephaloridine with various beta-lactamases.
TI  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of desacetylcefotaxime compared to other related beta-lactams.
AB  - Like all other cephalosporins that contain an acetyl side chain in the 3' position, cefotaxime (CTX) is partially desacetylated in vivo. Desacetylcefotaxime (des-CTX) possesses a broad antimicrobial spectrum and high beta-lactamase stability. With the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, Bacteroides fragilis, and Staphylococcus aureus, most strains of other species tested usually had mean MICs of des-CTX lower than 1 microgram/ml. Its activity is generally lower than that of the parent compound. It was only against some strains of P. cepacia that des-CTX surpassed the activity of CTX. The activity of des-CTX markedly exceeds the activity of many therapeutically used cephalosporins. This is especially true for Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, most species of Enterobacteriaceae, and streptococci other than Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - Current mechanisms of resistance to antimicrobial agents in microorganisms causing infection in the patient at risk for infection.
AB  - The mechanisms of resistance encountered in bacteria causing infection in the patient at risk for infection are diverse. Most resistance currently seen is the result of plasmid transfer rather than mutational events. However, extensive use of antimicrobial agents in the hospital has caused the selection of organisms resistant to many agents by virtue of chromosomally mediated mechanisms. Staphylococcus aureus resistant to beta-lactams due to altered penicillin-binding proteins has become a problem in certain patients such as narcotic addicts and chronic care facility patients exposed to many beta-lactam antibiotics. S. epidermidis has also proved to be a problem in patients with indwelling foreign devices, and altered penicillin-binding proteins also make these organisms resistant to available penicillins and cephalosporins. Streptococcus fecalis has become increasingly resistant to aminoglycosides, erythromycin, and tetracyclines due to plasmid-mediated enzymes. Hemophilus influenzae resistant to both penicillins and chloramphenicol by virtue of beta-lactamases and chloramphenicol transacetylase has been encountered. Beta-lactamase-mediated resistance of Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae to beta-lactam antibiotics has increased, and resistance of Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to aminoglycosides and penicillins is a widespread phenomenon. Mechanisms to reduce resistance will include not only careful attention to hygienic practices but also more appropriate use of antibiotics selecting the proper agent depending on the type of patient and environment in which the infection develops.
TI  - In vitro activity of fludalanine combined with pentizidone compared with those of other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of fludalanine ( MK641 ) combined with pentizidone ( MK642  ) so as to give a fludalanine /D-cycloserine ratio of 1:1 was compared with the activities of ampicillin, ticarcillin, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, and trimethoprim against 452 recent isolates and known beta-lactam- and trimethoprim-resistant strains. In addition, the in vitro activity of fludalanine - pentizidone on four different media, including a defined medium ( DFN -2), was studied. The MIC of fludalanine - pentizidone against 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Providencia stuartii, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus aureus, and fecal streptococci was 4 micrograms or less per ml on DFN -2, and activity was somewhat reduced on the other media. Proteus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (90% MIC, less than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml) and Bacteroides spp. (90% MIC, 16 micrograms/ml) were less susceptible. Generally, fludalanine - pentizidone was less active than ceftazidime and comparable in activity to cefuroxime. beta-Lactamase-producing and trimethoprim-resistant strains tended to be susceptible to fludalanine - pentidizone . In the absence of human serum, the MBC of fludalanine - pentizidone was similar to the MIC. In the presence of increasing concentrations of human serum, there tended to be a greater difference between the MIC and MBC.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dosage of cefmenoxime. Observation on the MICS and cefmenoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (CMX) was determined using agar dilution at  inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml against 333 clinical bacterial isolates. CMX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes and Haemophilus influenzae and also Streptococcus Pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MIC values in the range of 0.024 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. Against Staphylococci and Serratia marcescens, CMX showed the antimicrobial activity with MIC90 6.25 micrograms/ml. However, CMX was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter anitratus and exhibited no useful activity against Streptococcus faecalis. Reliability of CMX disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of the antimicrobial activity was also investigated, using 8 mm diameter disc (Showa) and 6 mm diameter disc (Wako), both of them containing 30 micrograms of CMX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, capable of utilizing CMX disc susceptibility test for the estimation of proper administrative dose of CMX. Using 6 mm diameter disc containing 30 micrograms CMX, FUCHS et al. have proposed the following tentative zone size break points: greater than or equal to 22 mm = MIC 8 micrograms/ml, susceptible; 15 to 21 mm = MIC 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (intermediate); and less than or equal to 14 mm = MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, resistant. In this investigation, the following zone size break points have preferred: greater than or equal to 25 mm = MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml (3+); 20 to 24 mm = MIC greater than 3 to 15 micrograms/ml (2+); 16 to 19 mm = MIC greater than 15 to 60 micrograms/ml (+) and less than or equal to 15 mm = MIC greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml (-). Based on CMX pharmacokinetic data currently available, MIC break points proposed, less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, would be useful for estimating the administrative dose of this antibiotic to obtain the effective blood level (e.g. the bacteriostatic activity in serum 1: greater than or equal to 8 for treatment of severe infection.
TI  - Selective media for the quantitation of bacteria in cystic fibrosis sputum.
AB  - We used selective media together with aerobic and anaerobic incubation for the quantitation of common pathogens in liquefied sputum from children with cystic fibrosis. The accuracy of the technique was verified by reconstruction studies in which laboratory strains with antibiotic-resistance markers were added to sputum from cystic fibrosis patients. Comparison of the numbers of bacteria found on quantitative culture of clinical specimens with the "predominant" organism found on routine culture yielded a poor correlation. When Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most prevalent on routine culture, it was present in the highest numbers on quantitative culture (mean count = 10(8) cfu/g). However, large numbers of Haemophilus influenzae (mean count = 10(7) cfu/g), Staphylococcus aureus (mean count = 2 X 10(6) cfu/g), and streptococci (mean count = 2 X 10(6) cfu/g) were also present in these cultures. When S. aureus was the predominant organism, H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa were also present in similar numbers (c. 10(7) cfu/g). When H. influenzae was the predominant species on routine culture, the mean count was 7 X 10(6) cfu/g and P. aeruginosa was often completely absent. We conclude that the selective technique permits reliable enumeration of sputum bacteria, and offers a more accurate assessment of the microbial flora of sputum in cystic fibrosis than does simple plating of unhomogenised sputum.
TI  - In-vitro activity of enoxacin (CL-919), a new quinoline derivative, compared with that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of enoxacin (CI-919), a new synthetic quinoline derivative  was compared with that of three other quinolines ofloxacin, norfloxacin and nalidixic acid. In addition beta-lactams and gentamicin were also included when appropriate. The MICs of enoxacin for 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Providencia stuartii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were less than 4 mg/l, for Haemophilus influenzae less than 0.25 mg/l and Neisseria gonorrhoeae less than 0.03 mg/l. Bacteroides fragilis and streptococci (including Streptococcus pneumoniae) were less susceptible, MIC90 16 mg/l. Against many of the common Enterobacteriaceae enoxacin displayed a similar degree of activity as gentamicin. Gentamicin-resistant strains of common bacterial pathogens were susceptible to enoxacin as were methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus. The protein binding of enoxacin (concentration 5 mg/l) was 18%.
TI  - Sputum bacteriology in patients with cystic fibrosis in a Toronto hospital during 1970-1981.
AB  
TI  - Clavulanic acid in combination with ticarcillin: an in-vitro comparison with other beta-lactams.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ticarcillin in combination with clavulanic acid was compared with that of ticarcillin alone, piperacillin, cefotaxime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 301 recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. An agar dilution procedure was used to determine MICs and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. MICs of the combination of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid were expressed as MICs of ticarcillin in the presence of 5 or 10 mg/l of clavulanic acid. Against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii and Serratia marcescens), ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid was as active as or more active than piperacillin. Against Staphylococcus aureus. Haemophilus influenzae and the Bacteroides fragilis group the combination was considerably more active than piperacillin. Piperacillin was more active than the ticarcillin/clavulanic acid combination against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Trends in the development of beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - In many ways it is ironic that the first description of a beta-lactamase occurred in 1940 with an enzyme isolated from Escherichia coli since in recent years there has been a major interest in Gram-negative species and the development of agents to overcome the hydrolytic action of beta-lactamases of Gram-negative species. There have been four distinctly different approaches to the development of new beta-lactam antibiotics. These have been the search for inhibitors of beta-lactamases and agents such as clavulanic acid and sulbactam are examples of compounds which by virtue of Kcat function act as suicide inhibitors and make old antibiotics new. There has been the modification of the penicillin and cephem nucleus to increase beta-lactamase stability or failing that to improve the ability of the compounds to pass through the cell wall and increase affinity for critical beta-lactam receptors, i.e. penicillin-binding proteins. There has been the development of carbapenem type of agents such as imipenem which would have broad activity including aerobic, anaerobic, Gram-positive and Gram-negative species. There has been the discovery of the monobactam agents of which aztreonam is an example of a compound with great beta-lactamase stability but with activity limited to Gram-negative aerobic species. Bacterial resistance has indeed been the major factor that has modified use of beta-lactams and influenced the development of the aforementioned types of drugs. The widespread presence of beta-lactamases in common pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides fragilis has made it necessary to have beta-lactamase stable compounds for initial therapy of infection. It is possible to analyze structure-activity relations of beta-lactam compounds to determine changes which will be most advantageous in light of known and expected resistance patterns. But the increased realization in recent years of the importance of the pharmacokinetics of beta-lactam drugs has made it essential that the development of new compounds be based on an integration of microbiological and pharmacokinetic parameters. Interest in the prevention of resistant flora has also affected the development of new drugs since it is increasingly appreciated that alteration of intestinal flora contributes to selection of drug resistant microorganisms. Finally, new toxicities or adverse effects associated with the use of certain new agents has modified the development of certain compounds.
TI  - Recognition and clinical significance of mechanisms of bacterial resistance to beta-lactams.
AB  - Resistance to beta-lactams may be difficult to recognize. This is due to the difficulty in detecting these resistances, when the routine tests performed in diagnostic laboratories are interpreted in the usual manner. Since failure to recognize this type of resistance may have serious consequences for the patient, it is essential that it be detected when present. For the detection of methicillin resistance of Staphylococcus aureus a standardized method using either a medium containing 5% NaCl or a low incubation temperature is advocated. Methicillin resistance of S. epidermidis can only be recognized reliably by means of a quantitative test and incubation for 42-48 h. Resistance of Haemophilus influenzae to ampicillin may be intrinsic or it may be caused by a TEM beta-lactamase; a beta-lactamase test should be used to detect the latter type of resistance. Inducible cephalosporinase may be responsible for the rapid development of resistance of some bacterial species to cefamandole, even during therapy. If a stable beta-lactamase production is attained by mutation, resistance to other beta-lactams will usually be present as well. Routine induction tests should be performed for all isolates of species of Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter and Proteus, indole-positive. The same type of 'hidden' resistance may be present in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with regard to cefotaxime and other third-generation cephalosporins. Beta-lactamase-positive Neisseria gonorrhoeae can easily be recognized by a beta-lactamase test. In addition, the results of diffusion tests allow one to distinguish between beta-lactamase-positive and beta-lactamase-negative strains. Recognition of those strains of N. gonorrhoeae having a decreased susceptibility to penicillin is only possible when well-standardized quantitative tests are used.
TI  - The use of beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of septicaemia and endocarditis.
AB  - Despite the availability of numerous beta-lactam antibiotics, benzylpenicillin remains the most important beta-lactam antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis. Penicillin alone and in combination with an aminoglycoside is effective in the treatment of endocarditis due to all streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus aprophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Listeria monocytogenes. Oral phenoxymethylpenicillin in combination with streptomycin is effective in treating endocarditis due to viridans streptococci. Ampicillin is effective in endocarditis due to Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, H. paraphrophilus, Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli. Oral amoxicillin with gentamicin has been used to treat enterococcal endocarditis. The penicillinase-resistant penicillins are effective in treating S. aureus endocarditis. Carbenicillin or ticarcillin in combination with tobramycin or gentamicin are used to treat endocarditis due to Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The use of piperacillin in combination with tobramycin against P. aeruginosa endocarditis has been associated with failure and increased resistance. The cephalosporins have been used to treat endocarditis caused by susceptible organisms. There have been few data on the efficacy of the newer cephalosporins in treating endocarditis. They have been used to treat septicaemia due to susceptible organisms with good results.
TI  - Antibacterial monoclonal antibodies and the dawn of a new era in the control of infection.
AB  - Literature reports concerned with monoclonal antibodies against bacteria, or their toxins, which are pathogens for man and animals were surveyed. These antibodies have important potential uses in human and veterinary pathology and medicine. They are likely to become key elements in a fast progression toward a more complete understanding and control of infectious diseases and of toxin poisoning. A new area of bacteriology relevant to sanitary engineering is also being advanced with the help of antibacterial monoclonal antibodies. This area involves bacteria that produce the biofuel methane, along with other molecules of nutritional value, through a process which brings about the recycling of organic wastes and thereby limits or controls microbial contamination of soil and water.
TI  - [Etiology of the inflammatory process in chronic pneumonia and mucoviscidosis in  children].

TI  - Multicenter clinical trials of cefoperazone in Japan.
AB  - The safety and clinical efficacy of cefoperazone were evaluated at 149 institutions in Japan. A total of 979 hospitalized patients were treated with cefoperazone alone for 1,059 infections. In the 984 infections evaluated, there was an overall satisfactory clinical response in 824 (83.7%). Cefoperazone was effective in 83.0% of the respiratory tract infections, 84.9% of urinary tract infections, and 89.6% of hepatobiliary tract infections. Clinical response was satisfactory in 90% or more of the cases in which Escherichia coli, Serratia sp, Haemophilus influenzae or Staphylococcus sp were isolated. Sixty percent to 90% of the infections with Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Proteus sp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa responded satisfactorily to cefoperazone. Cefoperazone was effective in 76.2% of 260 evaluated cases that had failed to respond to prior treatment with other cephalosporins. The adverse reactions that occurred in 19 (1.9%) of the 979 patients included rash (1%), diarrhea (0.6%), and fever (0.4%). Cefoperazone appears to be extremely useful in the treatment of various infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Asian multicenter trial of cefoperazone in respiratory tract infection.
AB  - The safety and clinical efficacy of cefoperazone were evaluated in a multicenter  trial conducted at institutions in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. Cefoperazone was given as the sole antibiotic for 481 respiratory tract infections in 476 patients. An overall satisfactory clinical response was achieved in 73.7% of patients. Cefoperazone was effective in 78.9% of cases of pneumonia, 81.1% of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and 69.4% of bronchiectasis with infection. A satisfactory bacteriological effect was obtained in 93.2% of cases in which Haemophilus influenzae was isolated, 70.2% of Klebsiella infections, and 84.6% of infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Although the eradication rate was only 38.6% in patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the success rate increases to 59.1% if patients showing a decrease in the number of organisms are included. Cefoperazone was effective in 63.5% of the 148 cases that had failed to respond to treatment with other antibiotics. Adverse reactions occurred in 8.0% of patients and consisted primarily of rash, diarrhea, and fever. Cefoperazone appears to be an extremely useful injectable antibiotic for the treatment of respiratory tract infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of ceftriaxone.
AB  - Seventy-seven patients with acute bacterial infections were treated with ceftriaxone (1 gm administered intravenously every 12 hours). The 58 patients evaluable for efficacy had 60 infections, including 39 of the respiratory tract, 14 of the urinary tract, and seven of soft tissue. Five patients were bacteremic. The mean duration of ceftriaxone treatment was eight days for patients with respiratory and urinary tract infections and 13 days for patients with other types of infections. A satisfactory clinical response occurred in 56 (93%) of the infections. Eighty-four (94%) of the 89 pretherapy pathogens were bacteriologically eradicated. Included were all 19 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, all 15 of Streptococcus pneumoniae, all 12 of Escherichia coli, 22 of the 23 isolates of other Enterobacteriaceae species, three of five isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and three of four isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. Two cases of superinfection (one with bacteremia) occurred with P aeruginosa. There were two cases each of reinfection and colonization with Streptococcus faecalis. One patient developed manifestations of culture-documented S pneumoniae meningitis eight hours after the first dose was administered. Peak and trough plasma levels of ceftriaxone were 142 and 64 micrograms/ml. Ceftriaxone achieved therapeutic levels in infected cerebrospinal fluid and in the abscess fluid of selected patients. Adverse effects, which were mild, included diarrhea in 4% of the patients and elevated transaminase levels in 10%.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activity of FCE 22101, a new penem, with those of other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FCE 22101, a new semisynthetic penem derivative, was compared with that of ceftriaxone, moxalactam, imipenem (formerly imipemide, N-formimidoyl thienamycin, or MK 0787), cefuroxime, ceftazidime, and other beta-lactams, when appropriate, against 472 recent isolates and known beta-lactam-resistant strains. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of FCE 22101 against 90% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Lancefield group D streptococci, and Bacteroides spp. were between 0.5 and 4 micrograms/ml. Methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible. Ninety percent of the Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were susceptible to 0.25 microgram of FCE 22101 per ml. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to FCE 22101 (minimum inhibitory concentration, greater than 128 micrograms/ml). The susceptibility of known, characterized beta-lactamase-producing strains of the Enterobacteriaceae suggested that FCE 22101 is resistant to many beta-lactamases. Generally, FCE 22101 was slightly less active than imipenem, moxalactam, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime against members of the Enterobacteriaceae and considerably more active than the cephalosporins (including moxalactam) against Staphylococcus aureus. The human serum protein binding of FCE 22101 was about 40%, and human serum had little effect on the activity.
TI  - Ceftriaxone: a summary of in vitro antibacterial qualities including recommendations for susceptibility tests with 30-micrograms disks.
AB  - The new aminothiazoyl-cephalosporin, ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), was found to have  excellent inhibitory activity against the Enterobacteriaceae (minimum inhibitory concentration needed to inhibit 50% of isolates (MIC50) less than or equal to 0.004-0.5 microgram/ml, Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50 less than or equal to 0.004 micrograms/ml), Neisseria species (MIC50 less than or equal to 0.001 microgram/ml), pneumococci (MIC50 0.25 micrograms/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC50 2.0 micrograms/ml), and Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC50 0.015 micrograms/ml). Ceftriaxone was less effective against Acinetobacter species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other Pseudomonas species (MIC50 8.0-16 micrograms/ml). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus and enterococci were not significantly inhibited by ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone was very resistant to beta-lactamase hydrolysis, although the type IV cephalosporinase minimally destroyed the compound at 16.4-19.9% of the rates for cephaloridine. Type I cephalosporinases were inhibited by ceftriaxone and related enzyme-stable cephalosporins. Based on analysis of disk-MIC regression statistics, tentative recommendations for the disk test of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards are 21 mm or more = susceptible, 14-20 mm = moderately susceptible, and 13 mm or less = resistant. These criteria produce interpretive accuracy of more than 92%, with very rare major errors. Ceftriaxone was comparable to cefotaxime in spectrum and activity, thus allowing the use of the "spectrum-class" concept (for example, cefotaxime tests in vitro to predict ceftriaxone susceptibility, and vice versa).
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1981)].
AB  - During the period from September 1981 to March 1982, 363 bacterial isolates were  obtained as possible pathogens from 311 patients with lower respiratory tract infections at 12 medical institutions in Japan. Of these clinical isolates, mostly from the sputum, a total of 231 isolates including 19 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 33 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 90 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 65 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 17 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 7 strains of Escherichia coli were tested in vitro for minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 17 antimicrobial agents, and their antimicrobial susceptibility distribution and cumulative percentages of inhibited isolates by increasing concentrations of drugs were determined. The data were further analyzed to investigate the interrelation between such parameters as the age-distribution of patients by diseases of the respiratory system, sex and types of infection and the species and frequency of isolation of the organisms, and also the relationship between the antimicrobial chemotherapy prior to collection of clinical specimens and the species and incidence of the bacterial isolates. In respiratory infections, it is frequently that chemotherapy should be instituted with an appropriate drug even before the causative organism can be identified and assessed for its antimicrobial susceptibility. The present data may provide valuable informations in selecting appropriate drugs in practical, clinical use.
TI  - Pathogenicity of encapsulated Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  - The pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus (BM) group and four clinical isolates of B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (SC) or intraperitoneal abscesses. Only 11 isolates of BM group and one B. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). When the other 23 isolates, however, were injected SC in combination with either Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. The Bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. Capsules also formed in Bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of K. pneumoniae or encapsulated Bacteroides sp. Once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, natural peptide antibiotics of rabbit lung macrophages.
AB  - Microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, peptides derived from rabbit lung macrophages, were tested for bactericidal activity against various bacterial species. Both were highly active against diverse gram-positive and gram-negative organisms under conditions of near-neutral pH (between 7 and 8) and relatively low ionic strength. Susceptible species included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. Streptococcus agalactiae, type 1A, was less susceptible than the aforementioned organisms or S. agalactiae, type 3. Bordetella bronchiseptica, a common commensal and pathogen of the rabbit respiratory tract, was completely resistant to both peptides.
TI  - Rapid diagnosis of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.
AB  - Rapid identification of pathogens in patients with bacterial pneumonia is important for optimal antimicrobial therapy. Coagglutination was compared with counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) for sensitivity and specificity in the detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa antigens in sputum specimens of 101 patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Coagglutination detected the appropriate bacterial antigen in 16 of 17 (94%) definite etiology patients and CIE detected 11 (64%). In 17 probable etiology patients, bacterial antigens were detected by coagglutination in 15 (88%) and by CIE in 7 (41%). Only 1 pathogen was falsely identified in the 19 culture-negative control patients, indicating a high degree of specificity for both tests. Coagglutination was more sensitive than CIE (p less than 0.05) or sputum stained with Gram's stain (p less than 0.05) in correctly identifying the putative pathogen in sputum. Our results strongly suggest that coagglutination is a useful diagnostic technique for establishing a rapid etiologic diagnosis in community-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - Third-generation and investigational cephalosporins: II. Microbiologic review and clinical summaries.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility of Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Hemophilus influenzae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Neisseria gonorrhea to three new second-generation and eight third-generation cephalosporins is tabulated. In general, the newer cephalosporins have an extended spectrum of activity against gram-negative bacteria, including Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria gonorrhea. They also tend to be active against anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis. However, they generally have less activity against gram-positive bacteria when compared with the first- and second-generation cephalosporins. Clinical summaries are given for each of the cephalosporins, with emphasis on the results of comparative clinical trials. These cephalosporins may prove especially useful in nosocomial infections with resistant organisms, intraabdominal infections, febrile episodes in the granulocytopenic patient, and meningitis.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates in pediatrics to cefpiramide].
AB  - Cefpiramide (CPM, SM-1652) had broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against most of clinically isolated organisms to which are paid attention as pathogenic organism in the field of pediatrics. Antibacterial activities of CPM against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis and Proteus mirabilis were almost the same as those of cefoperazone (CPZ). Antibacterial activities of CPM against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were somewhat weaker than those of CPZ, but antibacterial activity of CPM against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was rather stronger than that of CPZ and almost the same as that of cefsulodin. Antibacterial activity of CPM has a tendency to decrease in beta-lactamase (PCase type) producing S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, H. Influenzae, etc. It is suggestive that the determination of not only the antibacterial activity of CPM against pathogenic organisms but also the beta-lactamase producing activity of them is important on the occasion of clinical use of CPM.
TI  - Is treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis with intramuscular mezlocillin justifiable?
AB  - A group of patients admitted to hospital with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis was treated with two daily injections of 1 or 2 g mezlocillin intramuscularly for ten days, 19 patients receiving 1 g and 17 the 2 g doses. Serum and sputum mezlocillin concentrations were measured microbiologically on the first treatment day. The peak serum levels averaged 23 mg/l after 1 g and 34 mg/l after 2 g, and the corresponding average sputum peak concentrations were 0.78 and 1.26 mg/l respectively. Fourteen of the 36 patients had infections associated with beta-lactamase-producing bacteria and nine of the positive cultures on the last treatment day also showed beta-lactamase producers to be present. Most of the MICs for the sensitive bacteria were of the order of 2-4 mg/l, but the MICs for the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were greater than 16 mg/l. Mezlocillin was relatively inactive against many of the common respiratory pathogens--even when these were not beta-lactamase producers--by virtue of poor penetration.
TI  - Experience with ceftazidime in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Twelve adults and children with cystic fibrosis received a total of 17 courses of ceftazidime for the treatment of an acute exacerbation of respiratory tract infection. In 6 cases ceftazidime was given as the sole antibiotic. All patients who were clinically assessable were considered to be cured of the acute infection, or improved. Bacteriologically all initial sputum specimens contained Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In 13 instances the organism disappeared during treatment, while in the other 4 the organism remained although the patients improved clinically. Additional organisms, usually Staphylococcus aureus or Haemophilus influenzae, were present in 7 instances. One patient suffered from nausea, palpitations and local skin inflammation on injection whilst being treated with ceftazidime, but the relationship between these adverse effects and ceftazidime was uncertain. The patient tolerated these effects without discontinuation of the drug.
TI  - Evaluation of ceftazidime in the treatment of severe bacterial infection.
AB  - We investigated the clinical efficiency and safety of ceftazidime for treatment of 33 episodes of infection in 30 patients (17 males and 13 females), whose ages ranged from 9 to 92 years (mean 52.5). Fourteen patients had ultimately fatal disease and the remaining 16 had non-fatal diseases. The clinical condition of patients at the beginning of treatment was critical or poor in 16 cases. Episodes of infection treated were: 24 urinary tract infections (eight of them with concomitant bacteraemia), seven wound infections (one with concomitant bacteraemia and three with osteomyelitis), and two episodes of pneumonia. Twenty-nine episodes of infection were monomicrobial and the four remaining ones were polymicrobial. Significant organisms isolated were all aerobic or facultatively anaerobic Gram-negative rods and were responsible for the following episodes of infection: Escherichia coli (14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), Pseudomonas cepacia (1), Proteus mirabilis (5), Serratia marcescens (2), Klebsiella (2), Enterobacter aerogenes (1) and Haemophilus influenzae (1). Total dosage of ceftazidime ranged from 28 to 240 g (mean 82.4 g), and mean duration of therapy was 17 days (range 8 to 44 days). The overall rate of clinical response to ceftazidime was 91%. Local and general tolerance to the drug was excellent. Enterococcal and/or candida colonization occurred in 12 episodes (36%) and superinfections by the same micro-organisms occurred in three episodes. Ceftazidime seems to be an effective and safe single agent for therapy of many bacterial infections, including those caused by Ps. aeruginosa.
TI  - Alternative antibiotics for the treatment of Pseudomonas infections in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - We have investigated the effectiveness of seven new beta-lactam antibiotics, azlocillin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefsulodin, cefoperazone, latamoxef (moxalactam), and cefotaxime, against acute pulmonary exacerbations caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis. Three hundred and fifty-five strains of Ps aeruginosa isolated from 310 sputum cultures (190 cystic fibrosis patients) were tested for susceptibility to the drugs by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC). The highest activity was shown by ceftazidime (6% resistant strains) followed by cefsulodin and piperacillin (15 and 16% resistant strains); very low activity was found for cefotaxime and latamoxef (moxalactam). Ceftazidime was the most active drug against 32 pseudomonas isolates that were resistant to both carbenicillin and aminoglycosides (78% susceptible). A randomized, double-blind trial of azlocillin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefsulodin or cefoperazone was performed in 111 cystic fibrosis patients with predominant and susceptible pseudomonas in their sputum. Results were evaluated by a clinical, radiological and bacteriological scoring system: the best results were obtained with ceftazidime, followed by cefsulodin and piperacillin. However, pseudomonas was eradicated in only 22 (23%) of the cases with the most active drugs and persisted or reappeared in all the cases 1 to 3 months later. Ceftazidime always eradicated Staph. aureus and Haemophilus influenzae associated with pseudomonas. Similar eradication occurred nearly always with cefsulodin but rarely with the other drugs. No serious drug reaction occurred but a later fever and rash with piperacillin, transient diarrhoea with cefoperazone, vomiting with cefsulodin, and very frequent eosinophilia with ceftazidime should be mentioned. These five drugs offer, in varying degree, alternatives to traditional anti pseudomonas antibiotics in cystic fibrosis pulmonary infections, but they should be used only against well-proven resistant strains. Ceftazidime is best and cefotaxime and latamoxef (moxalactam) least useful.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the BACTEC resin-containing blood culture bottle.
AB  - The BACTEC resin-containing blood culture bottle (16B; Johnston Laboratories) was designed to bind antibiotics and to support bacterial growth. However, only modest increases in the recovery rates of pathogens have been found in clinical studies. This in vitro study evaluated the ability of the 16B to recover organisms from human serum containing clinically achievable concentrations of antibiotics. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, and a viridans streptococcus were added to serum containing antibiotic(s), and at various time intervals of antibiotic exposure, portions were removed and inoculated into both the 16B and the 6B (conventional aerobic) bottles. The studies of the kinetics of killing of the bacterial strains by the various antibiotics showed a good correlation between those combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which produced slow killing and the combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which were recovered preferentially in the 16B bottles. Low recovery rates were noted when the antibiotics killed the organisms rapidly. The indications for use of the resin-containing blood culture bottle should be limited to those situations in which the patient is receiving antibiotics and the bacteremia is suspected to involve a pathogen which is killed slowly by the administered drug(s) or when the bacteremia is continuous. The failure of the BACTEC 16B blood culture bottle to recover organisms may in part reflect the bactericidal activity of the antibiotics administered.
TI  - Pneumatocele in infants and children. Report of 12 cases.
AB  - Pneumatoceles were found in 2.4 per cent of 493 infants and children with pneumonia. In all cases, attempts were made to establish the etiology by means of blood cultures and of deep tracheal aspirations or pleural punctures, when indicated. A definite cause was established in 9 of 12 cases. Seven were due to infection: in two Hemophilus influenzae was involved; two others were due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were each isolated in one case. Two pneumatoceles were seen following kerosene ingestion. A coagulase negative staphylococcus isolated only on blood culture in one other child may have been related to the illness. Two patients experienced spontaneous pneumothorax and died of progressive respiratory failure due to enlargement of the pneumatocele, but all the other patients recovered without complication. Pneumatoceles in childhood can result from a variety of bacterologic infections as well as from kerosene ingestion.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin in vitro.
AB  - Fosfomycin is a new bactericidal broad-spectrum antibiotic. In this study the minimum inhibiting concentration (MIC) was determined for 745 recent clinical isolates. Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, group A and B streptococci Streptococcus faecalis and pneumoniae as well as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and Haemophilus influenzae were very sensitive to the new drug with essentially all strains inhibited at 64 mg/l or less. Klebsiella, Enterobacter, indole-positive proteus and Pseudomonas-aeruginosa were less sensitive with 96, 42, 66 and 58% inhibited at 64 mg/l of fosfomycin. Bacteroides fragilis was resistant.
TI  - Naturally occurring antibodies in human sera that react with Haemophilus influenzae type b ribosomal vaccine.
AB  - Sera from populations of normal adults and children as well as sera from children with systemic Haemophilus influenzae type b disease were tested for antibodies reacting with ribosomes from H. influenzae type b. Adults generally had high titers of antibody, with 90% having titers greater than 1:64. The distribution of titers approximated a normal curve. Among normal children, there was more variability between individual titers, with the median titers ranging between 1:64 and 1:128. In contrast, acute-phase sera from children with systemic H. influenzae type b disease all had titers of 1:16 or less. Two convalescent-phase sera had high titers. Absorption experiments ruled out cross-reaction between ribosomes and type b capsular material. Ribosomes from two unrelated type b strains were completely cross-reactive, whereas absorption with ribosomes from a type c strain led to significantly decreased titers in three of four sera. Absorption of sera with ribosomes from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae also decreased titers, indicating that these antibodies may have been induced by ribosomes of other bacteria.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial properties of AT-2266, a new pyridonecarboxylic acid.
AB  - AT-2266, 1-ethyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-(1-piperazinyl)-1,8-naphthyridine-3 -carboxylic acid, is a new pyridonecarboxylic acid derivative with broad and potent antibacterial activity. It inhibited some gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococci and Bacillus subtilis, and most gram-negative bacteria, including Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Campylobacter jejuni, at concentrations of 0.1 to 0.78 microgram/ml, and most gram-positive bacteria, glucose-nonfermenters, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae at concentrations of 1.56 to 12.5 micrograms/ml. Most of the clinical isolates tested were as susceptible to AT-2266 as were laboratory strains. The antibacterial potency of AT-2266 was higher than those of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid and similar to that of norfloxacin. AT-2266 was not cross-resistant with antibiotics and inhibited most highly nalidixic acid-resistant bacteria at concentrations of 1.56 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. Its activity was barely affected by the addition of horse serum or sodium cholate but weakened by lowering the medium pH or increasing the inoculum size. AT-2266 was bactericidal at concentrations near its minimal inhibitory concentrations. Frequencies of mutants resistant to 10 micrograms of AT-2266 per ml were lower than 4.0 x 10(-9).
TI  - Meningitis--a complication of spinal anesthesia.
AB  - During a five-year period, 17 of 1429 patients admitted with meningitis had had recent spinal anesthesia in Cairo, Egypt. Ten of the 17 had positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures: 8 were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 was Staphylococcus aureus, and 1 was Streptococcus mitis. These organisms were not cultured from patients who had not had spinal anesthesia. Two patients with negative cultures had lumbar spine x-ray changes consistent with tuberculosis. Antibiotic therapy was based upon the sensitivity of cultured organisms. Four of the 17 patients died. These data strongly suggest that meningitis in patients with recent spinal anesthesia is commonly due to unusual or nosocomial organisms. Aggressive, meticulous bacteriologic evaluation of these patients is essential.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - The alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains of Serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. However, strans of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. The mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.
TI  - [In vitro bacteriostatic activity of cefmenoxime (SCE 1365), cefotaxime and moxalactam].
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (SCE 1365), a new cephalosporin derivate was compared with two other "third generation" cephalosporins: cefotaxime and moxalactam. Cefmenoxime as cefotaxime and moxalactam were very active against 305 cephalosporinase-producing and cephalosporinase-non-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Cefmenoxime was the most active against Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii, Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia enterocolitica with a mean MIC at least twice lower. Several strains of the species Hafnia alvei, Providencia stuartii and Proteus vulgaris were more resistant. Against Haemophilus influenzae, the activity of the three cephalosporins was higher with a mean MIC between 0,030 and 0,040 microgram/ml. Against carbenicillin-sensible or carpenicillin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, the three cephalosporins were not performant. Against Staphylococcus aureus, cefmenoxime and cefotaxime had an identical activity with a mean MIC of 1,5 microgram/ml against methicillin-sensible strains and a mean MIC of 5,5 micrograms/ml against methicillin-resistant strains.
TI  - In vitro activity of CI-919 (AT-2266), an oral antipseudomonal compound.
AB  - We tested CI-919 (AT-2266), a nalidixic acid analog, against 555 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, using microbroth or agar dilution methods. The activity of CI-919 was compared with those of cephalosporins, tobramycin, ticarcillin, dicloxacillin, rifampin, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of CI-919 for 90% of isolates were (in micrograms per milliliter): Pseudomonas spp. (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa), 4.0; Enterobacteriaceae, 0.5; Staphylococcus spp., 2.0; Haemophilus influenzae, 0.12; Campylobacter jejuni, 0.12; and enterococci, 16. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of CI-919 for 90% of 82 tobramycin-resistant, gram-negative strains was 4.0 micrograms/ml. CI-919 was bactericidal for most isolates, showing no cross-resistance with unrelated antimicrobial agents, and was stable for 11 weeks at temperatures ranging from 22 to -70 degrees C. Inoculum size and media pH had little effect on the antibacterial activity of CI-919 for nine strains tested. CI-919 may be useful as an oral antibiotic for the treatment of infections due to diverse bacteria, including P. aeruginosa.
TI  - N-formimidoyl thienamycin: in vitro comparison with cefoxitin and tobramycin against clinical, bacterial isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the novel beta-lactam antibiotic, N-formimidoyl thienamycin (N-f thienamycin) has been compared with those of cefoxitin and tobramycin. An agar dilution method was employed. N-f thienamycin was active against all Enterobacteriaceae isolates (MIC less than or equal to 4 mg/l). All Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 2 mg/l. N-f thienamycin was also active against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (96 per cent inhibited by 0.5 mg/l) and Gram-positive cocci. All enterococci were inhibited by 2 mg/l. The drug was active against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC less than or equal to 1 mg/l) and the Bacteroides fragilis group (MIC less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l). Cefoxitin was inactive against most Enterobacter and A. calcoaceticus isolates and all P. aeruginosa and enterococcal isolates. Tobramycin was virtually inactive against Gram-positive cocci other than Staphylococcus aureus. N-f thienamycin thus has a broad spectrum of in vitro activity, greater than that of cefoxitin and tobramycin, and may therefore be useful in the treatment of serious infection, particularly when the aetiology is unknown.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of temocillin (BRL 17421), a new penicillin.
AB  - The activity in vitro of the new parenteral penicillin, temocillin, was determined by an agar dilution technique at two inocula against 201 recent clinical isolates and also against reference strains that produced characterized beta-lactamases. Ampicillin, ticarcillin, latamoxef (moxalactam) and cefoxitin were used as comparative agents. Temocillin showed no useful activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa or the Bacteroides fragilis group but was highly active against the Enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting all isolates (Serratia marcescens excepted) at less than or equal to 8 mg/l. The MIC50 and MIC90 were usually within one dilution and results with both inoculum sizes were similar. Temocillin also had good activity against Haemophilus influenzae and beta-lactamase producing strains were as susceptible as non-beta-lactamase producers. Neither for the Enterobacteriaceae nor for H. influenzae did a 1000-fold increase in inoculum result in a greater than two-fold increase in MIC. The above results implied excellent stability to beta-lactamases and this was borne out by the activity of temocillin against strains containing chromosomal cephalosporinases, the 'broad-spectrum' Class IV enzyme and the plasmid mediated enzymes TEM-1, OXA-1 and SHV-1. The protein binding of temocillin was found to be 87%.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies of T-1982 (cefbuperazone) in pediatric infectious diseases].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies were carried out with T-1982 (cefbuperazone) in pediatric infectious diseases. Results were as follows. 1. The average serum concentrations of T-1982 following intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg were 35.3, 64.7 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes, 25.5, 41.5 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 12.4, 21.8 micrograms/ml at 2 hours, respectively. Dose-response was observed. Urinary recovery rates of T-1982 during 6 hours after injection of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg were 57.3% and 73.6%, respectively. 2. The antibacterial activity of T-1982 against clinically isolated organisms was determined. T-1982 was more active than cefazolin and cefmetazole against K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and E. coli. It was also effective against ampicillin-resistant E. coli. 3. Thirty-seven patients received daily 30-69 mg/kg of T-1982 t.i.d. for 5-9 days. The rate of satisfactory clinical response was 91.9%. 4. Side effects were diarrhea in 4 cases, diarrhea and rash in 1 case and slight elevation of GOT and GPT in 1 case. But these were transient and mild.
TI  - In vitro activity of Bay 09867, a new quinoline derivative, compared with those of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Bay 09867, a new quinoline derivative, was compared with those of norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, ceftazidime, cefaclor, cefuroxime, gentamicin, and other antimicrobial agents, when appropriate, against 410 recent clinical isolates. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of Bay 09867 for 90% of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacteroides fragilis strains were between 0.008 and 2 micrograms/ml. Bay 09867 was considerably more active against the gram-negative bacteria tested than were other agents tested. Gentamicin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were highly susceptible to Bay 09867. Strains less susceptible to nalidixic acid and norfloxacin tended to be less susceptible to Bay 09867. The protein binding of Bay 09867 was about 20%.
TI  - Discrepancies between in vitro activity of and in vivo response to antimicrobial  agents.
AB  - The correlation between in vitro antimicrobial activity and the in vivo response  to antimicrobial therapy is affected by multiple host factors, the site and nature of the infection, and the pharmacokinetics of the antimicrobial and its penetration into areas of infection. In certain instances, discrepancies are also caused by methodologically-related variables of in vitro susceptibility tests. Examples of discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo response to antimicrobial are discussed.
TI  - Multicentered clinical evaluation of cefoperazone for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Adult patients with bacterial infections of the lower respiratory tract were given either cefoperazone or cefamandole in a multicenter clinical study of the clinical and bacteriologic efficacy of cefoperazone. Clinical diagnoses included pneumonia, bronchitis, lung abscess, and bronchiectasis. Efficacy was evaluated in 119 patients given cefoperazone and 73 patients given cefamandole. Major pathogens isolated included Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Satisfactory clinical responses were noted for 96% of the patients in both treatment groups, including 14 of 17 patients given cefoperazone who were primarily infected with P. aeruginosa. Satisfactory bacteriologic responses were noted for 88% of the group given cefoperazone and 89% of the group given cefamandole. Adverse reactions related to the antibiotic occurred infrequently in each treatment group. The results of this study indicate that cefoperazone is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections due to S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, and many gram-negative bacilli, including susceptible strains of P. aeruginosa, in adult patients.
TI  - Transtracheal aspiration in pulmonary infection in children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Six transtracheal aspirations (TTA) and expectorated sputum specimens were collected from four children suffering from cystic fibrosis who had pulmonary infection. Specimens obtained from both sites were cultured for aerobic bacteria and TTA aspirates were also cultured for anaerobes. Differences in bacteria isolated in TTA and sputum aspirates were present in all instances. Six isolates were recovered in both sites (three Pseudomonas aeruginosa, two Staphylococcus aureus and one Aspergillus flavus). Five aerobic isolates were recovered only in the expectorated sputum and not in TTA aspirations (two Klebsiella pneumoniae and one each of P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis). Nine organisms were isolated only from the TTA (two each of Veillonella parvula and Alpha hemolytic streptococci, and one each of Bacteroides fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, Lactobacillus sp., Haemophilus influenzae and Gamma hemolytic streptococci). The recovery of anaerobic organisms from four of the six TTA specimens suggests a possible role for these organisms in the etiology of pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis. We found TTA to be helpful in the bacterial diagnosis and management of pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis.
TI  - The efficacy of cefuroxime in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in infants and children.
AB  - Forty-eight infants and children with bacterial meningitis received daily dosages of cefuroxime ranging from 90 to 300 mg/kg during the first two to four days of treatment and 45 to 149 mg/kg during the subsequent six to eight days of treatment. Cefuroxime was clinically and bacteriologically effective in 40 (83%) of the patients. All strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Salmonella typhi were sensitive to cefuroxime. Fourteen strains of Haemophilus influenzae were sensitive, and one was moderately sensitive, to the drug. Nine strains of Staphylococcus aureus were sensitive to cefuroxime, but three were resistant, as was Pseudomonas aeruginosa. No toxicity was encountered.
TI  - Cefotetan: in-vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility to beta-lactamases.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefotetan was assessed against recent clinical isolates of common bacteria and also against reference strains that produced known beta-lactamases. The compound was active against most staphylococci (MICs 4 to 8 mg/l) though methicillin-resistant strains were less sensitive. It was also generally active against streptococci (MICs mostly in the range 1 to 16 mg/l). However, enterococci and penicillin-resistant pneumococci were resistant. Cefotetan was highly active against enterobacteria, with 75% of isolates inhibited by 0.5 mg/l and 90% inhibited by 4 mg/l. It was also highly active against Haemophilus influenzae (MICs 0.5 to 4 mg/l) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MICs 0.06 to 2 mg/l) but had relatively poor activity against Acinetobacter spp. (MICs mostly 4 to 128 mg/l). Cefotetan had little useful activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MICs 16 to 512 mg/l) but was more active against most other pseudomonads. Cefotetan had moderate activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group (MICs mostly less than or equal to 32 mg/l), though Bact. fragilis sensu stricto and Bact. vulgatus were more sensitive (MICs usually less than or equal to 4 mg/l). It was more active against most other anaerobes, though its activity was always exceeded by that of ampicillin. Cefotetan possessed a high degree of resistance to both plasmid-mediated and chromosomally-determined beta-lactamases.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial activity of cefotetan.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of cefotetan, a recently developed cephamycin, was investigated under various experimental conditions. The compound showed moderate activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis, but a high activity against Enterobacteriaceae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. Haemophilus influenzae also was fairly susceptible. The MBC was usually equal to or two- or fourfold higher than MIC. Medium composition, pH and inoculum size had minimal influence on its activity. About 50% of recent clinical isolates of Bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to cefotetan, but some were highly resistant. Killing curves of cefotetan against different bacterial strains indicated that it was rapidly bactericidal at concentrations equal to MIC or two- to fourfold higher. However, some strains showed regrowth after initial inhibition. Combination of cefotetan with aminoglycosides, or with cefazolin, cefotaxime, moxalactam or piperacillin resulted either in synergy, addition or indifference according to the bacterial strain and the nature of the combination. Antagonism was never observed. Human serum protein binding varied from 75 to 86% according to the assay method. Binding with horse serum protein was about 28%.
TI  - [Bacteriological studies of the sputum by qualitative and quantitative methods in chronic bronchitis].
AB  
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the cephamycin cefotetan: an in-vitro comparison with other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The cephamycin, cefotetan, was compared with other beta-lactam antibiotics including the monocyclic beta-lactam, azthreonam, against a total of 277 recent clinical isolates. Cefotetan had activity comparable to moxalactam against Staphylococcus aureus and against the Enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting all isolates except for Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter spp. at less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l. Cefotetan was active against beta-lactamase producing and non-beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 1 mg/l); was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 greater than 128 mg/l); and was eightfold less active than cefoxitin against the Bacteroides fragilis group. Azthreonam was as active as moxalactam against the Enterobacteriaceae and was more active than moxalactam against Ps. aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of isolates at less than or equal to 8 mg/l, but was inactive against the Bact. fragilis group (MIC90 greater than 128 mg/l) and against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90 greater than 128 mg/l).
TI  - Laboratory evaluation of cefmenoxime: a new cephalosporin. In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities and pharmacokinetic properties.
AB  - Cefmenoxime is a new syn-methoxyimino cephalosporin antibiotic derived from cefotiam, which has been proved to be a very effective and useful antibiotic for the treatment of respiratory infections. This bacteriological and pharmacokinetic study was therefore performed in order to evaluate the potency of cefmenoxime in the treatment of respiratory infections. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of cefmenoxime against 179 isolates of respiratory pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae 53, Haemophilus influenzae 64, Klebsiella pneumoniae 43, Escherichia coli 9, Enterobacter spp. 10) were less than 0.20 micrograms/ml, and 43 (73%) of 60 Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml. In vitro antibacterial activity of cefmenoxime was superior to 18 other antibiotics, including cefotiam and cefotaxime tested in this study. Pharmacokinetic studies on tissue distribution in rats, serum levels and urinary excretion in 3 healthy volunteers, and penetration into bronchial secretes of 9 patients with respiratory infections, revealed that cefmenoxime has a higher penetration into the lung and bronchial secretes compared with cefotiam and cefotaxime. In 1 patient with chronic bronchiolitis, the concentration of cefmenoxime in the intra-bronchial secrete reached 12.5 micrograms/ml. From these results, it is concluded that cefmenoxime is a highly potent and useful antibiotic, and may be more effective in the treatment of respiratory infections than many other cephalosporins, including cefazolin, cefotiam and cefotaxime.
TI  - Cefoperazone versus cefamandole in the treatment of acute bacterial lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - In a randomized comparative study, 113 patients were treated with cefoperazone or cefamandole for acute bacterial lower respiratory tract infections. Most patients had Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae infections, although five patients in the cefoperazone group had infections caused by other Gram-negative bacilli (two with Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The clinical responses and adverse effects were not significantly different between the two treatment groups. Satisfactory clinical responses occurred in 36/39 (92%) of evaluable patients in the cefoperazone group and 33/34 (97%) of evaluable patients treated with cefamandole. Two failures in the cefoperazone group were secondary to superinfection (Acinetobacter and Ps. aeruginosa). Bacteriological and symptomatic failure occurred in one patient with Ps. aeruginosa lung abscess treated with cefoperazone and in one patient with a polymicrobial empyema treated with cefamandole. The results of this study indicate that cefoperazone is safe and effective in the therapy of acute bacterial lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Cefotetan, a new cephamycin: comparison of in vitro antimicrobial activity with other cephems, beta-lactamase stability, and preliminary recommendations for disk diffusion testing.
AB  - Cefotetan is a new, potent, 7 alpha-methoxy cephalosporin (cephamycin). The in vitro activity of cefotetan tested in a multiphasic, collaborative study against 12,260 consecutive clinical isolates and 448 selected isolates showed 93% of Enterobacteriaceae, 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (broth dilution), 83% of Bacteroides fragilis, and 72% of non-enterococcal streptococci to be inhibited by less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. Beta-Lactamase-producing and -nonproducing Haemophilus influenzae strains were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. Cefotetan's inhibitory spectrum paralleled those of the newest generation of cephems and exceeded those of cefoxitin and cefamandole. No useful activity was present against Streptococcus faecalis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefotetan was bactericidal without significant inoculum effect and was highly resistant to hydrolysis by Richmond-Sykes types I, III, and IV beta-lactamases. Hydrolysis of the chromogenic cephalosporin PADAC (pyridine-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline cephalosporin) by type I beta-lactamases was markedly inhibited by concentrations of cefotetan similar to those of the potent inhibitor dicloxacillin. Analysis of agar disk diffusion for several disk potencies and broth dilution susceptibility tests by regression and error rate-bounding methods produced preliminary tentative zone standards (30-micrograms disk, using minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml susceptible and greater than 32 micrograms/ml resistant, or 75-micrograms disk, using minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml susceptible and greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml resistant) of greater than or equal to 18 mm susceptible, less than or equal to 14 mm resistant, and 15 to 17 mm indeterminate. Staphylococcus aureus testing with the 30-micrograms disk is not recommended.
TI  - Bacteriology of the maxillary sinuses in patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - The maxillary sinuses of 20 patients (median age, 15 years) with cystic fibrosis  were examined with ultrasound, radiography, and transantral sinus aspiration (14 bilateral and six unilateral for a total of 34 aspirates). The sinus aspirations were performed with careful sterile techniques, and the material that was recovered was cultured quantitatively for both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Nineteen (95%) of the 20 patients had at least one positive (greater than or equal to 10(4) colony-forming units/ml) culture of sinus aspirate. The organisms most commonly recovered from the sinus aspirates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13), Haemophilus influenzae (10), streptococci (five), and anaerobes (five). There was no association between the bacterial species recovered from the sinus and the predominant bacterial species in the nasopharyngeal, throat, or sputum culture. Although most patients had been chronically receiving therapeutic oral doses of antimicrobial agents, bacteria sensitive to the antimicrobial agents that the patient had been taking (excluding P. aeruginosa) were recovered from the sinuses of nine of these 10 patients.
TI  - Moxalactam therapy for bacterial pneumonia.
AB  - Therapy with moxalactam was evaluated in 71 patients with bacterial pneumonia. Ninety-two percent of patients with pneumonia due to gram-positive cocci, anaerobes, or Haemophilus influenzae were cured. One patient developed probable pneumococcal meningitis during treatment of sputum culture-positive pneumococcal pneumonia. Six of 10 patients with pneumonia due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Enterobacteriaceae were cured also. However, two of these patients became colonized with moxalactam-resistant organisms, which were of the same species as the organism that caused the original infection. Two of the four patients in whom treatment failed were infected with P. aeruginosa and then developed superinfection with moxalactam-resistant Pseudomonas. Phlebitis and pain on intramuscular injection were the most common adverse effects observed. The results of this study, demonstrate that moxalactam may constitute effective therapy for bacterial pneumonia, but the development of resistance during therapy may limit its usefulness against Pseudomonas infections.
TI  - Azlocillin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin: new broad-spectrum penicillins.
AB  - Three new broad-spectrum penicillins--azlocillin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin--will soon be available for clinical use. Azlocillin and piperacillin are more active than carbenicillin or ticarcillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Piperacillin and mezlocillin demonstrate significant activity against the Enterobacteriaceae, including many strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae against which the older penicillins carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and ampicillin are ineffective. All three new drugs show substantial activity against anaerobes and ampicillin-susceptible gonococci and Haemophilus influenzae. Because these agents are inactivated by various beta-lactamases, most Staphylococcus aureus isolates and a number of gram-negative organisms, including some important nosocomial pathogens, will be resistant to these antibiotics. The new penicillins appear to be relatively safe and have been used successfully to treat patients with various infections; however, comparative trials have not yet established the superiority of these drugs over conventional therapeutic agents.
TI  - Lysozyme activity in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - The activity of lysozyme in saliva and serum was determined in 51 patients with cystic fibrosis. Measurements were made on two occasions at least 1 month apart and compared to those of 25 normal healthy individuals of the same ages, sex, and race. The mean serum lysozyme activity of normal individuals was 5.8 micrograms/ml (S.E. = 0.4), whereas that of cystic fibrosis patients was 10.8 micrograms/ml (S.E. = 0.5). The difference is significant (P less than 0.05). Initial mean values compared to those of repeated samples from the cystic fibrosis group were similar, whereas individual fluctuations occurred between test periods. The mean lysozyme activity of the saliva sample of normal individuals was 63.5 micrograms/ml (S.E. = 9.3) and the mean value from cystic fibrosis patients was 82.7 (S.E. = 6.9). This difference was not significant (P greater than 0.1). Mean values from specimens obtained a month or longer after the initial saliva samples were similar for the two episodes. There was no correlation between the serum and salivary values and the age, sex or race of the subjects, the Shwachman-Kulczycki scores, colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus or Haemophilus influenzae or absolute white blood cell counts. In vitro studies failed to demonstrate bactericidal activity for mucoid and nonmucoid strains of P. aeruginosa or for S. aureus. Elevated lysozyme activity in cystic fibrosis may be related to either an increased granulocyte turnover because of chronic bacterial infection of the respiratory tract or to a basic defect in the lysosomal membrane allowing an increased release of the enzyme, or a combination of both.
TI  - Antibiotic prophylaxis in cystic fibrosis: inhaled cephaloridine as an adjunct to oral cloxacillin.
AB  - The effect of prophylactic antibiotics on bacterial colonization of the respiratory tract and on general progression of cystic fibrosis was studied in a two-year prospective study of 47 mildly to moderately affected patients. One group of patients received inhaled cephaloridine and the other received no inhaled antibiotic; both groups received cloxacillin orally. Carriage of Haemophilus influenzae was greater in the group not receiving inhaled antibiotic (55% vs 20%). Rates of carriage of Staphylococcus aureus (23%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (greater than 90%). Pseudomonas cepacia (45%), and other organisms were similar in both groups. There were no significant differences between the two groups in incidence of respiratory tract infections or hospital admissions, clinical scores, radiologic scores, or rate of change of pulmonary function. Although continuous antistaphylococcal antibiotic prophylaxis may be successful in suppressing colonization with S. aureus, it may also contribute to the high rates of carriage of Ps. aeruginosa and Ps. cepacia observed in patients with cystic fibrosis.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activity of DL-8280, a new oxazine derivative.
AB  - DL-8280, 9-fluoro-3-methyl-10-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-7-oxo-2,3-dihydro-7H- pyrido-(1,2,3-de)1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid, is a new nalidixic acid analog with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including obligate anaerobes. The activity of DL-8280 against Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Clostridium perfringens was roughly comparable to that of norfloxacin and far exceeded that of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. DL-8280 had greater activity against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp., and Bacteroides fragilis than did norfloxacin, pipemidic acid, and nalidixic acid. Nalidixic acid-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, ampicillin-resistant gonococci, and clindamycin-resistant obligate anaerobes were also susceptible to DL-8280. The activity of DL-8280 was affected very little by inoculum size, and its action was bactericidal at two times the minimal inhibitory concentrations at most. Administered orally to mice experimentally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, or P. aeruginosa, DL-8280 was 2 to 7 times more effective than norfloxacin and 7 to more than 50 times more active than pipemidic acid.
TI  - Binding of human C-reactive protein to bacteria.
AB  - The binding of C-reactive protein to a variety of species of bacteria with potential clinical significance was studied to assess the potential function of C-reactive protein in nonimmune defense against infection. Purified, radioiodinated human C-reactive protein bound to all Streptococcus pneumoniae tested and to some viridans streptococci, but not to group A or group B streptococci or to any of eight different gram-negative rods and cocci.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of temocillin.
AB  - Temocillin, a 6-alpha-methoxy penicillin, inhibited 90% of strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter, Proteus, Providencia, Salmonella, and Shigella at a concentration of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoea were inhibited by less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. Changing the medium or pH of the cultures did not alter the minimal inhibitory concentrations, which were similar in broth and human serum, as were the minimal bactericidal concentrations. An increase in inoculum size from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units increased concentration required for inhibition. Temocillin inhibited strains resistant to ampicillin, ticarcillin, cefazolin, cefamandole, and cefoxitin. Most Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains and other Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. were resistant, as were gram-positive organisms. Temocillin was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases but inhibited them. The resistance of certain gram-negative bacilli to temocillin seemed to be a result of failure of the molecule to enter through the cell wall, since combination of temocillin with EDTA made Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Enterobacter strains susceptible to low concentrations of the compound.
TI  - Clinical trials of cefotaxime for the treatment of bacterial infections of the lower respiratory tract.
AB  - The efficacy of cefotaxime sodium for treatment of patients with lower respiratory infections was evaluated by three protocols in multicenter trials. The first trial studied cefotaxime alone; the second and third trials compared cefotaxime with cefazolin in observer-blind and single-blind randomized controlled studies, respectively. A total of 656 patients were entered in the three trials; 527 received cefotaxime. Overall rates of bacteriologic and clinical cure, analyzed by pathogen, for the cefotaxime treated patients were 89.9% and 93.9%, respectively. In the two comparative trials, overall rates of bacteriologic and clinical cure with cefotaxime, by pathogen, were greater than 94% and numerically exceeded those for cefazolin in each instance. The efficacies in the comparative studies, when analyzed by total patient responses, were significantly different only for clinical responses to cefotaxime in the single-blind randomized trial (P = 0.03). Favorable cure rates with cefotaxime were obtained in patients with infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, and nearly comparable responses were obtained for infections due to Proteus, Enterobacter, and Klebsiella species. Cefotaxime was clinically effective in some of the infections due to Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but bacteriologic failures occurred in 67% and 61% of cases, respectively. All Serratia strains were highly susceptible in vitro to cefotaxime, but the range of minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefotaxime for Pseudomonas isolates was wide.
TI  - Comparative activity of cefotaxime and selected beta-lactam antibiotics against Haemophilus influenzae and aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The activity of cefotaxime was compared with that of ampicillin, moxalactam, and  cefoperozone against 50 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and with that of ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefamandole, cefazolin, and several other established and investigational beta-lactam antibiotics against several hundred isolates of gram-negative aerobic enteric bacilli. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the drugs were determined by the agar plate dilution technique for H. influenzae and by the microtiter broth dilution technique for the other pathogens. Cefotaxime was the most active agent against H. influenzae; it was 20 times more active than ampicillin. It was also the most active agent against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, nontyphoid Salmonella species, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Cefotaxime was among the most active agents against Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter species, Shigella species, Proteus mirabilis, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. None of the new cephalosporins or penicillin inhibited greater than 90% of the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml; these drugs were, however, more active than carbenicillin.
TI  - Cefotaxime: a review of in vitro antimicrobial properties and spectrum of activity.
AB  - Cefotaxime has remarkable potency against all Enterobacteriaceae, including Enterobacter species, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, and Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, and Providencia species--all of which are resistant to earlier cephalosporins. Cefotaxime generally inhibits greater than 90% of enteric bacilli at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml; in one study it inhibited greater than 98% of isolates at less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. For staphylococci and nonenterococcal streptococci, the mean values for the minimal inhibitory concentration50 (MIC50) of cefotaxime (i.e., the lowest concentration inhibiting growth of 50% of tested strains) are 1.1-1.9 microgram/ml and 0.01-0.05 microgram/ml, respectively. Cefotaxime is inactive against Streptococcus faecalis and most other serogroup D streptococci. It is moderately active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC50, 19 microgram/ml) and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus (MIC50, 18 microgram/ml). Because the activity of cefotaxime against other pseudomonads and nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli varies, in vitro susceptibility testing must be used as a guide to therapy. Cefotaxime is potent against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria species. Infections due to beta-lactamase-producing gonococci have been treated effectively with cefotaxime (MIC, mode = less than or equal to 0.004 microgram/ml). Most anaerobes are highly susceptible to cefotaxime, but the minimal inhibitory concentrations for 10%-20% of Bacteroides fragilis strains (MIC50, 5.3 microgram/ml) and other Bacteroides species may exceed obtainable serum concentrations. The potent antimicrobial activity of cefotaxime appears to be the result of a combination of characteristics which include: beta-lactamase stability (types I, III, IV, and V), good ability to pass through the cell membrane, strong affinity for lethal penicillin-binding proteins 1a, 1b(s), and 3, minimal limitation by the inoculum effect, and bactericidal action at or close to the inhibitory concentration. Clinically useful methods of susceptibility testing have been developed and can be recommended for clinical laboratory use.
TI  - Ceftriaxone: in vitro activity against 410 bacterial isolates compared with cefotaxime.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the two new cephalosporins, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone,  against 410 bacterial isolates was compared using an agar dilution method. Both compounds were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive Proteus and Providencia; the great majority of the isolates were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l of either drug. Activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus was moderate, and enterococci were resistant. All Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae isolates were susceptible to 0.03 mg/l of either drug. The isolates belonging to the Bacteroides fragilis group were inhibited over a wide range of concentrations and some were highly resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 64 mg/l). There were no significant differences in the antibacterial activity of the two drugs against our isolates. Both drugs may be of potential use in the treatment of serious infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae; they may prove to be a useful alternative to the aminoglycosides.
TI  - Moxalactam in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - The clinical efficacy and safety of the new oxacephalosporin moxalactam disodium  were evaluated in 54 children with a variety of pediatric infections. Except for a terminally ill neutropenic leukemic patient with pneumonia and sepsis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa who died shortly after initiation of therapy, moxalactam treatment was effective in all patients. No recurrent infections were observed. The rate of clinical response to moxalactam appeared to be at least comparable to that of patients treated with traditional antibiotics. In vitro sensitivity testing demonstrated that all bacteria isolated except P aeruginosa were sensitive to moxalactam while Haemophilus influenzae was exquisitely sensitive. Side effects included thrombocytosis (five patients), transient SGPT elevations and eosinophilia (three each), fever with rash (one), and neutropenia (one). In one patient, superinfection with Streptococcus faecalis developed. We conclude that moxalactam may be a useful antibiotic in pediatrics, particularly for the treatment of infections due to H. influenzae and Enterobacteriaceae. Its role in infections caused by group B streptococcus and Pseudomonas awaits further studies.
TI  - Circulating immune complexes in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - The presence or absence of circulating immune complexes (CIC) was studied longitudinally over a period of 15 months in 17 patients with cystic fibrosis. (CF). Using the Raji cell assay, CIC were found in 47% of patients. Presence of immune complexes did not correlate with age at midpoint of the study severity of disease, acute pulmonary exacerbations, progression of lung disease, or nonspecific, humoral and cellular immune functions. In addition, the presence of CIC did not correlate with colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, or streptococcus species (viridans or pneumoniae). Because CIC were present in patients without concurrent sputum colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, antigens other than components of this organism may be capable of forming CIC in CF. The clinical and pathologic significant of CIC in CF remains to be determined.
TI  - Aetiology and treatment of acute bacterial infection of the external eye.
AB  - The microbial flora of 738 patients with acute bacterial conjunctivitis, corneal  ulceration, blepharitis, dacryocystitis, and discharging sockets has been investigated. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae were the main pathogens isolated. Str. viridans was associated with conjunctivitis in patients aged under 1 year. moraxella sp. was isolated on only one occasion. Overall, 40% of specimens were associated with Staph. epidermidis or mixed skin flora, which also occurred with cultures of the normal eye. Clostridium welchii was isolated on 3 occasions but was not associated with bullae or gas gangrene. The least overall resistance, of 6%, was to chloramphenicol, but no one antibiotic was effective against all pathogens. Gentamicin remains the antibiotic of choice for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.
TI  - [Clinical bacteriological studies on cefotiam and cefsulodin in the field of otorhinolaryngology].
AB  - Clinical bacteriological studies on cefotiam and cefsulodin in the field of otorhinolaryngology were carried out and the following results were obtained. 1) Aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were dominantly isolated from the clinical materials sent to the center from the clinical institutes. 2) It was considered that Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and beta-Streptococcus played an important role in the primary infections in the field of otorhinolaryngology. Staphylococcus aureus was also frequently isolated from the primary infections. Peptostreptococcus spp. was dominantly isolated from peritonsillar abscess. Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) were mainly isolated from the chronic secondary infections. Among GNB, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus spp. were more frequently isolated. Staphylococcus aureus was also constantly detected in the secondary infections together with GNB. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 20.1% of the patients with chronic otitis media and 27.1% of sinusitis. 3) Cefotiam showed potent antibacterial activities against most isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. 4) Cefsulodin showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Staphylococcus aureus and beta-Streptococcus were also susceptible to cefsulodin.
TI  - Rapid differentiation of bacterial meningitides by direct gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - Rapid identification of Haemophilus influenzae and other bacillary meningitides was attempted by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) of the metabolic by-products in broth cultures and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained from experimental meningitis produced in New Zealand White male rabbits. These results were correlated with the GLC of CSF of meningitis patients. A major peak with retention time of succinic acid was found in the broth cultures of all bacilli tested including H. influenzae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Listeria monocytogenes. Succinic acid was also found in the CSF of experimental meningitis and in the CSF of all patients with H. influenzae and Esch. coli meningitis. This peak was not detected in the blood samples of experimental animals. It was also absent in the broth cultures of all of the gram-positive and gram-negative cocci tested, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. Succinic acid, which appears to be a by product of fermentation, persisted as a clear cut marker in H. influenzae meningitis for at least 3 d after the initiation of treatment. In one patient, the succinic acid peak disappeared during treatment and reappeared with a clinical relapse. Clearly, the presence of succinic acid that can be rapidly detected by GLC in the CSF excludes pneumococcal or meningococcal meningitis and strongly suggests H. influenzae or other bacillary meningitides.
TI  - Transfer of the gonococcal penicillinase plasmid: mobilization in Escherichia coli by IncP plasmids and isolation as a DNA-protein relaxation complex.
AB  - A 4.4-megadalton penicillinase plasmid, pWD2, from Neisseria gonorrhoeae was transformed into Escherichia coli. pWD2 was efficiently mobilized by IncP plasmids in E. coli but not by Flac, R1drd-19, or R64drd-11. pWD2 could be isolated as a DNA-protein relaxation complex with properties similar to the well characterized ColE1 complex. The host range of pWD2 was shown to include gonococci, Enterobacteriaceae, and Hemophilus influenzae, but not Acinetobacter calcoaceticus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These findings suggest that P-group plasmids could have played a role in the dissemination of the TEM beta-lactamase to pathogenic gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of norfloxacin (MK-0366).
AB  - The in vitro activity of norfloxacin (MK-0366) compared with that of beta-lactam  antibiotics and, where appropriate of gentamicin or metronidazole was assessed against recent clinical isolates of common bacteria. The compound was highly active against most enterobacteria (minimal inhibitory concentrations [MICs], 0.008 to 32 micrograms/ml; 90% inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MICs, 0.03 to 0.12 micrograms/ml), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MICs, 0.008 to 0.016 micrograms/ml). It was also active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MICs, 0.12 to 2 micrograms/ml), most other pseudomonads (MICs, 0.03 to 32 micrograms/ml), and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (MICs 0.06 to 4 micrograms/ml). Norfloxacin was somewhat less active against staphylococci (MICs, 0.25 to 4 micrograms/ml; 1 microgram/ml required to inhibit 50% of isolates) and streptococci (MICs, 0.5 to 64 micrograms/ml). Members of the Bacteroides fragilis group of anaerobes were relatively resistant to norfloxacin (MICs, 8 to 128 micrograms/ml), as were most other anaerobes.
TI  - Moxalactam penetration into cerebrospinal fluid in patients with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Penetration of moxalactam into the cerebrospinal fluid was studied in 11 patients with bacterial meningitis undergoing treatment with other antibiotics. Moxalactam at a dose of 20 mg/kg was administered as three 30- to 45- min infusions at 8-h intervals, once between days 2 and 4 and a second time between days 11 and 20 of treatment with the other antibiotics. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid were sampled 60, 90, or 120 min after the third moxalactam dose for measurement of the concentration of this drug by high-performance liquid chromatography. The concentration of moxalactam in cerebrospinal fluid ranged from 1.5 to 11 micrograms/ml, depending on the sampling time and the time elapsed since the onset of the disease. These concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid were equal to or higher than the minimum inhibitor concentrations for Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), and most of the gram-negative bacilli except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These results show that moxalactam has good penetrability when the meninges are inflamed and that it might be considered in cases of bacterial meningitis when the susceptibility of the pathogen indicates its usefulness.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefotetan, a new cephamycin derivative, compared with that of other beta-lactam compounds.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefotetan, a new cephamycin, was compared with the activities of cefoxitin, cefuroxime, moxalactam, ceftazidime, and piperacillin against 273 recent clinical isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of cefotetan for 90% of Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were between 0.12 and 2 micrograms/ml; for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus, the minimum inhibitory concentration was 8 micrograms/ml, and for 90% of Bacteroides fragilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Lancefield group D streptococci it was 128 micrograms/ml or more. The activity of cefotetan against Enterobacteriaceae is comparable to the activities of ceftazidime and moxalactam and four to eight times greater than the activities of cefoxitin and cefuroxime. Cefotetan was approximately one-half as active as cefoxitin and cefuroxime against S. aureus. Although cefotetan was 87% bound to serum protein, serum had little effect on the in vitro antimicrobial activity of this agent.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. The clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. Of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. The bacteria isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. Improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. There were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. No serious drug toxicities were observed. At a dosage regimen of 1 g every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. Our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.
TI  - Pseudomonas and other organisms in cystic fibrosis.
AB  
TI  - The in vitro activity of moxalactam against 430 clinical, bacterial isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the novel beta-lactam antibiotic moxalactam against 430  bacterial isolates was determined by an agar dilution method. Moxalactam was highly active against Enterobacteriaceae including indole-positive Proteus and Providencia, all isolates being susceptible to 1.0 microgram/ml or less. The drug was somewhat less active against Gram-positive cocci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococci were highly resistant. All Haemophilus influenzae isolates were inhibited by 0.06 microgram/ml or less. Activity against Bacteroides fragilis was good but wide variations of minimal inhibitory concentrations were noted. Moxalactam may become a useful alternative to the aminoglycosides in the treatment of serious infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin against gram-positive  and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic species and its beta-lactamase stability.
AB  - The in vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin was determined against 800 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and compared with the activity of cefoxitin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefotaxime, moxalactam, ampicillin, cefoperazone, and gentamicin. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin inhibited the majority of organisms at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml. It inhibited methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis. It inhibited beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Unlike other new beta-lactams, it inhibited Listeria. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacters, Serratia, indole-positive Proteus, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides resistant to other agents were inhibited. There was minimal effect of inoculum size and aerobic versus anaerobic conditions, and serum had no effect on activity. Most minimal bactericidal concentrations were two- or fourfold greater than the minimal inhibitory concentration. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin showed partial synergy with aminoglycosides against S. aureus, S. faecalis, and many Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae. It was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated and chromosomal beta-lactamases.
TI  - Augmentin: laboratory studies.
AB  - Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactam antibiotic which, although it has little intrinsic activity, is a potent inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases. When combined with amoxycillin its range of activity includes penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and many of the beta-lactamase-producing strains of Gram-negative bacilli. Bacteria sensitive to augmentin include amoxycillin-resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli, in addition strains of Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Bacteroides fragilis are usually sensitive. The beta-lactamases produced by Enterobacter spp, Proteus morgani, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are less susceptible to clavulanic acid and these bacteria are usually resistant to augmentin (1).
TI  - Comparison of the antibacterial activity of norfloxacin (MK 0366, AM 715), a new  organic acid, with that of other orally absorbed chemotherapeutic agents.
AB  - 425 randomly selected, fresh clinical isolates were tested for susceptibility to  norfloxacin and other orally absorbed agents, i.e. amoxicillin, ampicillin, carbenicillin (available commercially as the indanyl ester), cefaclor, cinoxacin, erythromycin, nalidixic acid, penicillin G, tetracycline, trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole. The results have shown norfloxacin to be the most potent agent in vitro against representative members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomanas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae. Ninety percent of the isolates in these groups of bacteria were inhibited by less than 1 mg/l, 2 mg/l, 8 mg/l, 32 mg/l, 0.06 mg/l and 0.25 mg/l of norfloxacin, respectively. Although norfloxacin inhibited most streptococci and Ureaplasma at a concentration of 8 mg/l or less, penicillin G proved to be the most active against Streptococcus pygenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae; trimethoprim was the most active against Streptococcus faecalis, and tetracycline the most active against Ureaplasma.
TI  - Clinical efficacy of cefotaxime in serious infections.
AB  - Thirty-five patients underwent 38 treatment courses with cefotaxime. Documented infections included 11 bacteremias, 7 cases of nosocomial pneumonia, 6 surgical wound infections, 3 bone infections, 1 biliary infection, and 1 urinary tract infection. Granulocytopenic patients with fever received 15 courses of empiric cefotaxime therapy alone; in 8 courses, no definite site of infection or pathogen was isolated. Broad-spectrum antibiotics had been administered to 23 patients before cefotaxime. Thirty-seven bacterial pathogens were isolated from 25 patients. Three such pathogens were resistant to cefotaxime and required alternative therapies. Pathogenic isolates included 13 Serratia marcescens, 12 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 Escherichia coli, 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 Providencia stuartii, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Haemophilus influenzae, 1 Enterococcus, and 1 Staphylococcus aureus. Of the treatment courses, 25 of 38 resulted in a favorable response to cefotaxime, including 9 of 15 in granulocytopenic patients. Superinfection was seen in one patient. The emergence of resistance was documented in another patient. Of 15 patients with multiply resistant pathogens, 12 improved with cefotaxime. Of 12 patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6 favorably responded. Possible complications of cefotaxime were observed in 14 of 42 treatment courses. Cefotaxime is most useful in treatment of infections due to multiply resistant, gram-negative pathogens other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of ceftizoxime in the pediatric infections (author's transl)].
AB  - Ceftizoxime (FK 749, CZX) was evaluated in 24 children with a suspicion of bacterial infection. Of the 17 confirmed bacterial infections, 16 were shown to be effective (effective rate, 94.1%). The diagnosis included acute pharyngitis (2), pneumonia (6), staphylococcal empyema (1), cervical purulent lymphadenitis (2), acute enterocolitis (2), acute pyelonephritis (1), SSSS (1) and suspected septicemia (2). The etiological pathogens recovered were Streptococcus anginosus (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Staphylococcus aureus (2), Haemophilus influenzae (3), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (1) etc. A case of suspected Pseudomonas aeruginosa septicemia was not effectively treated with CZX. The serum half-life of CZX was 1.36 hours after intravenous bolus infection. A cerebrospinal fluid level of CZX was 6.2 mcg/ml 1 hour after intravenous bolus injection of 1 g (23.8 mg/kg) in a child with inflamed meninges. No severe adverse reaction was encountered with the CZX therapy. The data suggest that CZX is an excellent candidate for the first choice parenteral antibiotic in the pediatric infections.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin in comparison with cefotaxime, lamoxactam, cefoperazone, piperacillin gentamicin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK 0787), a new stable derivative of thienamycin was compared with that of lamoxactam, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, piperacillin and gentamicin against 410 clinical isolates of common bacteria. In comparison with the other agents, MK 0787 was more or equally active against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., and Serratia spp. It inhibited all isolates at a concentration of 0.5 mg/l, but was less active than cefotaxime and lamoxactam against Proteus mirabilis and less active than cefotaxime, lamoxactam and cefoperazone against Beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae. Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more susceptible to N-formimidoyl thienamycin than to other antibiotics.

TI  - SQ 26,776, a novel beta-lactam: an in-vitro comparison with other antimicrobial agents.
AB  
TI  - Distribution of IS5 in bacteria.
AB  - Four different strains of Escherichia coli and several other bacteria were examined by Southern analysis for the presence of the insertion element IS5 and IS5-like sequences. Variations in the copy number, degree of homology and restriction pattern of the IS5-like sequence were found among the different organisms. The number and distribution of IS5 sequences do not appear to correlate with the evolutionary relationship of the bacteria in which they occur.
TI  - Moxalactam therapy for bacterial infections.
AB  - Moxalactam, a novel beta-lactam antimicrobial agent in which oxygen has replaced  sulfur in the six-membered ring of the conventional cephem nucleus, has in vitro activity against almost all commonly isolated bacterial pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Haemophilus influenzae. The clinical efficacy an toxicity of moxalactam alone was evaluated in the treatment of 100 infections, including 22 septicemias. Thirty-two infections involved P aeruginosa, while organisms resistant to one or more of the currently available cephalosporins or cefoxitin were isolated from cultures in 63 of the cases. The overall clinical response was favorable (infection cured or improved) in 86% of the infections. A child with Klebsiella pneumoniae ventriculitis and meningitis was cured with intravenous moxalactam alone. Six of 14 treatment failures involved P. aeruginosa, and P aeruginosa isolates resistant to moxalactam emerged during therapy of 12 infections. Side effects, usually mild diarrhea, occurred in only 8.8% of the patients. Except for some severe P aeruginosa infections outside the urinary tract, moxalactam is effective and safe single-agent therapy for infections caused by susceptible organisms and represents a major advancement in beta-lactam antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Penetration of piperacillin into bronchial mucosa and sputum.
AB  - Bronchial mucosal biopsies were obtained during fibreoptic bronchoscopy in 12 patients receiving a new semisynthetic penicillin, piperacillin. The piperacillin levels estimated in bronchial mucosa exceeded those required to eradicate organisms associated with acute bronchitis, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and compared favourably with those required for activity against a wide variety of anaerobic and Gram-negative organisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Sputum and serum piperacillin levels were obtained from eight patients with bronchial disease receiving a five to seven day course (8 to 16 g/day). Sputum/serum level ratios were constant for the two dosages (10.7% for 8 g/day; 14.3% for 16 g/day) suggesting a diffusion transfer process, although the presence of pus in the sputum appeared to facilitate penetration. Seven patients achieved sputum levels exceeding those required for activity against Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus influenzae, and four for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This study provides pharmacolinetic support of the use of piperacillin in bronchopulmonary infection.
TI  - An in-vitro comparison of new cephalosporins with special reference to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - MICs of cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and moxalactam were determined for  staphylococci, Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenza and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The new compounds are 10 to 100 times more active in vitro against Enterobacteriaceae and H. influenzae (including penicillinase-producing strains) than the older cephalosporins. Against N. gonorrhoeae, including penicillinase-producing strains, cefotaxime appeared to be the most active compound (MIC as low as 0.002 mg/l), while the other new cephalosporins were approximately as active as cefuroxime. Cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefsulodin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and moxalactam were tested against carbenicillin susceptible (Cbs) and carbenicillin resistant (Cb(R)) strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Cb(S) strains the lowest MIC values were obtained with ceftazidime (1 mg/l) followed by cefsulodin (1-2 mg/l), cefoperazone (2-4 mg/l), ceftriaxone (4 mg/l), moxalactam (4-8 mg/l) and cefotaxime (8-16 mg/l). Usually the susceptibility to cephalosporins of Cb(R) strains was found decreased for all compounds, but the least for ceftazidime. Considerable cross resistance with carbenicillin was noted for cefsulodin and cefoperazone only. Lysates of 19 CbR strains have been screened for the presence of constitutive beta-lactamases. Three enzyme types were found: pI 5.4 (n=8) pl 5.3 (n=5) and pI 5.7 (n=6).
TI  - In-vitro activity of ceftazidime compared with other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - Ceftazidime and ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), two new parenteral cephalosporins, were compared with other beta-lactam antibiotics against a total of 237 recent clinical isolates. Both ceftazidime and ceftriaxone had good activity against the Enterobacteriaceae, with 90% of isolates being inhibited by 0.5 mg/l of ceftazidime and by 0.25 mg/l of ceftriaxone. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftazidime was about four times more active than ceftriaxone which, in turn, was at least eight times more active than carbenicillin. Both ceftazidime and ceftriaxone were highly active against beta-lactamase producing and non-beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae. Against the Bacteroides fragilis group, neither ceftazidime nor ceftriaxone showed good activity, the MIC90 for ceftazidime being > 128 mg/l and the MIC90 for ceftriaxone being 32 mg/l. Both ceftazidime and ceftriaxone were less active than cephalothin against Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of ceftazidime against clinically important pathogens.
AB  - A total of 1414 strains of Gram-negative bacilli and 250 strains of Gram-positive cocci were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the broth dilution method. The strains were clinical isolates from 26 hospitals in the Rhein-Main area. All the strains were tested against ceftazidime and ten other cephalosporin antibiotics. Ceftazidime was found to exhibit an in-vitro activity against Enterobacteriaceae similar to that of cefotaxime, moxalactam and other new members of the cephalosporin class, but was more active against Acinetobacter species. Ceftazidime shows extremely high activity both against carbenicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Similarly, ampicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae are susceptible to ceftazidime. The activity of ceftazidime against Staphylococcus aureus is limited and, like other cephalosporins, it is inactive against Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - Ceftazidime, a pseudomonas-active cephalosporin: in-vitro antimicrobial activity  evaluation including recommendations for disc diffusion susceptibility tests.
AB  - The in-vitro qualities of ceftazidime, as compared to other beta-lactams and three other antimicrobials (amikacin, gentamicin and chloramphenicol), were evaluated in a multilaboratory, multiphasic study in the United States. A total of 12,986 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference dilution methods in six medical centres over 45-60 days. Ceftazidime was superior to the comparison cephalosporin (cefamandole) and comparable in spectrum and activity to gentamicin against Enterobacteriaceae. Of 8038 enteric bacilli tested, over 98% had CTAZ MICs < or = 8 mg/l with a mode of < or = 0.12 mg/l. Only Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter aerogenes had ceftazidime MIC(90S) in the resistant range ( > or =32 mg/l). Staphylococcus aureus strains were less susceptible to ceftazidime (mode MIC 8 mg/l) compared to cefamandole or gentamicin. Ceftazidime was more effective than cefamandole or gentamicin against the beta-haemolytic streptococci and the pneumococcus. More than 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, most other Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by ceftazidime at concentrations of 8 mg/l. In other comparative studies ceftazidime was found remarkably similar in spectrum to cefotaxime, cefoperazone and moxalactam against the Enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci and Streptococcus spp. Enterobacter cloacae was the only enteric species having ceftazidime MIC90 >8 mg/l. Only cefsulodin (mode MIC 2 mg/l) and cefoperazone (mode MIC 4 mg/l) shared the ceftazidime activity against Ps. aeruginosa. Ceftazidime MIC(50S) for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were 0.03-0.06 and 0.015 mg/l, respectively. Ceftazidime was found to be bactericidal against most strains at or one doubling dilution above the MIC, and was relatively unaffected by increasing inoculum concentration (some strain variations). It perfused readily into bacterial cells and was effective against the majority of strains resistant to currently available cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. beta-lactamases of Types I-V and Bacillus cereus failed to significantly hydrolyse ceftazidime. Ceftazidime inhibited only Type I Ent. cloacae beta-lactamase hydrolysis. Disc diffusion tests favour the use of a 30 microg ceftazidime disc for the methods described by the National Committee Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Quality control data are presented. Tentative 30 microg disc interpretive criteria, based on susceptible MICs of < or =8 mg/l(> 17 mm) and resistant > or =32 mg/l ( < or =13 mm), resulted in < 1% (false resistance or false susceptible) interpretive error rates. Staph. aureus was the species most commonly found to have strains with indeterminate ceftazidime zones or MICs. We found ceftazidime to possess one of the widest clinically usable antimicrobial spectrum by in-vitro testing of any beta-lactam tested and to be most comparable to broad-spectrum aminoglycosides such as amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin.
TI  - Ceftazidime: comparative in-vitro study.
AB  - Ceftazidime showed moderate activity against Staphylococcus aureus and a high activity against Haemophilus influenzae and the streptococci except against the enterococci. Ceftazidime inhibited 90% of the 830 Enterobacteriaceae tested at a concentration of 0.5 mg/l and 99% at 8 mg/l, an activity very similar to that of cefotaxime. Against Pseudomonas spp. ceftazidime proved to be the most active beta-lactam antibiotic studied. It inhibited 67% of the 141 Ps. aeruginosa strains at 2 mg/l, 84% at 4 mg/l, 98% at 8 mg/l and 100% at 16 mg/l. The inhibitory and the bactericidal concentrations were very close and there was only a minor effect of the inoculum. Ceftazidime retained its high activity against microorganisms with acquired as well as with natural resistance to other beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of ceftazidime compared with that of other cephalosporins.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ceftazidime was compared with the activities of cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefsulodin, cefuroxime, cephalothin and cefatriaxon against 331 clinical bacterial isolates. Against Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Enterobacter, Proteus mirabilis and indole-positive Proteus ceftazidime, with MIC90 of < or = 0.25 mg/l, was more active than cephalothin, cefoperazone and cefuroxime but less active than cefotaxime and ceftriaxone Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia, Acinetobacter and Citrobacter were inhibited at higher concentrations (MIC90 1-4 mg/l). The activity of ceftazidime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MIC90 of 4 mg/l) was four times that of cefoperazone, five times that of cefatriaxon and ten times that of cefotaxime, but similar to that of cefsulodin. Against Staphylococcus aureus and Lancefield groups A and B streptococci ceftazidime was less active than the other cephalosporins. Group D streptococci were resistant. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by < or = 0.25 mg/l. There were no significant inoculum effects on ceftazidime and MBCs were within one twofold dilution of MICs. The addition of 50% human serum had no effect on MICs and MBCs.
TI  - Ceftazidime: in-vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility to beta-lactamases compared with that of cefotaxime, moxalactam and other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activity of ceftazidime was assessed against recent clinical isolates of common bacteria and also against reference strains that produced known beta-lactamases. The compound was active, though less so than cephaloridine against staphylococci and streptococci with MICs mostly 0.12-2 mg/l for streptococci and 8 mg/l for staphylococci, but enterococci (MICs > or =64 mg/l) and methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MICs 16-32 mg/l) were resistant. Penicillin-resistant pneumococci (MICs 2-4 mg/l) were much less sensitive than other pneumococci (MICs 0.12-0.25 mg/l). Ceftazidime was also active, but slightly less so than cefotaxime or moxalactam, against enterobacteria (MICs mostly 0.12-0.25 mg/l). Its activity was also inferior to that of cefotaxime against Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MICs mostly 0.03-0.06 mg/l) and Haemophilus influenzae (MICs mostly 0.06-0.25 mg/l). However it was about eightfold more active than cefotaxime or moxalactam against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MICs mostly 1-4 mg/l), and it was also more active than these compounds against other pseudomonads. Ceftazidime was less active than cefoxitin against Bacteroides spp. (MICs mostly 16-64 mg/l for Bact. fragilis and 2-8 mg/l for other bacteroides) and less active than ampicillin or cefoxitin against other anaerobes. The compound was highly resistant to hydrolysis by most beta-lactamases including OXA-1 and the enzymes from Klebsiella 1082E and Proteus vulgaris PC37 which hydrolyse cefuroxime and cefotaxime. However, it was hydrolysed slowly by the enzyme from a highly ampicillin-resistant isolate of Bact. fragilis.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity and mode of action of ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), a new highly potent cephalosporin.
AB  
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of first, second and third generation cephalosporins.
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined against 662 recent clinical isolates for eight cephalosporins representing first, second and third generation compounds. All four third-generation cephalosporins tested (cefoperaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and moxalactam) were significantly more active against aerobic gram-negative bacteria than the older compounds (cephalothin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cefuroxime). Cefotaxime and moxalactam were most active against Enterobacteriaceae with extremely low MIC-values. Ceftazidime was definitely most active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with more than 90% of strains inhibited at 4 micro g/ml. MIC-values for cefotaxime against Staphylococcus aureus were for all strains 1-2 micro g/ml, slightly higher for cefoperazone, while the effect of ceftazidime and moxalactam was more limited. All third generation cephalosporins demonstrated efficiency against Streptococcus pyogenes, cefotaxime being most active and moxalactam least active, but were essentially ineffective against Streptococcus faecalis. Moxalactam demonstrated higher activity against Bacteroides fragilis than other second and third generation cephalosporins including cefoxitin. Previous studies have demonstrated a very high activity of all third generation cephalosporins against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase producing strains.
TI  - In vivo activity of ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic  cephalosporin.
AB  - Ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904) was compared with other newer beta-lactam antibiotics for activity in experimental infections of mice with Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and gram-positive bacteria. Overall, ceftriaxone was equal or superior to cefotaxime and cefoperazone against systemic infections. All three drugs were highly potent against most organisms but were considerably less active against P. aeruginosa. However, ceftriaxone tended to be more active than the other two agents against 8 of the 10 P. aeruginosa strains tested. Ceftriaxone, cefmenoxime (SCE 1365), and moxalactam were all highly active against systemic infections with 16 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, whereas ceftriaxone was more active against infections with two strains of streptococci. When the drugs were administered at various time intervals before infection, ceftriaxone was superior to cefotaxime, cefmenoxime, and moxalactam. This suggested that ceftriaxone might be eliminated from mice more slowly than the other drugs. In the case of cefotaxime, this was directly confirmed by microbiological assays of plasma samples. In a murine meningitis model induced by Klebsiella pneumoniae or Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftriaxone was more active than ampicillin or cefotaxime. Ceftriaxone was more active than ampicillin, cefotaxime, piperacillin, cefamandole, or carbenicillin in a pneumococcal, pneumonia model in mice. These studies indicate that ceftriaxone is a potent, broad-spectrum cephalosporin with unusual pharmacokinetic properties.
TI  - BRL 17421, a novel beta-lactam antibiotic, highly resistant to beta-lactamases, giving high and prolonged serum levels in humans.
AB  - BRL 17421 is a new semisynthetic beta-lactam antibiotic with an unusual spectrum  of antibacterial activity. The compound exhibits exceptional stability to a wide range of bacterial beta-lactamases and is active against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae, including strains highly resistant to many of the penicillins and cephalosporins currently available. Among the clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae tested, the frequency of strains resistant to BRL 17421 was found to be low, and there was a slow rate of emergence of resistance during in vitro studies. BRL 17421 was highly active against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. The compound was markedly less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacteroides fragilis than against the Enterobacteriaceae. Against the gram-positive bacteria, BRL 17421 showed a very low level of activity. BRL 17421 was found to be 85% bound to human serum, and the antibacterial activity was diminished two- to fourfold in the presence of human serum. Against experimental infections in mice, the activity of BRL 17421 reflected the properties observed in vitro. Studies in human volunteers showed unusually high and prolonged serum concentrations of the compound after parenteral dosage, with a serum half-life of about 5 h, and approximately 85% of the dose was recovered unchanged in the urine. BRL 17421 was poorly absorbed after oral administration. The compound was well tolerated after intramuscular and intravenous administration in volunteers, with no adverse side effects.
TI  - Polymyxin B inactivation of lipopolysaccharide in vaccines of Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Endotoxin activity in suspensions of Bordetella pertussis, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was often markedly decreased by polymyxin B. Polymyxin B treatment may be a means to reduce inflammatory reactivity of lipopolysaccharide in vaccines of gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Ro 13-9904 and GR 20263, two new cephalosporins with broad-spectrum activity: an  in vitro comparison with other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  
TI  - Penicillin-binding proteins in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of Haemophilus influenzae were studied by  sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Eight major PBPs, ranging in molecular weights from 90,000 to 27,000, were detected. The pattern of molecular weights was different from that determined fro Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A study on the binding of several beta-lactam antibodies to the PBPs at their minimal inhibitory concentrations and at lower and higher concentrations revealed that all had highest affinity for PBP 2. Amdinocillin (mecillinam) was an exception; it had highest affinity for PBP 3. The morphological effects of several penicillins, cephalosporins, and amdinocillin on H. influenzae were similar to those reported for E. coli.

AB  - In a literary review the respiratory tract in its physiological condition, the causative agents of bacterial pneumonias and bronchitides are taken into consideration as are also concerned with the question of the suitability of sputum as a material to be examined by infections of the lower respiratory tract which above all with regard to the diagnostic value to other materials as transtracheal aspiration (TTA), bronchial aspiration (BA) and lung aspiration (LA) specimens.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of 6059-S therapy in children (author's transl)].
AB  - A new semisynthetic 1-oxa-beta-lactam derivative, 6059-S, was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in children. Twenty-five patients were treated with 10 to 274 mg/kg per day of 6059-S by intravenous administrations. The diagnosis of the patients were acute pharyngitis (2), acute bronchitis (2), pneumonia (4), pertussis (4), acute enterocolitis (2), recurrent urinary tract infection (2), suspected septicemia (3), and acute purulent meningitis (1); and the remaining 5 patients were considered to have nonbacterial infections. The pathogens recovered were Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1), Enterobacter cloacae (1), Enterobacter aerogenes (1), Proteus morganii (1), Psuedomonas aeruginosa (2) and Salmonella typhimurium (1). All the patients of bacterial infections were cured after the 6059-S therapy. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium were not eradicated after the 6059-S therapy, and the rate of bacterial disappearance was 75%. Diarrhea (3), precordial pain (2, only in cases with high-dose therapy), transient elevation of GOT and GPT (2), and transient eosinophilia (2) were found to be associated with the 6059-S therapy. However, no severe adverse reactions were encountered. Half life of the serum 6059-S level was 1.34 +/- 0.16 hours. CSF concentrations in a case with Haemophilus influenzae meningitis ranged 4.0 to 9.7 mcg/ml after an intravenous injection of 34.3 to 75 mg/kg of 6059-S. From the present study, 6059-S appears to be a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections. It remains to be further determined whether 6059-S is superior to ABPC in the treatment of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis.
TI  - Cefoperazone and cefotiam--two new cephalosporins: an in-vitro comparison.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefoperazone (CPZ) and cefotiam (CTM) was compared to other available cephalosporins. Using an agar dilution procedure both CTM and CPZ were more active against the Enterobacteriaceae tested than cefoxitin, cefuroxime and cefazolin; CTM being slightly more active than CPZ, in particular against Klebsiella spp Haemophilus influenzae were more susceptible to CPZ. CTM had no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa but CPZ exhibited considerable activity (mode MIC 4 mg/l). Against Bacteroides fragilis CPZ had a similar activity to cefuroxime, but CTM was less active. CTM was about twice as active as CPZ against Staphylococcus aureus, cefazolin being the most active agent tested. The MBC was about twice the MIC for each compound and the presence of 75% serum had only a modest effect on the MIC and MBC. The protein binding of CPZ was 94% and CTM 62%.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), a beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), a parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. the compound was less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis than was cephalothin or cefamandole, but it was comparable to cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam in inhibiting most isolates of S. aureus at 3.1 microgram/ml. Ro 13-9904 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations below 0.25 microgram/ml, but Streptococcus faecalis required concentrations above 25 microgram/ml. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations similar to those of cefotaxime, less than 0.1 microgram/ml. Ro 13-9904 was as active as cefotaxime and moxalactam against most Enterobacteriaceae and was the most active agent tested against Proteus, inhibiting all strains tested at 0.006 microgram/ml. Ro 13-9904 was slightly less active than moxalactam or cefoxitin against Bacteroides fragilis, requiring more than 100 microgram/ml to inhibit 90% of isolates, and it was less active than cefoperazone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Presence of serum, alteration of pH, and use of various media did not change the inhibitory levels. Bactericidal concentrations were similar to inhibitory levels. Ro 13-9904 was stable to most plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by some Enterobacter, Proteus, and Bacteroides beta-lactamases of chromosomal origin.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365).
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365 or A-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was compared with those of cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against a broad spectrum of 486 organisms and with that of cefotaxime against 114 organisms. Cefmenoxime and cefotaxime exhibited nearly equivalent activities against those organisms tested and were the most active of these cephalosporins against all aerobic and facultative organisms except Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefmenoxime required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (MIC(90)) ranged from 0.06 to 8 mug/ml for the Enterobacteriaceae. The MIC(90)s for gram-positive cocci were 0.015 and </=0.008 mug/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively, and 2 mug/ml for S. aureus. Group D streptococci were less susceptible. Cefmenoxime was very active against Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis with MIC(90)s ranging from </=0.008 to 0.25 mug/ml. Cefmenoxime, at a concentration of 16 mug/ml, inhibited 78% and 73% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., respectively. MICs for anaerobes ranged from 0.5 to >128 mug/ml with good activity against the gram-positive organisms. In addition, cefmenoxime activity was bactericidal and only slightly affected by differences in inoculum size. The combination of cefmenoxime and gentamicin was synergistic against 80% of the Enterobacteriaceae and 100% of P. aeruginosa strains tested. Development of resistance to cefmenoxime was slow or absent for organisms with low initial MICs but more rapid for those with higher initial MICs. Cefmenoxime exhibited good protective activity in mice infected with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, or S. aureus but was less effective against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Comparative in vitro studies of Ro 13-9904, a new cephalosporin derivative.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 13-9904, a new cephalosporin derivative, was compared with the activities of cephalothin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam against 591 clinical isolates of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. The spectra of activity and potency of Ro 13-9904 and cefotaxime were quite similar; they were the most active agents against Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis. Moxalactam was only slightly less active against these organisms. Ro 13-9904, cefotaxime, and moxalactam were approximately equal in activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa; concentrations of 50 to 100 microgram/ml inhibited over 90% of the strains tested. Cefamandole and cephalothin were the most active drugs tested against staphylococci. Moxalactam demonstrated the highest intrinsic activity against Bacteroides fragilis; a concentration of 1.6 microgram/ml inhibited over 50% of the strains. All six of the antibiotics were essentially inactive against group D streptococci. The action of all of the antibiotics was bactericidal, with minimal bactericidal concentrations generally being no more than twofold greater than minimal inhibitory concentrations. The only exception to this was found when large inocula of Staphylococcus aureus were tested. Increased inoculum size generally sharply reduced the activity of Ro 13-9904, cefotaxime, and moxalactam against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Cefotaxime CSF levels in children with purulent meningitis (author's transl)].
AB  - Cefotaxime concentrations obtained in the C.S.F. of twelve children suffering from bacterial meningitis and undergoing monotherapy with this antibiotic are reported. Among these 12 patients, 4 infants (aged 3 to 28 days) had neonatal meningitis (due to Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli); one infant (2 months old) had meningitis due to Salmonella panama; 5 children (aged 5 to 11 months) had meningitis due to Haemophilus; and 2 children had belated superinfection caused by a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt due to Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefotaxime concentration reached a high level as early as one hour after the injection (3 to 19 mcg/ml), remained at this level until the fifth hour (1,8 to 14,3 mcg/ml) and decreased without significant proportionality with the disappearance of the inflammatory symptoms. Compared to the M.I.C. of the bacteria which caused the twelve cases of meningitis, these results show that the concentrations in the C.S.F. are much higher than the M.I.C.'s. These results are comparable to those of previous studies. Cefotaxime diffuses in the C.S.F. and gives concentrations which ensures an antibacterial activity that ampicillin could not reach: in particular against Haemophilus influenzae and enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 13-9904, a new beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Ro 13-9904 against 245 clinical isolates was determined by an agar dilution method. The activity of Ro 13-9904 against most Enterobacteriaceae was similar to that of cefotaxime; it was slightly more active than cefotaxime against Proteus mirabilis, Providencia species, and Serratia marcescens, but slightly less active against Klebsiella species. Ro 13-9904 was twofold more active than cefotaxime and threefold more active than ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with a mean MIC of 7.2 micrograms/ml; isolates highly resistant to ticarcillin were inhibited by a mean MIC of 17.2 micrograms/ml. Ro 13-9904 was fourfold more active than ampicillin against susceptible Haemophilus influenzae and was equally active against beta-lactamase-producing isolates. Ro 13-9904 was highly active against pneumococci and moderately active (MIC, 4 micrograms/ml) against Staphylococcus aureus isolates, whether they were susceptible or resistant to penicillin G. Oxacillin-resistant S. aureus and Streptococcus faecalis were completely resistant to Ro 13-9904 (MIC, greater than 128 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Antibacterial properties of Ro 13-99041, a long-acting new cephalosporin.
AB  - The antibacterial properties of the new cephalosporin RO 13-9904 were investigated in vitro and in vivo. The compound showed good activity against Entero-bacteriaceae and gram-positive cocci, except Streptococcus faecalis. Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis were extremely susceptible to Ro 13-9904. The bactericidal activity of Ro 13-9004 was comparable to that of cefotaxime. The new cephalosporin showed better therapeutic efficacy in mice against Pseudomonas aeruginosa than cefotaxime, cefoperazone, azlocillin, and piperacillin. Ro 13-9904 was highly effective in prophylactic studies, in contrast to cefotaxime, SCE-1365, cefoperazone and piperacillin. This indicates that Ro 13-9004 essentially differs from other beta-lactam compounds in showing unusually prolonged in vivo efficacy.
TI  - A comparison of cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone:  an in vitro test on a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of 9 species and 1 genus of bacteria.
AB  - The sensitivity of a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens to cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone was determined in vitro. All bacterial cultures were examined for beta-lactamase production using the chromogenic cephalosporin compound 87/312. All strains were typed by means of antibiotic and chemotherapeutic sensitivities. Only non-identical strains were used. A tray method was used to determine the quantity of antimicrobial product necessary for a complete growth inhibition at various culture dilutions. The results showed that all strains of H. influenzae, especially in the dilution 2.10(6), were sensitive to the five cephalosporins. The other species and genus of bacteria had a varying sensitivity to the five cephalosporins. Cefoperazone had potent activity against Ps. aeruginosa. Differences between the five cephalosporins with regard to the effect of culture dilution were only small.
TI  - Cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities.
AB  - The activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-(Z)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetraz ol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, was compared with that of other cephalosporins. Cefmenoxime exhibited high activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime against Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive Proteus, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter freundii, was 10 to 1,000 times greater than that of several other cephalosporins. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cefmenoxime showed activity two to four times that of sulbenicillin and carbenicillin but less than that of cefsulodin. Variation in pH, addition of horse serum, and type of growth medium had definite effects on the activity of cefmenoxime, and the inoculum size affected the activity against bacterial species. In Escherichia coli cefmenoxime showed marked affinity for penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP-3), followed by PBP-1 (1A and 1B). This affinity profile was well correlated with its filamentous cell-forming activity under extremely low drug concentrations and with its bactericidal activity against microorganisms. The high in vitro activity of cefmenoxime was reflected in the degree of protection observed in mice infected intraperitoneally with a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, cefmenoxime showed good therapeutic activity against infection models in mice such as respiratory tract infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and urinary tract infection caused by Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - In vitro antagonism by erythromycin of the bactericidal action of antimicrobial agents against common respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Ten strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were tested in vitro against erythromycin combined with ampicillin, cefamandole, or gentamicin. Antagonism by erythromycin occurred with 47% of the combinations involving strains of S. aureus and to a lesser degree with H. influenzae. Synergy occurred most commonly with H. influenzae (27%). The high frequency of antagonism and synergy with these organisms was associated with a broad range of bacteriostatic action by erythromycin against these same bacteria. The implications for the treatment of pneumonia are discussed.
TI  - Phosphonopeptide antibacterial agents related to alafosfalin: design, synthesis,  and structure-activity relationships.
AB  - Dipeptide variants of alafosfalin (L-alanyl-L-1-aminoethylphosphonic acid) with substantial differences in potency and antibacterial spectrum in vitro and in vivo have been synthesized. Certain dipeptides with alternatives to the L-alanyl residue had broader antibacterial spectra; activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was included. Some compounds had better in vivo activity than alafosfalin when introduced into infected rodents orally, but for the majority of the more active phosphonodipeptides, parenteral administration was more effective. Certain oligopeptides derived from the more active phosphonodipeptides possessed good in vitro activity against an extended range of organisms; they included Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The in vivo activity of some of these phosphono-oligopeptides was significantly greater than that of the parent dipeptide and correlated well with the in vitro results. This indicates that phosphono-oligopeptides exert part of their in vivo action directly, in addition to that arising from smaller peptides produced by peptidase cleavage.
TI  - Ro 13-9904, a long-acting broad-spectrum cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  - Ro 13-9904, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was found to have high in vitro activity against Enterobacteriaceae and other gram-negative bacteria, including various isolates resistant to cefuroxime, cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cefazolin. It showed promising activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although inhibitory against Staphylococcus aureus at concentrations readily achievable in plasma, it was less potent against this pathogen than cefamandole, cefazolin, or cefuroxime. Isolates of Streptococcus faecalis were uniformly resistant to all the cephalosporins tested. Ro 13-9904 was more active than cefotaxime against Proteus mirabilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae, but less active against S. aureus. Ro 13-9904 was stable to various types of beta-lactamases. Its therapeutic efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice was equal to or slightly superior to that of cefotaxime and SCE-1365 when the antibiotics were administered in repeated subcutaneous doses after bacterial challenge. Cefoperazone, and particularly cefamandole nafate, cefazolin, and mezlocillin were less effective. Although structurally related to cefotaxime and SCE-1365, Ro 13-9904 was found to differ from them in one important respect, namely, in having a long duration of action; this was observed with single-dose treatment given before bacterial challenge. Its broad spectrum of activity coupled with favorable pharmacokinetic properties make Ro 13-9904 a promising compound for clinical studies.

TI  - Rapid diagnosis of infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria by means of an enzyme radioisotopic assay.
AB  - We developed a sensitive enzyme radioisotopic assay for the measurement of beta-lactamase, an enzyme produced by a number of pathogenic bacteria. This ERIA was 100-fold more sensitive than the commonly used iodometric or spectrophotometric assays for the measurement of beta-lactamase and, unlike these other assays, the ERIA was not significantly influenced by serum proteins or unlabeled penicillin. Clinical specimens consisting of blood, peritoneal, pleural, and cerebrospinal fluids from patients infected with beta-lactamase-producing organisms yielded positive ERIA tests; fluids from uninfected patients were negative. The ERIA takes approximately 90 minutes to perform, and offers great potential for the rapid diagnosis of serious bacterial infections caused by bacteria which produce beta-lactamase.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of cerumen.
AB  - Freshly collected cerumen (dry form) suspended at a concentration of 3% in glycerol-sodium bicarbonate buffer showed bactericidal activity against some strains of bacteria tested. This suspension reduced the viability of Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli K-12, and Serratia marcescens by more than 99%, whereas the viability of two Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, E. coli K-1, Streptococcus, and two Staphylococcus aureus isolates of human origin was reduced by 30 to 80%. The results support the hypothesis that cerumen functions to kill certain foreign organisms which enter the ear canal.
TI  - Cellulitis: bacterial etiology, clinical features, and laboratory findings.
AB  
TI  - Comparative in vitro appraisal of piperacillin, including its activity against Salmonella typhi.
AB  - Piperacillin was evaluated in vitro against 711 clinical isolates of aerobic and  anerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including 76 isolates of Salmonella typhi. Piperacillin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were compared with those of a range of beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, and other antimicrobial agents, and inoculum size effects were considered. The relationship between dilution and disk diffusion tests was studied by regression analysis. In addition, piperacillin was assessed in combination with aminoglycoside and other beta-lactam drugs. This investigation has confirmed the activity of piperacillin against a broad range of bacteria, including Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria, beta-lactamase-negative Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus as well as enterococci, Bacteroides fragilis, and other anaerobes. All strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by </=32 mug/ml or less, demonstrating again the potential usefulness of piperacillin in the treatment of pseudomonal infections. S. typhi proved susceptible to piperacillin, all isolates being inhibited by 1 mug/ml. Inoculum size experiments showed that inocula of 10(8) CFU resulted in MICs and MBCs appreciably higher than those resulting from inocula of 10(6) CFU, and inocula of 10(2) CFU resulted in MICs and MBCs appreciably lower than those resulting from inocula of 10(4) CFU. Piperacillin was active against all gentamicin-resistant pseudomonads tested, but not against gentamicin-resistant klebsiellas and enterobacters. Combinations of piperacillin with tobramycin and amikacin were consistently synergistic against Pseudomonas and Serratia isolates. Less consistent results were shown when piperacillin was combined with aminoglycosides or cephalothin against Klebsiella and indole-positive Proteus isolates, although synergy was observed in most cases. Occasional antagonistic reactions were encountered with piperacillin-cephalothin or piperacillin-tobramycin combinations against the latter isolates.
TI  - Haemophilus infections in cystic fibrosis.
AB  
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activity of Sch 21420, a gentamicin B derivative, with those of amikacin, gentamicin, netilmicin, sisomicin, and tobramycin.
AB  - Sch 21420 is a new aminoglycoside synthesized from gentamicin B. Susceptibility tests with Sch 21420, amikacin, gentamicin, netilmicin, sisomicin, and tobramycin were performed on a variety of bacterial species including 44 with known mechanisms of resistance to aminoglycosides. Sch 21420 and amikacin had similar effects on all except Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria species, which were more susceptible to amikacin. Except with some strains of Serratia marcescens, the drugs used were bactericidal. Sch 21420 and amikacin were more stable than the other four aminoglycosides in the presence of the inactivating enzymes produced by some strains. Strains which were very resistant to Sch 21420 and emikacin either were permeability mutants or produced AAC (6')-I inactivating enzyme. The effect of cations on the susceptibilities of these strains to Sch 21420 and amikacin was seen mostly with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to Sch 21420 with Acinetobacter. Cations did not affect the susceptibilities of other Pseudomonas species, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus faecalis to Sch 21420 or amikacin.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility of the cephalosporin Ro 13-9904 to beta-lactamases.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 13-9904 was assessed against clinical isolated of common bacteria. Its activity against most enterobacteria was similar to that of cefotaxime and moxalactam, but it was even more active than these compounds against all Proteus species. It was also highly active against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase producers. Like cefotaxime and moxalactam, Or 13-9904 was approximately eightfold more active than carbenicillin against most isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and also active against highly carbenicillin-resistant isolates, but it was relatively inactive against moderately carbenicillin-resistant isolates. Ro 13-9904 also resembled cefotaxime and moxalactam in that it was active, though less so than cephaloridine, against staphylococci and streptococci, except for methicillin-resistant staphylococci and Streptococcus faecalis, which were resistant to it. It was less active than cefoxitin but slightly more active than ampicillin against both Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. Ro 13-9904 was resistant to most beta-lactamases but was attacked by enzymes from B. fragilis, isolates of indole-positive Proteus species, and also by a cefoxitin-hydrolyzing enzyme from an isolate of Enterobacter cloacae.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies of cefoperazone in children (author's transl)].
AB  - As a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (CPZ), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) When tested against 10 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of CPZ was found to be weaker than that of CEZ. Against 5 strains of A-beta-Streptococcus and 4 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, both CPZ and CEZ exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. CPZ was effective against 18 strains of Escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. Against 15 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of Haemophilus parahaemolyticus, CPZ was found to be more effective than CEZ though several high-resistant strains were noted. CPZ also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than CEZ against 4 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 5 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of Salmonella sp., 4 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of Proteus sp. (2) The mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of CPZ to three children was 70 minutes. (3) One hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of CPZ to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. In one case, the CSF/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) The average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) Eighteen pediatric patients received CPZ in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. They were RTI in 7, URI in 5, UTI in 5, SSSS in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. The clinical effectiveness of CPZ was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. One patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. The three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) Side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of GOT and GPT, and 1 case of mild elevation of GOT. All were considered to be minor.

TI  - Microorganisms isolated from blood and cerebrospinal fluid in a general hospital. Clinical implications.
AB  - This study is a review of 1,040 significant positive blood cultures from 415 patients, and 44 positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures from 44 patients treated at the Meir General Hospital during the period 1976-78. The most frequent isolates from blood cultures were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The most frequent isolates from cerebrospinal fluid cultures were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis, which were present in similar proportions. E. coli was predominant in the division of medicine, Staph. aureus in the division of pediatrics and Klebsiella in the division of surgery. Fifty percent of the E. coli isolates were sensitive to ampicillin and carbenicillin; about 80%, to cephalothin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim; and 100%, to gentamicin. Only 7% of the Klebsiella isolates were sensitive to apicillin; 72% were sensitive to cephalothin and 87%, to gentamicin. Only 18% of Staph. aureus isolates were sensitive to penicillin, but about 95% were sensitive to methicillin or cephalothin. Two of 10 salmonellae isolates and 13% of H. influenzae were resistant to ampicillin.
TI  - Chronic otitis media in children. Microbiological studies.
AB  - Aspiration of the exudate through the open perforation was performed in 68 children with chronic otitis media. The middle ear aspirate and a swab specimen of the external auditory canal were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Seventy-eight isolates were recovered from the middle ears, 99 from the external ear canals, and 95 were present at both sites. Aerobes only were isolated from 33 patients (48.5%), nine (13.2%) had only anaerobes, and 26 (38%) had a culture that grew both aerobes and anaerobes. There were 99 aerobic isolates. Aerobes commonly recovered were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. There were 74 anaerobes isolated. Anaerobes commonly isolated were anerobic Gram-positive cocci, Bacteroides sp, and Clostridium sp. These findings demonstrate the polymicrobial bacteriology of chronic otitis media in children. Cultures collected from the external auditory canals prior to their sterilization can be misleading. Reliable information can be obtained from the ear exudates when collected through the open perforation in the tympanic membrane.
TI  - Indirect sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rapid detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 antigen.
AB  - An indirect sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of the polysaccharide antigen of type 3 pneumococcus (SSS-III) is reported. Polystyrene balls with attached anti-SSS-III antibody serve as the solid phase, and antigen is detected using an alkaline phosphatase-labeled antiglobulin conjugate. The reaction is quantitated by spectrophotometry. Concentrations of antigen are estimated by comparison with standard curves prepared with purified SSS-III. For this assay, the practical lower limit of detection of SSS-III is approximately 2 to 3 ng/ml, thus making the test sensitivity about 25 times that reported for counterimmunoelectrophoresis. In preliminary tests with simulated human clinical specimens, none of the body fluids tested (spinal fluid, serum, urine, and sputum) interfered with detection of antigen, nor did they produce false-positive or false-negative results. Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 whole organisms were readily detected in simulated clinically positive sputum specimens. Cross-reactions were not observed with Haemophilus influenzae type b, group B Streptococcus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of a new stabilized thienamycin, N-formimidoyl thienamycin, in comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new crystalline derivative of thienamycin, N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787), was tested against 46 laboratory reference strains and 2,158 clinical isolates of gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including anaerobes, and compared with cefoxitin, cefaxolin, carbenicillin, and amikacin. MK0787 was significantly more active than the reference antibiotics against most bacteria tests. MK0787 was 16- to 500-fold more active than the other antibiotics against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and group A and group B streptococci, inhibiting most isolates at concentrations less than 0.031 micrograms/ml. The inhibition concentration against over 90% of 156 strains of Streptococcus faecalis was 1 micrograms/ml. MK0787 had slightly less activity than carbenicillin against Haemophilus influenzae. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of MK0787 against strains of Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Serratia marcescems. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Clostridium difficile that are resistant to currently available antibiotics were less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. The only species found resistant to MK0787 was Pseudomonas maltophilia, which was equally nonsusceptible to the other reference antibiotics.
TI  - Bacteriology of sputum in cystic fibrosis: evaluation of dithiothreitol as a mucolytic agent.
AB  - Liquefaction and homogenization have been recommended to ensure accurate, representative sputum cultures. We evaluated dithiothreitol (DTT) as mucolytic agent for culturing sputum samples obtained from 79 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Liquefaction with DTT was not superior to direct plating of specimens for routine qualitative cultures. Unliquefied sputum cultures failed to direct 3 of 47 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates; DTT-treated specimens missed 5 of 13 Candida albicans isolates. Neither treated nor untreated sputum cultures were completely successful in detecting Staphylococcus aureus or Enterobacteriaceae. Since Haemophilus influenzae was recovered from only two qualitative cultures, we could not evaluate the effect of DTT on the receovery of this organism. However, 27 of 29 strains of H. influenzae were inhibited by concentrations of DTT near the recommended final working concentration of 50 micrograms/ml, suggesting that liquefaction might impair isolation of this organism. Liquefaction with DTT permitted quantitative cultures of CF sputum. The predominant pathogen in our CF population was P. aeruginosa; 37 of 43 (86%) patients were colonized with this organism. Median densities of rough and mucoid strains were 3.2 x 10(7) and 4.3 x 10(7) colony-forming units per ml, respectively. Previous oral antistaphylococcal therapy may have accounted for the observed low density of S. aureus (mean density, 3.5 x 10(3) colony-forming units per ml). We conclude that DTT treatment does not improve recovery of organisms from qualitative cultures but does facilitate quantitative studies of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in CF sputum.
TI  - GR-20263: a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with high activity against Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The in vitro activity of GR-20263, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was compared with the activities of other beta-lactam antibiotics by using 800 clinical bacterial isolates. GR-20263 was highly active (inhibition of 90% of the isolates between 0.03 and 1 microgram/ml) against the common Enterobacteriaceae and 5 to 20 times more active than cefuroxime, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. GR-20263 was three to six times less active than cefotaxime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella, and Shigella, but three to four times more active than cefotaxime against Proteus vulgaris and Serratia marcescens. The activity of GR-20263 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 2 and 8 micrograms/ml for 90 and 100% of the isolates, respectively) was similar to that of tobramycin, 2 times that of cefsulodin, 5 times that of piperacillin, and 10 times that of cefotaxime. Against Haemophilus influenzae GR-20263 was three time more active than ampicillin. The beta-lactamase-producing strains were as susceptible to GR-20263 as the beta-lactamase-negative strains. GR-20263 was less active than cefotaxime and ampicillin against Staphylococcus aureus.

AB  - The in vitro activity of GR 20263, a new cephalosporin, was compared primarily with the activities of moxalactam (LY 127935), cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, and cefazolin against 293 clinical isolates of a variety of gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of GR 20263 for 90% of group isolates were between 0.06 and 0.5 microgram/ml for the Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Lancefield group A beta-hemolytic streptococci; 2 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 16 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus aureus; and in excess of 128 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides fragilis and Lancefield group D streptococci. In comparison with the other agents, GR 20263 was markedly more active against the Enterobacteriaceae than cefuroxime, cefoxitin, and cefazolin, but marginally less active than moxalactam or cofotaxime. Aganist S. aureus, cefazolin was 16-fold and cefotaxime was 4-fold more active than GR 20263 and moxalactam. GR 20263 was eight-fold more active than cefotaxime and moxalactam against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Cellulitis: a prospective study.
AB  - We prospectively studied 20 children, ages 2 to 12 years, seen with cellulitis. Each child had a complete blood count, a blood culture, and a culture of an aspirate from the lesion. The age of the child, the fever, and the extent of cellulitis determined whether the child was hospitalized. Outpatient antibiotic therapy was penicillin or dicloxacillin. Four children (20%) had an infection on the upper extremity: 14 (70%), the leg; 1 (5%), the forehead; and one (5%), the periorbital area. Three children (15%) had a white blood cell (WBC) count greater than or equal to 15,000 cu mm. Two were febrile. One child with a WBC count less than or equal to 15,000 cu mm was febrile. Two blood cultures (10%) were positive, both for Haemophilus influenzae. Twelve organisms were isolated from the aspirates: 8 Staphylococcus aureus (all penicillinase producing), 2 H influenzae, 1 Streptococcus pyogenes, and 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both children with H influenzae were febrile with WBC counts greater than or equal to 15,000 cu mm. Of the 17 children (85%) treated as outpatients, all but one responded. We recommend admission and cultures of the blood and an aspirate of the lesion for all facial cellulitis and treatment with oxacillin and chloramphenicol. In a truncal or extremity cellulitis, initial therapy should be directed against S aureus. If the child is febrile or the WBC count greater than or equal to 15,000 cu mm, H influenzae is a likely pathogen and thus intravenous chloramphenicol must be used after cultures are obtained.
TI  - Moxalactam (6059-S), a novel 1-oxa-beta-lactam with an expanded antibacterial spectrum: laboratory evaluation.
AB  - Moxalactam (6059-S) {7beta-[2-carboxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamido]-7alpha-methoxy-3-[[(1-methyl-1H-t etrazol-5-yl)thio]-methyl]-1-oxa-1-dethia-3-cephem-4- carboxylic acid disodium salt} is a new semisynthetic 1-oxa-beta-lactam derivative for parenteral use. It was highly active against a broad range of gram-negative microorganisms, including those resistant to other cephalosporins. Moreover, it had widely expanded antibacterial spectra which included Haemophilus influenzae, indole-positive Proteus, Enterobacter, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides fragilis. When a large number of clinical isolates of the above-named bacilli were tested by the agar dilution method, using an inoculum size of one loopful of 10(6) or 10(8) organisms or both per ml, the 70% minimal inhibitory concentrations at the lower inoculum were 0.2, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 25, and 0.8 mug/ml, respectively. Its activity appeared to be independent of inoculum size and addition of serum. In these organisms, morphological response of the exposed cells revealed that the bacteriolytic effect of 6059-S was initiated by a concentration equivalent to the minimal inhibitory concentration. 6059-S was markedly bactericidal to both beta-lactamase-producing and -nonproducing strains of Escherichia coli; this was well reflected by its extraordinary stability to microbial beta-lactamase degradation. Administered subcutaneously in mice, 6059-S attained plasma levels and a half-life similar to those of cefazolin and exhibited potent protective efficacy against systemic infections; it also proved to be significantly more effective than either sulbenicillin or piperacillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and than either cefazolin or cefmetazole against a variety of other gram-negative bacteria.

TI  - Intravenous cefotaxime in children with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Thirteen children with meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, beta-haemolytic  streptococcus group B, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and who had been unsuccessfully treated with other antibiotics or had causative organisms which were resistant to available antibiotics were treated with intravenous cefotaxime. Nine children were cured; in one case infection (with a different organism) recurred but a further course of cefotaxime was successful; one child died, with sterile CSF; one child died from his underlying disease (astrocytoma); and one child was cured with sequelae (hydrocephalus). A further child with meningitis caused by E. coli had been treated unsuccessfully by intravenous and intraventricular chloramphenicol and gentamicin; intravenous and intraventricular cefotaxime was successful. The agent was well tolerated. CSF levels were measured in seven children and ranged from 300 to 27 200 microgram/l; published and unpublished in-vitro studies suggest that minimum inhibitory concentrations for cefotaxime against the organisms commonly causing bacterial meningitis are usually well below 250 microgram/l.
TI  - [Quantitative cytobacteriological study of sputum in chronic bronchitics (author's transl)].
AB  - A quantitative cytobacteriological study of sputum was carried out in 259 chronic bronchitics. In non-purulent sputum (leukocyte count lower than 2,000/mm3), flora identified was salivary in 73% of the cases. In purulent sputum (leukocyte count higher than 5 000/mm3), the most frequently identified predominant bacterial species were Haemophilus influenzae (20%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.5%). In the most severely ill patients, admitted to the intensive care unit, Haemophilus influenzae was rarely identified as a predominant bacteria (9.8%), whereas in 26.3% of the cases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified as the only bacteria present. In the less severely ill chronic bronchitis admitted to the medical department, the most common bacteria was Haemophilus influenzae (34.4%), Streptococci (19%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (8.8%). The leukocyte count in sputum was systematically higher in the patients admitted to the intensive care unit even when the mean bacterial concentration was identical to that observed in the patients in the medical department.

TI  - In vitro studies of moxalactam (LY127935), a new beta-lactam antibiotic with significant activity against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Moxalactam (LY127935) is a new beta-lactam antibiotic which is chemically related to the cephalosporins. The agent is highly active against the Enterobacteriaceae, with most organisms sensitive to 0.1 mcg/ml or less. It is also active at low concentration against gentamicin-resistant strains of Providencia and Serratia. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of moxalactam for Pseudomonas aeruginosa are approximately four-fold lower than those of carbenicillin for the same isolates. It is highly active against Hemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains, with all strains tested sensitive to 0.1 mcg/ml or less. The majority of strains of Neisseria gonorrheae and Neisseria meningitidis are sensitive to 0.1 mcg/ml or less. Moxalactam is more active against Bacteroides fragilis than cefoxitin. However, activity of moxalactam against gram-positive cocci was uniformly less than cephalothin and other cephalosporins tested. Little effect of inoculum size was observed with moxalactam except for particular strains of gram-negative bacilli. The drug was found to be 40-43% bound to human serum proteins.
TI  - Clinical trials with cefoperazone in the field of internal medicine in Japan.
AB  - A total of 466 patients were treated with cefoperazone. The drug was usually administered by drip infusion of 2 to 4 gm/day. Therapy was described as markedly effective and moderately effective in 64 of 77 patients (83.1%) treated for urinary tract infections; 253 of 316 patients (80.1%) treated for respiratory infections; 37 of 48 patients (77.1%) treated for liver biliary duct infections; ten of 16 patients (62.5%) treated for septicemia; and seven of nine patients (77.8%) being treated for other infections. Overall, cefoperazone was effective 79.6% of all patients treated. With respect to bacteriological activity, the overall eradication rate for gram-negative organisms (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella sp, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter sp, and Proteus sp) was 81% (182/225) and for gram-positive (Staphyloccocus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis) 90% (36/40). Of 205 patients who failed to respond to previous antibiotic therapy, 67.8% were treated effectively with cefoperazone. Side effects, such as skin eruption, pyrexia and diarrhea, occurred in only 4.8% of patients treated, while laboratory abnormalities, such as elevated glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and eosinophil values, occurred in only 6.4% of the treated patients. None of these abnormal values were of clinical significance.

TI  - Electron microscopy of malachite green--glutaraldehyde fixed bacteria.
AB  - Malachite green combined with glutaraldehyde has been used recently as a fixative for preserving and revaling lipid complexes in thin sections of eukaryotic cells examined by electron microscopy. When bacteria were prefixed with the above mixture granular electron dense inclusions were revealed in all cultures tested. These inclusions were replaced by electron transparent areas in cells fixed with glutaraldehyde alone. The structures were frequently located near to or within the nucleoid and adjacent to the cell membrane in Gram-negative bacteria and were associated with the nucleoid and mesosomes in Gram-positive species. Polyhydroxybutyrate granules, generally poorly preserved in thin sections of Aquaspirillum serpens, were well preserved by the malachite green-glutaraldehyde fixative. Malachite green complexes were observed outside of the cells in all preparations. Capsules were neither preserved nor stained.
TI  - Indirect sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rapid detection of Haemophilus influenzae type b infection.
AB  - We report the development and testing of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with excellent sensitivity for the detection of Haemophilus influenzae type b (HI(b)) antigen in clinical specimens from patients with HI(b) meningitis. The assay, an indirect sandwich technique, uses polystyrene balls as a solid phase and an alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit globulin conjugate. Specimens are incubated with polystyrene balls armed with burro anti-HI(b) antiserum, and recognition antibody is visualized by addition of alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-globulin, together with the enzyme substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Concentrations of antigen are determined from standard curves prepared by using purified HI(b) capsular antigen polyribophosphate. The assay reproducibly detects polyribophosphate at concentrations between 1 and 5 ng/ml. Cross-reactions have not as yet been encountered in simulated and authentic clinical specimens containing other species including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, group B Streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitidis, and Listeria monocytogenes. In preliminary tests with 11 spinal fluid specimens, 2 serum specimens, and 5 urine specimens from patients with culture-proved HI(b) meningitis, antigen was detected in all specimens in concentrations ranging from 1 to 7,000 ng/ml. Antigen was not detected in any of 62 clinical specimens which were culture negative for HI(b), including 11 spinal fluid specimens from patients with bacterial meningitis caused by microorganisms other than HI(b). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique described here is considerably simpler than radioimmunoassay and, based on concurrent tests with 14 positive clinical specimens, may be more sensitive than counterimmunoelectrophoresis. It seems, therefore, to hold considerable promise for clinical use in rapid detection of systemic HI(b) infections.
TI  - LY-127935: a novel beta-lactam antibiotic with unusual antibacterial activity.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LY-127935, a new beta-lactam antibiotic, was examined by using 370 clinical bacterial strains. In comparison with several other beta-lactam agents, LY-127935 was the most inhibitory against the Enterobacteriaceae. It was remarkably active against multi-drug-resistant strains of Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. LY-127935 had four- to eightfold greater activity than did cefoxitin against Bacteroides fragilis. Production of beta-lactamase by Enterobacteriaceae did not influence the minimal inhibitory concentration of LY-127935. However, the beta-lactamase-producing strains of B. fragilis and Haemophilus influenzae had generally higher minimal inhibitory concentrations. LY-127935 was the least active agent tested against gram-positive aerobic cocci. Variations in pH, salt content, protein content, or inocula size had little influence on susceptibility to LY-127935. Although combination studies with LY-127935 and gentamicin demonstrated synergy for P. aeruginosa, the rates of killing for the combination and for gentamicin alone were similar.
TI  - Detection of experimental bacteremia and fungemia by examination of buffy coat prepared by a micromethod.
AB  - Rabbits received intravenous injections of bacteria or fungi, and a comparison was made of the abilities of broth cultures, plating after dilution either in saline solution or in distilled water containing Triton X-100, and buffy coat examinations to detect the organisms in heart blood. The most sensitive method was broth culture. By microscopy or subculture of buffy coat cells prepared by centrifugation of blood in microhematocrit tubes, organisms were rapidly and regularly detected when their viable counts increased to 300--1,000/ml as detected by plating. By micromodification, buffy coat examination is technically easy to perform, and the method is only slightly less sensitive than when a larger amount of blood is used. Thus, it would be ideal for rapid provisional diagnosis of sepsis in patients, e.g., neonates, when the use of only a small blood sample is preferred.
TI  - Gentamicin resistance in Christchurch hospitals.
AB  - Prior to June 1976, the isolation of gentamicin resistant organisms was an infrequent occurrence in North Canterbury Hospital Board institutions. During July 1976, 20 different gentamicin resistant organisms were isolated from patients in Christchurch Hospital. Gentamicin resistant organisms hav e been continually isolated from an increasingly wide area since then. The organisms involved are: providence species; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Klebsiella species; E coli; Staphyloccus aureus; Proteus mirabilis; Staphylococcus epidermidis; Acinetobacter species; Enterobacter species; Haemophilus influenzae; Pseudomonas maltophilia CDC II F; Citrobacter species; Alcaligenes odorans and Pseudomonas species. The spread of gentamicin resistant organisms has occurred rapidly in the hospital environment. The importance of the urinary tract as a reservoir of microorganisms is indicated in this report.
TI  - In vitro activity of furazlocillin (Bay k 4999) compared with those of mezlocillin, piperacillin, and standard beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The activity of furazlocillin (Bay k 4999) was compared with those of mezlocillin, piperacillin, and standard beta-lactam antibiotics against a number of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. These new expanded-spectrum penicillins were less active than penicillin G against most gram-positive organisms. Furazlocillin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin showed activity comparable to ampicillin and penicillin G against Haemophilus influenzae and penicillin-susceptible neisseriae, respectively. None of the drugs tested was effective against penicillin-resistant gonococci. The activity of furazlocillin was greater than that of mezlocillin, piperacillin, ampicillin, or carbenicillin against many Enterobacteriaceae. However, certain beta-lactam-resistant strains among these organisms were not highly susceptible to any of the three new penicillins. Furazlocillin was less active than piperacillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa but was more active than carbenicillin or mezlocillin. Inoculum effects and discrepancies between minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations were observed with furazlocillin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin against several genera. The kinetics of bacterial killing by the new penicillins were often slow and incomplete over 24 h, especially in tests with Enterobacter and P. aeruginosa. Synergy was demonstrated between furazlocillin and aminoglycosides against a variety of gram-negative bacilli and Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of azlocillin, ampicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin, alone and in combination with an aminoglycoside.
AB  - The in vitro activities of the newer semisynthetic penicillins azlocillin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin were compared with those of ampicillin and ticarcillin by using 290 clinical laboratory isolates. Piperacillin and mezlocillin were the most active against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., and Enterobacter spp. When Pseudomonas aeruginosa was tested, piperacillin and azlocillin were more active than either mezlocillin or ticarcillin. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae species were highly susceptible to all of the penicillins tested. Ticarcillin had relatively poor activity against enterococci. The rate of bacterial killing with multiples of the minimal inhibitory concentration of azlocillin, ampicillin, or ticarcillin was tested for E. coli, P. mirabilis, P. aeruginosa, and Klebsiella spp. Increasing concentrations increased the bactericidal effect. The effect of combining azlocillin, ampicillin, or ticarcillin with an aminoglycoside was studied by using both killing curves and checkerboards. The isobolograms constructed from the checkerboards showed a synergistic pattern for the organisms tested, which included E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis, and enterococci. However, the rate of killing was increased by the combination only for P. aeruginosa and enterococci.
TI  - Cefuroxime: a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacological properties and therapeutic use.
AB  - Cefuroxime is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin for parenteral administration. It is resistant to destruction by beta-lactamases produced by staphylococci and most Gram-negative aerobic bacteria and is active against many bacteria resistant to cephalothin. Cefuroxime is the most active of the cephalosporins against gonococci and Haemophilus influenzae particularly against beta-lactamase producing strains. Given by intramuscular or intravenous injection cefuroxime is effective against a wide variety of infections caused by Gram-positive or Gram-negative aerobes, but has no effect against infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or B. fragilis. Cefuroxime is of value in the treatment of respiratory infections due to Haemophilus influenzae and Streptocococcus pneumoniae and is useful against cephalosporin-resistant Klebsiella and Enterobacter infections. Cefuroxime is an alternative to spectinomycin for the treatment of beta-lactamase producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections. It is generally well tolerated and appears not to be nephrotoxic when given alone at usual dosages.

TI  - HR 756, a new cephalosporin active against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of HR 756, 7-[2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-(Z)-(methoximino)acetamido] cephalosporanic acid, was investigated against 659 isolates. HR 756 inhibited Neisseria and Haemophilus species at concentrations similar to those needed with ampicillin. It inhibited beta-lactamase-producing N. gonorrhoeae and H. influenzae. HR 756 was the most active compound tested against members of the Enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting most isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella, Enterobacter, and Shigella at concentrations of less than 0.1 mug/ml. It was twice as active as carbenicillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and inhibited Bacteroides fragilis as well as cefoxitin. HR 756 killed E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and P. aeruginosa at rates similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Etiology and antimicrobial therapy of acute maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - Eighty-one adults with symptoms of acute sinusitis were studied by direct needle  puncture and aspiration of the maxillary sinus (105 sinuses). Fifty-nine bacterial strains were isolated in titers of greater than or equal to 10(4) colony-forming units/ml; Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae accounted for 64% of the isolates. Other bacteria recovered included anaerobes (12%), Neisseria species (8.5%). Streptococcus pyogenes (3%), alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus (3%), non-group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (3%), Staphylococcus aureus (2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%), and Escherichia coli (2%). Viruses were isolated from 11 sinuses; these isolates included rhinovirus (six), influenza A (H3N2) virus (three), and two types of parainfluenza virus (one each). The efficacy of therapy with orally administered ampicillin, amoxicillin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was evaluated by a repeat sinus puncture and culture. Clinical and bacteriologic responses to all three regimens were good.

A correlation appears between the kinetics of fosformycin antibacterial action and the microbial growth rate.
TI  - Ceforanide (BL-S786) in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.
AB  - Ceforanide (BL-S 786) is a new long-acting parenteral cephalosporin which has the major pharmacologic advantage of requiring only twice a day dosage. We treated 28 adult patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia using doses of 500 or 1000 mg every 12 hours. Twenty-four of 28 infections were due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and/or Hemophilus influenzae, and all pathogens were susceptible in vitro to both cephalothin and ceforanide. Patients were treated for a mean of 7.5 days, and all showed a good clinical and radiographic response with no mortality. Of the 13 patients with H. influenzae, the organism could still be recovered during therapy in 9/12 and post therapy in 3/8. One clinical superinfection (sepsis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa) occurred during therapy. Side effects with therapy included thrombocytosis (15), asymptomatic eosinophilia (5), and mild elevation of the serum transaminases (3). These studies suggest that ceforanide is a safe and effective agent for the treatment of adult patients with bacterial pneumonia due to S. pneumoniae; further experience in therapy of H. influenzae is needed because of frequent failure of ceforanide to eradicate this organism from the sputum.
TI  - Comparative activities of ampicillin, epicillin and amoxycillin in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of three aminopenicillins ampicillin, epicillin and  amoxycillin were compared in vitro and in vivo. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the three penicillins were very similar and the compounds were active against non-beta-lactamase-producing strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Shigella species, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Streptococci including Streptococcus faecalis, and non-beta-lactamase-producing staphylococci were also sensitive to the compounds but Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter and indole-positive Proteus species were resistant. At concentrations close to MIC value epicillin and ampicillin showed similar bactericidal activity against E. coli and against S. typhi and both compounds caused a slower rate of kill than was seen with amoxycillin. Microscopical observation of the cells exposed to ampicillin and epicillin for 1 h showed the presence of filamentous forms which lysed slowly, whereas cells exposed to amoxycillin for the same period rapidly. Epicillin was similar to or slightly less active than ampicillin against experimental mouse infections, and against the majority of infections both compounds were significantly less effective than amoxycillin by the oral and subcutaneous routes of administration.
TI  - [Therapy of chronic respiratory tract infections in children, including mucoviscidosis (author's transl)].
AB  - In respiratory tract infections in children a distinction must be made between frequently recurring infections and genuine chronic infections due to specific anatomical factors, immunological defects or congenital diseases such as mucoviscidosis. The most frequent pathogens are Haemophilus influenzae, pneumococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella, S. aureus predominates in infants. The same applies for mucoviscidosis, in which P. aeruginosa is the second most frequent pathogen, occurring frequently after a primary infection with staphylococci. In order to avoid frequent relapses in mucoviscidosis patients, uninterrupted long-term treatment with an antibiotic which is effective against staphylococci is recommended, commencing the moment the diagnosis has been established. Suitable antibiotics are co-trimoxazole or oral cephalosporins (e. g. cephalexin, cephradine or cefaclor). Other respiratory tract infections should be treated according to the antibiogramme with a suitable antibiotic once the diagnosis has been confirmed.
TI  - Effect of antibiotics on the formation of specific antibodies.
AB  - Immune response to staphylococcal haemolysin and Haemophilus influenzae capsular  antigen administered simultaneously with antibiotics was studied in rabbits. In addition to specific humoral antibodies, the quantitative values of IgG, IgA, IgM and C'3 complement were determined. Statistically significant deficiency of immune response was observed in all cases in animals which were given the antigen with the antibiotic in comparison with the controls which were immunized by the antigen alone. Statistically significant differences were also observed in the levels of immunoglobulins (mainly IgG and IgM) in animals which were given antigens simultaneously with antibiotics in comparison with animals which were given antibiotics alone.
TI  - Serotypes and antibiotic susceptibilities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from single sputa of cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - A phenotypic characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from single sputum samples of 21 typical cystic fibrosis patients indicated a high frequency of heterogeneity among isolates on the basis of differences in antibiotic resistance, colony morphology, pigmentation, and serotype. Two or more isolates with different but stable susceptibilities to carbenicillin, gentamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim were detected in 38% of the sputa. Differences generally were independent of the mucoid state of the strain. O-antigen group determination with the Difco typing set showed that two or more serologically distinct strains were present in 10/21 sputum specimens. Nonmucoid derivatives of mucoid isolates almost always retained both the antibiotic susceptibilities and serotype of their parent strain. These data suggest that cystic fibrosis patients may be cocolonized/coinfected by different strains of P. aeruginosa more frequently than generally believed. Alternatively, phenotypically distinct strains from a single patient might arise as phenotypic dissociants from a single infecting strain. Because of the frequency and multiplicity of phenotypically distinct P. aeruginosa isolates which we obtained from our cystic fibrosis patients, it is important to select multiple isolates from sputum cultures for antimicrobial susceptibility testing so as to assess adequately the susceptibility of this organism to antibiotic therapy in cystic fibrosis. We recommend that several colonies of each distinguishable colony type of P. aeruginosa be pooled for the antibiogram.

TI  - HR 756, a highly active cephalosporin: comparison with cefazolin and carbenicillin.
AB  - HR 756, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with cefazolin and carbenicillin for activity against a total of 264 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus spp. (indole positive), Enterobacter spp., Salmonella typhi, Serratia marcescens, Providencia stuartii, and Staphylococcus aureus. In every comparison, except that with the last organism, HR 756 was clearly more active than cefazolin and carbenicillin. All three compounds had similar activity against penicillin-susceptible staphylococci; against penicillin-resistant strains, HR 756 and cefazolin were equally active and superior to carbenicillin. HR 756 was compared with penicillin for activity against strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Lancefield group D streptococci, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; with ampicillin against Haemophilus influenzae; and with cefoxitin against Bacteriodes fragilis. HR 756 was clearly more active than the respective reference compounds in all of these comparisons, except those involving the streptococci. HR 756 and penicillin were essentially equally active against S. pyogenes; against Lancefield group D, penicillin was 32 times as active as HR 756. HR 756 not only compared favorably with the reference compounds with respect to relative activity, but also effected growth inhibition of essentially all test organisms (P. aeruginosa and group D streptococci excepted) at remarkably low concentrations ranging from 0.015 to 2.0 mug/ml. A series of seven transfers of selected strains of E. coli, Klebsiella spp., S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa through medium containing HR 756 led to emergence of strains with significant levels of resistance to the agent. Resistance to HR 756 was retained for at least seven transfers through plain medium.
TI  - Pulmonary function and morbidity in 40 adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Pulmonary function and cardiopulmonary complications were studied in a group of 40 patients with cystic fibrosis who reached the age of 25 years. Mean values for vital capacity (VC), functional residual capacity, residual volume (RV), the ratio of RV over total lung capacity (RV/TLC), conductance, and the ratio of the forced expiratory volume in one second over VC were abnormal. There was a variable pattern of progression from patient to patient. The men differed from the women only in that they had a significantly larger TLC and inspiratory capacity than the women. The resultant preservation of VC may have an advantage for survival in those patients in whom it is observed. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was encountered with increasing frequency with age. Massive hemoptysis did not result in early death. The occurrence of rightsided heart failure secondary to cor pulmonale, with or without respiratory failure, was a poor prognostic sign.
TI  - Clavulanic acid, a novel inhibitor of beta-lactamases.
AB  - Clavulanic acid, Z-(2R,5R)-3-(beta-hydroxyethylidene)-7-oxo-4-oxa-1-azabicyclo-[3,2,0] heptane-2-carboxylic acid, has been shown to be an effective inhibitor of the beta-lactamases of the Richmond types II, III, IV, and V. Inhibition is a time-dependent reaction and is irreversible. Clavulanic acid had poor antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with minimal inhibitory levels greater than 25 mug/ml. It did inhibit the majority of Neisseria gonorrhoeae at 0.1 mug/ml and Haemophilus influenzae at 6.3 mug/ml. Clavulanic acid acted synergistically with penicillins and cephalosporins to inhibit beta-lactamase-producing S. aureus and Enterobacteriaceae. Clavulanic acid combined with ampicillin inhibited beta-lactamase-producing N. gonorrhoeae, H. influenzae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, and Shigella sonnei.
TI  - Comparison of the in vitro activity of Bay k 4999 and piperacillin, two new antipseudomonal broad-spectrum penicillins, with other beta-lactam drugs.
AB  - Bay k 4999 and piperacillin, two new substituted ampicillins, were compared with  other beta-lactam antibiotics, including carbenicillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, and cefoxitin, against a wide range of gram-positive and -negative organisms. Bay k 4999 and piperacillin were extremely active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (50% inhibited by 2 mug/ml), being about 16-fold more active than carbenicillin. Bay k 4999 was the most active drug against Escherichia coli (50% inhibited by 0.5 mug/ml) and Klebsiella spp. (50% inhibited by 2 mug/ml). Piperacillin and Bay k 4999 were equally active against Proteus spp., and piperacillin had high activity against Bacteroides fragilis (50% inhibited by between 1 and 2 mug/ml).
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on new semisynthetic penicillin, PC-904, in pediatric field (author's transl)].
AB  - PC-904 was administered to 16 pediatric patients and the following basic and clinical results were obtained. (1) PC-904 was administered 20 approximately 30 mg/kg. The serum peak level of PC-904 after drip intravenous infusion over 1 hour was 66.7 microgram/ml at 1 hour and T 1/2 of PC-904 was 67.8 minutes. PC-904 was administered 25 approximately 30 mg/kg intravenous one shot injection was 49.4 microgram/ml at 1 hour and T 1/2 of PC-904 was 52.2 minutes. (2) Urinary excretion rate was about 20% up to 6 hours after drip intravenous infusion of 20 mg/kg. In a case of intravenous one shot injection of 25 approximately 30 mg/kg, the excretion rate was 11.9 approximately 19.9%. (3) PC-904 was administered 60 approximately 120 mg/kg/day for 3 approximately 48 days to 5 cases of sepsis and bacterial endocarditis, 6 of pneumonia, 2 of sss syndrome (staphylococcal scald skin syndrome) and 3 of pyelonephritis. Clinical effects were excellent in 11 cases and good in 5 cases, effective ratio being 100%. (4) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus viridans, Acinetobacter anitratus and Hemophilus influenzae isolated from clinical specimens disappeared by the treatment of PC-904, and Hemophilus influenzae isolated from clinical specimens disappeared by the treatment of PC-904. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae reduced. (5) As to the side effect by PC-904, s-GOT and s-GPT were elevated in 2 cases. Anemia, rash and fever were observed in each 1 case out of 16 patients though the causal relation with the agent was unknown.
TI  - The critical role of iron in host-bacterial interactions.
AB  - The ability of potential pathogens to acquire iron in a host is an important determinant of both their virulence and the nature of the infection produced. Virulent gram-negative bacteria are capable of acquiring sufficient iron from the host because their virulence (for chick embryos) is unaffected by exogenous iron. Avirulent mutants which are apparently limited in their ability to acquire iron could be isolated from the virulent strains. The lethality of these mutants was significantly enhanced by exogenous iron. Reduction of the relatively high serum iron saturation of chick embryos (to levels more closely approximating those in man) by pretreatment with iron-binding proteins or endotoxin inhibits the lethality of some virulent bacteria. Those bacteria whose virulence was reduced include the Shigella, Vibrio cholerae and strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, all of which are nondisseminating pathogens in the normal human host. Pathogens which produce septicemic and disseminating infections such as Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type B, Escherichia coli possessing K-1 antigen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium and disseminating strains of N. gonorrhoeae were, in general, unaffected by reduced serum iron saturation. These disseminating bacteria appeared to produce greater quantities of compounds (siderophores) which stimulated microbial growth in low-iron media than did the nondisseminating pathogens. Thus, the gram-negative bacteria tested can be divided into four major classes according to their responses to modifications in iron levels in the chick embryo model and these results correlate with the nature of the infections which they typically produce in man.
TI  - Bacterial etiology of otitis media during the first six weeks of life.
AB  - Tympanocentesis was performed on 70 infants who had otitis media during the first six weeks of life. The bacteria isolated from their middle-ear effusions were Streptococcus pneumoniae (13 patients), Neisseria catarrhalis (11 patients), Hemophilus influenzae (ten patients), Enterobacteriaceae (four patients), Staphylococcus aureus (four patients), streptococci (groups A and B) (three patients), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two patients). Thirty patients (42.9%) had middle-ear effusions which did not contain pathogenic bacteria. Twenty-seven infants were followed for at least 12 months and 12 (44.4%) of these infants had six or more episodes of otitis media during the observation period. Further studies will be needed to establish the significance of middle-ear disease at this age and the role of therapy in improving its outcome.
TI  - Activity of azlocillin and mezlocillin against gram-negative organisms: comparison with other penicillins.
AB  - The activities of azlocillin and mezlocillin were compared with those of carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and pirbenicillin against a wide range of gram-negative organisms. The two new drugs were considerably more active than carbenicillin against Klebsiella species and Escherichia coli. Carbenicillin was twice as active against Proteus mirabilis as mezlocillin and four times as active as azlocillin. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, azlocillin was eight times as active as carbenicillin. Azlocillin and mezlocillin were twice as active as carbenicillin against Bacteroides fragilis, and these drugs showed a high degree of activity against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
TI  - In vitro activity of piperacillin, a new semisynthetic penicillin with an unusually broad spectrum of activity.
AB  - The in vitro activity of piperacillin (T-1220), a new semisynthetic derivative of aminobenzylpenicillin, was investigated. The majority of streptococci and pneumococci were inhibited by 0.12 micrograms/ml; the staphylococci and enterococci were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin was slightly more active against Neisseria and Haemophilus influenzae than was ampicillin. Piperacillin was active against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae including the Klebsiella, 58% of which were inhibited by 8 micrograms/ml. The activity of piperacillin was at least equivalent, but generally superior, to that of ampicillin or carbenicillin on species susceptible to these drugs. Most striking was its activity on Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml, and 83% were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml. The minimum bactericidal concentrations were very close to the minimum inhibitory concentrations, and in most species only a slight inoculum effect was observed on the minimum bacterial values except for certain P. aeruginosa strains. A complete parallel resistance exists between piperacillin and ampicillin or carbenicillin. However, the clinical importance of this is largely mitigated by the intrinsically higher activity of piperacillin.
TI  - Qualitative study of paradoxical zone phenomenon of penicillins against 17 bacterial species of clinical importance.
AB  - Using a triple agar layer technique and enzymatic inactivation of penicillin, the occurrence of a paradoxical zone phenomenon (illustrated by a typical 'target' image around the reservoir of antibiotic) was determined for several bacterial species specially chosen with regards to their taxonomic position, clinical importance and penicillin susceptibility. Among gram-positive bacteria, a paradoxical zone was obtained for approximately 43% of the strains studied here (all 10 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, all 10 strains of Streptococcus faecalis, 7 of 10 strains of group B beta-hemolytic streptococci, 1 of 10 group A strains, 3 of 10 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 3 of 10 strains of Clostridium perfringens but for none of 10 strains each of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Listeria monocytogenes). Among gram-negative bacteria, a target image was regularly obtained with Haemophilus influenzae (all 10 strains tested) and Proteus species (9 of 10 strains) but with none of the following species: Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis and Bacteroides fragilis. Therapeutic implications of these observations are difficult to assess, and need further investigation.
TI  - beta-lactamases and R-plasmids of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The emergence of resistance to ampicillin and other antibiotics in Haemophilus influenzae has been a relatively recent event. In contrast, drug resistance has been rampant in the Enterobacteriaceae for many years. Ampicillin-resistance in H. influenzae is almost invariably attributable to possession of the TEM (Type III a)beta-lactamase. As is common in other bacteria the gene specifying this enzyme is plasmid-borne in Haemophilus. Some ampicillin-resistant strains of H. influenzae can transfer the TEM beta-lactamase gene to other strains of Haemophilus, to Escherichia coli and to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The features of such transfer are unusual and lead for example, to the induction of adenine requirement in recipient strains of P. aeruginosa. Crypticity measurements of beta-lactamase activity show that in comparison to P. aeruginosa or E. coli, the outer membrane of H. influenzae affords only a weak penetration barrier to beta-lactam antibiotics. This may have consequences for the stability and distribution of beta-lactamase production in Haemophilus spp. which are discussed. A comparison of the molecular properties of R-plasmids determining a variety of resistances and carried by strains of H. influenzae isolated in diverse geographical locations has revealed unexpected homologies. A series of such plasmids of similar molecular weights (about 30 X 10(6)) differ substantially only in the transposable resistance genes that they carry. A model based on these findings is presented to explain the acquisition of ampicillin- and other resistances by Haemophilus.
TI  - Cellular immunity to bacteria: impairment of in vitro lymphocyte responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - Lymphocyte responses to the mitogens phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A and to Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were evaluated in patients with cystic fibrosis and in normal individuals. Lymphocyte proliferation in vitro was stimulated by gentamicin-killed whole bacteria, and the proliferative response was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation. The in vitro lymphocyte responses to antibiotic-killed bacterial reached maximum thymidine incorporation after 5 days in culture and followed a unimodal dose-response curve for each of the bacteria studied. A significant specific incapacity to respond to P. aeruginosa was detected in cystic fibrosis patients with advanced clinical disease.
TI  - Precipitating antibody to antigens of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in chronic obstructive lung disease.
AB  - Two antigens designated Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytoplasmic antigen (P(1-5)) and P. aeruginosa cell wal antigen (PCW) were prepared by ultrasonic disintegration and hot phenol extraction of a smooth polyagglutinable strain of P. aeruginosa isolated from the respiratory tract. It was shown that P(1-5) and PCW are immunologically distinct, that P(1-5) is heat-labile while PCW contains a heat-stable component which stains positively for polysaccharide, is positive for endotoxin and cross-reacts with a cell wall antigen of Haemophilus influenzae prepared by hot phenol extraction. Both antigens were able to activate the alternate pathway for complement. A statistically significant number of patients with cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis have precipitating antibody to that fraction of cytoplasmic antigen specific for P. aeruginosa (P(1-2)) and PCW compared to controls, whereas patients with asthma and chronic bronchitis do not. The use of both antigens increases the number of patients with antibody to P. aeruginosa. Radioactive immunodiffusion studies indicate that 80.8% of controls have precipitating antibody to PCW antigen and that antibody to it is IgG, IgA and IgM. These studies indicate that consideration should be given to PCW as well as P(1-5) in any consideration of the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa in these conditions.
TI  - [Bacteriological findings in chronic infantile tonsillitis (author's transl)].
AB  - Under general anaesthesia cultures were taken from infantile tonsils prior to T & A. The bacteriological results and the serological classification of hemophilus are questionning literature reports. According to our findings one must consider haemophilus influencae as a resident of the common oral flora. There was no significant difference culturing tonsils with or without repeated antibiotic treatment. Hemophilus influencae combined with beta-hemolytic streptococci is common. Immunological considerations against infantile T & A, based on bacteriological observations are questioned.
TI  - Heterologous transfection with bacteriophage phiX174 DNA. Unusual heterogeneous products.
AB  - Hydroxylamine-resistant infectious materials (HARIM) synthesized in natural non-host and progeny phage low productive bacterial spheroplasts upon transfection with bacteriophage phiX174 DNA were found to be unusually heterogeneous in their forms. Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a source of HARIM, it was shown that they have the following unusual features. (1) Almost all of the HARIM are denser than normal single-stranded (SS)- and double-stranded replicative form (RF)-DNAs of phiX174 found usually in the phage-infected host cells. (2) A great part of these heavy HARIM (approximately 84%) contain a variable length of single-stranded RNA associated with their infectious elements. (3) For most of the HARIM (approximately 80% of total molecules as the infectious elements of the heavy HARIM), the infectious elements are phiX-RFI-DNA. The wide-spread system for phiX-HARIM synthesis was shown to be present in many gram-negative bacterial cells.
TI  - Transfer of a plasmid-specified beta-lactamase gene from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - A number of ampicillin-resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae could donate a gene specifying the type IIIa (TEM) beta-lactamase to Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Donor strains rapidly lost their ability to transfer ampicillin resistance on storage or subculture. Such strains also apparently contained a single species of covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid of contour length 1.2 mum, equivalent to about 2.5 x 10(6) daltons. No species of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid large enough to encode sex factor activity was detected. Despite this, transfer occurred to several bacterial genera in the presence of deoxyribonuclease, suggesting that transmissibility was by conjugation. The beta-lactamase gene was generally unstable after transfer and was lost in the absence of selection. Where stable transcipients were found, this was evidently by insertion of the beta-lactamase gene into the host chromosome. In P. aeruginosa insertion was always accompanied by induction of auxotrophy for adenine, suggesting insertion at a specific site. It is believed that insertion also occurred at one site on the chromosome of Escherichia coli. Crypticity measurements for beta-lactamase activity showed that there was little or no penetration barrier to beta-lactam drugs in Haemophilus. This may explain the long delay in the acquisition of ampicillin resistance by this organism.

TI  - Amikacin in the treatment of gram-negative bronchopulmonary infections.
AB  - Six patients with acute gram-negative bronchopulmonary infection were treated with amikacin (15 mg/kg per day) administered intramuscularly in two equal doses at 12-hr intervals for 10-13 days. Two patients had underlying nonspecific pulmonary disease, two had advanced bronchocarcinoma, and two had extensive bronchiectasis (due to chronic aspergillosis in one patient). The pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa in three patients, and Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella ozaenae, and Enterobacter cloacae each in one patient. Five patients recovered completely, with resolution of fever and other acute symptoms and elimination of the causative organism from sputum cultures. A moribund patient with advanced metastatic bronchocarcinoma died two days after the treatment with amikacin had been completed; the last specimen of sputum was still positive for P. aeruginosa. Tests of liver and renal function and blood counts revealed no abnormaltities. Complete audiometric survey showed no hearing loss. Nystagmography revealed reversible, lessened caloric response in some patients. Amikacin was well absorbed from the site of intramuscular injection. Levels of amikacin in serum varied among the subjects and, in some cases, for individual patients on different days.
TI  - Susceptibility of recently isolated bacteria to amikacin in vitro: comparisons with four other aminoglycoside antibiotics.
AB  - In vitro tests for susceptibility to amikacin and to four other aminoglycoside antibiotics were carried out with strains of many bacterial species by use of an agar dilution method and an inocula replicator. In general, amikacin was as active as or more active against most of the organims than kanamycin, neomycin, and streptomycin; in particular, amikacin was active against strains resistant to one or more of these three antibiotics. Amikacin was more active than gentamicin against strains of Nocardia asteroides and Providencia stuartii and also against gentamicin-resistant strains of some other gram-negative bacilli, notably Serratia marcescens. However, gentamicin was more active than amikacin against most of the other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that were tested. In comparative tests of four media, minimal inhibitory concentrations MICs) were greater in tests with Mueller-Hinton agar, and generally somewhat lower in those with heart infusion agar, than in tests with trypticase soy agar and nutrient agar. Inocula of a 1:1,000 dilution of culture generally gave MICs lower than those obtained with undiluted cultures; the differences were small with enterococci, but they were greater with amikacin than with gentamicin in tests on strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae. These findings generally confirm those previously reported by others.
TI  - Cystic fibrosis in adolescents and adults.
AB  - Forty-five patients (25 male and 20 female) over 12 years of age with cystic fibrosis have been studied clinically, radiologically and physiologically. Their mean age at the first visit was 17 years; they were followed for a mean period of 4 years and attended at least every six months. The first symptom which developed before the age of five in 42 of the 45 patients was respiratory. Thirty-two of the 45 patients had severe lung disease (Group III) at the start of the study of the seven patients died during the study. Cough and sputum were almost universal, 23 had haemoptyses and eight pneumothoraces. Staphylococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the common pathogens isolated from sputum and the increasing prevalence of the latter was again confirmed. Acquisition of the mucoid strain of pseudomonas signified poor prognosis. Established infection was never eradicated. Forty-three patients had evidence of pancreatic insufficiency; in all but one patient the symptoms were mild and five patients abandoned dietary restriction and pancreatin without ill effect. Seven patients had symptoms of partial bowel obstruction (meconium ileus equivalent) but only one required surgical relief. The liver was enlarged in seven patients and the spleen was felt in three. Three patients had diabetes mellitus. The influence of cystic fibrosis on growth and development is reported--the growth spurt is late in the majority but growth failure is not confined to those with severe lung infection or malabsorption and in these circumstances remains unexplained. Mean weight was low in relation to height and puberty was delayed in both sexes.
TI  - In vitro comparison of cefoxitin, cefamandole, cephalexin, and cephalothin.
AB  - The in vitro effect of cefoxitin, cefamandole, cephalexin, and cephalothin was tested against 645 strains of bacteria recently isolated from clinical sources. Against gram-positive organisms cephalothin and cefamandole were the most effective, generally being three- to fourfold more active than cephalexin or cefoxitin. Enterococci were not inhibited by less than 25 mug of any of the antibiotics per ml. Against Enterobacteriaceae, cefoxitin and cefamandole were the most active. An exception was the Enterobacter strains, against which cefoxitin was the least effective. None of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were susceptible to 100 mug of any of the cephalosporins per ml. Cefamandole was the most active agent against Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It was also the most effective agent against Haemophilus influenzae, even when taking into account a threefold inoculum effect.
TI  - [Studies on the distribution of thienylcarbenicillin in the human tissue].
AB  - Thienylcarbenicillin is another semisynthetic penicillin with a wide range of antibacterial activity including most of gram-negative bacterias, even such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To investigate penetration activities into bone and another tissues, 120 specimens of serum and 120 specimens of tissue were obtained from 20 patients, after i.v. injection of a single doses of 150 mg thienylcarbenicillin per kg body weight. The evaluation of concentration showed that Thienylcarbenicillin was eliminated from serum in a half-life time of 77 minutes. The concentration varied in different tissues. Maximal levels were found in musculature and in spongy bone. Unexpected high concentrations were found in fascia and in cutis. The lowest concentration was found in subcutis and compact bone. The experimental doses of 150 mg/kg body weight was not enough to gain a sufficient therapeutical level in compact bone.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - Considerable advances have been made in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. This review emphasizes the continued efforts toward standardization of methods for dilution and diffusion testing, particularly in the area of variation in medium performance, methods for detection of ampicillin resistant Haemophilus influenzae, and attempts to develop rapid automated systems for susceptibility testing. Susceptibility testing of anaerobes continues to be controversial from the standpoint of both the selection of methods and the application of susceptibility results to the clinical situation. It is expected that these and other problems in susceptibility testing will be solved by continued application of the investigative approaches that have brought us where we are today.
TI  - [Gentamicin-susceptibility of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials].
AB  - We studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing with other antibiotics. Beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. Staph, aureus and Staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin, and no resistant strain to this drug was found. Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Serratia and five species of Proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. A few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in E. coli, Citrobacerr, Serratia, Pr. morganii and Pr. rettgeri. Pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of Proteus. Antibacterial activity of gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. Gentamicin-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.

AB  - We have examined the antibacterial activity of the new antibiotic, fosfomycin (FOM) in vitro and in vivo. The following results were obtained. 1. FOM showed a broad antibacterial spectrum. 2. The antibacterial activity of FOM was enhanced in the medium at pH 6 and pH 7, and was also influenced by the addition of rabbit serum, calf serum, glucose-6-phosphate or defibrilated sheep blood to the growth medium, and by the size of inoculum. 3 FOM showed especially strong bactericidal action upon the bacteria at the logarithmic phase. 4. FOM showed remarkable therapeutic effect against most strains of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria tested in experimental infections of mice. 5. The therapeutic effect of FOM was especially remarkable for infection with Salmonella. 6. The therapeutic effect of FOM was more potent than the other drugs tested against infection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 7. It seems that FOM is more active in vivo than in vitro with respect to antibacterial activity.
TI  - A study of the agglutinin response in 40 cases of bacterial pneumonia.
AB  - Comparison of the results of cultures from blood and sputum with those of agglutinin response in 40 cases of bacterial pneumonia and 36 controls suggests that a provisional identification of causal bacteria, for purposes of antibiotic therapy, may be made by the serological tests with much greater rapidity and comparable accuracy. A combination of these methods is recommended.
TI  - Antibacterial precipitins and autoantibodies in serum of patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Sera from 84 patients with cystic fibrosis, 31 patients with other respiratory diseases and 21 control persons have been investigated for the occurrence of antibacterial precipitins and autoantibodies. Preciptins were studied by means of crossed immunoelectrophoresis, antinuclear factors by an indirect immunofluorescence technique and rheumatoid factors by the latex fixation slide test. A very heterogeneous antibacterial immune response was found in patients with cystic fibrosis, notably as regards Ps. aeruginosa. None of the other patients or controls had precipitins against this bacterium. The occurrence of precipitins against St. aureus and D. pneumoniae were more frequent in cystic fibrosis patients as compared with controls, but not as compared with other respiratory disease patients. No significant differences were found as regards precipitins against H. influenzae or the occurrence of rheumatoid factors. Antinuclear factors were more frequent in cystic fibrosis patients than in the other two groups investigated. A pronounced and heterogeneous humoral immune response against Ps. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients chronically infected with mucoid strains of this bacterium was found to be correlated with poor prognosis and the reason for this is discussed.
TI  - Agglutinin response to bacterial infection in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - Agglutinin titres to Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Proteus vulgaris in the serum of patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, patients producing mucoid sputum, and healthy controls were determined. Serological evidence of infection with H. influenzae was found in 38 of 57 patients with acute exacerbations, and Str. pneumoniae infection in 10 of the 57 patients, but was generally absent from healthy control subjects and from patiens producing mucoid sputum. No serological evidence of infection with other organisms named above was found to be associated with exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. Ten patients with acute exacerbations were without serological evidence of infection by any of the bacteria tested.
TI  - [Clinical effects of lividomycin on respiratory tract infections, primarily wet cases of bronchiectasis (author's transl)].
AB  - Patients with various respiratory infections, primarily wet cases of bronchiectasis, were treated with lividomycin (LVDM) at a dose of 1 g/day for about a week. The results obtained are as follows: 1. Of the 15 patients with refractory bronchiectasis who had previously been treated with various other antibiotics, 11 patients (73.3%) responded to LVDM. Although there was no patient who responded to LVDM excellently, good cures were achieved in 5 pateints and fair cures in 6 patients. 2. In bronchiectasis patients having infections in association with pulmonary tuberculosis (mixed infections), LVDM did not show any remarkable effects, excepting that fair cures were achieved in 3 patients. 3. In the 7 patients with acute bronchopneumonia, excellent, good and fair cures were achieved in 1, 5 and 1 patient, respectively. Although LVDM was effective in all of the patients with the said infection, the number of the patients responded excellently was meager and the onset of action seemed to be somewhat slow. 4. In one patient with lobar pneumonia, LVDM was not effective. 5. The MIC values of LVDM for clinically isolated various organisms are summarized below: Pseudomonas aeruginosa 50 mcg/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae 3.13 to 6.25 mcg/ml, Haemophilis influenzae 1.56 to 6.25 mcg/ml, Diplococcus pneumoniae 50 mcg/ml, alpha-Streptococcus 50 to 100 mcg/ml, beta-Streptococcus 100 mcg/ml, and Staphylococcus aureus 1.56 mcg/ml. 6. In spite of the fact that a majority of the patients participated in this study were the aged, LVDM's side effects were limited to an increase of BUN (one patient) and eruption (one patient). Any noticeable changes in hepatic and renal function, hearing acuity, etc. were not observed. As indicated above, LVDM was effective against, respiratory infections as well as infections of the urinary tract on which a considerable number of research has already been reported. Thus, it is considered to be worthwhile to use LVDM for the treatment of respiratory infections.

TI  - Secondary respiratory infection in hospital patients: effect of antimicrobial agents and environment.
AB  - A prospective study of 358 medical and 234 postoperative patients with clinical evidence of secondary chest infection showed that previous administration of antimicrobial agents greatly reduced the chance of obtaining a clear-cut laboratory report. In patients with radiographical evidence of pneumonia this led to a fourfold decrease in the overall rate of isolation of potential pathogens. Furthermore, 81 diverse "coliforms" were isolated from 258 medical and surgical patients who had received previous antimicrobial therapy while only four coliforms (all Escherichia coli) were isolated from 334 untreated patients. Thus the general hospital environment on its own seemed to have a negligible influence in promoting the growth of coliform flora in sputum. Any unique effect of underlying disease in this regard was masked by that of previous therapy. Finally, the results raised the possibility that previous antimicrobial therapy might have increased the risk of secondary pneumonia in hospital patients.

Broth and agar dilution and disk diffusion techniques were used with at least two sizes of inocula of organisms. Cefazolin was also studied in the treatment of 85 hospitalized patients with a variety of serious infections. In concentations of 5 mug or less/ml, cefazolin inhibited and killed more than 90% of isolates of Enterobacteriaceae with the exception of indole-positive Proteus and Enterobacter species. No isolate of P. aeruginosa and only a few of Enterobacter and enterococci were killed by 25 mug of cefazolin/ml, a concentration readily attainable in serum with a 500-mg dose given intramuscularly. Penicillin-susceptible as well as penicillin-resistant isolates of S. aureus were killed by 1 mug or less of cefazolin per ml; however, 25 mug/ml was required to kill 100% of the strains when the inoculum size was increased 100-fold. Cefazolin treatment appeared effective in 82 of 85 patients, including four with endocarditis. Pain was minimal after intramuscular injection, and thrombophlebitis was not observed in those treated intravenously. No patient developed a positive Coombs test, and no evidence of renal toxicity was apparent in clinical studies.
TI  - Selectagerm: a new approach to clinical bacteriology.
AB  - A method of processing clinical specimens received at the laboratory on cotton wool swabs is described. The method uses a range of selective culture media to assist in the isolation of potential pathogens from mixed cultures. Because the culture media are distributed in 2 millilitre volumes in the small squares of divided plastic petri dishes it is economically possible to use the same series for every specimen. This facilitates the rapid processing of large numbers of swabs and allows the isolation of pathogens from sites where they might otherwise go unnoticed.

AB  - A relatively simple technique for sputum homogenization and dilution is described. Results show that this technique is reliable for isolation and quantitative culture of organisms from cases of chest infection. The technique has resulted in significant reduction in false positive reports, particularly when a system of interpretative reporting is utilized based on 10(7) organisms per millilitre of sputum being accepted as evidence of significant infection.
TI  - Amoxycillin: a new semi-synthetic penicillin.
AB  - Amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. Penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella species, and Streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. Penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive Proteus, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. The new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. After oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. The absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.

TI  - Cephalexin and cephaloglycin activity in vitro and absorption and urinary excretion of single oral doses in normal young adults.
AB  - A large number of recently isolated bacterial pathogens were tested for susceptibility to cephalexin and cephaloglycin by the replica inoculating method. Strains of group A hemolytic streptococci, viridans (alpha and gamma) streptococci, pneumococci, gonococci, meningococci, and penicillin G-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus were all moderately to highly susceptible to both of these cephalosporin analogues, nearly all of the strains being two to eight (median four) times more susceptible to cephaloglycin than to cephalexin. The penicillin G-resistant, penicillinase-producing strains of S. aureus varied in their susceptibility; many were moderately resistant to both analogues, particularly to cephalexin. Strains of enterococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and most of the common gram-negative bacilli were moderately to highly resistant. Reducing the size of the inoculum had variable effects on inhibition by these drugs, depending on the species or strain. The activity of cephalexin was very little affected by pH of the medium within the clinical range or by incubation at 37 C in broth for up to 24 hr. In contrast, cephaloglycin in broth deteriorated rapidly at 37 C, and its activity was markedly reduced in alkaline medium. Both cephalexin and cephaloglycin were rapidly absorbed and excreted into the urine after single oral doses of 500 mg. Much higher levels were achieved and sustained with the former. Absorption of both analogues was delayed when taken with food, and the levels in the serum were significantly higher and better sustained when probenecid was also given. Very high concentrations of cephalexin were excreted into the urine during the first 4 hr, and the levels were still high in the 4- to 8-hr collection. The concentrations of cephaloglycin in the urine at these times were much lower. An average of 80 to 93% of the dose of cephalexin and 25 to 30% of the cephaloglycin were accounted for as active drug in the urine collected in 8 hr. Both analogues were well tolerated.

The nucleotidases were found to be very active in Proteus vulgaris, in which organism they were studied in detail. The relative activities, the pH optima, and the effect of metal ions were investigated. It was concluded that bacterial 3- and 5-nucleotidases are distinct and separate enzymes.
