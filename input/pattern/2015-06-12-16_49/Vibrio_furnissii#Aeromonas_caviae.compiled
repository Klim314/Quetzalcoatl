TI  - [A study on diarrhoea disease caused by Vibrionaceae along coast the east of Zhejiang Province].
AB  - A study of the etiology of 1028 cases of acute diarrhoea due to vibrionaceae was  carried out between August 1988 to July 1990 along the coast of east Zhejiang Province. From 417 clinical cases (40.56%) were found. 590 strains (57.39%) of pathogenic vibrios Among them, the detection rates of vibrio, aeromonas and plesionmonas were 48.14%, 44.74%, 7.12% respectively. There were 8 Species of vibrio detected: V. parahemolyticus (63.73%), V. fluvialis (11.97%), V. alginolyticus (10.215), non-01 vibrio cholera (9.86%), V. furnissii (2.47%), V. mimicus (1.06%), V. metchnikovii (0.35%), V. vulnificus (0.35%). The detection rate of aeromonas species of A. sorbia, A. caviae, A. hydrophila and A. indefinite sp. were 30.68%, 27.27%, 22.73%, and 19.32% respectively. Plesionmonas shigellides was also found in this study. The age, sex, clinical features, detection rates of pathogenic vibrios of diarrhoea cases and sea food contact history were analyzed.
