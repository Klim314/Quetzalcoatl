TI  == the cultivable microbiota of primary and secondary infected root canals, their susceptibility to antibiotics and association with the signs and symptoms of infection.
AB  == aim: to examine the presence of microbial species in primary and secondary infections and identify the signs and symptoms associated with them. methodology: a total number of 37 root canals from 33 patients undergoing root canal treatment were selected. samples were taken using a sterile paper point following chemomechanical canal instrumentation. microbiological identification was performed by macromorphological, micromorphological, and commercial biochemical tests (atb system). the antibiotic susceptibility profile of isolated enterococcus, streptococcus and propionibacterium spp. was evaluated. results: a  total number of 54 species were isolated. the most common was e. faecalis followed by propionibacterium acnes and streptococcus spp. five multidrug-resistant enterococcal strains were isolated. however, resistance to linezolid or glycopeptides was not found. radiolucency was observed significantly more often in symptomatic infections (p=0.0061) caused by actinomyces spp. than in asymptomatic ones. conclusions: enterococci and streptococci were the most commonly isolated bacteria from root canals. the resistance of enterococci to many antimicrobials may pose a problem in their eradication. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == synergistic effect of 2% chlorhexidine combined with proteolytic enzymes on biofilm disruption and killing.
AB  == aim: to investigate the dynamics of a disinfection regimen using 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase k in combination with 2% chlorhexidine (with or without ultrasonics) using a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies model biofilm. methodology: nutrient-stressed biofilms (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus  epidermidis, actinomyces radicidentis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecalis omgs 3202) were grown in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth. the treatment groups included 1% trypsin and 2% chlorhexidine (chx), 1% proteinase k and 2% chx (with and without ultrasonics). 2% chx was the positive control and untreated group, and sterile saline (with and without ultrasonics) was the negative control. the biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. results: the trypsin and chx group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective in reducing viable counts and the substratum coverage than those of all other groups (p < 0.05). the viable counts of the proteinase k and chx group used with (4.26 +/- 0.58 log10 cfu ml-1 ) or without ultrasonics (5.05 +/-  1.36 log10 cfu ml-1 ) were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) as compared with the  untreated control (7.67 +/- 0.84 log10 cfu ml-1 ) and saline groups used with (6.57 +/- 0.73 log10 cfu ml-1 ) and without ultrasonics (6.74 +/- 0.10 log10 cfu  ml-1 ). the chx group was less effective in biofilm disruption compared to when used in combination with trypsin and proteinase k. conclusion: the trypsin and chx group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective at reducing bacterial viable counts and disrupting biofilm.

TI  == antibiofilm efficacy of photosensitizer-functionalized bioactive nanoparticles on multispecies biofilm.
AB  == introduction: newer disinfection strategies based on antibacterial nanoparticles  and photodynamic therapy (pdt) aim to eliminate residual biofilm bacteria during  root canal treatment. the aim of the current study was to test the newly developed rose bengal-functionalized chitosan nanoparticles (csrbnps) for their interaction/uptake with monospecies bacteria/biofilm and assess their antibiofilm efficacy on a multispecies biofilm model in vitro. methods: the interaction of csrbnps with bacterial cells was conducted using atomic force microscopy. their membrane-damaging effect was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm (od260nm) using enterococcus faecalis. the penetration of csrbnps into e. faecalis biofilms was evaluated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm).  multispecies biofilms of streptococcus oralis, prevotella intermedia, and actinomyces naeslundii were grown on dentin sections for 21 days to assess the antibiofilm efficacy. the biofilms were subjected to pdt (60 j/cm(2)) using csrbnps and rose bengal. the treated/untreated biofilms were examined under scanning electron microscopy and clsm. results: the csrbnps synthesized were 60 +/- 20 nm and showed absorption spectra similar to rose bengal. atomic force microscopy showed adherence of csrbnps to bacteria, roughening of cell surface, and cell disruption after pdt. csrbnp treatment resulted in significantly increased bacterial membrane damage (p < .05). csrbnps exhibited deeper penetration into the biofilm structure. scanning electron microscopy and clsm confirmed the complete disruption of multispecies biofilm with a reduction in viable bacteria and biofilm thickness (p < .05). conclusions: these novel photosensitizer functionalized bioactive nanoparticles with increased affinity to bacterial cell membrane, higher penetration into biofilm structure, and enhanced  ability to eliminate clinically relevant multispecies bacterial biofilm present a potential antibiofilm agent for root canal disinfection.

TI  == individual growth detection of bacterial species in an in vitro oral polymicrobial biofilm model.
AB  == most in vitro studies on the antibacterial effects of antiseptics have used planktonic bacteria in monocultures. however, this study design does not reflect  the in vivo situation in oral cavities harboring different bacterial species that live in symbiotic relationships in biofilms. the aim of this study was to establish a simple in vitro polymicrobial model consisting of only three bacterial strains of different phases of oral biofilm formation to simulate in vivo oral conditions. therefore, we studied the biofilm formation of actinomyces  naeslundii (an), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), and enterococcus faecalis (ef) on  96-well tissue culture plates under static anaerobic conditions using artificial  saliva according to the method established by pratten et al. that was supplemented with 1 g l(-1) sucrose. growth was separately determined for each bacterial strain after incubation periods of up to 72 h by means of quantitative  real-time polymerase chain reaction and live/dead staining. presence of an extracellular polymeric substance (eps) was visualized by concanavalin a staining. increasing incubation times of up to 72 h showed adhesion and propagation of the bacterial strains with artificial saliva formulation. an and ef had significantly higher growth rates than fn. live/dead staining showed a median of 49.9 % (range 46.0-53.0 %) of living bacteria after 72 h of incubation, and 3d fluorescence microscopy showed a three-dimensional structure containing eps. an in vitro oral polymicrobial biofilm model was established to better simulate oral conditions and had the advantage of providing the well-controlled experimental conditions of in vitro testing.

TI  == improving photodynamic inactivation of bacteria in dentistry: highly effective and fast killing of oral key pathogens with novel tooth-colored type-ii photosensitizers.
AB  == increasing antibiotic resistances in microorganisms create serious problems in public health. this demands alternative approaches for killing pathogens to supplement standard treatment methods. photodynamic inactivation of bacteria (pib) uses light activated photosensitizers (ps) to generate reactive oxygen species immediately upon illumination, inducing lethal phototoxicity. positively  charged phenalen-1-one derivatives are a new generation of ps for light-mediated  killing of pathogens with outstanding singlet oxygen quantum yield phidelta of >97%. upon irradiation with a standard photopolymerizer light (bluephase c8, 1260 +/- 50 mw/cm(2)) the ps showed high activity against the oral key pathogens enterococcus faecalis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. at a concentration of 10 mum, a maximum efficacy of more than 6 log10 steps (>/= 99.9999%) of bacteria killing is reached in less than 1 min (light dose 50 j/cm(2)) after one single treatment. the pyridinium substituent as positively charged moiety is especially advantageous for antimicrobial action.

TI  == characterisation of the antibacterial effect of polyethyleneimine nanoparticles in relation to particle distribution in resin composite.
AB  == objectives: to characterise the antibacterial effect of resin composite incorporating cross-linked quaternised polyethyleneimine (qpei) nanoparticles in  relation to their distribution in the bulk material. methods: the antibacterial effect of resin composite incorporating qpei nanoparticle was tested against various oral pathogens, including enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscousus, lactobacilus casei and whole saliva. nanoparticle distribution in the modified resin composite was assessed using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps). additionally, the degree of conversion was recorded. results: total bacterial inhibition was detected against all the tested pathogens following direct contact with the outer surface of the modified resin composite. similarly, the inner surface of the modified resin composite caused total inhibition. electron microscope images showed bacterial death. xps revealed surface i(-) ions on both the outer and the inner surfaces of the modified composite. no i(-) ions were detected in the unmodified composite. nanoparticle distribution was higher on the inner surface of the modified composite. the composite's degree of conversion was unaffected by nanoparticle addition. conclusions: qpei nanoparticles represent a new generation of antibacterial nanoparticles which are highly promising in preventing bacterial recontamination  when restoring teeth.

TI  == new bacterial composition in primary and persistent/secondary endodontic infections with respect to clinical and radiographic findings.
AB  == introduction: the aim of the present study was to analyze the microbiota of primary and secondary/persistent endodontic infections of patients undergoing endodontic treatment with respect to clinical and radiographic findings. methods: samples from the root canals of 21 german patients were taken using 3 sequential  sterile paper points. in the case of a root canal filling, gutta-percha was removed with sterile files, and samples were taken using sterile paper points. the samples were plated, and microorganisms were then isolated and identified morphologically by biochemical analysis and sequencing the 16s rrna genes of isolated microorganisms. results: in 12 of 21 root canals, 33 different species could be isolated. six (50%) of the cases with isolated microorganisms were primary, and 6 (50%) cases were endodontic infections associated with root-filled teeth. twelve of the isolated species were facultative anaerobic and 21 obligate  anaerobic. monomicrobial infections were found for enterococcus faecalis and actinomyces viscosus. e. faecalis was most frequently isolated in secondary endodontic infections (33%). moraxella osloensis was isolated from a secondary endodontic infection that had an insufficient root canal filling accompanied by a mild sensation of pain. a new bacterial composition compromising atopobium rimae, anaerococcus prevotii, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, dialister invisus, and fusobacterium nucleatum was recovered from teeth with chronic apical abscesses. conclusions: new bacterial combinations were found and correlated to clinical and radiographic findings, particularly to chronic apical abscesses. m. osloensis was detected in root canals for the second time and only in german patients.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and capacity for biofilm formation of different bacteria isolated from endodontic infections associated with root-filled teeth.
AB  == introduction: to date, a variety of microbial species have been isolated from endodontic infections. however, endodontic clinical bacterial isolates have not been sufficiently characterized with regard to their capacity for antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation. in this study, antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation of 47 different aerobic and anaerobic bacterial isolates, belonging to 32 different species previously isolated from infected filled root canals, were studied. methods: antibiotic sensitivity to 11 antibiotics including penicillin g, amoxicillin, clindamycin, gentamicin, vancomycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, fosfomycin, rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin was tested using the standardized etest method (bio merieux, marcy-1'etoile, france). the antibiotic sensitivity of 4 control strains was also estimated in parallel. additionally, the capacity to form biofilms was quantified using the microtiter plate test. results: different aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species were either resistant against a number of antibiotics or showed high minimal inhibitory concentrations against clinically relevant antibiotics. five aerobic and 2 anaerobic isolates, including enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans,  lactobacillus fermentum, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, prevotella buccae, and propionibacterium acidifaciens, were characterized as being high biofilm producers, whereas 8 aerobic and 3 anaerobic isolates were found to be moderate biofilm producers. most isolates with resistance or markedly high minimal inhibitory concentration values were also either moderate biofilm producers or high biofilm producers. conclusions: these results suggest that the  clinical significance of endodontic infections could include that they serve as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance. furthermore, endodontic treatment should consider the adhesion and biofilm formation by a variety of bacteria.

TI  == the effectiveness of enzymic irrigation in removing a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies biofilm.
AB  == aim: to establish a nutrient-stressed multispecies model biofilm and investigate  the dynamics of biofilm killing and disruption by 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase k  with or without ultrasonic activation. methodology: nutrient-stressed biofilms (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, actinomyces radicidentis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecalis omgs 3202) were grown on hydroxyapatite discs and in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth in modified fluid universal medium. the treatment groups included trypsin, proteinase k, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 1% sodium hypochlorite (naocl) (with and without ultrasonics). naocl and chlorhexidine were the positive controls and untreated group, and sterile saline was the negative control. the biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. results: nutrient stress in the multispecies biofilm was apparent as the medium ph became alkaline, glucose was absent, and serum proteins were degraded in the supernatant. the clsm showed the percentage reduction in viable bacteria at the biofilm surface level due to nutrient starvation. on the disc model, trypsin and proteinase k were effective in killing bacteria; their aerobic viable counts were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than the negative control and chlorhexidine. naocl was the most  effective agent (p < 0.001). in the tooth model, when compared to saline, trypsin with ultrasonics caused significant killing both aerobically and anaerobically (p < 0.05). chlorhexidine (1.46 +/- 0.42), trypsin (3.56 +/- 1.18) and proteinase k  (4.2 +/- 1.01) with ultrasonics were significantly effective (p < 0.05) in reducing the substratum coverage as compared to saline with ultrasonics (12% +/-  4.9). conclusion: trypsin with ultrasonic activation has a biofilm killing and disrupting potential.

TI  == antibacterial efficacy of a human beta-defensin-3 peptide on multispecies biofilms.
AB  == introduction: the aggregation of mixed bacterial flora into sessile biofilms on root canal surfaces can be one of the causes of persistent apical periodontitis.  the aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3) peptide on multispecies biofilms by using confocal laser scanning microscopy. methods: actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus salivarius, streptococcus mutans, and enterococcus faecalis were cultured in a peptone-yeast-glucose broth, and their culture suspensions were combined in equal proportions. the mixed bacteria were inoculated on sterile coverslips placed into the wells of tissue culture plates to permit the formation of mixed species biofilm. after incubation for 3 weeks, the samples were treated for 24 hours with saline (control), saturated calcium hydroxide solution (ch), 2% chlorhexidine solution (chx), and 50 mug/ml hbd3 solution. a commercial biofilm/viability assay kit was used to assess cell viability and analyze the 3-dimensional architecture  of biofilms. the percentage of dead cells was determined from the ratio of biovolumes for the red subpopulation and the total biofilm. results: three medication groups showed a significant reduction of biovolume within the biofilms compared with the control group (p < .001). the hbd3-treated biofilms had a higher percentage of dead cells than the other medication groups (p < .05). the ch and chx groups showed higher levels of bactericidal activity than saline (p <  .05), and there was no significant difference between the 2 groups (p > .05). conclusions: hbd3 peptide exhibited more antibacterial activity against mature multispecies biofilms in vitro than either ch or chx.

TI  == comparative antibacterial efficacies of hydrodynamic and ultrasonic irrigation systems in vitro.
AB  == introduction: to ensure root canal treatment success, endodontic microbiota should be efficiently reduced. the in vitro bactericidal effects of a hydrodynamic system and a passive ultrasonic irrigation system were compared. methods: single-rooted extracted teeth (n = 250) were contaminated with suspensions of enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, mixed aerobic cultures, or mixed anaerobic cultures. first, the antibacterial effects of the hydrodynamic system (rinsendo), a passive ultrasonic irrigation system (piezo smart), and manual rinsing with 0.9% nacl (the control) were compared. colony-forming units were counted. second, the 2 systems were used with 1.5% sodium hypochlorite (naocl) alone or naocl + 0.2% chlorhexidine (chx). the colony-forming units in the treated and untreated roots were determined during a period of 5 days. results: both irrigation systems reduced bacterial numbers more effectively than manual rinsing (p < .001). with nacl, ultrasonic activated irrigation reduced bacterial  counts significantly better than hydrodynamic irrigation (p = .042). the naocl +  chx combination was more effective than naocl alone for both systems (p < .001),  but hydrodynamic irrigation was more effective with naocl + chx than the passive  ultrasonic irrigation system. conclusions: both irrigation systems, when combined with naocl + chx, removed bacteria from root canals.

TI  == photodynamic biofilm inactivation by sapyr--an exclusive singlet oxygen photosensitizer.
AB  == prevention and control of biofilm-growing microorganisms are serious problems in  public health due to increasing resistances of some pathogens against antimicrobial drugs and the potential of these microorganisms to cause severe infections in patients. therefore, alternative approaches that are capable of killing pathogens are needed to supplement standard treatment modalities. one alternative is the photodynamic inactivation of bacteria (pib). the lethal effect of pib is based on the principle that visible light activates a photosensitizer,  leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species, e.g., singlet oxygen, which  induces phototoxicity immediately during illumination. sapyr is a new generation  of photosensitizers. based on a 7-perinaphthenone structure, it shows a singlet oxygen quantum yield phidelta of 99% and is water soluble and photostable. moreover, it contains a positive charge for good adherence to cell walls of pathogens. in this study, the pib properties of sapyr were investigated against monospecies and polyspecies biofilms formed in vitro by oral key pathogens. sapyr showed a dual mechanism of action against biofilms: (i) it disrupts the structure of the biofilm even without illumination; (ii) when irradiated, it inactivates bacteria in a polymicrobial biofilm after one single treatment with an efficacy of >/= 99.99%. these results encourage further investigation on the potential of  pib using sapyr for the treatment of localized infectious diseases.

TI  == effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy  agar (tsa) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. the autofluorescence was then assessed at  405 nm excitation. on the tsa without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. on the tsa containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from parvimonas micra. when the tsa was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin k, red autofluorescence was observed  from actinomyces naeslundii, bifidobacterium dentium, and streptococcus mutans. finally, on the tsa supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a. naeslundii, enterococcus  faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus salivarius, s. mutans, and veillonella parvula. we conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. the autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as  metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.

TI  == bacteria isolated from dugongs (dugong dugon) submitted for postmortem examination in queensland, australia, 2000-2011.
AB  == microbial infection may contribute to disease in a significant proportion of marine mammal mortalities, but little is known about infectious bacterial species and their prevalence in dugongs (dugong dugon). this study represents a survey of the species of bacteria and fungi isolated from dugongs submitted to the university of queensland's school of veterinary science for postmortem examination. thirty-six dugongs were included in the survey, with 23 species of bacteria and four species of fungus cultured from lesions that were suspected of  contributing to local infection, systemic infection, or both. the most abundant bacteria included aeromonas spp., clostridium spp., vibrio spp., enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas spp. in six cases, the microorganism(s) cultured were considered to have been associated with disease. mixed infections containing aeromonas spp. and vibrio spp.; morganella morganii, pasteurella multocida, and serratia marcescens; and actinomyces spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. were associated with pneumonia or pleuritis, and enterococcus faecalis was associated  with a multisystemic infection in a neonate. clostridium spp. was cultured from two animals with peritonitis and likely septicemia. the significance of many of the other isolates is uncertain because the samples were taken after death, and some of the species isolated may represent postmortem overgrowth. it is also difficult to fulfil koch's postulates through experimental infection in marine mammals. regardless, this information will assist clinicians working with dugongs to make treatment decisions and the baseline data on the prevalence of bacterial  and fungal species is of value for monitoring coastal water habitat health and risks of zoonotic disease transmission.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of mtad and nisin in combination against common pathogens associated with root canal infection.
AB  == introduction: many pathogenic microorganisms were found in an infected root canal. the object of this study was to evaluate the effect of mtad in combination with nisin on the pathogens associated with root canal infection. methods: the survival rates of 9 pathogenic bacteria were determined after 1-, 5-, and 10-minute treatment with mtad, mtan (substitution of doxycycline with nisin), and mtadn (nisin in combination with doxycycline). the survival rates of enterococcus faecalis in the starvation phase and pretreatment alkalization as well as in the  normal physiological state under mtad, mtan, and mtadn challenge for 1, 5, and 10 minutes were evaluated and compared. furthermore, scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the morphologic modification of actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus paracasei, and porphyromonas gingivalis after mtad and mtadn treatment. results: l. fermenti, l. paracasei, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, streptococcus gordonii, and peptostreptococcus were more sensitive to mtadn and mtan than to mtad. mtad, mtan, and mtadn showed a rapid antibacterial effect on p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum. enterococcus faecalis in the stress state was as sensitive to mtad, mtan, and mtadn as the control e. faecalis. furthermore, in the observation of scanning electron microscopy, the membranes in a. naeslundii and l. paracasei presented significant rupture, and p. gingivalis did not exhibit significant damage after mtadn treatment. conclusions: mtad in combination with nisin improved antibacterial efficacy against pathogens, especially for some gram-positive bacteria associated with persistent intracanal infection. therefore, the combination had the potential to be used as an effective intracanal irrigation.

AB  == introduction: the development of multispecies biofilm models are needed to explain the interactions that take place in root canal biofilms during apical periodontitis. the aim of this study was to investigate the ability of 4 root canal bacteria to establish a multispecies biofilm community and to characterize  the main structural, compositional, and physiological features of this community. methods: four clinical isolates isolated from infected root canals, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus salivarius, streptococcus gordonii, and enterococcus faecalis, were grown together in a miniflow cell system. simultaneous detection of the 4 species in the biofilm communities was achieved by fluorescence in situ  hybridization in combination with confocal microscopy at different time points. the live/dead baclight technique (molecular probes, carlsbad, ca) was used to assess cell viability and to calculate 3-dimensional architectural parameters such as biovolume (mum(3)). redox fluorescence dye 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride was used to assess the metabolic activity of biofilm bacteria. results: the 4 species tested were able to form stable and reproducible biofilm communities. the biofilms formed in rich medium generally showed continuous growth over time, however, in the absence of glucose biofilms showed significantly smaller biovolumes. a high proportion of viable cells (>90%) were generally observed, and biofilm growth was correlated with high metabolic activity of cells. the community structure of biofilms formed in rich medium did  not change considerably over the 120-hour period, during which e. faecalis, l. salivarius, and s. gordonii were most abundant. conclusions: the ability of 4 root canal bacteria to form multispecies biofilm communities shown in this study  give insights into assessing the community lifestyle of these microorganisms in vivo. this multispecies model could be useful for further research simulating stresses representative of in vivo conditions.

TI  == effect of a novel antimicrobial peptide chrysophsin-1 on oral pathogens and streptococcus mutans biofilms.
AB  == dental caries and pulpal diseases are common oral bacterial infectious diseases.  controlling and reducing the causative pathogens, such as streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis, is a key step toward prevention and treatment of the two diseases. chrysophsin-1 is a cationic antimicrobial peptide having broad-spectrum bactericidal activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. in this study, we investigated the antibacterial activity of chrysophsin-1 against several oral pathogens and s. mutans biofilms and performed a preliminary study of the antimicrobial mechanism. cytotoxic activity of chrysophsin-1 against human gingival fibroblasts (hgfs) was investigated. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic), minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) and time-kill assay were used to evaluate the killing effect of chrysophsin-1. scanning electron microscopy (sem) was used to analyze morphological and membrane change in oral pathogens. live/dead staining, in conjunction with confocal scanning laser microscopy (cslm), was used to observe and analyze s. mutans biofilms. mic and mbc results demonstrated that chrysophsin-1 had different antimicrobial activities against the tested oral microbes. lysis and pore formation of the cytomembrane were observed following treatment of the bacteria with chrysophsin-1 for 4h or 24h by sem. furthermore, clsm images showed that chrysophsin-1 remarkably reduced the viability of cells within biofilms and had a significantly lethal effect against s. mutans biofilms. toxicity studies showed that chrysophsin-1 at concentration between 8 mug/ml and 32 mug/ml had little effect on viability of hgfs in 5 min. our findings suggest that chrysophsin-1 may have potential clinical applications in the prevention and treatment of dental caries and pulpal diseases.

TI  == short-term antimicrobial properties of mineral trioxide aggregate with incorporated silver-zeolite.
AB  == the purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether adding silver-zeolite (sz) to mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) would enhance the antimicrobial activity of mta against staphylococcus aureus (atcc #25923), enterococcus faecalis (atcc #29212), escherichia coli (atcc#25922), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc #27853), candida albicans (atcc #90028), porphyromonas gingivalis (atcc #33277), actinomyces israelii (atcc #12102), and prevotella intermedia (atcc# 15032). sz was added at 0.2% and 2% mass fraction concentration to mta powder. the control group was mta powder with no sz. the antimicrobial effect test was accomplished by placing freshly mixed mta specimens on agar plates inoculated with microorganisms and comparing the zones of inhibition at 24, 48, and 72 h. the amounts of silver ion release from mta specimens were measured with atomic absorption spectrophotometry at 10-min, 24-, 48-, and 72-h periods. the ph of mta specimens was measured with a ph meter at 10-min, 24-, 48-, and 72-h periods. mta with 2% and 0.2% sz specimens showed inhibitory effects on some microorganisms at all time periods, whereas no antimicrobial activity showed for p. intermedia and  a. israelii. mta without sz inhibited c. albicans, e. coli, and p. intermedia. the highest silver release was detected in 2% sz mta at 24 h. the incorporation of sz may enhance the antimicrobial activity of mta.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  == human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals,  including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.

TI  == bactericidal effect of nd:yag laser irradiation on some endodontic pathogens ex vivo.
AB  == aim: to define the role of neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (nd:yag) lasers in root canal disinfection along with a minimally invasive treatment concept. methodology: the hypothesis was tested ex vivo that nd:yag laser irradiation has  a bactericidal effect on endodontic pathogens inoculated in root canals. resultant colony-forming unit counts were associated with observations of bacterial cell structural changes using conventional scanning electron microscopy (csem) and environmental scanning electron microscopy (esem) on inoculated dentine surfaces, following indirect and direct nd:yag laser irradiation, respectively. results: the nd:yag laser irradiation (1.5 w, 15 hz, four times for 5 s) of enterococcus faecalis inoculated canals resulted in a significant reduction (p < 0.05, wilcoxon signed rank test) of the bacterial load, meaning a  99.7% kill, but no sterilization. the csem procedure verified that the extent of  radiation damage was in line with the total amount of laser energy applied. after 2 h of incubation and three cycles of indirect laser treatment (i.e. through a 1-mm-thick dentine disc), no morphologically intact bacteria of actinomyces naeslundii or streptococcus anginosus were discernible. however, when micro-colonies of s. anginosus and specially biofilms of e. faecalis were present after 2 days, the in situ experiment using esem and direct laser treatment showed that bacterial eradication was reduced in deep layers. conclusions: the nd:yag laser irradiation is not an alternative but a possible supplement to existing protocols for canal disinfection as the properties of laser light may allow a bactericidal effect beyond 1 mm of dentine. endodontic pathogens that grow as biofilms, however, are difficult to eradicate even upon direct laser exposure.

AB  == the purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether the substitution of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for sterile water as a mixing agent would enhance the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored proroot mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) against actinomyces odontolyticus (atcc17982), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc2586), streptococcus sanguis (atcc10556), enterococcus faecalis (er3/2s), escherichia coli (sm10lambdapir), staphylococcus aureus (atcc6538), pseudomonas aeruginosa (ume), and candida albicans (atcc10261). two wells of 5-mm diameter were made in triplicate agar plates inoculated with standardized suspensions of each microorganism. mta (33 mg) mixed with chlorhexidine (12 microl) or sterile water (12 microl) was placed to fill each well. plates were incubated at 37 degrees c as required for microbial growth. a blinded, independent observer measured zones of inhibition. all mta samples inhibited microbial growth regardless of mixing agent. mta/chlorhexidine showed significantly larger zones of inhibition (p < 0.0002, paired t test). in conclusion, substituting 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for water enhanced the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored proroot mta.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of 'mgp' gutta-percha in vitro.
AB  == aim: to determine whether 'mgp' gutta-percha (westport, ct, usa), a commercially  available gutta-percha containing iodoform, inhibits the growth of potential endodontic pathogens. methodology: inocula of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus sanguis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces odontolyticus were spread onto the surface of agar plates. 'mgp' gutta-percha cones presoaked in sterile water were transferred to the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees c aerobically or anaerobically as required for optimal growth. identical studies were performed using iodoform-free gutta-percha and sterile paper disks saturated with 10% povidone-iodine. following incubation, zones of inhibition around the 'mgp' gutta-percha, iodoform-free gutta-percha and disks were evaluated. results: povidone-iodine inhibited all the strains. iodoform-free gutta-percha inhibited s. sanguis and a. odontolyticus. 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited s. aureus, s. sanguis, a. odontolyticus and f. nucleatum. neither iodoform-free gutta-percha nor 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited growth of e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa. conclusions: compared to iodoform-free gutta-percha, iodoform-containing 'mgp' gutta-percha had an inhibitory effect in vitro on s. aureus and f. nucleatum, but not on e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa.

TI  == microorganisms from canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions.
AB  == aim: the objective of the present study was to identify the microbial flora within root canals of teeth with failed root-canal treatment and to determine the association of the various species with clinical features. methodology: sixty root-filled teeth with persisting periapical lesions were selected for this study. during nonsurgical endodontic re-treatment, the root-filling material was  removed and the canals were sampled. microbial sampling, isolation and species determination were performed using advanced microbiological techniques for anaerobic species. the association of microbiological findings with clinical features was investigated. results: microorganisms were recovered from 51 teeth.  in most cases, one or two strains per canal were found. of the microbial species  isolated, 57.4% were facultative anaerobic species and 83.3% gram-positive microorganisms. enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently recovered bacterial species. obligate anaerobes accounted for 42.6% of the species and the most frequently isolated genera was peptostreptococcus. which was associated with clinical symptoms (p < 0.01). significant associations were also observed between: (a) pain or history of pain and polymicrobial infections or anaerobes (p < 0.05): (b) tenderness to percussion and prevotella intermedia/p. nigrescens (p  < 0.05); (c) sinus and streptococcus spp. (p < 0.001) or actinomyces spp. (p < 0.01); (d) coronally unsealed teeth and streptococcus spp. or candida spp. (both  with p < 0.01). conclusion: the microbial flora in canals after failure of root-canal treatment were limited to a small number of predominantly gram-positive microbial species. facultative anaerobes, especially e. faecalis, were the most commonly isolated microorganisms, however, polymicrobial infections and obligate anaerobes were frequently found in canals of symptomatic root-filled teeth.

TI  == evaluation of root canal microorganisms isolated from teeth with endodontic failure and their antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  == studies of the microbiota from the canals of teeth with failure of endodontic therapy have revealed that it differs markedly from that of untreated necrotic dental pulps. this study aimed to evaluate the microbiota of 30 root-filled teeth with persisting periapical lesions and to test the antibiotic susceptibility of the most prevalent species. microbial samples, isolation and speciation were done using advanced microbiologic techniques for anaerobic species. a total of 55 bacterial species were isolated, 80% were gram-positives and 58% facultative anaerobic microorganisms. the bacterial genera most frequently recovered were enterococcus, streptococcus, peptostreptococcus and actinomyces. antibiotic sensitivity of enterococcus faecalis and peptostreptococcus spp. was accomplished with the e-test system. all species studied were susceptible to benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin combined with clavulanate. however, 20% of the e.faecalis strains were resistant to erythromycin and 60% to azithromycin. it was concluded that microbial flora in canals after endodontic failure comprised predominantly facultative anaerobes and gram-positive species. e.faecalis was the species most frequently isolated and showed erythromycin and azithromycin resistance among the isolates.

TI  == microbial susceptibility to calcium hydroxide pastes and their vehicles.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of some microorganisms commonly isolated from root canals to calcium hydroxide in combination with several vehicles by the agar diffusion method. stainless-steel cylinders were placed on each inoculated agar medium. the test medications and their controls were placed inside the cylinders. the zones of growth inhibition were measured and recorded after the incubation period for each plate, and the results were analyzed statistically. enterococcus faecalis was most resistant, whereas the anaerobic porphyromonas endodontalis was more susceptible to all medications, followed by p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedial intermedia. ca(oh)2 + cmcp + glycerin showed significantly larger mean zones of inhibition when compared with the other medications. we conclude that anaerobic gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to calcium hydroxide pastes than facultative gram-positive microorganisms.

TI  == bacteriological cultures of removed intrauterine devices and pelvic inflammatory  disease.
AB  == intrauterine devices (iuds) are highly effective, long-term methods of contraception. although evidence of a direct association between iud use and pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) is scarce, concerns about pid related to iuds use has limited their use throughout the world. we designed this study to examine the effect of iuds on pid. for the study, we recruited 200 participants from among women who requested an iud as a means of contraception. the iuds were removed 36 months later or in case of pid. no pid cases were recorded during the  follow-up period. prior to iud insertion, 121 women (60.5%) had symptoms and/or signs of lower genital tract infection, whereas during the follow-up period 179 women (89.5%) had symptoms and/or signs of lower genital tract infection. the papanicolaou smears were negative for actinomyces throughout the study period. also, cultures for sexualy transmitted disease microorganisms were negative throughout the study period. following iud removal, 189 iud cultures (94.5%) were positive. the bacterial flora of the removed iuds consisted of common aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms that do not account for pid. the most common microorganisms identified were staphylococcus coagulase negative, eschericia coli, and enterococcus faecalis. iuds are a very effective and safe method of contraception if potential recipients are selected carefully. culture of the removed iuds and therapeutic management of women with positive cultures are not recommended when women are asymptomatic for pid.

TI  == actinomyces species, streptococci, and enterococcus faecalis in primary root canal infections.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of actinomyces species,  streptococci, and enterococcus faecalis in primary root canal infections by using a molecular genetic method. samples were obtained from 53 infected teeth, of which 27 cases were diagnosed as acute periradicular abscesses. dna was extracted to evaluate the occurrence of 13 bacterial species by using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. polymerase chain reaction using an ubiquitous bacterial primer was undertaken to check the presence of bacterial dna in clinical samples. all root canal samples contained bacteria as demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction. the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay allowed the detection of streptococci in 22.6% of the samples, actinomyces species in 9.4%, and e. faecalis in 7.5%. the most prevalent species were members of the streptococcus anginosus group. with regard to the asymptomatic lesions, the most  prevalent species were s. intermedius (11.5% of the cases), e. faecalis (11.5%),  and s. anginosus (7.7%). s. constellatus was the most prevalent species in pus samples (25.9% of the cases). the other most prevalent species in abscessed teeth were a. gerencseriae (14.8%), s. gordonii (11.1%), s. intermedius (11.1%), a. israelii (7.4%), s. anginosus (7.4%), and s. sanguis (7.4%). s. constellatus was  the only species positively associated with acute periradicular abscess (p < 0.01).

TI  == penetration of bacteria in bovine root dentine in vitro.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to develop a test model to quantify the penetration of bacteria into dentinal tubules. methodology: the model consisted of two compartments separated by a bovine dentine specimen with a thickness of 1.5-3.1 mm. the root cementum was removed from the root surface and the specimens were oriented in the model with the pulpal side facing the inoculated chamber of  the test model. one compartment contained the test organism and the other was filled with sterile broth that was evaluated for growth of the test organism. the depth of bacterial penetration was measured in the dentine with or without a smear layer using both a histological and a quantitative recovering grinding technique, after 6 weeks of exposure to the microorganisms. results: e. faecalis  penetrated dentine significantly deeper than a. israelii (p < 0.001). after removal of the smear layer with edta, e. faecalis penetrated significantly deeper than in dentine pretreated with saline only (p < 0.01) or with a combination of saline and sodium hypochlorite (p < 0.01). microorganisms were found in 89% of the cultured specimens and in 80% of the specimens that were evaluated with light microscopy. total penetration through the dentine specimen and infection of the broth in the test compartment of the model occurred in only two out of 72 specimens. conclusion: collection and immediate culturing of infected dentine dust and counting colony forming units (cfu) allowed an overview of the number of bacteria per sample and was more sensitive than microscopy. removal of the smear  layer enhanced bacterial penetration.

TI  == microbial analysis of bone collected during implant surgery: a clinical and laboratory study.
AB  == dental implant surgery produces bone debris which can be used to correct bone defects in the "simultaneous-augmentation" technique. however, this debris is potentially contaminated with oral bacteria. therefore, this study examined bone  debris collected during dental implant surgery in order 1) to identify the microbial contaminants and 2) to compare the effects of two different aspiration  protocols on the levels of microbial contamination. twenty-four partially dentate patients were randomly allocated into two equal groups and underwent bone collection using the frios bone collector during surgery to insert two endosseous dental implants. in group s (using a stringent aspiration protocol), bone collection occurred within the surgical site only. in group ns (utilizing a non-stringent aspiration protocol), bone collection and tissue fluid control was  achieved using the same suction tip. bone samples were immediately transported for microbial analysis. colonial and microscopic morphology, gaseous requirements and identification kits were utilized for identification of the isolated microbes. twenty-eight species were identified including a number associated with disease, in particular, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis as well as the anaerobes actinomyces odontolyticus, eubacterium sp., prevotella intermedia, propionibacterium propionicum and peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. in group s (stringent aspiration protocol), significantly fewer organisms were found than in group ns, the non-stringent aspiration protocol (p=0.001). gram-positive cocci dominated the isolates from both groups. it is concluded that if bone debris is collected for implantation around dental implants, it should be collected with a stringent aspiration protocol (within the surgical site only) to minimize bacterial contaminants.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

TI  == cell wall-anchored csha polypeptide (259 kilodaltons) in streptococcus gordonii forms surface fibrils that confer hydrophobic and adhesive properties.
AB  == it has been shown previously that inactivation of the csha gene, encoding a major cell surface polypeptide (259 kda) in the oral bacterium streptococcus gordonii,  generates mutants that are markedly reduced in hydrophobicity, deficient in binding to oral actinomyces species and to human fibronectin, and unable to colonize the oral cavities of mice. we now show further that surface fibrils 60.7 +/- 14.5 nm long, which are present on wild-type s. gordonii dl1 (challis) cells, bind csha-specific antibodies and are absent from the cell surfaces of csha mutants. to more precisely determine the structural and functional properties of  csha, already inferred from insertional-mutagenesis experiments, we have cloned the entire csha gene into the replicative plasmid pam401 and expressed full-length csha polypeptide on the cell surface of heterologous enterococcus faecalis jh2-2. enterococci expressing csha exhibited a 30-fold increase in cell  surface hydrophobicity over e. faecalis jh2-2 carrying the pam401 vector alone and 2.4-fold-increased adhesion to human fibronectin. csha expression in e. faecalis also promoted cell-cell aggregation and increased the ability of enterococci to bind actinomyces naeslundii cells. electron micrographs of negatively stained e. faecalis cells expressing csha showed peritrichous surface  fibrils 70.3 +/- 9.1 nm long that were absent from control e. faecalis jh2-2(pam401) cells. the fibrils bound csha-specific antibodies, as detected by immunoelectron microscopy, and the antibodies inhibited the adhesion of e. faecalis cells to fibronectin. the results demonstrate that the csha polypeptide  is the structural and functional component of s. gordonii adhesive fibrils, and they provide a molecular basis for past correlations of surface fibril production, cell surface hydrophobicity, and adhesion in species of oral "sanguis-like" streptococci.

TI  == binding properties of streptococcus gordonii sspa and sspb (antigen i/ii family)  polypeptides expressed on the cell surface of lactococcus lactis mg1363.
AB  == the oral bacterium streptococcus gordonii expresses two cell wall-associated polypeptides, designated sspa (1,542 amino acid residues) and sspb (1,462 amino acid residues), that have 70% sequence identity. these polypeptides are members of the antigen i/ii family of oral streptococcal adhesins and mediate the binding of streptococci to salivary glycoproteins, collagen, and other oral microorganisms such as actinomyces naeslundii. to determine if sspa and sspb have differential binding properties, the coding sequences of the sspa and sspb genes  were cloned into expression plasmid vector ptrex1-usp45ls to generate ptrex1-sspa and ptrex1-sspb, respectively, and the ssp polypeptides were displayed on the cell surface of lactococcus lactis mg1363. lactococcal cells expressing similar levels of surface sspa or sspb polypeptide were then compared for their abilities to adhere to a range of antigen i/ii polypeptide substrates. more than twice as many l. lactis cells expressing sspa bound to immobilized salivary agglutinin glycoprotein (sag) as did l. lactis cells expressing sspb. in contrast, lactococci expressing sspb adhered twice as well as lactococci producing sspa to  collagen type i and to candida albicans. the binding of a. naeslundii to lactococci was only weakly enhanced by surface expression of ssp polypeptides. l. lactis(ptrex1-sspb) cells bound in greater numbers to sag than did enterococcus faecalis jh2-2 cells expressing sspb from pam401eb-5. the results suggest that sspa and sspb have markedly different binding affinities for their oral substrates and thus may function to promote site diversity in colonization by s.  gordonii.

TI  == clinical and microbiological features of refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the clinical parameters and the  site prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival species in successfully treated and  refractory periodontitis subjects. 94 subjects received scaling and root planing  and if needed, periodontal surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. 28 refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or > 3 sites showing attachment loss > 2.5 mm within 1 year post-therapy. 66 successfully treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss > 2.5 mm. baseline subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject and differences between groups sought using the mann-whitney test. most of the 40 species tested, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus, were equally or less prevalent in the refractory group. prevotella nigrescens was significantly more prevalent in successfully treated subjects, while refractory subjects harbored a larger proportion of streptococcus species, particularly streptococcus constellatus. the odds of a subject being refractory was 8.6 (p < 0.001) if s. constellatus constituted > or = 3.5% of the  total dna probe count. since few microbiological differences existed between treatment outcome groups using dna probes to known species, the predominant cultivable microbiota of 33 subgingival samples from 14 refractory subjects was examined. 85% of the 1649 isolates were identified using probes to 69 recognized  subgingival species. the remaining unidentified strains were classified by analyzing 16s rrna gene sequences. many sequenced isolates were of taxa not considered a common part of the oral microbiota such as acinetobacter baumanni, gemella haemolysans, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus warneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and novel species in the genera bartonella, ralstonia, neisseria, eubacterium, rothia, gordona, gemella, corynebacterium, leptotrichia, and actinomyces. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their subgingival microbiota. as a group, they did not harbor more of the "classic" periodontopathogens, although elevated proportions of s. constellatus were found.

TI  == acid tolerance response and survival by oral bacteria.
AB  == using 21 species of oral bacteria, representing six acidogenic genera, we undertook to determine whether the ph-limiting exponential growth is related to the ability of the organisms to generate an acid-tolerance response that results  in enhanced survival at low ph. the lower ph limit of exponential growth varied by more than two units with that of neisseria a182 at ph 6.34; growth of lactobacillus casei rb1014 stopped at ph 3.81, with species of actinomyces, enterococcus, prevotella and streptococcus falling between these limits. the working hypothesis was that the organisms with the higher ph limits for growth are unable to respond to acidic environments in order to survive, whereas the more aciduric organisms would possess or acquire acid tolerance. adaptation to acid tolerance was tested by determining whether the prior exposure of exponential-phase cells to a low, sub-lethal ph would trigger the induction of a  mechanism that would enhance survival at a ph killing ph 7.5 control cells. the killing ph varied from ph 4.5 for prevotella intermedia atcc 25611 to ph 2.3 for  the three lactobacillus casei strains in the study, with the three streptococcus  mutans strains killed at ph 3.0 for 3 h. the adaptation experiments revealed three groups of organisms: non-acid-responders, generally representing strains with the highest terminal ph values; weak acid-responders in the middle of the ph list, generating low numbers of survivors at one or two ph values, and the aciduric, strong responders generating a high number of survivors at ph values in the range 6.0 to 3.5, but not at ph 7.5. predominant among the latter group were  the s. mutans and lactobacilli casei strains, with the most significant adaptive  response exhibited by s. mutans lt11 and s. mutans ingbritt, involving a process  that required protein synthesis. time course experiments with the latter organisms indicated that 90-120 min was required after exposure to the triggering ph before the acid response was fully functional. these results indicate that the sudden exposure of strains of oral streptococci and lactobacilli, as well as enterococcus faecalis, to ph values between 6.0 and 3.5 results in the induction  of an acid tolerance response that enhances the survival of these strains at or below ph 3.5.

AB  == an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain ponssii has been isolated and partially characterized. the antibiotic is produced throughout culture growth, with maximum amounts accumulating in the broth when the culture is in the early stationary phase of growth. the activity declines within about 30 h after the culture enters stationary phase. purification techniques included chromatography on amberlite xad-2, deae sephadex and sp sephadex in addition to c18 hplc with an average yield of 75%. this antibiotic only inhibits pathogenic strains of s. scabies that cause scab disease on potato and other tuberous vegetables and does not affect s. griseus, s. venezuelae, actinomyces bovis, nocardia asteroides, clostridium perfringens, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli. the antibiotic has a molecular weight of 500 or less, and is stable for weeks at acidic ph but is very labile at alkaline ph conditions.

TI  == disinfection by calcium hydroxide pastes of dentinal tubules infected with two obligate and one facultative anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == bovine dentine cylinders were experimentally infected with actinomyces israelii,  fusobacterium nucleatum, or enterococcus faecalis. the latter is a facultative anaerobic bacteria and the others are obligate anaerobes commonly found in endodontic infections. the infected specimens were exposed to pastes of calcium hydroxide mixed with saline solution or camphorated paramonochlorophenol for periods of 1 h, 1 day, and 1 week. the viability of bacteria after these exposure times was evaluated by specimen incubation in culture medium to compare the effectiveness of the pastes in disinfecting dentinal tubules. the calcium hydroxide/camphorated paramonochlorophenol paste effectively killed bacteria in the tubules after a 1-h period of exposure, except for e. faecalis that required  one day of exposure. in contrast, the calcium hydroxide/saline paste was ineffective against e. faecalis and f. nucleatum even after 1 week of exposure. the results showed that camphorated paramonochlorophenol increased the antibacterial effects of calcium hydroxide.

TI  == serum antibodies to commensal oral and gut bacteria vary with age.
AB  == this study examined the relationship between serum antibody levels to selected bacteria from the commensal oral and gut flora with increased age in a healthy adult population. a total of 116 healthy subjects were studied consisting of the  following age groups: 20-39 years (group a), 40-59 years (group b), 60-79 years (group c) and 80+ years (group d). only significantly lower mean igm antibody levels to streptococcus mutans strain guy's serotype c were observed in older age groups (p < 0.001). with actinomyces viscosus nctc 10951 significantly reduced igm levels (p < 0.02) and significantly elevated iga levels were observed with increased age (p < 0.05). iga and igg antibodies to escherichia coli nctc 10418 were increased significantly in the older age groups (p < 0.001), whilst a trend  toward lower levels of igm antibodies was recorded with age. no changes in iga antibodies to streptococcus faecalis nctc 775 were observed but the lowest level  of igm antibodies were detected in the oldest age group (p < 0.05). mean specific activity was decreased with age with igm antibodies to the oral bacteria and increased with age with igg and iga antibodies to e. coli. overall, our results suggest a general reduction in serum igm antibody responses. this impairment in the circulatory igm immune response may contribute to the increased occurrence of infections in the elderly.

TI  == pathogenicity of bacteria using a simulated root canal system.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the reliability of an implantation test using teflon-simulated root canals for evaluating the pathogenicity of root  canal bacteria. models including suspensions of lyophilized strains (actinomyces  israelii, streptococcus faecalis, and porphyromonas asaccharolyticus) were implanted in rat subcutaneous tissue for 1 wk, and histological changes were observed. severe inflammation occurred around the models. among them, p. asaccharolyticus induced the severest inflammatory response. further study using  p. asaccharolyticus was conducted to compare the implantation test's ability to evaluate pathogenicity with that of an injection test at 1, 2, or 4 wk. tissue injected with a bacterial suspension showed no clear response through the experimental periods, whereas tissue around implantation sites showed a severe response at 1 wk. however, the inflammatory response subsided at later stages. consequently, further improvement is needed to investigate pathogenicity for long periods.

TI  == the endodontic microflora revisited.
AB  == the microbial flora of 35 dental root canals were examined, taking care to maintain the viability of obligate anaerobes which accounted for 45% of total isolations, while streptococcal species accounted for 24% of the total species isolated. individual root canals yielded a maximum of eight bacterial species. a  total of 40 different species was isolated of which the most prevalent were the facultative anaerobe streptococcus sanguis and the obligate anaerobe, peptostreptococcus micros (both in 23% of root canals), followed by eubacterium aerofaciens and the 'streptococcus milleri group' (both 17%) then prevotella melaninogenica (formerly bacteroides melaninogenicus), enterococcus faecalis and  prevotella oralis (formerly bacteroides oralis), which were each isolated from 14% of root canals. highly significant associations were discovered between four  pairs of species, viz p. melaninogenica with p. micros, p. melaninogenica with p. oralis, prevotella corporis with streptococcus morbillorum and actinomyces odontolyticus with e. faecalis.

TI  == [the bactericidal efficiency of ultrasonic in the root canal].
AB  == the objective of this paper was to determine the quantitative bactericidal efficiency of ultrasonic in the root canal. four test organisms found frequently  in the root canal were compared. the result showed ultrasonic can kill the test organisms effectively in the root canals. the best bactericidal efficiency occurred at 4 or 5 min. of ultrasonic though the more efficiency as the time longer. bactericidal irrigation could increase the bactericidal efficiency of ultrasonic and its bactericidal action similar to irrigation bactericidal property.

TI  == salivary-agglutinin-mediated adherence of streptococcus mutans to early plaque bacteria.
AB  == interspecies binding is important in the colonization of the oral cavity by bacteria. streptococcus mutans can adhere to other plaque bacteria, such as streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces viscosus, and this adherence is enhanced by saliva. the salivary and bacterial molecules that mediate this interaction were investigated. salivary agglutinin, a mucinlike glycoprotein known to mediate the  aggregation of many oral streptococci in vitro, was found to mediate the adherence of s. mutans to s. sanguis or a. viscosus. adherence of s. mutans to saliva- or agglutinin-coated s. sanguis and a. viscosus was inhibited by antibodies to the bacterial agglutinin receptor. expression of the s. sanguis receptor (ssp-5) gene in enterococcus faecalis increased adhesion of this organism to saliva- or agglutinin-coated s. sanguis and a. viscosus. this interaction could be inhibited by antibodies to the agglutinin receptor. the results suggest that salivary agglutinin can promote adherence of s. mutans to s. sanguis and a. viscosus through interactions with the agglutinin receptor on s. mutans.

TI  == bacteria in the apical 5 mm of infected root canals.
AB  == ten freshly extracted teeth which had carious pulpal exposures and periapical lesions contiguous with the root apex were placed inside an anaerobic chamber and the apical 5 mm of the root canals cultured. in addition to anaerobic incubation, duplicate cultures were incubated aerobically. fifty strains of bacteria from the 10 root canals were isolated and identified. the most prominent bacteria cultured from the 10 root canals were actinomyces, lactobacillus, black-pigmented bacteroides, peptostreptococcus, nonpigmented bacteroides, veillonella, enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and streptococcus mutans. of the  50 bacterial isolates, 34 (68%) were strict anaerobes. this study demonstrates the presence of predominantly anaerobic bacteria in the apical 5 mm of infected root canals in teeth with carious pulpal exposures and periapical lesions.

TI  == studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == [chemiluminescence response and phagocytic activity of murine polymorphonuclear leukocytes to various species of oral bacteria].
AB  == polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) are predominant cells in the gingival crevice  and saliva, and may play an important role in oral bacteria. murine peritoneal pmn was used and stimulated with 9 genera, 17 species of oral bacteria, including cariogenic and periodontal pathogens. the pmn response to the bacteria was measured by the luminol mediated chemiluminescence (cl) response and phagocytic activities, and the activities of lysozyme in the reaction medium after the cl response were also measured. the bacteria which could induce a high level of cl response of pmn were fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola and bacteroides gingivalis; middle grade were staphylococcus subsp. and actinomyces subsp.; low levels were lactobacillus subsp., all 5 species of streptococci and enterococcus  faecalis. phagocytic indexes of pmn to various kind of bacteria were distributed  from 8 to 40% and the bacterial numbers in 100 pmn were 27 to 301. there was no correlation between cl values and phagocytic indexes or between cl values and the bacterial number in 100 pmn by limiting the data on staphylococcus, streptococcus subsp. and lactobacillus subsp., the correlation efficiency which was obtained between their values was r = 0.91 or 0.86. there was only a little in the lysozyme activities released from pmn by stimulation of various kind of bacteria, and the maximum difference corresponded to only 2.8% of the whole lysozyme activity of pmn. either catalase activities or sod activities were measured by h2o2 decomposition or the inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity using the intact bacteria. neither of the enzyme activities of bacteria were closely related to the level of cl response.

TI  == apical periodontitis induced by selected bacterial strains in root canals of immunized and nonimmunized monkeys.
AB  == experimental infections in root canals with streptococcus faecalis ss. liquefaciens (strep-mc4). actinomyces bovis (act-mc6) and bacteroides oralis (bact-mc3) were studied in four immunized and five nonimmunized monkeys. the immunization was performed using antigens of the homologous strains. the antibody level was checked by gel diffusion. in 56 root canals of the immunized animals and 60 root canals of the nonimmunized animals, viable cells of the three bacterial strains were enclosed in equal amounts of various combinations. after 6 months, samples from the root canals were subjected to qualitative and quantitative bacteriologic analyses and the apical area was radiographically and  histologically examined. the analyses revealed no significant difference between  the two groups of monkeys, although the viable cell recovery was slightly higher  in most of the root canals of nonimmunized monkeys. the cell proportion of the strains within the different bacterial combinations was equal in root canals of the two groups of animals. the radiographic and histologic examinations revealed  no significant difference between the two groups of animals regarding the number  of teeth with periapical lesions. the radiographic examination, however, showed a more distinct limitation of the process in the immunized than in the nonimmunized monkeys. histologically the lesions were more encapsulated and had a sparser cell infiltration in immunized than in nonimmunized monkeys. in the latter, inflammatory cells had often infiltrated the bone. mixed infections gave a more severe periapical reaction than single strain infections in both animal groups.

TI  == bacteriolytic activity of human gingival exudate.
AB  == we investigated the bacteriolytic activity of gingival crevicular fluid (cf) on 14c-labeled streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus,  and on whole dental plaque. cf was collected from 100 healthy donors pooled and centrifuged at 200 g. cf supernate and a frozen and thawed extract of the pellet  were interacted with the different bacterial strains, while streptococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus released 60% and 75% of the radioactive label, only 38% of it was solubilized from streptococcus mutans, following their incubation with the cf supernate. the findings agreed with results obtained by interacting bacteria with a frozen and thawed lysate of human peripheral blood leukocytes. on the other hand, extracts from frozen and thawed cf pellet were inactive. further, lipoteichoic acid and lipopolysaccharide were released by cf from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. the role of bacteriolytic factors, present in cf, as a result of the interaction between microorganisms and leukocytes at inflammatory sites is discussed.
