TI  - Microbiological etiology of bacterial prostatitis in general hospital and primary care clinic in Korea.
AB  - PURPOSE: The National Institutes of Health classification of prostatitis reported the proportion of chronic bacterial prostatitis, especially category II, at 3% to 10%. Because of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnosis technique, chronic prostatitis syndrome (CPS) with a known bacterial origin has increased recently. In this study, we evaluated the proportion of chronic bacterial prostatitis in a general hospital and a primary care clinic (PCC) in addition to the distribution of the microorganism in chronic bacterial prostatitis in Korea. METHODS: Two hundred and ninety-three patients were enrolled in this study. One hundred and five patients in the general hospital and 188 patients in the PCC were enrolled in the study. Using a questionnaire, all patients were checked for symptoms of urinalysis, expressed prostate secretion (EPS), EPS or V3 culture and PCR of EPS or VB3 for Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma genetalia, and Trichomatis vaginalis. RESULTS: In routine EPS or VB3 culture, 12 of 105 patients (11.4%) in the general hospital showed positive culture, but 77 of 188 patients (40.9%) in the PCC showed a positive culture. Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas were isolated in routine culture. In the PCR diagnosis, 37 of 105 patients (35.2%) in the general hospital were PCR positive, and 65 of 188 patients (34.5%) in the PCC were PCR positive. In the general hospital, C. trachomatis was the most common (49%), followed by U. urealyticum (24%), M. genetalia (16%), M. hominis (10%), and T. vaginalis (2%). In the PCC, U. urealyticum was the most common (45%), followed by C. trachomatis (34%), M. hominis (13%), M. genetalia (7%) and T. vaginalis (1%). The proportions of chronic bacterial prostatitis were 46.6% (49/105) and 67.5% (127/188) in the general hospital and PCC, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The total portion of chronic bacterial prostatitis was 59.3% (174/293). Culture-positive patients in the PCC were significantly higher than in the general hospital, but the number of PCR positive patients in the PCC was the same as in the general hospital.
TI  - HIV-infected women of Burkina Faso: a "reservoir" of mycoplasma infection.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this work was to assess the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and genital mycoplasma colonization in 251 HIV-positive compared to 200 HIV-negative women at the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) service of Saint Camille Medical Center Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso). METHODOLOGY: After revealing the cervix with a speculum, we collected swabs of vaginal discharge for the detection of pathogenic bacteria. RESULTS: Among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women, we identified respectively: Mycoplasma hominis (16.7% versus 5.5%); Ureaplasma urealyticum (16.3% versus 0.0%); co-infection M. hominis with U. urealyticum (13.14% versus 0.0%); Candida albicans (21.11% versus 41.5%); E. coli (9.96% versus 4.0%); and the presence of abundant vaginal discharge (27.5% versus 5.0%) respectively. The Nugent's score, utilized for the diagnosis of BV, was significantly higher in HIV-positive women (p < 0.001) associated with poor vaginal hygiene practices (p < 0.01) and no use of condoms (p < 0.01). Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumonia, Klebsiella oxitocica, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Gardnerella vaginalis were also isolated, but in a low prevalence ranging from 0% to 5%. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the HIV-positive women of Burkina Faso are frequently affected by BV and represent a reservoir for mycoplasma infection. Since these germs can lead to sterility and premature delivery, it is important to develop a policy of screening.
TI  - Elevated concentrations of interleukin-6 in intra-amniotic infection with Ureaplasma urealyticum in asymptomatic women during genetic amniocentesis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intra-amniotic infection is an important cause of preterm delivery and interleukin-6 (IL-6) determination was recently applied for identification of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity. Our aim was to determine the levels of IL-6 in culture-positive amniotic fluids at genetic amniocentesis and to evaluate their significance in relation to pregnancy outcome. METHODS: Seven culture-positive and 23 culture-negative amniotic fluids, obtained at 17-19 weeks of gestation, were analyzed for IL-6 levels by an immunoassay (ELISA). Pregnancy outcomes of all 30 women were obtained from the medical charts. RESULTS: The mean level of IL-6 in the culture-negative amniotic fluids was 78+/-206 pg/ml. Among the seven culture-positive, high levels of IL-6 were found only in three amniotic fluids that were culture-positive for Ureaplasma urealyticum (1834, 1342 and 2832 pg/ml). Low levels of IL-6, ranging from zero to 60 pg/ml, were found in four AFs that were culture-positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=3) and Bacillus Gram-positive (n= 1). Adverse pregnancy outcome occurred in the three women who had intra-amniotic infection with U. urealyticum accompanied by high levels of IL-6 (two fetal loss and one preterm delivery at 28 weeks of gestation). The four women with culture-positive but IL-6 negative amniotic fluids, had normal pregnancy outcome and term delivery. Two of the 23 women with culture-negative had preterm delivery, one with high (1000 pg/ml) and one with low (80 pg/ml) levels of IL-6. CONCLUSION: High levels of IL-6 are suggestive of a genuine intra-amniotic infection with urea-plasmas resulting in adverse pregnancy outcome, while culture-positive amniotic fluids with normal IL-6 levels, may suggest a state of contamination.
TI  - Bacterial and Ureaplasma colonization of the airway: radiologic findings in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We designed this retrospective study to compare radiologic findings in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in whom gram-positive cocci (GPC), gram-negative bacilli (GNB), or Ureaplasma urealyticum were colonized. Another objective was to correlate the radiologic findings of these patients with the clinical severity of BPD. STUDY DESIGN: We correlated serial tracheal aspirates with radiographic findings from 183 infants whose birth weight was < or = 1250 gm. BPD severity was assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (36 w PCA) and at the time of discharge. Two radiologists independently scored films taken at birth and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of life. RESULTS: Of the study population, 55% were male and 35% were black; 80% received surfactant and 69% received dexamethasone; 91% survived. GPC isolates from throat cultures were mainly Staphylococcus [corrected] epidermidis and Streptococcus haemolyticus. A superimposed GNB colonization was present in 37% of these infants. Most common isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Escherichia coli. Sepsis caused by GPC developed in 16% of all patients; 7% had sepsis caused by GNB. Infants infected with GNB remained receiving oxygen at 36 w PCA and at the time of discharge twice as often as those noninfected. RADIOLOGIC FINDINGS: Hyperinflation, interstitial changes, and generalized or localized emphysema were prominent features throughout. Mean radiologic scores increased over time in a pattern similar among GPC, GNB, and U. urealyticum infected and noninfected infants. High radiologic scores were not predictive at any time of infants who needed supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 w PCA. Infants infected with U. urealyticum were neither clinically nor radiologically different than noncolonized neonates. CONCLUSION: GPC, GNB, and U. urealyticum airway colonization is not associated with particular radiographic changes at any time. GNB-infected infants had the most severe BPD course, and yet they were radiologically indistinguishable from the other patients. U. urealyticum colonization does not result in more clinically severe BPD or demonstrate a unique radiologic course.
TI  - [Microbial associations in Trichomonas urethritis].
AB  - The results on isolation of associated microflora from 190 patients suffering from Trichomonas urethritis are given. Microorganisms belonged to the species: Mycoplasma hominis. Ureaplasma urealyticum. Streptococcus pyogenes. Escherichia coli. Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis. Moraxella lacunata. Acinetobacter Calcoaceticus and Candida. Staphylococcus cultures which were isolated from 100% patients belonged to 8 species: Staphylococcus aureus, S. intermedius, S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis, S. capitis, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. saprophyticus. Most of Staphylococcus cultures had pathogenic features. Structure of Trichomonas vaginalis and interaction between them and associated microflora were studied by electron microscopy.
TI  - Antimicrobial treatment for chronic prostatitis as a means of defining the role of Ureaplasma urealyticum.
AB  - A study was conducted to assess the clinical and microbiological effects of antimicrobial treatment for chronic prostatitis as a means of defining the role of Ureaplasma urealyticum. Significant U. urealyticum cells were considered to be isolated from the prostates of 18 of 143 prostatitis patients. These patients with ureaplasma-associated prostatitis were randomly treated with either ofloxacin or minocycline for 2 weeks; 4 patients were excluded due to voluntary withdrawal. U. urealyticum was eradicated in all the patients. Symptoms were resolved in 10 patients, and leukocytes in expressed prostatic secretion were cleared in 4 patients; both drug treatments revealed similar results. Even if we exclude 3 patients with significant coexistent Staphylococcus epidermidis cells before treatment, 3 of 11 patients evaluated showed complete resolution of symptoms and clearance of leukocytes in expressed prostatic fluid. These results suggest that U. urealyticum is a causative organism in some patients with chronic prostatitis.
TI  - Septic osteomyelitis and polyarthritis with ureaplasma in hypogammaglobulinemia.
AB  - We describe a hypogammaglobulinemic woman with a one-year history of destructive  septic osteomyelitis and polyarthritis with positive cultures for Ureaplasma urealyticum from joint exudate and blood. The clinical course was complicated by subcutaneous abscesses from which both U. urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis were grown. Multiple routine cultures had been negative, except for sporadic findings of Staphylococcus epidermidis before specific cultures for mycoplasmas were performed. Therapy with beta-lactam antibiotics, clindamycin, rifampicin, fusidic acid and aminoglycosides had been given without obvious clinical effect. Intravenous doxycycline treatment instituted after microbiological diagnosis had a dramatic effect on the clinical course. The clinical suspicion of mycoplasma and ureaplasma as etiologic agents of orthopaedic infections in hypogammaglobulinemic patients is mandatory in order to perform appropriate cultures.
TI  - Ureaplasmal pneumonia and sepsis associated with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.
AB  - Ureaplasma urealyticum was isolated from the lower respiratory tract of three infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. In one, cultures positive for U urealyticum were obtained on multiple occasions from trachea, blood, and pleural fluid prior to the infant's death on postnatal day 6. Autopsy findings confirmed the presence of severe pneumonia and the organism was again recovered from multiple sites. A second infant had no apparent predisposing factors for development of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn but U urealyticum and Staphylococcus epidermidis were recovered from the trachea antemortem and from lung tissue obtained during autopsy on the 12th postnatal day. The third infant had persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn and a pulmonary infiltrate within hours after birth with tracheal cultures positive for both U urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis. Erythromycin was given for ten days, and the infant gradually improved. Prolonged ventilation with supplemental oxygen was necessary, and chronic lung disease developed. This is the first report of neonatal ureaplasmal pneumonia with sepsis and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn as well as the first time a microorganism other than streptococci has been specifically implicated in the pathogenesis of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. Respiratory infections with U urealyticum or other bacteria should be considered as possible causative or contributory factors in infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.
TI  - Chorioamnionitis: a study of organisms isolated in perinatal autopsies.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the validity of postmortem cultures in perinatal autopsies; in particular, those cases where there is gross or histologic evidence of chorioamnionitis. Lung, liver, blood, and placental cultures were obtained from 159 neonatal autopsies with histologic evidence of chorioamnionitis at Magee-Women's Hospital between January 1980 and July 1985. The criterion for chorioamnionitis was a polymorphonuclear leukocytic infiltrate in the placental membranes. The neonates studied were 63 percent white and 36 percent black; the male to female ratio was 83 to 76. Intrauterine fetal death occurred in 43 percent of the cases. The mean gestational age was 24 weeks. Premature labor occurred in 64 percent of the cases, and 70 percent of the cases presented with premature rupture of fetal membranes. Congenital pneumonia (defined by the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the alveolar spaces) was present in 45 percent of cases. The lung was the most frequent site cultured; the four most frequently isolated organisms were: Staphylococcus epidermidis--18 percent; Beta Streptococcus Group B--13 percent; E. coli--nine percent; Ureaplasma urealyticum--nine percent. Negative cultures from multiple sites occurred in seven percent of cases. The results of this investigation indicate that multi-organ cultures help in defining the role of a particular bacteria as a pathogen, and that Staphylococcus epidermidis may be a true fetal pathogen under certain conditions. It is recommended that cultures for Chlamydia trachomatis not be done on fetal tissues.
TI  - The acute urethral syndrome in routine practice.
AB  - Midstream samples of urine from 185 acutely dysuric women and 89 symptom-free controls were screened according to the modified criteria of Kass by both conventional and microaerophilic culture. Among the 185 symptomatic women, coliform bacilli were isolated from 125 (67.5%) and in 45 (36%) of the latter the concentration of these organisms in the urine was less than 10(8)/l. Fastidious organisms were isolated in pure and mixed cultures from 25 (13.4%) of the 185 patients and from 4 (4.5%) of 89 controls. Staphylococcus species were isolated from 10.8% (9.7% S. saprophyticus; 1.1% S. epidermidis) and Ureaplasma urealyticum from 2.7%. All patients infected with conventional organisms but only 30.4% of those yielding fastidious organisms had pyuria. The isolation rate of fastidious organisms tended to be higher (P = 0.055) in symptomatic women that in symptom-free controls.
TI  - Polymicrobial early postpartum endometritis with facultative and anaerobic bacteria, genital mycoplasmas, and Chlamydia trachomatis: treatment with piperacillin or cefoxitin.
AB  - A protected, triple-lumen transcervical culture method was used to recover organisms from the endometrium. At least one facultative or one anaerobic species of bacteria was recovered from 82% of the patients, and genital mycoplasmas were recovered from 76% of the women with endometritis. Bacteria together with genital mycoplasmas were present in 61% of the women, bacteria alone were present in 20%, genital mycoplasmas alone were present in 16%, and Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated from 2% of the patients. The most common organisms included Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptococcus spp., Bacteroides spp., Staphylococcus epidermidis, group B Streptococcus, and Ureaplasma urealyticum. A randomized, double-blind regimen of either piperacillin or cefoxitin was equally successful in treating the postpartum endometritis.

TI  - Microbial flora in semen of asymptomatic infertile men.
AB  - A microbiological examination has been carried out in 116 patients with unexplained infertility and with asymptomatic bacteriospermia. Organisms more frequently isolated were Staphylococcus epidermidis (81.9%), non hemolytic streptococci (23.3%), diphtheroids (25%) and alpha-hemolytic streptococci (18.1%). None of the 103 patients were positive for C. trachomatis. Mycoplasmas were isolated in 56 (48.3%) of the 116 examined samples, U. urealyticum was present in 49 (42.2%), M. hominis in 3 (2.6%) and both species in 4 (3.5%) samples of examined fluids. Forty-one of the 56 mycoplasmas-positive patients have been treated with doxycycline therapy. The treatment improved motility and caused decrease of coiled tails in 12 cases. Conception occurred in 5 (26.3%) of the 19 treated patients whose cultures were negative for mycoplasmas. These 5 pregnancies occurred in the patients that had high titers (greater than 10(5) c.c.u./ml) of ureaplasmas and in which the antibiotic therapy was successful. No pregnancy was seen in the other 22 patients where treatment failed to eradicate mycoplasmas.
TI  - [Comparative bacteriological and chemical analysis of kidney calculi. Apropos of  135 cases].
AB  - The formation of some urinary tract stones (struvite stones) is known to be related to infection by urease-possessing microorganisms, such as Proteus sp. and some other bacteria. Ureaplasma urealyticum, a genital mycoplasma, contains also urease and is predominantly located in the urogenital tract. Its significance in the production of human urinary stones has not yet been elucidated. In this study, 135 human calculi obtained by surgery were analysed chemically and were cultured for the presence of conventional bacteria and U. urealyticum, 51 were ammonium magnesium phosphate stones and contained Proteus (27), E. coli (4), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3), Streptococcus D (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1), Corynebacterium (1), Candida albicans (1). U. urealyticum was isolated in one patient, from two different calculi (left and right) taken after an interval of fifteen days. Different bacteria were isolated from other calculi (oxalate, uric acid). This findings suggest that Ureaplasma urealyticum should be looked for in struvite calculi.
TI  - Sexually transmitted conditions among women college students.
AB  - We studied 500 unselected young women who consulted a gynecologist in a student health service. Most participants were symptom-free and had normal physical examinations. Few sexually transmitted infections were encountered. Neisseria gonorrhoeae was recovered from two and Trichomonas vaginalis was obtained from 14 of 500 women. Chlamydia trachomatis was recovered from 20 (4.6%) of 439 participants. Genital warts, genital herpes, and molluscum contagiosum, respectively, were noted in seven, four, and one of the 500 participants. There was no cases of syphilis, scabies, or pediculosis pubis. Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum, respectively, were recovered from 17.6 and 56.8% of the subjects. Prevalent vaginal bacteria included lactobacilli, streptococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and diphtheroids. Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated from the vaginal specimens of about one third of the participants.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  - Semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group A) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group B). These 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. Overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group A were positive and 73% from group B were positive. Mixed bacterial flora were isolated from both groups but in group B they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group A. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. aureus, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group A. Group B revealed these organisma plus Streptococcus pneumoniae type III, Strep. pyogenes group A, Strep. feacalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Eubacterium species. Semen samples from group A were of better quality than those from group B. In addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group A was greater than that from group B.
TI  - Microbiological investigation of Bartholin's gland abscesses and cysts.
AB  - Percutaneous aspirates from intact Bartholin's gland cysts (12) and abscesses (34) were examined for bacteria and genital mycoplasmas. Aspirates from 10 of the 12 patients with Bartholin's gland cysts were sterile. Aspirates from the other two cysts contained organisms that are part of the vaginal microbial flora. Of the 34 abscesses, 24 (70.6 per cent) contained bacteria. Eight abscesses contained gram-negative rods in pure culture and four contained gonococci in pure culture. Twelve abscesses contained one or more vaginal organisms including anaerobic gram-negative rods (eight isolates), anaerobic gram-positive cocci (eight), Staphylococcus epidermidis (four), and microaerophilic streptococci (three). Although most of the patients had genital mycoplasmas isolated from vaginal cultures, Mycoplasma hominis was isolated from only one and Ureaplasma urealyticum from none of the aspirates.
