TI  == in vitro inhibition of clostridium difficile and clostridium perfringens by commercial probiotic strains.
AB  == probiotics have gained importance in human and veterinary medicine to prevent and control clostridial enteric disease. limited information is available on the ability of different probiotic bacteria used in food products to inhibit clostridium difficile and clostridium perfringens. the objective of this study was to examine the in vitro inhibitory effects of selected commercial bacterial strains on pathogenic clostridia and their growth characteristics under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. the inhibitory effects of 17 commercial strains of lactobacillus (n = 16) and bifidobacterium (n = 1) on the reference strains of c. difficile and c. perfringens were assessed by an agar well diffusion assay and by a broth culture inhibition assay using cell-free supernatant harvested at different growth phases, with and without ph neutralization. to study growth characteristics, probiotic strains were cultivated in different acid and bile environments, and growth in the modified media was compared to growth in standard medium. in the agar well diffusion assay, supernatant obtained from two probiotic strains inhibited the growth of both reference and clinical strains of c. perfringens. this effect as seen when supernatant was assessed with and without ph neutralization. supernatants obtained from 10 probiotic strains inhibited c. difficile only when supernatant was added without ph neutralization. in the broth culture inhibition assay, growth of c. perfringens and c. difficile was inhibited by supernatant without ph neutralization from 5 and 10 probiotic strains, respectively. all potential probiotic strains were able to grow at ph 4.0 and in  the presence of 0.15% and 0.3% bile but none were able to grow or survive at ph 2.0. altogether five probiotic strains [lactobacillus plantarum (n = 2), lactobacillus rhamnosus (n = 2), bifidobacterium animalis lactis (n = 1)] were shown to inhibit all strains of c. difficile and c. perfringens. the inhibitory effect was probiotic strain-specific. two strains showed a ph-independent inhibitory effect likely due to production of either antibiotics or bacteriocins  inhibiting c. perfringens only. these strains have favourable growth characteristics for use as probiotics and their efficacy as prophylactic or therapeutic measures against clostridial enteric disease should be further evaluated by clinical trials in animals.

TI  == portrait of a canine probiotic bifidobacterium--from gut to gut.
AB  == the gastrointestinal environment is a complex interactive system involving the host, ingested dietary components, and numerous microbial species. we hypothesized that isolation and screening of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria adherent to healthy canine gastrointestinal tissue would yield strains with commensal activity in canines. the aims of this study were (1) to isolate a bank  of commensal organisms from the canine gastrointestinal tract; (2) to screen these novel microbial isolates for potential probiotic effects; (3) to select one organism from these screens and test its impact on the canine microbiota. lactic  acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from resected canine gastrointestinal tissue and screened in vitro for putative probiotic activities. murine studies examined  gastrointestinal transit and inhibition of salmonella typhimurium translocation.  one strain was progressed to a canine study where its impact on the gastrointestinal microbiota was determined. of the 420 isolates from the canine gut, 62 strains were characterised as lab. following assessment of the strain bank with regard to ph sensitivity, bile resistance, pathogen inhibition and survival following freeze-drying, four lactobacillus strains and two bifidobacteria strains were selected for further examination. bifidobacterium animalis ahc7 adhered to epithelial cells, transited the murine gastrointestinal  tract to high numbers and significantly reduced s. typhimurium translocation. b.  animalis ahc7 consumption significantly reduced the carriage of clostridia, in particular clostridium difficile, in dogs. this study describes the isolation and screening of canine-derived bacterial strains with commensal traits. the results  demonstrate that b. animalis ahc7 has significant potential for improving canine  gastrointestinal health.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by probiotic strains modify the adhesion of probiotics and enteropathogens to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == exopolysaccharides (epss) are exocellular polymers present in the surface of many bacteria, including lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. the genome sequence of several strains revealed the presence of eps-encoding genes. however, the physiological role that epss play in the bacterial ecology still remains uncertain. in this study, we have assessed the effect of epss produced by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium longum nb667, and bifidobacterium animalis ipla-r1 on the adhesion of probiotic and enteropathogen strains to human intestinal mucus. the eps fraction gg had no significant effect on the adhesion of l. rhamnosus gg and b. animalis ipla-r1. however, the eps fractions nb667 and  ipla-r1 significantly reduced the adherence of both probiotic strains. in contrast, the three eps fractions increased the adhesion of enterobacter sakazakii atcc 29544 and escherichia coli nctc 8603. higher adherence of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 29631 and clostridium difficile atcc 9689 was detected in the presence of the eps fractions gg and nb667. in general,  these effects were obtained at eps concentrations of up to 5 mg/ml, and they were eps dose dependent. the competitive exclusion of probiotics in the presence of eps could suggest the involvement of these biopolymers in the adhesion to mucus.  the increase in the adherence of enteropathogens could be explained if components of the pathogen surface are able to bind to specific epss and the bound epss are  able to adhere to mucus. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work reporting the effect of epss from probiotics on bacterial adhesion properties.
