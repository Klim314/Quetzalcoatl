TI  == quantitative analysis of a high-rate hydrogen-producing microbial community in anaerobic agitated granular sludge bed bioreactors using glucose as substrate.
AB  == fermentative h(2) production microbial structure in an agitated granular sludge bed bioreactor was analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) and polymerase chain reaction-denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). this hydrogen-producing system was operated at four different hydraulic retention times (hrts) of 4, 2, 1, and 0.5 h and with an influent glucose concentration of  20 g chemical oxygen demand/l. according to the pcr-dgge analysis, bacterial community structures were mainly composed of clostridium sp. (possibly clostridium pasteurianum), klebsiella oxytoca, and streptococcus sp. significant  increase of clostridium/total cell ratio (68%) was observed when the reactor was  operated under higher influent flow rate. the existence of streptococcus sp. in the reactor became more important when operated under a short hrt as indicated by the ratio of streptococcus probe-positive cells to clostridium probe-positive cells changing from 21% (hrt 4 h) to 38% (hrt 0.5 h). fish images suggested that  streptococcus cells probably acted as seeds for self-flocculated granule formation. furthermore, combining the inspections with hydrogen production under  different hrts and their corresponding fish analysis indicated that k. oxytoca did not directly contribute to h(2) production but possibly played a role in consuming o(2) to create an anaerobic environment for the hydrogen-producing clostridium.

TI  == assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.
