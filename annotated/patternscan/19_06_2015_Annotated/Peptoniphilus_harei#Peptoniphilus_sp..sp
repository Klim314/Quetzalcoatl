TI  == comparative microbial analysis of paired amniotic fluid and cord blood from pregnancies complicated by preterm birth and early-onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  == background: 16s rrna-based genomic analyses have revolutionized our understanding of infectious diseases. many cases which were recognized as "idiopathic" are now  known to have an infectious etiology. here, we present a proof-of-concept study to examine the microbial link between intra-amniotic infection (iai) and early-onset neonatal sepsis (eons). results: using culture independent methods, we analyzed paired amniotic fluid (af) and cord blood (cb) samples from 36 singleton pregnancies complicated by preterm birth (ptb), iai, and/or eons. ptb cases were grouped as 1) group 1- neonatal blood culture-positive eons (n=6). 2)  group 2- neonatal blood culture-negative presumed eons with positive iai (n=16).  3) group 3- neonatal blood culture-negative presumed eons with no iai (n=7); 4) group 4- no eons or iai (n=7). in addition, samples from term healthy deliveries  (n=8) served as technical controls. a total of 31 species (15 non-redundant) were identified in af, of which only 1/3 were cultivated. significantly fewer microorganisms were detected in cb, with a total of 18 species (7 non-redundant)  identified, of which only 2 (escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae) were cultivated. of those, bergeyella, fusobacterium nucleatum, and sneathia sanguinegens had not been detected in eons before. the novel species identified in af by pcr include peptoniphilus harei and lachnospiraceae sp. the majority (72%) of cb species were also detected in the matching af, with e. coli and f. nucleatum as the most prevalent. the 16s rrna sequences of paired af and cb were  99.9-100% identical, while no identical sequences were found between different pregnancies. conclusions: previously unrecognized, uncultivated or difficult-to-cultivate species are implicated in eons. microbial species in paired af and cb likely share the same infectious origin. given its prevalence in eons, f. nucleatum should be placed on the same importance scale as e. coli.

TI  == peptoniphilus coxii sp. nov. and peptoniphilus tyrrelliae sp. nov. isolated from  human clinical infections.
AB  == two groups of previously undescribed anaerobic, gram-positive cocci recovered from human clinical infections were characterized using phenotypic and molecular  genotypic methods. comparative genotypic analysis showed that the strains within  each of these two groups were homogeneous within the group and that each group was unique within the genus peptoniphilus. the first group is most closely related to peptoniphilus ivorii and the second group to peptoniphilus harei. based on these findings we propose two novel species, peptoniphilus coxii sp. nov. and peptoniphilus tyrrelliae sp. nov. the type strains are p. coxii sp. nov., rma 16757(t) (= jcm 16892(t) = ccug 59622(t) = atcc baa-2106(t)) and p. tyrrelliae sp. nov., rma 19911(t) (= jcm 16893(t) = ccug 59621(t) = atcc baa-2105(t)).

TI  == peptoniphilus gorbachii sp. nov., peptoniphilus olsenii sp. nov., and anaerococcus murdochii sp. nov. isolated from clinical specimens of human origin.
AB  == three groups of previously unknown gram-positive, anaerobic, coccus-shaped bacteria were characterized using phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. phenotypic and genotypic data demonstrate that these organisms are distinct, and  each group represents a previously unknown subline within clostridium cluster xiii. two groups are most closely related to peptoniphilus harei in the genus peptoniphilus, and the other group is most closely related to anaerococcus lactolyticus in the genus anaerococcus. based on the findings, three novel species, peptoniphilus gorbachii sp. nov., peptoniphilus olsenii sp. nov., and anaerococcus murdochii sp. nov., are proposed. the type strains of peptoniphilus  gorbachii sp. nov., peptoniphilus olsenii sp. nov., and anaerococcus murdochii sp. nov. are wal 10418(t) (= ccug 53341(t) = atcc baa-1383(t)), wal 12922(t) (= ccug 53342(t) = atcc baa-1384(t)), and wal 17230(t) (= ccug 53340(t) = atcc baa-1385(t)), respectively.

TI  == proposal of the genera anaerococcus gen. nov., peptoniphilus gen. nov. and gallicola gen. nov. for members of the genus peptostreptococcus.
AB  == members of genus peptostreptococcus have previously been found to be distantly related to the type species, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, on the basis of 16s rdna sequence similarities. they were divided into three major phylogenetic groups, and their peptidoglycan structure and biochemical traits differed between groups. the reclassification of the species of these three groups into three new  genera, peptoniphilus gen. nov., anaerococcus gen. nov. and gallicola gen. nov.,  is proposed. the genus peptoniphilus gen. nov. includes the following butyrate-producing, non-saccharolytic species that use peptone and amino acids as major energy sources: peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus comb. nov. (type species), peptoniphilus lacrimaris comb. nov., peptoniphilus harei comb. nov., peptoniphilus indolicus comb. nov. and peptoniphilus ivorii comb. nov. the genus  anaerococcus gen. nov. contains the saccharolytic, butyrate-producing species anaerococcus prevotii comb. nov. (type species), anaerococcus tetradius comb. nov., anaerococcus lactolyticus comb. nov., anaerococcus hydrogenalis comb. nov., anaerococcus vaginalis comb. nov. and anaerococcus octavius sp. nov. the genus gallicola gen. nov. contains a single species, gallicola barnesae comb. nov.
