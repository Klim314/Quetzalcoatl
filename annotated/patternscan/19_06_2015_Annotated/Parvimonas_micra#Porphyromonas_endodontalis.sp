TI  == subgingival microbial communities in leukocyte adhesion deficiency and their relationship with local immunopathology.
AB  == leukocyte adhesion deficiency i (lad-i) is a primary immunodeficiency caused by single gene mutations in the cd18 subunit of beta2 integrins which result in defective transmigration of neutrophils into the tissues. affected patients suffer from recurrent life threatening infections and severe oral disease (periodontitis). microbial communities in the local environment (subgingival plaque) are thought to be the triggers for inflammatory periodontitis, yet little is known regarding the microbial communities associated with lad-i periodontitis. here we present the first comprehensive characterization of the subgingival communities in lad-i, using a 16s rrna gene-based microarray, and investigate the relationship of this tooth adherent microbiome to the local immunopathology of periodontitis. we show that the lad subgingival microbiome is distinct from that  of health and localized aggressive periodontitits. select periodontitis-associated species in the lad microbiome included parvimonas micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, eubacterium brachy and treponema species. pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium not typically found in subgingival plaque is detected in  lad-i. we suggest that microbial products from lad-associated communities may have a role in stimulating the local inflammatory response. we demonstrate that bacterial lps translocates into the lesions of lad-periodontitis potentially triggering immunopathology. we also show in in vitro assays with human macrophages and in vivo in animal models that microbial products from lad-associated subgingival plaque trigger il-23-related immune responses, which have been shown to dominate in patient lesions. in conclusion, our current study  characterizes the subgingival microbial communities in lad-periodontitis and supports their role as triggers of disease pathogenesis.

TI  == combinations of bacterial species associated with symptomatic endodontic infections in a chinese population.
AB  == aim: to use microarrays to detect 11 selected bacteria in infected root canals, revealing bacterial combinations that are associated with clinical symptoms and signs of primary endodontic infections in a chinese population. methodology: dna  was extracted from 90 samples collected from the root canals of teeth with primary endodontic infections in a chinese population, and the 16s rrna gene was  amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the pcr products were hybridized to microarrays containing specific oligonucleotide probes targeting 11 species, and  the arrays were screened with a confocal laser scanner. pearson's chi-squared test and cluster analysis were performed to investigate the associations between  the bacterial combinations and clinical symptoms and signs using sas 8.02. results: seventy-seven samples (86%) yielded at least one of the 11 target species. parvimonas micra (56%), porphyromonas endodontalis (51%), tannerella forsythia (48%), prevotella intermedia (44%) and porphyromonas gingivalis (37%) were the most prevalent taxa and were often concomitant. the following positive associations were found between the bacterial combinations and clinical features: p. endodontalis and t. forsythia with abscess; p. gingivalis and p. micra with sinus tract; p. gingivalis and p. endodontalis or p. micra and p. endodontalis with abscess and sinus tract; and the combination of p. endodontalis, p. micra, t. forsythia and p. gingivalis with sinus tract (p < 0.05). conclusions: various  combinations of p. micra, p. endodontalis, t. forsythia and p. gingivalis may contribute to abscesses or sinus tracts of endodontic origin with bacterial synergism in a chinese population.

TI  == [study of association between parvimonas micra and pulp dominant pathogens in the infected root canals with chronic periradicular periodontitis].
AB  == objective: to study the prevalence of parvimonas micra (pm) and the associations  between pm and pulp dominant pathogens in order to reflect the colonization of pm in the infected root canals with chronic periradicular periodontitis. methods: a  total of 120 teeth diagnosed as chronic periradicular periodontitis from 104 patients were included into the study. the teeth were allocated into untreated (primary infectious) and root-canal- treated (secondary infectious) groups with 60 in either group. samples were collected from the root canals using sterile files and paper points, and subsequent extraction of bacterial dna was undertaken. the pm 16s rdna level was evaluated using 16s rdna pcr. the prevalence of pm in chronic periradicular periodontitis was determined accordingly. then, the associations of pm and enterococcus faecalis (ef), porphyromonas endodontalis (pe) as well as porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) were analysed. results: pm was detected in 40% (24/60) of the samples from the primary infectious group, 5% (3/60) from the secondary infectious group. the prevalences  of pm from the two groups were different significantly (chi(2) = 21.06, p < 0.05). significant correlations (untreated group or = 5.98, root-canal-treated group or = 33.50) between pm and pe were identified in both groups, while the correlations between pm and pg as well as ef were not of significance, respectively. conclusions: a significantly higher relevance ratio of pm was estimated in the primary infectious group than the secondary infectious one. pm and pe were correlated significantly in the infected root canals, suggesting a symbiotic relation between these two bacteria.

TI  == hydrogen sulfide production from subgingival plaque samples.
AB  == periodontitis is a polymicrobial anaerobe infection. little is known about the dysbiotic microbiota and the role of bacterial metabolites in the disease process. it is suggested that the production of certain waste products in the proteolytic metabolism may work as markers for disease severity. hydrogen sulfide (h2s) is a gas produced by degradation of proteins in the subgingival pocket. it  is highly toxic and believed to have pro-inflammatory properties. we aimed to study h2s production from subgingival plaque samples in relation to disease severity in subjects with natural development of the disease, using a colorimetric method based on bismuth precipitation. in remote areas of northern thailand, adults with poor oral hygiene habits and a natural development of periodontal disease were examined for their oral health status. h2s production was measured with the bismuth method and subgingival plaque samples were analyzed for the presence of 20 bacterial species with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. in total, 43 subjects were examined (age 40-60 years, mean pi 95 +/- 6.6%). fifty-six percent had moderate periodontal breakdown (cal > 3 < 7 mm) and 35% had severe periodontal breakdown (cal > 7 mm) on at least one site. parvimonas micra, filifactor alocis, porphyromonas endodontalis and fusobacterium nucleatum were frequently detected. h2s production could not be correlated to periodontal disease severity (ppd or cal at sampled sites) or to a  specific bacterial composition. site 21 had statistically lower production of h2s (p = 0.02) compared to 16 and 46. betel nut chewers had statistically significant lower h2s production (p = 0.01) than non-chewers. rapid detection and estimation  of subgingival h2s production capacity was easily and reliably tested by the colorimetric bismuth sulfide precipitation method. h2s may be a valuable clinical marker for degradation of proteins in the subgingival pocket.

TI  == macrophage cell activation with acute apical abscess contents determined by interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha production.
AB  == introduction: this clinical study has investigated the antigenic activity of bacterial contents from exudates of acute apical abscesses (aaas) and their paired root canal contents regarding the stimulation capacity by levels of interleukin (il)-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) throughout the root canal treatment against macrophage cells. methods: paired samples of infected root canals and exudates of aaas were collected from 10 subjects. endodontic contents were sampled before (root canal sample [rcs] 1) and after chemomechanical preparation (rcs2) and after 30 days of intracanal medication with calcium hydroxide + chlorhexidine gel (ca[oh]2 + chx gel) (rcs3). polymerase chain reaction (16s rdna) was used for detection of the target bacteria, whereas  limulus amebocyte lysate was used to measure endotoxin levels. raw 264.7 macrophages were stimulated with aaa exudates from endodontic contents sampled in different moments of root canal treatment. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to measure the levels of tnf-alpha and il-1 beta. results: parvimonas micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, dialister pneumosintes, and prevotella nigrescens were the most frequently detected species. higher levels of endotoxins were found in samples from periapical exudates at rcs1 (p < .005). in fact, samples collected from periapical exudates showed a higher stimulation capacity at rcs1 (p < .05). a positive correlation was found between endotoxins from exudates with il-1 beta (r = 0.97) and tnf-alpha (r = 0.88) production (p < .01). the significant reduction of endotoxins and bacterial species achieved by chemomechanical procedures (rcs2) resulted in a lower capacity of root canal contents to stimulate the cells compared with that at rcs1 (p < .05). the use of  ca(oh)2 + chx gel as an intracanal medication (rcs3) improved the removal of endotoxins and bacteria from infected root canals (p < .05) whose contents induced a lower stimulation capacity against macrophages cells at rcs1, rcs2, and rcs3 (p < .05). conclusions: aaa exudates showed higher levels of endotoxins and  showed a greater capacity of macrophage stimulation than the paired root canal samples. moreover, the use of intracanal medication improved the removal of bacteria and endotoxins from infected root canals, which may have resulted in the reduction of the inflammatory potential of the root canal content.

TI  == microbial evaluation of traumatized teeth treated with triple antibiotic paste or calcium hydroxide with 2% chlorhexidine gel in pulp revascularization.
AB  == introduction: revascularization outcome depends on microbial elimination because  apical repair will not happen in the presence of infected tissues. this study evaluated the microbial composition of traumatized immature teeth and assessed their reduction during different stages of the revascularization procedures performed with 2 intracanal medicaments. methods: fifteen patients (7-17 years old) with immature teeth were submitted to the revascularization procedures; they were divided into 2 groups according to the intracanal medicament used: tap group (n = 7), medicated with a triple antibiotic paste, and chp group (n = 8), dressed with calcium hydroxide + 2% chlorhexidine gel. samples were taken before any treatment (s1), after irrigation with 6% naocl (s2), after irrigation with 2% chlorhexidine (s3), after intracanal dressing (s4), and after 17% edta irrigation (s5). cultivable bacteria recovered from the 5 stages were counted and identified by means of polymerase chain reaction assay (16s rrna). results: both groups had  colony-forming unit counts significantly reduced after s2 (p < .05); however, no  significant difference was found between the irrigants (s2 and s3, p = .99). no difference in bacteria counts was found between the intracanal medicaments used (p = .95). the most prevalent bacteria detected were actinomyces naeslundii (66.67%), followed by porphyromonas endodontalis, parvimonas micra, and fusobacterium nucleatum, which were detected in 33.34% of the root canals. an average of 2.13 species per canal was found, and no statistical correlation was observed between bacterial species and clinical/radiographic features. conclusions: the microbial profile of infected immature teeth is similar to that  of primarily infected permanent teeth. the greatest bacterial reduction was promoted by the irrigation solutions. the revascularization protocols that used the tested intracanal medicaments were efficient in reducing viable bacteria in necrotic immature teeth.

TI  == signaling pathways activation by primary endodontic infectious contents and production of inflammatory mediators.
AB  == introduction: this study investigated the bacterial community involved in primary endodontic diseases, evaluated its ability to activate the macrophage toll-like receptor 4 receptor through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) and nuclear factor kappa b (nf-kappab) signaling pathways, and determined the levels  of endotoxins and interleukins (interleukin [il]-6 and -10) produced by endodontic content-stimulated macrophages. methods: samples were taken from 21 root canals by using sterile/apyrogenic paper points. raw 264.7 macrophages were  stimulated with root canal contents. checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was used  for bacterial analysis and the limulus amebocyte lysate assay for endotoxin measurement; p38 mapk and nf-kappab activation was determined by western blot analysis. il-6 and il-10 were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: bacteria and endotoxins were detected in 100% of the samples (21/21). the most frequently observed species were parvimonas micra (16/21, 76%), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (15/21, 71%), and porphyromonas endodontalis (14/21, 66%). correlations were found between endotoxins and il-6 and il-10 (p < .05); p38 phosphorylation had a peak at 60 minutes, and nf-kappab  was quickly activated after 10 minutes of stimulation. conclusions: it was concluded that the complex bacterial community was shown to be a potent activator of tlr-4 determined by the p38 mapk and nf-kappab signaling pathways, culminating in a high antigenicity against macrophages through the levels of il-6 and il-10,  all significantly affected by endotoxin levels.

TI  == an investigation of the presence of specific anaerobic species in necrotic primary teeth.
AB  == different microbial identification methods have shown that the microbial community profiles in endodontic infections are diverse and assorted. the aim of  this study was to evaluate the frequency of selected endodontic pathogens in the  pulp chambers (pcs) and root canals (rcs) of infected primary teeth using pcr methods. paired pc and rc samples were collected from 15 subjects and analyzed by pcr for the presence of filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella tannerae, tanerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii. the frequency of each species was  determined in the pc and rc of each case. the species most frequently detected in pcs were p. nigrescens (86.7%), p. gingivalis (73.3%), and f. alocis (73.3%). of  the pc samples, 13.3% contained p. micra and t. denticola, and 6.7% contained t.  forsythia. the species most frequently detected in rcs were p. gingivalis (100%)  and p. nigrescens (93.3%). p. tannerae, p. micra, and t. denticola were found in  40% of the rc samples; t. forsythia was found in 26.7% of the rc samples. the "red complex", which comprises p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, was not found in the pc of any tooth but was found in 30% of the rc samples. the detection of p. nigrescens in the pc was statistically associated with the presence of p. nigrescens in the rc (p = 0.04). the results suggest high heterogeneity among the samples, even among those from the same subject.

TI  == molecular methods for diagnosis of odontogenic infections.
AB  == purpose: historically, the identification of microorganisms has been limited to species that could be cultured in the microbiology laboratory. the purpose of the present study was to apply molecular techniques to identify microorganisms in orofacial odontogenic infections (ois). materials and methods: specimens were obtained from subjects with clinical evidence of oi. to identify the microorganisms involved, 16s rrna sequencing methods were used on clinical specimens. the name and number of the clones of each species identified and the combinations of species present were recorded for each subject. descriptive statistics were computed for the study variables. results: specimens of pus or wound fluid were obtained from 9 subjects. a mean of 7.4 +/- 3.7 (standard deviation) species per case were identified. the predominant species detected in  the present study that have previously been associated with ois were fusobacterium spp, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, and prevotella oris. the predominant species detected in our study that have not been previously associated with ois were dialister pneumosintes and eubacterium brachy. unculturable phylotypes accounted for 24% of the species identified in our study. all species detected were obligate or facultative anaerobes. streptococci were not detected. conclusions: molecular methods have enabled us to detect previously cultivated and not-yet-cultivated species in ois; these methods could change our  understanding of the pathogenic flora of orofacial ois.

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == gingival fluid cytokine expression and subgingival bacterial counts during pregnancy and postpartum: a case series.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to assess gingival fluid (gcf) cytokine messenger rna (mrna) levels, subgingival bacteria, and clinical periodontal conditions during a normal pregnancy to postpartum. materials and methods: subgingival bacterial samples were analyzed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. gcf samples were assessed with real-time pcr including five proinflammatory cytokines and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor. results: nineteen pregnant women with a mean age of 32 years (s.d. +/- 4 years, range 26-42) participated in the study. full-mouth bleeding scores (bop) decreased from an average of 41.2% (s.d. +/- 18.6%) at the 12th week of pregnancy to 26.6% (s.d. +/- 14.4%) at the 4-6 weeks postpartum (p < 0.001). between week 12 and 4-6 weeks postpartum, the mean probing pocket depth changed from 2.4 mm (s.d. +/- 0.4) to 2.3 mm (s.d. +/- 0.3) (p = 0.34). higher counts of eubacterium saburreum, parvimonas micra, selenomonas noxia, and staphylococcus aureus were found at week 12 of pregnancy than at the 4-6 weeks postpartum examinations (p < 0.001). during and after pregnancy, statistically significant correlations between bop scores and bacterial counts were observed. bop scores and gcf levels of selected cytokines were not related to each other and no differences in gcf levels of the  cytokines were observed between samples from the 12th week of pregnancy to 4-6 weeks postpartum. decreasing postpartum counts of porphyromonas endodontalis and  pseudomonas aeruginosa were associated with decreasing levels of il-8 and il-1beta. conclusions: bop decreased after pregnancy without any active periodontal therapy. associations between bacterial counts and cytokine levels varied greatly in pregnant women with gingivitis and a normal pregnancy outcome.  postpartum associations between gcf cytokines and bacterial counts were more consistent. clinical relevance: combined assessments of gingival fluid cytokines  and subgingival bacteria may provide important information on host response.

TI  == the subgingival microbiota of papillon-lefevre syndrome.
AB  == background: there is little information about the microbiologic profiles of periodontal lesions in papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls) and the significance of bacteria in the pathogenesis of periodontitis in these patients. this comprehensive analysis of the subgingival microbiota in patients with pls used 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) clonal analysis and the 16s rrna-based human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: thirteen patients with pls from seven unrelated families volunteered for this microbiologic study. subgingival plaque was collected with sterile paper points from multiple sites with >/=5 mm probing depth, and whole genomic dna was extracted. the 16s rrna genes were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. the samples were then probed for approximately 300 predominant oral bacterial species using the homim. results: the most commonly detected phylotypes in the clonal analysis were gemella morbillorum, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, lachnospiraceae ot 100 (ei074), parvimonas micra, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. as a group, streptococci were commonly detected in these individuals. in the homim analysis, a total of 170 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected, with a range of 40 to 80 species per patient with pls. of these, 12 bacterial species were detected in medium to high levels in >/=50% of the individuals. the high-frequency strains were clustered into eight groups: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter spp., capnocytophaga granulosa, g. morbillorum, p. micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, streptococcus spp., and tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the subgingival microbiota in pls is diverse.  periodontal pathogens commonly associated with chronic and aggressive periodontitis and opportunistic pathogens may be associated with the development  of severe periodontitis in patients with pls.

TI  == analysis of symptomatic and asymptomatic primary root canal infections in adult norwegian patients.
AB  == introduction: this molecular study analyzed the microbiota of primary root canal  infections from adult norwegian patients. methods: samples were taken from the necrotic root canals of teeth with symptomatic (n = 13) or asymptomatic (n = 21)  apical periodontitis and chronic apical abscesses (n = 9). dna was extracted from samples, and bacterial identifications were performed by a closed-ended reverse-capture checkerboard approach targeting 50 candidate endodontic pathogens. results: bacterial dna was detected in all cases. in teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis, the most frequent taxa were dialister invisus  (71%), fusobacterium nucleatum (62%), and porphyromonas endodontalis (62%). in chronic apical abscesses, the most prevalent taxa were p. endodontalis (100%), d. invisus (89%), parvimonas micra (78%), and solobacterium moorei (78%). in teeth with symptomatic apical periodontitis, the most prevalent taxa were d. invisus, p. endodontalis, s. moorei, propionibacterium acnes, and streptococcus species (all in 69%). none of the targeted taxa were significantly associated with either sinus tract or pain (p > .05), except for selenomonas sputigena, which was more frequently found in painful cases (p = .04). no taxa were found in significantly  higher levels in any conditions (p > .05). cluster analyses revealed bacterial groupings that differed between cases with and without pain. conclusions: although basically the same species were highly prevalent in the different conditions examined and none of the most prevalent taxa were positively associated with symptoms, results revealed that species formed different partnerships and associations in samples from teeth with or without pain. therefore, it is possible that more virulent multispecies communities can form as a result of overall bacterial combinations and give rise to acute inflammation.

TI  == response of subgingival bacteria to smoking cessation.
AB  == it has been demonstrated that smoking cessation alters the subgingival microbial  profile; however, the response of individual bacteria within this ecosystem has not been well studied. the aim of this investigation, therefore, was to longitudinally examine the effect of smoking cessation on the prevalence and levels of selected subgingival bacteria using molecular approaches for bacterial  identification and enumeration. subgingival plaque was collected from 22 smokers  at the baseline and 12 months following periodontal nonsurgical management and smoking cessation counseling. the prevalence and abundance of selected organisms  were examined using nested pcr and multiplexed bead-based flow cytometry. eleven  subjects successfully quit smoking over 12 months (quitters), while 11 continued  to smoke throughout (smokers). smoking cessation led to a decrease in the prevalence of porphyromonas endodontalis and dialister pneumosintes at 12 months  and in the levels of parvimonas micra, filifactor alocis, and treponema denticola. smoking cessation also led to an increase in the levels of veillonella parvula. following nonsurgical periodontal therapy and smoking cessation, the subgingival microbiome is recolonized by a greater number of health-associated species and there are a significantly lower prevalence and abundance of putative  periodontal pathogens. the results indicate a critical role for smoking cessation counseling in periodontal therapy for smokers in order to effectively alter the subgingival microbiome.

TI  == bacteria in the apical root canal of teeth with primary apical periodontitis.
AB  == objective: bacteria settled in the apical root canal are in a privileged position to inflict damage to the periradicular tissues. therefore, the species identified in this region can be of special relevance for the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis. this study investigated the occurrence and levels of several bacterial taxa in the apical root canal of teeth with apical periodontitis. study design: dna extracts from samples taken from the apical part of the root canal of extracted teeth evincing chronic apical periodontitis lesions served as templates for analysis of the presence and levels of 28 bacterial species/phylotypes using  a 16s ribosomal rna gene-based reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay.  results: bacterial dna was detected in 19 out of 20 samples. detected taxa included pseudoramibacter alactolyticus (32%), bacteroidetes clone x083 (26%), streptococcus species (21%), olsenella uli (10.5%), synergistes clone ba121 (10.5%), fusobacterium nucleatum (10.5%), porphyromonas endodontalis (10.5%), dialister clone bs016 (5%), filifactor alocis (5%), parvimonas micra (5%), and treponema denticola (5%). of these, only bacteroidetes clone x083 and synergistes clone ba121 were found at levels above 10(5). conclusion: occurrence of these bacterial taxa in the apical part of infected root canals indicates their potential pathogenetic role in the etiology of apical periodontitis.

TI  == the microbiota of acute apical abscesses.
AB  == as the breadth of bacterial diversity in the oral cavity has been deciphered by molecular studies, several newly identified species/phylotypes have emerged as potential pathogens. we hypothesized that many of these species/phylotypes could  also be involved with the etiology of endodontic abscesses. abscess aspirates from 42 persons were analyzed for the presence of 81 species/phylotypes by means  of a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. associations between the most frequently detected taxa were calculated. the most prevalent taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, and porphyromonas endodontalis. other  frequently found taxa included olsenella uli, streptococci, eikenella corrodens,  some as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes (bacteroidetes clone x083 and synergistes clone ba121), and newly named species (prevotella baroniae and dialister invisus). several positive bacterial associations were disclosed. findings not only strengthen the association of many cultivable species with abscesses, but also include some newly named species and uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with this disease.

TI  == root canal microbiota of teeth with chronic apical periodontitis.
AB  == samples from infected root canals of 43 teeth with chronic apical periodontitis were analyzed for the presence and relative levels of 83 oral bacterial species and/or phylotypes using a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. associations between the most frequently detected taxa were also recorded. the most prevalent taxa were olsenella uli (74%), eikenella corrodens (63%), porphyromonas endodontalis (56%), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (54%), and bacteroidetes oral clone x083 (51%). when prevalence was considered only for bacteria present at levels >10(5), bacteroidetes clone x083 was the most frequently isolated bacterium (37%), followed by parvimonas micra (28%), e. corrodens (23%), and tannerella forsythia (19%). the number of target taxa per canal was directly proportional to the size of the apical periodontitis lesion, with lesions >10 mm in diameter harboring a mean number of approximately 20 taxa. several positive associations for the most prevalent taxa were disclosed for the  first time and may have important ecological and pathogenic implications. in addition to strengthening the association of several cultivable named species with chronic apical periodontitis, the present findings using a large-scale analysis allowed the inclusion of some newly named species and as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with  this disease.
