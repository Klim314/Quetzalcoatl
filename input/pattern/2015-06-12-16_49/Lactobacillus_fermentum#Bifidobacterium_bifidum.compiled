TI  - Lactobacillus strains isolated from infant faeces possess potent inhibitory activity against intestinal alpha- and beta-glucosidases suggesting anti-diabetic potential.
AB  - PURPOSE: Inhibitors of intestinal alpha-glucosidases are used therapeutically to  treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Bacteria such as Actinoplanes sp. naturally produce potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitor compounds, including the most widely available drug acarbose. It is not known whether lactic acid bacteria (LAB) colonising the human gut possess inhibitory potential against glucosidases. Hence, the study was undertaken to screen LABs having inherent alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory potential. METHODS: This study isolated, screened, identified and extracted Lactobacillus strains (Lb1-15) from human infant faecal samples determining their inhibitory activity against intestinal maltase, sucrase, lactase and amylase. Lactobacillus reference strains (Ref1-7), a Gram positive control (Ctrl1) and two Gram negative controls (Ctrl2-3), were also analysed to compare activity. RESULTS: Faecal isolates were identified by DNA sequencing, with the majority identified as unique strains of Lactobacillus plantarum. Some strains (L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. casei and L. rhamnosus) had potent and broad spectrum inhibitory activities (up to 89%; p < 0.001; 500 mg/ml wet weight) comparable to acarbose (up to 88%; p < 0.001; 30 mg/ml). Inhibitory activity was concentration-dependent and was freely available in the supernatant, and was not present in other bacterial genera (Bifidobacterium bifidum and Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium). Interestingly, the potency and spectrum of inhibitory activity across strains of a single species (L. plantarum) differed substantially. Some Lactobacillus extracts had broader spectrum activities than acarbose, effectively inhibiting beta-glucosidase activity (lactase) as well as alpha-glucosidase activities (maltase, sucrase and amylase). Anti-diabetic potential was indicated by the fact that oral gavage with a L. rhamnosus extract (1 g/kg) was able to reduce glucose excursions (Area under curve; 22%; p < 0.05) in rats during a carbohydrate challenge (starch; 2 g/kg). CONCLUSION: These results definitively demonstrate that Lactobacillus strains present in the human gut have alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory activities and can reduce blood glucose responses in vivo. Although the potential use of LAB such as Lactobacillus as a dietary supplement, medicinal food or biotherapeutic for diabetes is uncertain, such an approach might offer advantages over drug therapies in terms of broader spectrum activities and fewer unpleasant side effects. Further characterisation of this bioactivity is warranted, and chronic studies should be undertaken in appropriate animal models or diabetic subjects.
TI  - Polysaccharide from seeds of Plantago asiatica L. affects lipid metabolism and colon microbiota of mouse.
AB  - Polysaccharide from the seeds of Plantago asiatica L. was given via oral administration to mice (0.4 g/kg body weight, 30 days) to observe its effects on mouse nutrient metabolism and colon microbiota. It was found the polysaccharide intake could lower the apparent absorption of lipid. Total triglyceride, cholesterol, and atherogenic index in blood serum with total lipid and cholesterol levels in liver of polysaccharide group mice were all significantly lower than those of the control group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the effect of the polysaccharide intake on mouse colon bacterial communities was investigated. Mice from the polysaccharide group showed a higher colon bacterial diversity than the control group. Bacteroides sp., Eubacterium sp., butyrate-producing bacteria Butyrivibrio sp., and probiotics Bifidobacterium bifidum , Lactobacillus fermentum , and Lactobacillus reuteri in mouse colon were all increased after polysaccharide intake. These indicated that the intake of polysaccharide from P. asiatica L. could be beneficial for lipid metabolism and colon microbiota.
TI  - Role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  - Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. Following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285((R)) and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R((R)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical MRSA isolates, we conducted a literature search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment of S. aureus infection. As summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of S. aureus and clinical isolates of MRSA in vitro. The most active strains were Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Propionibacterium freudenreichii, Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus paracasei, L. acidophilus, L. casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactococcus lactis. Their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. L. acidophilus also inhibited S. aureus biofilm formation and lipase production. In vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. S. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in vitro to L. acidophilus, whilst in vivo Bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. On the other hand, L. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against S. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with S. aureus in mice. Very few clinical data were found on the interactions between probiotics and MRSA, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of MRSA colonisation with probiotic use.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (bLf), but the results are inconsistent. Moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-bLf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield bLf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-bLf. However, whether bLf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. Therefore, various probiotic strains in Taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate in vitro. Thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, Lactobacillus salivarius ATCC 11741, Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103, Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707, and Bifidobacterium lactis BCRC 17394 were inhibited by both apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate. The growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate, including L. rhamnosus ATCC 7469, Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 23272, Lactobacillus fermentum ATCC 11739, Lactobacillus coryniformis ATCC 25602, L. acidophilus BCRC 14065, Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697, Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC 29521, and Pediococcus acidilactici ATCC 8081. However, apo-bLf and its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Moreover, the supernatants produced by L. fermentum, B. lactis, and B. longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. Importantly, a combination of apo-bLf or bLf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. In conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-bLf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.
TI  - Production of xylooligosaccharides from corncob xylan by fungal xylanase and their utilization by probiotics.
AB  - The selective production of xylooligosaccharides (XOS) was carried out using partially purified xylanase from Aspergillus foetidus MTCC 4898. Corncob xylan was extracted using a mild alkali treatment which yielded 178.73+/-5.8 g of xylan/kg of corncobs. Partially purified beta-xylosidase free xylanase was found efficient in releasing xylooligosaccharides from corncob xylan. Maximum yield of xylooligosaccharides was 6.73+/-0.23 mg/ml after 8 h of reaction time using 20 U of xylanase at 45 degrees C. Purification of XOS was done using activated charcoal column chromatography. The purified XOS preparation contained mainly xylobiose and xylotriose. XOS mixture was found suitable for food industry looking at its high thermal stability at low pH. Prebiotic effect of XOS was evaluated by in vitro fermentation of XOS using known probiotic strains viz. Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus. The results of this study revealed better growth of Bifidobacterium spp. on XOS than Lactobacillus spp.
TI  - Effect of grape polyphenols on lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria growth: resistance and metabolism.
AB  - Food polyphenols are able to selectively modify the growth of susceptible micro-organisms. This study describes the effect of a flavan-3-ol enriched grape seed extract (GSE) on the growth of several lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bifidobacteria and the ability of the resistant strains to metabolize these compounds. Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus vaginalis strains showed a remarkable sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, including a GSE fraction consisting mainly in (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin (GSE-M). On the other hand, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus strains reached maximal growth with the GSE fractions, including a rich-oligomeric (GSE-O) fraction. Within bifidobacteria, Bifidobacterium lactis BB12 showed the highest sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, whereas Bifidobacterium breve 26M2 and Bifidobacterium bifidum HDD541 reached maximum growth in presence of GSE-O and GSE-M fractions. Metabolism of flavan-3-ols by LAB and bifidobacteria resistant strains was investigated in vitro. The results revealed that only L. plantarum IFPL935 was able to metabolize the polyphenols studied by means of galloyl-esterase, decarboxylase and benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase activities that led to the formation of gallic acid, pyrogallol and catechol, respectively. An unknown metabolite that does not exhibit a phenolic-acid-type structure was also detected, which suggests a new enzyme activity in L. plantarum IFPL935 able to degrade flavan-3-ol monomers.
TI  - Predominant genera of fecal microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis are not altered by intake of probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bi-07.
AB  - The effect of probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07 on the composition of the Lactobacillus group, Bifidobacterium and the total bacterial population in feces from young children with atopic dermatitis was investigated. The study included 50 children randomized to intake of one of the probiotic strain or placebo. Microbial composition was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, quantitative PCR and, in a subset of subjects, by pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The core population of the Lactobacillus group was identified as Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus oris, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, while the bifidobacterial community included Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium catenulatum. The fecal numbers of L. acidophilus and B. lactis increased significantly after intervention, indicating survival of the ingested bacteria. The levels of Bifidobacterium correlated positively (P=0.03), while the levels of the Lactobacillus group negatively (P=0.01) with improvement of atopic eczema evaluated by the Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis index. This correlation was observed across the whole study cohort and not attributed to the probiotic intake. The main conclusion of the study is that administration of L. acidophilus NCFM and B. lactis Bi-07 does not affect the composition and diversity of the main bacterial populations in feces.
TI  - [Analysis of the probiotic Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus community in child intestinal flora].
AB  - To investigate the distribution of child intestinal flora and the composition of  its key probiotics community, study on intestinal flora of 21 Chinese children (age 2 - 5) was conducted, which included bacteria isolation and counting, 16S rDNA sequencing and homology analysis. For identification of the key probiotics such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in children feces at the species level, the specific primers Im26/Im3 and L159/L677 for PCR amplification of partial 16S rDNA were used. The results show that the composition of child intestinal flora is was relatively stable and almost same to the intestinal flora of the youth (age 20 - 25). Culture-based approaches show that the key probiotic community in feces at the species level was highly different in composition and numbers from individual to individual. B. longum and B. pseudocatenulatum, which are detected at levels of 10(7) CFU/g (wet) in samples and the detection rates are 90.48% and 85.71% respectively, are believed to be major bifidobacterial species in child intestinal microbiota. In addition, B. adolescentis, B. bifidum, B. infantis and B. thermacidophium have also been found. L. mucosae, L. fermentum, L. salivarius, L. ruminis, L. gasseri and L. plantarum are isolated from the stools. L. mucosae (3.68 log10 CFU/g (wet), detection rate 71.43%) and L. fermentum (3.97 log10 CFU/g (wet), detection rate 52.38%) are two dominant species of Lactobacillus. Study on Chinese child intestinal flora, especially on the compositions and numbers of key probiotics in the feces will be very helpful to the development of effective probiotics in future.
TI  - Relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in indigenous and exogenous bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate whether there is a relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and enterococci. METHODS AND RESULTS: Hydrophobicity, cell wall protein profiles and sites of interaction in the gut (by using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled bacteria) were determined for Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. animalis and Enterococcus faecalis. We also determined the number of immunoglobulin (Ig)A+, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha+, interleukin (IL)-6+ and IL-10+ cells after oral administration of the above bacteria to BALB/c mice. All strains assessed were found to interact with the sites of induction of the immune response in the gut. No correlation with hydrophobicity was observed. When some strains at certain doses were administered to mice, bacterial translocation to liver was observed. The oral administration of indigenous (104 cells day(-1)) and exogenous (107 cells day(-1)) bifidobacteria and lactobacilli for 5 consecutive days activated the systemic and intestinal mucosal immune response in a strain-specific way, independently whether the strain was indigenous or exogenous in relation to the host. The differences in the immunopotentiating capacity of the various strains might be related to the differences in their cell wall protein profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Indigenous bacteria activated the mucosal immune response at a dose significantly smaller than the one required for probiotic exogenous bacteria. However, probiotic exogenous bacteria can be used at high concentrations in fermented dairy products with a great impact on the immune system, favouring its immunomodulation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The immunomodulation capacity of probiotic bacteria is strain specific and independent of the specificity of the host. The ability of certain strains to down-regulate the production and release of IL-6 by IL-10 may have potential implications in their use in cases in which cytokine deregulation or excessive production at the mucosal level can be the cause of tissue damage.
TI  - Development and application of an in vitro methodology to determine the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species in the upper human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - An in vitro methodology which mimics in vivo human upper gastrointestinal transit was developed. The transit tolerance of potentially probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species was determined by exposing washed cell suspensions at 37 degrees C to a simulated gastric juice (pH 2.0), containing pepsin (0.3% w/v) and sodium chloride (0.5% w/v), and a simulated small intestinal juice (pH 8.0), containing pancreatin USP (1 g l-1) and sodium chloride (5 g l-1), and monitoring changes in total viable count periodically. The methodology was also employed to determine the effect of adding milk proteins (1 g l-1), hog gastric mucin (1 g l-1) and soyabean trypsinchymotrypsin inhibitor [SBTCI] (1 g l-1) on transit tolerance. The majority (14 of 15) of isolates lost > 90% viability during simulated gastric transit. Only one isolate, Lactobacillus fermentum KLD, was considered intrinsically resistant. The addition of milk proteins, singly and in combination, generally improved gastric transit tolerance. In this regard, two isolates, Lact. casei 212.3 and Bifidobacterium infantis 25962, exhibited 100% gastric transit tolerance in the presence of milk proteins. In general, the addition of hog gastric mucin did not influence simulated gastric transit tolerance of lactobacilli but tended to increase that of bifidobacteria. However, it increased that of Lact. casei 242 and Lact. salivarius 43338 but diminished that of B. bifidum 2715 and B. animalis Bo. Selected bile salts-resistant isolates were intrinsically tolerant to simulated small intestinal transit. Only Lact. casei F19 and B. adolescentis 15703T showed significant reduction in viability after 240 min. In general, the addition of milk proteins and SBTCI did not affect simulated small intestinal transit tolerance. However, they significantly improved the intrinsic resistance of Lact. casei F19 but diminished that of B. breve 15700T. It is concluded that, whereas the majority of bile salts-resistant lactobacilli and bifidobacteria may be intrinsically sensitive to gastric transit, they are intrinsically resistant to small intestinal transit. In addition, it is postulated that milk proteins and mucin may function as both buffering agents and inhibitors of digestive protease activity in vivo, thereby protecting ingested bacterial strains during upper gastrointestinal transit.
TI  - Digoxigenin-labeled deoxyribonucleic acid probes for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in fecal samples.
AB  - The numbers of bifidobacteria in fecal samples were specifically determined by colony hybridization with the mixture of digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes that were prepared from whole chromosomal DNA of Bifidobacterium longum 6001 and Bifidobacterium adolescentis 6003. These DNA probes strongly hybridized with DNA of B. longum, B. adolescentis, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium suis, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium angulatum, and Bifidobacterium animalis. Detectable positive signals with DNA of Bifidobacterium pseudolongum ssp. pseudolongum, Bifidobacterium catenulatum, and Bifidobacterium thermophilum were also found after hybridization. When dot-blot hybridization was performed with whole cells of 47 reference strains containing 11 species (16 strains) of bifidobacteria, all of the bifidobacteria tested could be specifically detected by using these DNA probes; Lactobacillus fermentum JCM 1173, however, showed a slight nonspecific signal. The counts of bifidobacteria by colony hybridization in the fecal samples of four of the five subjects were the same as the counts that were obtained by the conventional method using BL agar medium. Furthermore, no significant difference existed in the number of bifidobacteria that were determined by either method.
TI  - [The stimulating action of exogenous RNase on eubiotic strains of Lactobacillus,  Bifidobacterium and Escherichia coli].
AB  - The influence of Bacillus intermedius RNAase on the multiplication on B.B.bifidum, L.fermentum and E. coli was studied. The study revealed that the stimulating action depended on the dose of the enzyme, the microbial species and the growth phase of the inoculate. RNAase, added to the nutrient medium, was shown to induce the acceleration of the synthesis of DNA, RNA, protein, as well as mitosis. At the same time the stimulating action of RNAase was accompanied not only by the reduction of the duration of the lag phase, but in some cases even by an increase in the specific growth rate.
TI  - Influence of two infant formulas and human milk on the development of the faecal  flora in newborn infants.
AB  - The establishment of the faecal flora of 39 full-term infants fed exclusively on  breast milk (n = 20) or with two different modern adapted cow's milk formulas (n = 19) was studied during the first 3 months of life. One formula investigated was based on 100% bovine casein as the protein source whereas the other formula contained bovine milk proteins with a whey/casein ratio of 60:40. A faecal flora rich in bifidobacteria was found in all study groups; the growth of putrefactive bacteria (especially Bacteroides spp.), however, was limited. In formula-fed infants, significantly higher bacterial counts of enterococci and clostridia were detected compared to breast milk-fed infants. Similarities and differences due to the feeding regimen were particularly reflected in the pattern of the anaerobic bacterial species. Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. infantis and B. breve constituted the majority of the bifidobacterial flora independent of the type of milk feeding. Other bifidobacterial species such as B. longum, B. adolescentis, B. parabifidum and B. pseudo-catenulatum were detected in high numbers and at low frequencies in breastfed infants. The latter three were observed in infants fed the whey/casein formula as well. It seems that infants fed a casein formula develop a faecal flora more like that of breastfed infants concerning Lactobacillus spp. (especially L. fermentum and L. brevis).
TI  - Purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An inhibition factor from Streptococcus mutans strain C3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. Bacteriocin C3603 is a basic protein with a pI value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. The activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by pH over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees C for 10 min at pH 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees C for 15 min at pH 4.0. Pronase; papain, phospholipase C, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. Bacteriocin activity was greater against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. Bacteriocin C3603 was also effective against selected strains of S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, S. faecium, S. lactis, Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Corynebacterium parvum, and Candida albicans. The inhibition of S. mutans strains BHT and PS-14 by bacteriocin C3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. When water or a diet containing bacteriocin C3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. mutans PS-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
TI  - Urease-producing species of intestinal anaerobes and their activities.
AB  - Urease activities of anaerobic bacteria that constituted predominant gut flora were examined. It was demonstrated that some strains of Eubacterium aerofaciens, E. lentum, and Peptostreptococcus products produced urease. They were the most numerous species in human feces. All strains of Bifidobacterium infantis and some strains of Bacteroides multiacidus, B. bifidum, Clostridium symbiosum, Fusobacterium necrophorum, F. varium, Lactobacillus fermentum, Peptococcus asaccharolyticus, and P. prevotii produced urease. The optimum pH of the Lactobacillus urease was found to be 4.0, whereas the pH value of B. multiacidus urease was 8.0.
