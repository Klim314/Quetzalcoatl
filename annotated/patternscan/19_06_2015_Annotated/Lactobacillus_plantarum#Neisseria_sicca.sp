TI  == innate immune responses of human neonatal cells to bacteria from the normal gastrointestinal flora.
AB  == the hygiene hypothesis postulates that the prevalence of allergy has increased due to decreased microbial stimulation early in life, leading to delayed maturation of the immune system. the aim of this study was to examine the cytokine pattern produced from cord blood mononuclear cells relative to adult cells after stimulation with bacterial strains from the normal flora. mononuclear cells from cord and adult blood samples were stimulated with the following bacteria: bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus mitis, corynebacterium minutissimum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, veillonella parvula, and neisseria sicca. the levels of interleukin 12 (il-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-10, and il-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the tnf-alpha production was also analyzed after blocking cd14, toll-like receptor 2 (tlr-2), and tlr-4 prior to stimulation with bacteria. the levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha were similar in cord and adult cells. gram-positive bacteria induced considerably higher levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha than gram-negative bacteria in both cord and adult cells. the levels of il-6 were significantly higher in newborns than in adults, whereas the levels of  il-10 were similar in newborns and adults. gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria induced similar levels of il-6 and il-10 in cord cells. l. plantarum bound or signaled through cd14, tlr-2, and tlr-4, whereas e. coli acted mainly through cd14 and tlr-4. these results indicate that the innate immune response in newborns to commensal bacteria is strong and also suggest that different bacterial strains may have differential effects on the maturation of the immune system of infants.

TI  == selective sensitization of bacteria to peroxide damage associated with fluoride inhibition of catalase and pseudocatalase.
AB  == fluoride and sulfide are known inhibitors of heme catalases in acid environments. staphylococcus aureus h cells were found to be sensitized by fluoride or sulfide  to h2o2 killing at acid ph values in the range of 3.5 to 4.0, and catalase activity was reduced concomitantly. in contrast, fluoride had little effect on h2o2 killing of streptococcus mutans gs-5, which has fluoride-insensitive peroxidase activity, but still is more sensitive to h2o2 than is s. aureus in the absence of fluoride. fluoride but not sulfide was inhibitory also for the mn-containing, non-heme pseudocatalase of lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14431 over a wide ph range, and this inhibitory effect was reflected in enhanced h2o2 killing in the presence of fluoride. in addition, we found that catalase-positive s. aureus or neisseria sicca could protect catalase-negative s. mutans against killing by h2o2 in mixed suspensions, but protection was compromised by fluoride  or sulfide under acid conditions. thus, catalase-positive organisms could protect a catalase-negative organism against peroxide damage, but inhibition of catalase  reduced protection. these findings are pertinent to the widespread use of fluoride and peroxide in oral health care products.
