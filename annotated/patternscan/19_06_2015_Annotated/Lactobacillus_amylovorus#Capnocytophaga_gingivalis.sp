TI  == caries-related plaque microcosm biofilms developed in microplates.
AB  == in vivo dental plaque biofilms consist of complex communities of oral bacteria that are a challenge to replicate in vitro. the aim of this investigation was to  establish human dental plaque microcosms in microplates to reflect conditions that are relevant to dental caries. microcosm plaque biofilms were initiated from the saliva of two different donors, grown for up to 10 days in 24-welled microplates on thermanox coverslips in various types of artificial saliva with and without sucrose, which were replaced daily. microbiota composition of 40 species associated with oral health and dental caries was monitored in the plaques using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization analysis. ph was measured as an  indicator of cariogenic potential. the composition of the saliva inocula was different, and yielded plaque microcosms with different composition and growth responses to sucrose. artificial saliva type and presence of sucrose, and the resulting growth and ph conditions, modified the growth of individual species and hence the ecological profile of the microplate plaques during development. complex population shifts were observed during development, and older plaques comprised predominantly facultative anaerobic species. sucrose supplementation limited the decline of streptococci over time but did not increase the abundance  of mutans streptococci. sucrose at 0.15% increased levels of caries-associated species including lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces gerensceriae; these were further increased with sucrose at 0.5%, in addition to actinomyces israelii, rothia dentocariosa and capnocytophaga gingivalis. the microplate plaques demonstrated complex community dynamics that appeared to reflect the maturation of natural plaques, and sucrose induced a cariogenic plaque composition and ph.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrate and nitrite on six common oral pathogens in vitro.
AB  == background: salivary nitrate is positively correlated with plasma nitrate and its level is 9 times the plasma level after nitrate loading. nitrate in saliva is known to be reduced to nitrite by oral bacteria. nitrate and nitrite levels in saliva are 3 - 5 times those in serum in physiological conditions respectively in our previous study. the biological functions of high salivary nitrate and nitrite are still not well understood. the aim of this in vitro study was to investigate  the antimicrobial effects of nitrate and nitrite on main oral pathogens under acidic conditions. methods: six common oral pathogens including streptococcus mutans nctc 10449, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4646, porphyromonas gingivalis  atcc 33277, capnocytophaga gingivalis atcc 33624, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953, and candida albicans atcc 10231 were cultured in liquid medium. sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite was added to the medium to final concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 10 mmol/l. all of the microorganisms were incubated for 24 to 48 hours. the optical densities (od) of cell suspensions were determined and the cultures were transferred to solid nutrient broth medium to observe the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration for the six tested pathogens. results: nitrite at concentrations of 0.5 to 10 mmol/l  had an inhibitory effect on all tested organisms at low ph values. the antimicrobial effect of nitrite increased with the acidity of the medium. streptococcus mutans nctc 10449 was highly sensitive to nitrite at low ph values. lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4646 and candida albicans atcc 10231 were relatively resistant to acidified nitrite. nitrate at the given concentrations and under acidic conditions had no inhibitory effect on the growth of any of the  tested pathogens. conclusion: nitrite, at a concentration equal to that in human  saliva, is both cytocidal and cytostatic to six principal oral pathogens in vitro, whereas nitrate at a similar concentration has no antimicrobial effect on  these organisms.
