TI  == construction of a shuttle vector based on the small cryptic plasmid pjy33 from weissella cibaria 33.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid, pjy33, from weissella cibaria 33 was characterized. pjy33 was  2365 bp in size with a gc content of 41.27% and contained two putative open reading frames (orfs). orf1 encoded a putative hypothetical protein of 134 amino  acids. orf2 was 849 bp in size, and its putative translation product exhibited 87% identity with a replication initiation factor from a plasmid from w. cibaria  klc140. a weissella-escherichia coli shuttle vector, pjy33e (6.5 kb, em(r)), was  constructed by ligation of pjy33 with pbluescript ii sk(-) and an erythromycin resistance gene (em(r)). pjy33e replicated in lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus plantarum, and weissella confusa. a  single-stranded dna intermediate was detected from lb. brevis 2.14 harbouring pjy33e, providing evidence for rolling-circle replication of pjy33. most lb. brevis 2.14 cells (85.9%) retained pjy33e after one week of daily culturing in mrs broth without em. an aga gene encoding alpha-galactosidase (alpha-gal) from leuconostoc mesenteroides was successfully expressed in lb. brevis 2.14 using pjy33e, and the highest level of alpha-gal activity (36.13 u/mg protein) was observed when cells were grown on melibiose.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo evaluation of lactic acid bacteria of aquatic origin as probiotics for turbot (scophthalmus maximus l.) farming.
AB  == turbot (scophthalmus maximus l.) is an important commercial marine flatfish. its  production may be affected by bacterial diseases that cause severe economical losses, mainly tenacibaculosis and vibriosis, provoked by tenacibaculum maritimum and vibrio splendidus, respectively. an alternative or complementary strategy to  chemotherapy and vaccination for the control of these diseases is the use of probiotics. in this work, we report the in vitro and in vivo potential of eight lactic acid bacteria (lab), previously isolated from fish, seafood and fish products intended for human consumption, as turbot probiotics. seven out of the eight lab exerted direct antimicrobial activity against, at least, four strains of t. maritimum and v. splendidus. all lab survived in seawater at 18 degrees c for 7 days, and withstood exposure to ph 3.0 and 10% (v/v) turbot bile; however,  they differed in cell surface hydrophobicity (8.2-21.7%) and in their ability to  adhere to turbot skin (1.2-21.7%) and intestinal (0.7-2.1%) mucus. most of the tested strains inhibited the binding of turbot pathogens to the mucus. leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris smm69 and weissella cibaria p71 were selected based on their strong antimicrobial activity against t. maritimum and v. splendidus, good probiotic properties, and different adhesion ability to skin mucus and capacity to inhibit the adhesion of turbot pathogens to mucus. these two lab strains were harmless when administered by bath to turbot larvae and juveniles; moreover, real-time pcr on the transcription levels of the immunity-related genes encoding il-1beta, tnf-alpha, lysozyme, c3, mhc-ialpha and mhc-iialpha in five organs (head-kidney, spleen, liver, intestine and skin) revealed the ability of these lab to stimulate their expression in turbot juveniles, especially the non-specific immunity associated genes in mucosal tissues. based on our results, lc. cremoris smm69 and w. cibaria p71 may be considered as suitable probiotic candidates for turbot farming.

TI  == bacteriophages of leuconostoc, oenococcus, and weissella.
AB  == leuconostoc (ln.), weissella, and oenococcus form a group of related genera of lactic acid bacteria, which once all shared the name leuconostoc. they are associated with plants, fermented vegetable products, raw milk, dairy products, meat, and fish. most of industrially relevant leuconostoc strains can be classified as either ln. mesenteroides or ln. pseudomesenteroides. they are important flavor producers in dairy fermentations and they initiate nearly all vegetable fermentations. therefore, bacteriophages attacking leuconostoc strains  may negatively influence the production process. bacteriophages attacking leuconostoc strains were first reported in 1946. since then, the majority of described leuconostoc phages was isolated from either dairy products or fermented vegetable products. both lytic and temperate phages of leuconostoc were reported. most of leuconostoc phages examined using electron microscopy belong to the siphoviridae family and differ in morphological details. hybridization and comparative genomic studies of leuconostoc phages suggest that they can be divided into several groups, however overall diversity of leuconostoc phages is much lower as compared to, e.g., lactococcal phages. several fully sequenced genomes of leuconostoc phages have been deposited in public databases. lytic phages of leuconostoc can be divided into two host species-specific groups with similarly organized genomes that shared very low nucleotide similarity. phages of dairy leuconostoc have rather limited host-ranges. the receptor binding proteins  of two lytic ln. pseudomesenteroides phages have been identified. molecular tools for detection of dairy leuconostoc phages have been developed. the rather limited data on phages of oenococcus and weissella show that (i) lysogeny seems to be abundant in oenococcus strains, and (ii) several phages infecting weissella cibaria are also able to productively infect strains of other weissella species and even strains of the genus lactobacillus.

TI  == use of sourdough fermentation and mixture of wheat, chickpea, lentil and bean flours for enhancing the nutritional, texture and sensory characteristics of white bread.
AB  == this study aimed at investigating the addition of legume (chickpea, lentil and bean) flours to wheat flour bread. type i sourdough containing legumes or wheat-legume flours were prepared and propagated (back slopped) in laboratory, according to traditional protocols that are routinely used for making typical italian breads. based on kinetic of acidification and culture-dependent data, the wheat-legume sourdough was further characterized and selected for bread making. as determined by rapd-pcr and partial sequencing of 16s rdna gene analyses, lactic acid bacteria in wheat-legume sourdough included lactobacillus plantarum,  lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus fermentum, weissella cibaria, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus coryneformis, lactobacillus rossiae, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus paraplantarum. two breads containing 15% (w/w) of legume (chickpea, lentil and bean) flours were produced using selected wheat-legume sourdough (wlsb) and traditional wheat sourdough (wsb). compared to wheat yeasted bread (wyb), the level of total free amino acids (faa) was higher in wsb and wlsb. phytase and antioxidant activities were the highest in wlsb. compared to bread wyb, the addition of legume flours decreased the in vitro protein digestibility (ivpd) (wyb versus wsb). however, the dough fermentation with wslb favored an increase of ivpd. according to the levels of carbohydrates, dietary fibers and resistant starch, wsb and wlsb showed lower values of hydrolysis index (hi) compared to wyb. as showed by texture and image analyses and sensory evaluation of breads, a good acceptability was found for wsb and, especially, wlsb breads.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == probiotic table olives: microbial populations adhering on olive surface in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in an industrial plant.
AB  == this study reports the dynamics of microbial populations adhering on the surface  of debittered green olives cv. bella di cerignola in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in different brining conditions (4% and 8% (w/v) nacl) at room temperature and 4 degrees c. the probiotic strain successfully colonized the olive surface dominating the natural  lab population and decreasing the ph of brines to <or=5.0 after 30 days until the end of fermentation. the dynamics of microbial populations associated with olive  surface and belonging to the different groups indicated that inoculated olives held at room temperature did not host enterobacteriaceae at the end of fermentation. yeast populations were present in a low number (<or=log(10) 5.7 cfu/g) throughout the process. a considerable genetic diversity of lab species colonizing the olive surface was found mainly in inoculated set brined in 8% nacl, as indicated by the shannon diversity index calculated for each set. generally, strains of lactobacillus coryniformis, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l.  pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. brevis, l. mali, l. vaccinostercus, l.casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, weissella paramesenteroides, w. cibaria, enterococcus casseliflavus group and e.  italicus were identified during the whole process. in particular, l. pentosus was the most frequently isolated species and it showed a high strain diversity throughout fermentation in all processes except for the one held at 4 degrees c.  also a notable incidence of leuc. mesenteroides on olives was highlighted in this study during all fermentation. results indicated that the human strain l. paracasei impc2.1 can be considered an example of a strain used in the dual role  of starter and probiotic culture which allowed the control of fermentation processes and the realization of a final probiotic product with functional appeal.

TI  == development of a pcr assay for the strain-specific identification of probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1.
AB  == recent investigations clearly indicate that the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 can be incorporated into vegetables to obtain innovative probiotic foods whose marketing has been authorized by the italian ministry of health. in this study, strain impc2.1 was characterized at a molecular level in order to define its taxonomic position and to develop a pcr test for strain-specific identification. molecular methods, such as 16s rrna gene sequencing and multiplex pcr, have provided evidence that strain impc2.1 indeed belongs to the l. paracasei species. in addition, a cluster analysis of fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (f-aflp) data strongly indicated that strain impc2.1 and nine other l. paracasei strains (including strain atcc 334) belong to the same species and are definitely differentiated from the type strain l. casei atcc 393. the f-aflp technique was also used to identify a strain-specific dna fragment of l. paracasei impc2.1 - encoding an amino acid sequence similar to a glycosyltransferase of probiotic strain lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 - which enabled us to develop a rapid pcr test for  strain-specific identification. the strain-specificity of the pcr test was assessed by comparison with a total of 73 bacterial strains mainly isolated from  vegetable products that did not produce any amplified fragment. these strains belonged to the l. paracasei species, to 6 additional species of lactobacillus and to weissella cibaria, w. confusa, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides and pediococcus pentosaceus. a method similar to the one used in this study can be adopted to develop easy, rapid detection techniques for monitoring other bacteria in complex microbiota.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria in suan-tsai and fu-tsai, traditional fermented mustard products of taiwan.
AB  == fu-tsai and suan-tsai are spontaneously fermented mustard products traditionally  prepared by the hakka tribe of taiwan. we chose 5 different processing stages of  these products for analysis of the microbial community of lactic acid bacteria (lab) by 16s rrna gene sequencing. from 500 lab isolates we identified 119 representative strains belonging to 5 genera and 18 species, including enterococcus (1 species), lactobacillus (11 species), leuconostoc (3 species), pediococcus (1 species), and weissella (2 species). the lab composition of mustard fermented for 3 days, known as the mu sample, was the most diverse, with  11 different lab species being isolated. we used sequence analysis of the 16s rrna gene to identify the lab strains and analysis of the dnaa, phes, and rpoa genes to identify 13 lab strains for which identification by 16s rrna gene sequences was not possible. these 13 strains were found to belong to 5 validated  known species: lactobacillus farciminis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, weissella cibaria, and weissella paramesenteroides, and 5 possibly novel lactobacillus species. these results revealed that there is a high level of diversity in lab at the different stages of fermentation in the production of suan-tsai and fu-tsai.

TI  == biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in french wheat sourdough as determined by molecular characterization using species-specific pcr.
AB  == the lactic acid microflora of nine traditional wheat sourdoughs from the midi-pyrenees area (south western france) was previously isolated and preliminary characterized using conventional morphological and biochemical analysis. however, such phenotypic methods alone are not always reliable and have a low taxonomic resolution for identification of lactic acid bacteria species. in the present study, a total of 290 lab isolates were identified by pcr amplification using different sets of specific primers in order to provide a thorough characterization of the lactic flora from these traditional french sourdoughs. overall, the lab isolates belonged to 6 genera: lactobacillus (39%, 8 species), pediococcus (38%, 1 species), leuconostoc (17%, 2 species), weissella (4%, 2 species), lactococcus (1%, 1 species) and enterococcus (<1%, 1 species) and 15 different species were detected: l. plantarum, l. curvatus, l. paracasei, l. sanfranciscensis, l. pentosus, l. paraplantarum, l. sakei, l. brevis, p. pentosaceus, l. mesenteroides, l. citreum, w. cibaria, w. confusa, l. lactis and  e. hirae. facultative heterofermentative lab represent more than 76% of the total isolates, the main species isolated herein correspond to l. plantarum and p. pentosaceus. obligate heterofermentative lactobacilli (l. sanfranciscencis, l. brevis) represent less than 3% of the total isolates whereas leuconostoc and weissella species represent 21% of the total isolates and have been detected in eight of the nine samples. detection of some lab species was preferentially observed depending on the isolation culture medium. the number of different species within a sourdough varies from 3 to 7 and original associations of hetero- and homofermentative lab species have been revealed. results from this study clearly confirm the diversity encountered in the microbial community of traditional sourdough and highlight the importance of lab cocci in the sourdough  ecosystem, along with lactobacilli.

TI  == antifungal activity of strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a semolina ecosystem against penicillium roqueforti, aspergillus niger and endomyces fibuliger contaminating bakery products.
AB  == thirty samples of italian durum wheat semolina and whole durum wheat semolina, generally used for the production of southern italy's traditional breads, were subjected to microbiological analysis in order to explore their lactic acid bacteria (lab) diversity and to find strains with antifungal activity. a total of 125 presumptive lab isolates (gram-positive and catalase-negative) were characterized by repetitive extragenic palindromic-pcr (rep-pcr) and sequence analysis of the 16s rrna gene, leading to the identification of the following species: weissella confusa, weissella cibaria, leuconostoc citreum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus rossiae and lactobacillus plantarum. the rep-pcr results delineated 17 different patterns whose cluster analysis clearly differentiated w. cibaria from w. confusa isolates. seventeen strains, each characterized by a different rep-pcr pattern, were screened for their antifungal properties. they were grown in a flour-based medium, comparable  to a real food system, and the resulting fermentation products (fps) were tested  against fungal species generally contaminating bakery products, aspergillus niger, penicillium roqueforti and endomyces fibuliger. the results of the study indicated a strong inhibitory activity - comparable to that obtained with the common preservative calcium propionate (0.3% w/v) - of ten lab strains against the most widespread contaminant of bakery products, p. roqueforti. the screening  also highlighted the unexplored antifungal activity of l. citreum, l. rossiae and w. cibaria (1 strain), which inhibited all fungal strains to the same or a higher extent compared with calcium propionate. the fermentation products of these three strains were characterized by low ph values, and a high content of lactic and acetic acids.

TI  == phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from "alheira", a traditional fermented sausage produced in portugal.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from "alheira", a fermented sausage produced  in portugal. lab were identified to genus and species level by phenotypic characteristics, using genus or species-specific primers and sequencing of the gene encoding 16s rrna. two-hundred and eighty-three isolates were grouped into 14 species. lactobacillus plantarum was isolated from all sausages and enterococcusfaecalis from most of the samples. low numbers of lactobacillus paraplantarum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus zeae, lactobacillus paracasei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, pediococcus pentosaceus, pediococcus acidilactici, weissella cibaria, weissella viridescens and enterococcus faecium were recorded. the genetic heterogeneity of  l. plantarum and e. faecalis strains were determined by numerical analysis of dna banding patterns obtained by rapd-pcr. strains of l. plantarum and e. faecalis were different from different producers. this study forms the basis from which starter cultures could be selected for production of "alheira".

TI  == characterization of italian cheeses ripened under nonconventional conditions.
AB  == four italian cheeses (casciotta di urbino, barricato san martino, vento d'estate, and ubriaco di raboso) nonconventionally ripened under different plant materials  (walnut leaves, herbs, hay, and wine by-products, respectively) were compared for compositional, microbiological, biochemical, and volatile profile characteristics. mean values for gross composition were rather similar. because primary starters were not used for manufacture, the endogenous lactic acid bacteria were mainly present (7.0 to 9.0 log10 cfu/g). except for lactobacillus paracasei and leuconostoc mesenteroides, which were commonly identified in 3 cheeses, lactococcus lactis, enterococcus sanguinicola, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus durans/enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum, and weissella  cibaria/weissella confusa were variously found in the 4 cheeses. random amplification of polymorphic dna-pcr analysis showed the biodiversity among the strains, and the species of lactobacilli were in part grouped according to their  origin. as shown by the principal component analysis of reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography data for the ph 4.6-soluble fractions and by the determination of free aa, the secondary proteolysis of barricato san martino and  vento d'estate mainly differed from the other 2 cheeses. purge-and-trap and solid-phase microextraction were coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine volatile compounds. vento d'estate showed the highest levels of almost all chemical classes, and casciotta di urbino was characterized  by a very low level of volatile components. esters, ketones, and terpenes were the chemical classes that mainly differentiated the cheeses. several volatile compounds seemed to be released directly from the plant materials used for ripening, especially terpenes for vento d'estate cheese. the lowest level of volatile free fatty acids was found in casciotta d'urbino, in which rennet paste  was not used during manufacture. the highest concentration of free fatty acids, especially butyric and caproic acids, was found in vento d'estate cheese.

TI  == characterisation and biochemical properties of predominant lactic acid bacteria from fermenting cassava for selection as starter cultures.
AB  == a total of 375 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from fermenting cassava in south africa, benin, kenya and germany, and were characterised by phenotypic and  genotypic tests. these could be divided into five main groups comprising strains  of facultatively heterofermentative rods, obligately heterofermentative rods, heterofermentative cocci, homofermentative cocci and obligately homofermentative  rods, in decreasing order of predominance. most of the facultatively heterofermentative rods were identified by phenotypic tests as presumptive lactobacillus plantarum-group strains, which also comprised the most predominant  bacteria (54.4% of strains) isolated in the study. the next predominant group of  lactic acid bacteria (14.1% of total isolates) consisted of obligately heterofermentative rods belonging either to the genus lactobacillus or weissella, followed by the heterofermentative cocci (13.9% of isolates) belonging to the genera weissella or leuconostoc. homofermentative cocci were also isolated (13.3% of isolates). biochemical properties such as production of alpha-amylase, beta-glucosidase, tannase, antimicrobials (presumptive bacteriocin and h(2)o(2)-production), acidification and fermentation of the indigestible sugars raffinose and stachyose, were evaluated in vitro for selection of potential starter strains. a total of 32 strains with one or more desirable biochemical properties were pre-selected and identified using rep-pcr fingerprinting in combination with 16s rrna sequencing of representative rep-pcr cluster isolates.  of these strains, 18 were identified as l. plantarum, four as lactobacillus pentosus, two each as leuconostoc fallax, weissella paramesenteroides and lactobacillus fermentum, one each as leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and weissella cibaria, while two remained unidentified but could be assigned to the l. plantarum-group. these strains were further investigated for clonal relationships, using rapd-pcr with three primers, and of the 32 a total of 16 strains were finally selected for the development as starter cultures for gari production.

TI  == enzymatic activities of lactic acid bacteria isolated from cornetto di matera sourdoughs.
AB  == forty-one strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from cornetto di matera  sourdoughs were screened for their enzymatic activities, to elucidate their possible roles during the fermentation process. urease, peptidase, phytase, phosphatase and beta-glucosidase activities were measured spectrophotometrically  using synthetic substrates. proteolytic activities were examined in model doughs, using neutral and acidified sterile doughs as controls. all strains had low urease, glutamyl aminopeptidase and iminopeptidase activities, whereas differences within species were observed for the other enzymatic activities. leuconostoc mesenteroides and lactobacillus curvatus strains generally showed high aminopeptidase, x-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase, beta-glucosidase and phytase activities, while the enzymatic activities of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus and weissella cibaria varied between strains. in order to  classify the strains on the basis of similar enzymatic profiles, a hierarchical cluster analysis was carried out. several strains of l. plantarum, l. curvatus and leuc. mesenteroides showed an interesting combination of proteolytic, peptidase, beta-glucosidase and phytase activities, suggesting their possible usefulness as a mixed starter culture in bread-making processes.

TI  == monitoring the lactic acid bacterial diversity during shochu fermentation by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab) during shochu fermentation was monitored by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and by bacteriological culturing. no lab were detected from fermented mashes by pcr-dgge using a universal bacterial pcr primer set. however, pcr-dgge using a new primer  specific for the 16s rdna of lactococcus, streptococcus, tetragenococcus, enterococcus, and vagococcus and two primers specific for the 16s rdna of lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella revealed that enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus nagelii, lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and weissella cibaria inhabited in shochu mashes. it was also found that the lab community composition during shochu fermentation changed after the main ingredient and water were added during the fermentation process. therefore, we confirmed that pcr-dgge using all three primers specific for groups of lab together was well suited to the study of the lab diversity in shochu mashes. the results of dgge profiles were similar to the results of bacteriological culturing. in conclusion, lab are present during shochu fermentation but not dominant.

AB  == a total of 176 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from a typical spanish blood sausage called "morcilla de burgos" were identified by means of phenotypic characteristics and 16s rdna rflp (ribotyping). lab were isolated from "morcilla" of different producers and in different storage periods, which includes unpackaged, vacuum and modified atmosphere packaged "morcilla" and vacuum packed  and pasteurised "morcilla". the knowledge of specific spoilage bacteria of "morcilla de burgos" will be useful to design new preservation methods to extend  the shelf-life of this product. identification made according to phenotypic and biochemical characteristics shows the majority of the isolates were heterofermentative lab (93.2%) and eight different bacterial groups could be distinguished (a-g). weisella viridescens was the main species detected (42%). in addition, leuconostoc spp. (23.9%), weissella confusa (11.4%) and lactobacillus fructosus (5.7%) species were found. few strains were phenotypically misidentified as lactobacillus sanfrancisco, pediococcus spp., lactobacillus sakei/curvatus and carnobacterium spp. and 11 strains remained unknown. most of the leuconostocs were identified as leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc carnosum species. ribotyping shows a quite good correlation with phenotypic methods, although it has been possible to identify 15 different clusters. w. viridescens and leuconostocs were also the predominant lab. strains identified as w. confusa by phenotypic characteristics were resolved in w. confusa and weissella cibaria by ribotyping. neither carnobacterium piscicola nor lb. sanfrancisco were identified by means of genotypic method. all lb. fructosus strains and some more included in different phenotypic groups (17 strains in total) could not be associated with any reference strain (cluster vii).
