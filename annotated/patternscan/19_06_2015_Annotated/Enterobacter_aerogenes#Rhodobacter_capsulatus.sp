TI  == transport of nickel and cobalt ions into bacterial cells by s components of ecf transporters.
AB  == energy-coupling factor (ecf) transporters form a distinct group of abc-type micronutrient importers in prokaryotes that do not contain extracytoplasmic, soluble substrate-binding proteins. instead, they consist of a transmembrane substrate-specific s component that interacts with a module composed of a moderately conserved transmembrane (t) component and abc atpases. the majority of s components is considered to act as high-affinity binding proteins that strictly depend on their cognate t and atpase units for transport activity. for a fraction of biotin-specific s units, however, transport activity was demonstrated in their solitary state. here, we compared the activities of nickel- and cobalt-specific ecf transporters in the presence and absence of their t and atpase units. accumulation assays with radioactive metal ions showed that the truncated transporters led to approx. 25% of cell-bound radioactivity compared to the holotransporters. activity of urease, an intracellular nickel-dependent enzyme, was used as a reporter and clearly indicated that the cell-bound radioactivity correlates with the cytoplasmic metal concentration. the results demonstrate that s units of metal transporters not only bind their substrates on the cell surface  but mediate transport across the membrane, a finding of general importance on the way to understand the mechanism of ecf transporters.
