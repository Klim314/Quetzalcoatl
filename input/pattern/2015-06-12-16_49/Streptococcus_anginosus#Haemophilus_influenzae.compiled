TI  - Antimicrobial activity of preparation Bioaron C.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of sirupus Bioaron C, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of Aloe arborescens, was tested against different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. The experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus Candida and on 18 reference strains (ATCC). The antimicrobial activity of Bioaron C (MBC and MFC) was determined at undiluted concentration. Bioaron C proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. At the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (MBC, MFC) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Parvimonas micra, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus anginosus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, already after 15 min. The MIC of Bioaron C against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. The great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. Bioaron C may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.
TI  - Anogenital bacteriology in non-abused preschool children: a descriptive study of  the aerobic genital flora and the isolation of anogenital Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - The purpose of the study is to describe the genital aerobic bacterial flora including Gardnerella vaginalis in girls and the occurrence of anal G. vaginalis in both genders. From a group of 3773 children, 278 (99 boys and 179 girls) with a mean age of 5.63 y (range: 5.13-6.73) were recruited. Inclusion in the study was based on self-selection, whereby parents who did not suspect any occurrence of sexual abuse of their child gave informed consent to participate. Several mechanisms were undertaken to exclude abused children. At least one bacterial species was isolated from the genitals of 59 (33.9%) girls. Most isolates (39 out of 99) were bacteria representing skin flora (staphylococci and coryneform organisms), with viridans streptococci and related organisms as the second most common group of isolates (31 out of 99). S. anginosus was the single most frequent bacterial species identified (17 isolates). Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated from the genitals of two girls, Streptococcus pneumoniae from one girl and Haemophilus influenzae from eight girls. G. vaginalis was not isolated from the genitals in any girl, but the organism was isolated from the anal canal in three children.
TI  - Bactericidal titers of loracarbef (LY 163892) in serum and killing rates in volunteers receiving 400 versus 200 milligrams.
AB  - In a randomized crossover trial, six volunteers received 200- and 400-mg doses of loracarbef (LY 163892), a new oral cephalosporin. Mean +/- standard error of the mean concentrations in serum obtained after 1.5 and 3 h were 13.2 +/- 2.8 and 4.3 +/- 0.7 mg/liter, respectively, after the 400-mg dose and 6.9 +/- 1.0 and 1.7 +/- 0.2 mg/liter, respectively, after the 200-mg dose. Bactericidal reciprocal titers measured against respiratory pathogens in serum suggested that loracarbef would be highly effective against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes (median titers, 8 to 128 at 1.5 h and less than 2 to 32 at 3 h) and beta-lactamase-negative Haemophilus influenzae (median titers, 4 at 1.5 h and 2 to 4 at 3 h). Other species (Branhamella catarrhalis, Streptococcus anginosus, Staphylococcus aureus) were associated with lower bactericidal titers. Killing curves performed against 12 strains demonstrated that the bioactivity of loracarbef (measured by the reduction in the area under the control growth curve) was significantly correlated with the concentration/MIC ratio, whereas the initial rate of killing was not, once the concentration was greater than the MIC. Our results suggest that administration of 400 mg of loracarbef every 8 h might be associated with more favorable pharmacodynamic parameters against target bacteria.
TI  - Cefmenoxime: clinical evaluation.
AB  - Cefmenoxime was evaluated in an open trial consisting of 41 patients. Forty infections in 36 patients could be evaluated. Thirteen patients had pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli (two bacteremic), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Streptococcus faecalis; all improved and 12 of 13 were clinically cured, but one relapse (S. faecalis) occurred at two weeks. Six patients with cystitis due to E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, P. aeruginosa, or S. faecalis all improved, but relapse or reinfection, or both, occurred in five due to P. aeruginosa, S. faecalis, C. fruendii, or E. coli. Neurogenic bladder or other complications were present in five of 13 patients with pyelonephritis and five of six with cystitis. Ten patients with pneumonia and one with tracheobronchitis due to Hemophilus influenzae, S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, or Neisseria meningitidis all improved and seven had resolution without relapse, but P. aeruginosa emerged in two patients, one of whom died. Eight soft tissue infections due to Staphylococcus aureus, Peptococcus prevotti, Streptococcus species, or infections of mixed origin resolved in six. Sterility of blood cultures was obtained in one patient with endocarditis due to S. anginosus, but other therapy was substituted. Clinical resolution of the toxic shock syndrome and subsequent negative endocervical cultures for S. aureus occurred in one. Granulocytopenia of unverified cause in four (with less than 1,500 mm3) and two (with less than 2,000 mm3) was reversible. Headache during treatment occurred in six patients and a possible disulfiram-like effect in three. Elevations of serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase and alkaline phosphatase occurred in five, Coombs' positivity in two, and diarrhea in three. Clinical efficacy of cefmenoxime was significant. Possible side effects require further study.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of ceftizoxime in the pediatric infections (author's transl)].
AB  - Ceftizoxime (FK 749, CZX) was evaluated in 24 children with a suspicion of bacterial infection. Of the 17 confirmed bacterial infections, 16 were shown to be effective (effective rate, 94.1%). The diagnosis included acute pharyngitis (2), pneumonia (6), staphylococcal empyema (1), cervical purulent lymphadenitis (2), acute enterocolitis (2), acute pyelonephritis (1), SSSS (1) and suspected septicemia (2). The etiological pathogens recovered were Streptococcus anginosus (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Staphylococcus aureus (2), Haemophilus influenzae (3), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (1) etc. A case of suspected Pseudomonas aeruginosa septicemia was not effectively treated with CZX. The serum half-life of CZX was 1.36 hours after intravenous bolus infection. A cerebrospinal fluid level of CZX was 6.2 mcg/ml 1 hour after intravenous bolus injection of 1 g (23.8 mg/kg) in a child with inflamed meninges. No severe adverse reaction was encountered with the CZX therapy. The data suggest that CZX is an excellent candidate for the first choice parenteral antibiotic in the pediatric infections.
