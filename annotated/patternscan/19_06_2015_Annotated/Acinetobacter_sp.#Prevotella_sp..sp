TI  == analysis of the airway microbiota of healthy individuals and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by t-rflp and clone sequencing.
AB  == chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is a progressive, inflammatory lung  disease that affects a large number of patients and has significant impact. one hallmark of the disease is the presence of bacteria in the lower airways. objective: the aim of this study was to analyze the detailed structure of microbial communities found in the lungs of healthy individuals and patients with copd. nine copd patients as compared and 9 healthy individuals underwent flexible bronchoscopy and bal was performed. bacterial nucleic acids were subjected to terminal restriction fragment (trf) length polymorphism and clone library analysis. overall, we identified 326 t-rflp band, 159 in patients and 167 in healthy controls. the results of the trf analysis correlated partly with the data obtained from clone sequencing. although the results of the sequencing showed high diversity, the genera prevotella, sphingomonas, pseudomonas, acinetobacter,  fusobacterium, megasphaera, veillonella, staphylococcus, and streptococcus constituted the major part of the core microbiome found in both groups. a trf band possibly representing pseudomonas sp. monoinfection was associated with a reduction of the microbial diversity. non-cultural methods reveal the complexity  of the pulmonary microbiome in healthy individuals and in patients with copd. alterations of the microbiome in pulmonary diseases are correlated with disease.

TI  == [repression of bacterial biofilms in suppurative necrotic complications of diabetic foot syndrome by ultrasound cavitation].
AB  == aim: study of wound microbial landscape in suppurative necrotic complications in  patients with diabetic foot syndrome (dfs), and a possibility of suppression of bacterial biofilm development in these wounds by ultrasound cavitation (usc). materials and methods: 2 randomized groups of patients were included in the study: main group of 145 individuals with suppurative necrotic complications of dfs, who received ultrasound cavitation therapy, and comparison group of 86 patients who received basic therapy. in the main group sonoca-180 (siring, germany) unit, that allows to combine the process of mechanical wound treatment with antibacterial action of low frequency ultrasound, was used for wound treatment. quantitative and qualitative composition of wound microflora was studied by using bacteriological method with parallel utilization of transmission and scanning electron microscopy in the dynamic of usc treatment. results: in patients with dfs bacterial biofilms containing congestions in the polysaccharide matrix and fixed at the surface of dense structure of periostenum wound were detected. in the microbial landscape in dfs patients in 21% of cases aerobic-anaerobic microflora was detected, while associations included mostly from 2 to 5 bacteria species--members of the peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, prevotella, bacteroides genera. bacteria of staphylococcus, acinetobacter, pseudomonas, escherichia and klebsiella sp. genera were detected less frequently. application of usc in the main group resulted in a decrease of microbial contamination of wounds in the short-term. conclusion: usc method, when compared  with classical therapy approach in dfs complications, in patients with suppurative necrotic complications allows not only to remove mechanically the necrotic tissues but also to effectively suppress the bacterial biofilms that have formed in the wounds, this promotes the acceleration of recovery process and preparation of the patients for further plastic surgery intervention.

TI  == [usefulness and limit of gram staining smear examination].
AB  == gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. it yields results much faster than  culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. however, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from gram staining smears is also present. the gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. species of  gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive diplococcus, forming gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling streptococcus pneumoniae. acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, gram-negative  short rod in the sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. capnocytophaga sp. is a gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling fusobacterium nucleatum.

TI  == detection and identification of rumen bacteria constituting a fibrolytic consortium dominated by fibrobacter succinogenes.
AB  == a fibrolytic consortium, dominated by the rumen cellulolytic bacterium fibrobacter succinogenes, was artificially constructed on hay stems to detect and identify rumen bacteria that can potentially interact with f. succinogenes. consortium-bacterial members were determined by dgge and sequencing analysis targeted bacterial 16s rdna. an artificial consortium was formed in a 2-step incubation of hay stems; the first step with group 1, 2 or 3 f. succinogenes strains, the second step with rumen fluid. after consortium formation, morphologically different bacteria were observed in association with f. succinogenes. dgge exhibited more than 30 bands, the pattern of which depended on the f. succinogenes group. sequencing suggested that butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, clostridium sp., f. succinogenes group 2, prevotella  ruminicola and unclassified bacteroides were prominent in the group 1 consortium  and that treponema bryantii, b. fibrisolvens, acinetobacter sp, and wolinella succinogenes were prominent in the group 2 consortium. however, in the group 3 consortium, f. succinogenes-like bacteria were microscopically undetectable, whereas cellulolytic ruminococcus albus and f. succinogenes group 1 were prominent, suggesting that the group 3 cannot be a core member of this consortium. this study is the first attempt to identify bacterial members of a fibrolytic consortium dominated by a specific bacterium.
