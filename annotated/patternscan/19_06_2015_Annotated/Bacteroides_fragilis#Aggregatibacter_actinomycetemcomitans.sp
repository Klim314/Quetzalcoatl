TI  == essential oils and isolated compounds from lippia alba leaves and flowers: antimicrobial activity and osteoclast apoptosis.
AB  == in the present study, essential oils extracted from the leaves and flowers of lippia alba (mill.) n.e.br. (l. alba) were analyzed for their antimicrobial activity and their effects on osteoclasts. the periodontal pathogens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans; atcc 43717), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum; atcc 25586) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis); atcc 33277) were used in antimicrobial activity assays for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc), whereas bacteroides fragilis (b. fragilis; atcc 25285) was used as the control microorganism. osteoclast (oc) apoptosis was assessed by tunel assay and fas receptor expression was detected by immunocytochemistry. the analysis of antimicrobial activity revealed that p. gingivalis had the lowest mic values, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans had the highest. l. alba essential oils were found to be toxic to human cells, although the compounds, carvone, limonene and citral, were non-toxic and induced apoptosis in the ocs. this study demonstrates that l. alba has potential biotechnological application in dentistry. in fact periodontal disease has a multifactorial etiology, and the immune response to microbial challenge leads to osteoclast activation and the resorption of the alveolar bone, resulting in tooth loss.

TI  == inhibitory activity of aloe vera gel on some clinically isolated cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == aloe vera is a medicinal plant with anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antidiabetic and immune-boosting properties. in the present study we investigated the inhibitory activities of aloe vera gel on some cariogenic (streptococcus mutans), periodontopathic (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis) and an opportunistic periodontopathogen (bacteroides fragilis) isolated from patients with dental caries and periodontal diseases. twenty isolates of each of these bacteria were investigated for their sensitivity to aloe vera gel using the disk diffusion and microdilution methods. s. mutans was the species most sensitive to aloe vera gel with a mic of 12.5 microg/ml, while a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and b. fragilis were less sensitive, with a mic of 25-50 microg/ml (p < 0.01). based on our present findings it is concluded that aloe vera gel at optimum concentration could be used as an antiseptic for prevention of dental caries and periodontal diseases.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  == six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying mic values ranging from 1 to 10 mug ml-1. the results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.

TI  == recombinant expression and redox properties of triheme c membrane-bound quinol peroxidase.
AB  == the qpo gene of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans encodes a triheme c-containing membrane-bound enzyme, quinol peroxidase (qpo) that catalyzes peroxidation reaction in the respiratory chain and uses quinol as the physiological electron donor. the qpo of a. actinomycetemcomitans is the only characterized qpo, but homologues of the qpo gene are widely distributed among many gram-negative bacteria, including haemophils ducreii, bacteroides fragilis,  and escherichia coli. one-third of the amino acid sequence of qpo from the n-terminal end is unique, whereas two-thirds of the sequence from the c-terminal  end exhibits high homology with the sequence of the diheme bacterial cytochrome c peroxidase. in order to obtain sufficient protein for biophysical studies, the present study aimed to overproduce recombinant qpo (rqpo) from a. actinomycetemcomitans in e. coli. coexpression of qpo with e. coli cytochrome c maturation (ccm) genes resulted in the expression of an active qpo with a high yield. using purified rqpo, we determined the midpoint reduction potentials of the three heme molecules.

TI  == evidence for local production of antibodies to auto and non-self antigens in periodontal disease.
AB  == autoimmune mechanisms may contribute to periodontal disease (pd) pathogenesis; autoantibody to collagen type 1 is produced at the periodontal site and local levels are found to be higher than in serum. objectives: to find any evidence of  autoimmune destruction in diseased periodontal tissues in patients with periodontitis. the study examines the relationship of antibodies to a self antigen collagen type 1 and antigens from two periodontal pathogens namely porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) and a non-oral bacterium bacteroides fragilis (bf) in disease sites and in serum. materials and methods: granulomatous tissues from periodontally diseased sites and serum samples were obtained from 13 patients (15 sites) undergoing surgical therapy. tissues were homogenized at 4 degrees c on tris saline buffer [1 g (5 ml)-1], homogenate was centrifuged and the resultant supernatants were used in assays. antibody to collagen and aa, pg and bf in tissue eluates and serum were determined by competitive enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (elisa) and conventional elisa respectively using an alkaline phosphatase/p-nitrophenyl phosphate enzyme-substrate system. sera from age and sex matched healthy subjects and pooled human serum were used as controls. antibody (ab) levels in tissues and serum were standardized by concomitant albumin assay. results: level of antibodies to collagen type 1 in tissue was significantly higher than in serum (p = 0.0001). antibody levels in tissue to pg were significantly higher than in serum (p = 0.0271). ab levels to both aa and bf in tissues and serum were not significantly different from each other. conclusions: these findings confirm the  process of the local production of antibodies to autoantigen namely collagen type-1 and to bacterial antigens in the granulomatous tissues housed within the periodontal lesions in patients with periodontitis.

TI  == similarities between fusobacterium nucleatum and bacteroides fragilis studied by  two dna probes derived from fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-amplified oligonucleotide dna probe corresponding to a fusobacterium nucleatum fevl dna region coding for a 40-kda major outer-membrane protein (omp) and a randomly cloned 2.1 kb dna probe were found to recognize dna from the gram-negative bacteria fusobacterium nucleatum and bacteroides fragilis on southern blots and slot blots. the results indicate sequence similarity within the dna fragments studied. immunoblots tested with polyclonal antibodies against whole cells of f. nucleatum revealed only weak antigen similarity between these species.

TI  == e-test: a new technique for antimicrobial susceptibility testing for periodontal  microorganisms.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to validate the epsilometer test (e-test) method for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of selected periodontopathic microorganisms  using the agar dilution method as a standard. the e-test has been developed to provide a direct quantification of antimicrobial susceptibility of microorganisms. the device consists of a predefined, continuous, and exponential  gradient of antibiotic concentrations immobilized along a rectangular plastic test strip. after 48 hours incubation a drop-shaped inhibition zone intersects the graded test strip at the inhibitory concentration (ic) of the antibiotic. twenty-two subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites were plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% rabbit blood or 5% sheep blood and trypticase soy agar supplemented with vancomycin and bacitracin. a total of 60 strains of key periodontal pathogens (prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, and capnocytophaga) isolated from 22 sites of 12 patients were studied. the antibiotics tested were clindamycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, cefoxitin, and ampicillin at concentrations above and below the achieved blood or gingival crevicular fluid levels. as a standard reference the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined using the  agar dilution method. mics were compared with ics determined using the e-test method. the results showed an agreement ranging from 67% to 100%; sensitivity ranging from 75% to 100%; predictability ranging from 56% to 100% and specificity ranging from 33% to 96%. the e-test ics for ampicillin, cefoxitin, and metronidazole against the gram-negative capnophilic and microaerophilic rods and  the black-pigmented anaerobic rods ics for ampicillin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and tetracycline showed a high percentage of agreement with the agar dilution mics.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
