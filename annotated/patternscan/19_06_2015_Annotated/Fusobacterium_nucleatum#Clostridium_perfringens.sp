TI  == antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (itcs) extracted from horseradish (armoracia rusticana) root against oral microorganisms.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (itcs) extracted from horseradish root was investigated against oral microorganisms: 6 strains of facultative anaerobic bacteria, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus casei, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; one strain of yeast, candida albicans, and 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, and clostridium perfringens. the itcs extracted from horseradish root showed antimicrobial activity against all oral microorganisms by the paper disk method.  the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of the itcs extracted from horseradish root ranged from 1.25 to 5.00 mg/ml against 6 strains of facultative  anaerobic bacteria and one strain of yeast, and 4.17 to 16.67 mg/ml against 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria. the itcs extracted from horseradish root showed the strongest antimicrobial activity, with a mbc of 1.25 mg/ml, against c. albicans among facultative microorganisms, and 4.17 mg/ml against f. nucleatum among anaerobic bacteria. these results suggest that the itcs extracted from horseradish root may be a candidate for use as an antimicrobial agent against oral microorganisms.

TI  == coaggregation between and among human intestinal and oral bacteria.
AB  == coaggregation is believed to facilitate the integration of new bacterial species  into polymicrobial communities. the aim of this study was to investigate coaggregation between and among human oral and enteric bacteria. stationary phase cultures of 10 oral and 10 enteric species, chosen on the basis of numerical and  ecological significance in their respective environments together with their ease of cultivation, were tested using a quantitative spectrophotometric coaggregation assay in all possible pairwise combinations to provide quantitative coaggregation scores. while 40% of possible partnerships coaggregated strongly for oral strains, strong interactions between oral and gut strains were considerably less  common (4% incidence). coaggregation scores were also weak between members of the intestinal microbiota (7% incidence), apart from bacteroides fragilis with clostridium perfringens, and bifidobacterium adolescentis with c. perfringens. oral and intestinal bacteria did not strongly interact, apart from b. adolescentis with fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii with c. perfringens and f. nucleatum with lactobacillus paracasei. heating and sugar-addition experiments indicated that similar to oral microorganisms, interactions within intestinal bacteria and between intestinal and oral strains were mediated by lectin-carbohydrate interactions.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of propolis and other substances against selected endodontic pathogens.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial effect of ethanol extract of propolis (eep) and intracanal medicaments calcium hydroxide, camphorated paramonochlorophenol, and formocresol by means of the macrodilution method using the reinforced clostridial medium (rcm) and brucella and brain heart infusion media. study design: the antimicrobial agents were sequentially diluted  and tested against anaerobic bacteria prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces israelii, and clostridium perfringens and against enterococcus faecalis, with the 5 x 10(5) cfu/ml standardized inocula. the tubes  were anaerobically incubated and the minimum inhibitory concentration was detected. blood agar rcm subcultures were performed to provide minimum bactericidal concentration. the results were analyzed by analysis of variance test. results: all drugs were effective against all tested strains, without statistical differences. e. faecalis was the less susceptible strain, and rcm broth promoted faster bacterial growth, but there were no significant differences in these results. ethanol did not influence the antimicrobial effect of eep.

TI  == an in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. the agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. in this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. the time-kill experiment was performed using anaerobe broth medium. the drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory  concentration (mic), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/l for linezolid, 2mg/l for clindamycin, and 8mg/l for metronidazole. samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the bioscience international autospiral dw. exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees c).  the species tested included bacteroides fragilis (2), b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron, fusobacterium nucleatum, f. varium, prevotella melaninogenica,  clostridium perfringens, eubacterium lentum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). the activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. as expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. metronidazole yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions  of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three  strains. linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. the profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.

TI  == activity of endodontic antibacterial agents against selected anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of substances used as antibacterial agents (solutions  of 10% calcium hydroxide, camphorated paramonochlorophenol - pmcc, 2% chlorhexidine digluconate and 10% castor oil plant detergent) on anaerobic bacteria (fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586, prevotella nigrescens atcc 33563, clostridium perfringens atcc 13124 and bacteroidesfragilis atcc 25285), using a broth dilution technique, was evaluated in vitro. for determination of minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericide concentrations (mic and mbc), two culture broths, reinforced clostridial medium (rcm) and supplemented brucella, standardized inoculum and serially diluted solutions were used. all antibacterial agents presented antimicrobial activity that varied for different bacteria. there were no differences in the performance of the two broths. chlorhexidine digluconate was the most effective, with the lowest mics, followed by castor oil  detergent, pmcc and calcium hydroxide. c. perfringens and b. fragilis were the most resistant bacteria to all agents.

TI  == enumeration of viable anaerobic bacteria by solid phase cytometry under aerobic conditions.
AB  == classical enumeration methods for anaerobes are time-consuming and require special conditions. solid phase cytometry (spc) is a recent laser scanning technique for the quantitative detection of fluorescently labelled bacteria on a  membrane filter that eliminates the need for a growth phase. fluorescent labelling of cells results from the cleavage by intracellular esterases of a fluorescein type ester to yield a free fluorescein derivative, which is retained  only in cells with an intact cytoplasmic membrane. however, as the standard labelling procedure is carried out under the conditions of aerobiosis, labelling  of anaerobic bacteria does not appear to be obvious. we have labelled eight strains of vegetative anaerobic bacteria (i.e. bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, clostridium bifermentans, c. butyricum, c. perfringens, fusobacterium nucleatum,  porphyromonas canoris, p. gingivalis, propionibacterium acnes) and two strains of spores (c. butyricum, c. perfringens,) within 4 h under aerobic conditions. however, anaerobiosis remained necessary for spores of c. sordellii, c. sporogenes, c. tyrobutyricum. for vegetative cells of all strains, plots of spc versus plate counts were linear with slopes exceeding 1.0, indicating that spc consistently yielded higher numbers of bacteria.

TI  == in vitro effect of intracanal medicaments on strict anaerobes by means of the broth dilution method.
AB  == the determination of bacterial susceptibility to intracanal medicaments is a necessity. nevertheless, few studies utilize the proper methodology to carry out  that evaluation with anaerobes. in this study, the steps of a broth dilution method, carried out in microplates (microdilution) and tubes (macrodilution), to  test the effect of traditional intracanal medicaments on anaerobic bacteria are described. the results are presented as values of minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (mic and mbc). standardized inocula of the anaerobic  bacteria prevotella nigrescens (atcc 33563), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc 25586) and clostridium perfringens (atcc 13124), in reinforced clostridium medium (rcm)  and supplemented brucella broth, were submitted to different concentrations of calcium hydroxide, chlorhexidine digluconate, camphorated paramonochlorophenol and formocresol solutions. the drugs were diluted in the same culture broths, in  microplates and tubes, and were then incubated in anaerobiosis jars at 37 degrees c for 48 or 96 hours. the determination of mics was carried out through visual and spectrophotometric readings, and the determination of mbcs, through the plating of aliquots on rcm-blood agar. for that kind of study, the macromethod with spectrophotometric reading should be the natural choice. mics and mbcs obtained with the macromethod were compatible with the known clinical performance of the studied medications, and the values varied according to the bacteria and culture media employed. rcm was the most effective medium and c. perfringens, the most resistant microorganism.

TI  == antianaerobic activity of a cecropin---melittin peptide.
AB  == objective: several small, 15-residue peptides that contain portions of the amino  acid sequences of both cecropin a and melittin have previously been shown to have broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against aerobic microorganisms, with no undesirable hemolytic properties. it would also be useful to know what effect these hybrid peptides have on anaerobic bacteria. methods: the minimum inhibitory concentrations of one hybrid, ca(1--7)m(2--9)nh2, were compared with those of seven other antimicrobial agents against 111 clinical anaerobic strains; bacteroides fragilis, 24 strains; other bacteroides fragilis group, 14 strains; other bacteroides species, 13 strains; fusobacterium nucleatum, six strains; clostridium difficile, 22 strains; clostridium perfringens, 10 strains, propionibacterium spp., nine strains; and anaerobic cocci, 13 strains. results: ninety per cent of strains belonging to the b. fragilis group, fusobacteria, propionibacteria and peptostreptococci were inhibited by 4 mg/l ca(1--7)m(2--9)nh2, and the antimicrobial activity was approximately in the same  range as that of chloramphenicol. conclusion: this investigation showed that the  antimicrobial spectrum of this cecropin---melittin hybrid also includes anaerobic organisms.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of abt-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. mics at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for actinomyces spp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium spp., and porphyromonas spp. the mic(50)s and mic(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for eubacterium spp., lactobacillus spp., clostridium difficile, and clostridium ramosum. the mic(90) for bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides ureolyticus, and campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for prevotella bivia and other prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. the mic(90) for fusobacterium nucleatum was 8  microg/ml, and that for fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. the mic(90)s for the bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for b. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides distasonis, and bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. telithromycin mics for the b. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than abt-773 mics. for all strains, abt-773  was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.

TI  == review of the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic pathogens.
AB  == published reports on the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805),  a new fluoronaphthyridone, against anaerobic pathogens are reviewed here. the studies used a variety of media, inocula and antimicrobial agents. using a proposed breakpoint of 0.5 mg/l, these studies showed that gemifloxacin had generally higher potency against gram-positive anaerobes (clostridium perfringens, all peptostreptococcus spp.) and fusobacteria (fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium necrophorum) and moderate but variable potency against gram-negative anaerobes. bacteroides stercoris, bacteroides tectum and many bacteroides fragilis isolates were inhibited by concentrations of < or =0.5 mg/l, while the other species of the b. fragilis group required higher concentrations for inhibition. species variability was evident: porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas macaccae, prevotella heparinolytica and prevotella intermedia were susceptible to 0.5 mg/l  of gemifloxacin while most other porphyromonas and prevotella spp. were not. these data suggest that gemifloxacin may have a clinical role in the treatment of certain dental, head and neck and pleuropulmonary infections in which gram-positive anaerobes, fusobacteria and some prevotella and porphyromonas spp.  may predominate.

TI  == standardisation of quantitative direct gas liquid chromatography for early detection of bacteria in blood cultures.
AB  == blood cultures with strains of aerobic, facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria were studied by quantitative direct gas liquid chromatography for early  diagnosis of bacteraemias. small amounts of volatile and nonvolatile fatty acids  were detected in uninoculated blood cultures. bacteroides fragilis produced acetic (27.6 mumol/ml), propionic (1.0 mumol/ml), isovaleric, (0.6 mumol/ml), lactic (4.5 mumol/ml) and succinic (2.7 mumol/ml) acids after 48 h. blood cultures inoculated with clostridium perfringens and fusobacterium nucleatum produced large amount of butyric acid (2.5 and 18.8 mumol/ml respectively) along  with acetic, propionic, lactic and succinic acids on day 2 of incubation. blood cultures with escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (group a) produced only acetic, lactic and succinic  acids. pseudomonas aeruginosa produced only small amounts of succinic (0.6 mumol/ml) and acetic acids (2.4 mumol/ml) on day 5 of incubation. blood cultures  inoculated with anaerobic bacteria produced multiple volatile fatty acids within  24 to 48 h of incubation. since these acids could be detected earlier than the organism in cultures, they may be useful in the early diagnosis of anaerobic bacteraemias/septicaemias.

AB  == from january 1979, to july 1981, blood from each patient suspected of having bacteremia was collected in two bottles of commercially prepared tryptic soy broth; one bottle was vented for 24 hr to the atmosphere. bottles were incubated  at 37 degrees c for a maximum of seven days and were examined daily for signs of  growth. blind subcultures onto chocolate-agar plates were performed 18-24 hr after collection and again at 48 hr. for 63,106 bottles inoculated, a total of 4,788 strains were isolated, for a rate of 6.4% (excluding contaminants). two hundred and thirty (4.8%) isolates were anaerobes, of which 75 (33%) were identified as bacteroides fragilis. it is significant that 20 of these anaerobic  isolates (approximately 9%) were recovered only from the vented bottles. these included eight strains of b. fragilis; three strains of clostridium perfringens;  and one strain each of bacteroides distasonis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptococcus saccharolyticus, and eubacterium species. these results emphasize the need to check vented bottles for anaerobes, since significant numbers of these bacteria could be missed by failing to do so. these data further show the desirability of holding anaerobic blood cultures for a minimum of one week.

TI  == in vitro activity of u-57930e against anaerobic bacteria and its comparison with  clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline.
AB  == the in vitro activity of u-57930e, a pipecolic acid amide of clindamycin, was compared with those of clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline against 321 anaerobic clinical isolates. the mic (micrograms/ml) of u-57930e that inhibited 95% bacteroides fragilis, peptococcus prevotii, b. melaninogenicus and  p. asaccharolyticus was 0.0625; 0.03125 for peptostreptococcus anaerobius, b. vulgatus, propionibacterium and peptococcus species. clindamycin, on the other hand, gave mic values of 0.5 microgram/ml for b. fragilis, p. prevotii and p. asaccharolyticus, 0.25 for propionibacterium sp. all strains of clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml of u-57930e. both clindamycin and  u-57930e showed similar mic values for all strains of fusobacterium nucleatum and propionibacterium acnes tested. the mic values for ampicillin, carbenicillin and  tetracycline were within the expected range. u-57930e had a 4 approximately 8 fold lower mic than clindamycin and is significantly active against anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == pathogenic anaerobes.
AB  == anaerobes are prevalent on all mucosal surfaces and virtually all anaerobic infections are endogenous. two thirds of anaerobic infections involve five anaerobic organisms or groups--the bacteroides fragilis group, the bacteroides melaninogenicus-bacteroides asaccharolyticus group, fusobacterium nucleatum, the  anaerobic cocci, and clostridium perfringens. conditions that lower the oxidation-reduction potential and disrupt the mucosal surface (eg, vascular problems, malignant neoplasms, and surgery) lead to infection with anaerobes. clues to anaerobic infection include foul odor, gas, tissue destruction, underlying malignant neoplasms, and the unique appearance of certain anaerobes on gram's stain. specimens must be collected to avoid normal flora and transported to the laboratory under anaerobic conditions. therapy involves surgical debridement and drainage and the use of various antimicrobial agents. antimicrobial agents must be used for extended periods to avoid relapse.

TI  == biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-nitropyrene (1-np) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from salmonella typhimurium strain ta98 in the absence of s9 fraction in the salmonella-microsome test. it is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-np and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. we determined the 1-np nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. we found that the mutagenicity of 1-np mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. the product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-ap), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. the 1-np nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the  anaerobic bacteria, i.e., bacteroides fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, fusobacterium mortiferum, f. nucleatum, clostridium perfringens, c. sporogenes, bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, eubacterium lentum, e. limosum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-np to 1-ap and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-np.

TI  == survival of anaerobic bacteria in common laboratory diluents.
AB  == the survival of six species of anaerobic bacteria was studied in simple or commercially available diluents. bacteroides fragilis and fusobacterium nucleatum showed excellent survival in all diluents including distilled water. fusobacterium mortiferum survived well in all diluents except water and water supplemented with 0.1% gelatain. clostridium perfringens survived best in phosphate-buffered saline with gelatin. peptococcus asaccharolyticus required gelatin added to the basic diluent, and streptococcus intermedius showed excellent survival only in minimal essential medium with gelatin. these diluents  could provide effective and economical alternatives to more complex and costly diluents often used in work with anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == in vitro activity of tiamulin (81.723 hfu), a new pleuromulin derivative, against clinically significant anaerobes.
AB  == the susceptibility of more than 40 strains of gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobes to tiamulin (sandoz 81.723 hfu), a new pleuromulin (pleuromutilin) derivative, was determined by broth dilution and agar dilution tests. the influences of density of the inoculum upon mics was studied by a specially designed pour plate-technique. bacteroides fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. splanchnicus, b. oralis, b. asaccharolyticus, b. melaninogenicus, fusobacterium fusiforme (f. nucleatum), sphaerophorus necrophorus, clostridium perfringens, c.  fallax, propionibacterium acnes and several species of peptococcaceae showed broth dilution mics of 0.03 similar to 1 microgram/ml. members of b. thetaiotaomicron, b. distasonis and s. freundii (f. mortiferum) were inhibited by 8 similar to 32 microgram/ml and 2 strains of s. varius had a broth dilution mic  of 256 microgram/ml. with most strains, the agar dilution mics were 2 similar to  4 similar to 8 times the broth dilution mics. in pour plate-tests, the mics were  not considerably influenced influenced by varying initial concentrations of viable cells. with most anaerobes, the mbcs of tiamulin were more than 100-fold higher than the mics. the results obtained indicated that, apart from s. varius,  b. thetaiotaomicron, b. distasonis and s. freundii (f. mortiferum), members of 16 other anaerobic species including b. fragilis were without exception sensitive to tiamulin.

TI  == a modified plate holding system for anaerobic cultures.
AB  == a modified plate holding system for anaerobes has been developed which: 1) effectively reduces the volume of oxygen-free gas required, 2) promotes earlier bacterial growth, and 3) monitors the anaerobic atmosphere of the holding vessel  and the rate of gas flow. cultures of bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, c. septicum, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptococcus sp. and propionibacterium sp. were evaluated for optimal growth. all cultures grew as well as or better when preincubated in the holding system for one to three hours  then incubated in a gaspak system for the remainder of the 24 hours, as compared  to incubation only in the gaspak or holding system for the entire 24-hour period.
