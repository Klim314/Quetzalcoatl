TI  - The effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. The aim of this study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into the study. Each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. All patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. Plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16S rDNA microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. RESULTS: Plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. The greatest differences in plaque composition were seen with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. Post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Eubacterium nodatum, while Campylobacter rectus, Parvimonas micra, and Actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.
TI  - The association between detectable plasmatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load and different subgingival microorganisms in Brazilian adults with HIV: a multilevel analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study investigates the association between detectable plasmatic  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load (HVL) and high levels of periodontal- and non-periodontal-related microorganisms in the subgingival microbiota of individuals with HIV. METHODS: Thirty-seven individuals with HIV were divided into two groups: 1) detectable HVL (n = 15); and 2) undetectable HVL (n = 22). Subgingival biofilm samples were obtained, and the levels of 35 microbial species were determined by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Periodontal clinical measures and laboratory and sociodemographic data were also registered. chi(2) test, Fisher exact test, and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare groups. Multilevel ordinal regression models were used to test the association between HVL and the levels of 35 microbial species in subgingival biofilm, adjusted for confounders. RESULTS: Of the 35 species studied, 11 (31.4%) showed higher mean levels in the detectable HVL group than undetectable HVL group (P <0.001). These species included Actinomyces naeslundii II, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Veillonella parvula, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter concisus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Candida albicans. Significant associations between detectable HVL and high levels of microorganisms, adjusted for confounders, were observed for A. naeslundii I, Actinomyces gerencseriae, C. gingivalis, E. corrodens, C. concisus, Prevotella nigrescens, T. forsythia, and Dialister pneumosintes. CONCLUSION: Detectable plasmatic HVL in individuals with HIV was associated with elevated levels of known periodontal pathogens, such as P. nigrescens, T. forsythia, and E. corrodens, as well as C. concisus, C. gingivalis, and D. pneumosintes in the subgingival biofilm.
TI  - The cultivable human oral gluten-degrading microbiome and its potential implications in coeliac disease and gluten sensitivity.
AB  - Coeliac disease is characterized by intestinal inflammation caused by gluten, proteins which are widely contained in the Western diet. Mammalian digestive enzymes are only partly capable of cleaving gluten, and fragments remain that induce toxic responses in patients with coeliac disease. We found that the oral microbiome is a novel and rich source of gluten-degrading organisms. Here we report on the isolation and characterization of the cultivable resident oral microbes that are capable of cleaving gluten, with special emphasis on the immunogenic domains. Bacteria were obtained by a selective culturing approach and enzyme activities were characterized by: (i) hydrolysis of paranitroanilide-derivatized gliadin-derived tripeptide substrates; (ii) gliadin degradation in-gel (gliadin zymography); (iii) gliadin degradation in solution; (iv) proteolysis of the highly immunogenic alpha-gliadin-derived 33-mer peptide. For selected strains pH activity profiles were determined. The culturing strategy yielded 87 aerobic and 63 anaerobic strains. Species with activity in at least two of the four assays were typed as: Rothia mucilaginosa HOT-681, Rothia aeria HOT-188, Actinomyces odontolyticus HOT-701, Streptococcus mitis HOT-677, Streptococcus sp. HOT-071, Neisseria mucosa HOT-682 and Capnocytophaga sputigena HOT-775, with Rothia species being active in all four assays. Cleavage specificities and substrate preferences differed among the strains identified. The approximate molecular weights of the enzymes were ~75 kD (Rothia spp.), ~60 kD (A. odontolyticus) and ~150 kD (Streptococcus spp.). In conclusion, this study identified new gluten-degrading microorganisms in the upper gastrointestinal tract. A cocktail of the most active oral bacteria, or their isolated enzymes, may offer promising new treatment modalities for coeliac disease.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts of Laminaria japonica against oral microorganisms.
AB  - Laminaria japonica is a brown alga, which is consumed widely in Korea, Japan, and China. This study investigated the antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts of L. japonica against oral microbial species to assess the possible application of L. japonica extracts in dental care products. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined in culture medium using a microdilution method. The MICs of ethanol extracts of L. japonica with oral streptococci were 62.5-500 mug/ml and the MBCs were 125-1000 mug/ml. The MICs of Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces odontolyticus were 250 and 62.5 mug/ml, respectively. The MBCs of A. naeslundii and A. odontolyticus were 500 and 250 mug/ml, respectively. The MICs were 250 and 62.5 mug/ml for Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis, respectively. The killing of Streptococcus mutans and P. gingivalis was dependent on the incubation time. The killing of S. mutans, A. odontolyticus, and P. gingivalis was significantly dependent on the extract concentration. Bacterial treatment with L. japonica extracts changed the cell surface texture of S. mutans, A. odontolyticus, and P. gingivalis. The results of this study suggest that L. japonica extracts may be useful for the development of antimicrobial agents to combat oral pathogens.
TI  - Molecular identification of bacteria on the tongue dorsum of subjects with and without halitosis.
AB  - AIM: Compare the microbial profiles on the tongue dorsum in patients with halitosis and control subjects in a UK population using culture-independent techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Halitosis patients were screened according to our recently developed recruitment protocol. Scrapings from the tongue dorsum were obtained for 12 control subjects and 20 halitosis patients. Bacteria were identified by PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. RESULTS: The predominant species found in the control samples were Lysobacter-type species, Streptococcus salivarius, Veillonella dispar, unidentified oral bacterium, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Atopobium parvulum and Veillonella atypica. In the halitosis samples, Lysobacter-type species, S. salivarius, Prevotella melaninogenica, unidentified oral bacterium, Prevotella veroralis and Prevotella pallens were the most commonly found species. For the control samples, 13-16 (4.7-5.8%) of 276 clones represented uncultured species, whereas in the halitosis samples, this proportion increased to 6.5-9.6% (36-53 of 553 clones). In the control samples, 22 (8.0%) of 276 clones represented potentially novel phylotypes, and in the halitosis samples, this figure was 39 (7.1%) of 553 clones. CONCLUSIONS: The microflora associated with the tongue dorsum is complex in both the control and halitosis groups, but several key species predominate in both groups.
TI  - In vivo evaluation of the effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on salivary bacteria using the checkerboard method.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on different species of the oral microbiota. METHODOLOGY: Saliva samples were collected from 20 subjects with good oral health, diluted and plated onto blood agar medium. The subjects were asked to place the strip (Listerine PocketPaks) on the tongue allowing it to dissolve. After 30 minutes, new saliva samples were collected again and the plates with the samples were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees C for seven days. Colony counts (CFU/mL) were determined for each sample. The colonies on the plates were washed with 1 mL of TE buffer, and the bacterial suspensions were processed for the identification of 24 species by DNA probes and the Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Differences in total counts, prevalence, and levels of the species evaluated before and after placement of the strips were determined by Wilcoxon sign rank and Chi-square tests. RESULTS: A modest increase in the total bacterial number in saliva from 1.4 x 10(8) to 1.7 x 10(8) bacterial cells was observed 30 minutes after the strip placement, although this change was not significant (p = 0.632). Most of the species reduced in frequency and/or levels, including the pathogens A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. rectus, E. corrodens, Fusobacterium spp., P. intermedia, and S. noxia, as well as the beneficial species A. meyeri, A. georgia, A. gerencseriae, A. odontolyticus, and P. acnes after strip placement. In contrast, A. viscosus, P. melaninogenica, P. gingivalis, P. micros, Streptococcus spp., T. forsythensis, and V. parvula presented an increase in prevalence and/or levels. These changes were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (p > 0.0022). CONCLUSION: The use of the essential oil-containing oral strips resulted in a short-term small increase in the total number of salivary microorganisms. In addition, a not significant decrease of certain periodontopathogens, and an increase in species compatible with oral health were observed.
TI  - Soft-tissue abscess involving Actinomyces odontolyticus and two Prevotella species in an intravenous drug abuser.
AB  - Skin and soft-tissue infections in intravenous users comprise a variety of microorganisms and anaerobic bacteria are frequently involved in these suppurative infections. A case of subcutaneous abscess into anterior femoral muscles involving Actinomyces odontolyticus and two Prevotella species (Prevotella buccae and Prevotella melaninogenica) in an intravenous drug abuser is presented. This combination of microorganisms has not previously been described in soft-tissue infections. The patient volunteering that he licked his hypodermic needle prior to cocaine injection supports that the implicating bacteria originated from the oral cavity. Eventually, the patient recovered and at a 6-month follow-up a gradual improvement of his subcutaneous infection was noticed.
TI  - The effects of an immediately pre-surgical chlorhexidine oral rinse on the bacterial contaminants of bone debris collected during dental implant surgery.
AB  - Dental implant surgery produces bone debris that can be used in the "simultaneous augmentation" technique. Although this debris is contaminated with oral bacteria, a stringent aspiration protocol has been shown to reduce the levels of contamination. Chlorhexidine mouthrinse is a well-proven antibacterial rinse that has been shown to reduce infectious complications associated with dental implants. This study examined the effect of pre-operative rinsing with a 0.1% chlorhexidine digluconate mouthrinse on the bacterial contaminants present in collected bone debris bone (CBD). Twenty partially edentate patients were randomly allocated into equal groups and underwent bone collection using the Frios Bone Collector (FBC) during the insertion of two dental implants. In group T a pre-operative chlorhexidine rinse was used, whilst in group C sterile water was used. For both groups, a stringent bone collection protocol was used. Bone samples were immediately transported for microbial analysis. Colonial and microscopic morphology, gaseous requirements and identification kits were utilised for identification of the isolated microbes. Thirty-nine species were identified including a number associated with disease, in particular Actinomyces odontolyticus, Clostridium bifermentans, Prevotella intermedia, and Propionibacterium propionicum. Samples from group T (chlorhexidine mouthrinse) yielded significantly fewer organisms (P < 0.001) than in group C (sterile water mouthrinse). Gram-positive cocci dominated the isolates from both groups. It is concluded that if bone debris is to be used for the purpose of immediate simultaneous augmentation, a preoperative chlorhexidine mouthrinse should be utilised in conjunction with a stringent aspiration protocol to reduce further the bacterial contamination of CBD.
TI  - Effects of instrumentation, irrigation and dressing with calcium hydroxide on infection in pulpless teeth with periapical bone lesions.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the fate of microorganisms in root canals of teeth with infected pulps and periapical bone lesions with and without the use of calcium hydroxide medication. METHODOLOGY: Endodontic samples were cultured and microorganisms were counted and identified in 43 teeth before (sample 1) and after (sample 2) treatment during the first visit and before (sample 3) and after (sample 4) treatment during the second visit. In the first visit teeth were instrumented and half of the teeth were filled with a thick slurry of calcium hydroxide in sterile saline. The other teeth were obturated with gutta-percha and AH-2 6 sealer. After 4 weeks the teeth with calcium-hydroxide were accessed again and after microbiological sampling they were obturated with gutta-percha and AH-26 sealer. RESULTS: The mean total colony forming unit (CFU) counts of positive samples dropped significantly as a result of canal preparation during the first visit from 1.0 x 10(6) to 1.8 x 10(3) (between samples 1 and 2) but increased to 9.3 x 10(3) in the period between the two visits (sample 2 and 3). There was no difference in mean total CFU counts of positive samples between the end of the first (sample 2) and the end of the second visit (sample 4). The most frequently isolated species were Prevotella intermedia, Capnocytophaga spp.. Actinomyces odontolyticus. Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus micros. CONCLUSIONS: Although a calcium hydroxide paste was placed in the prepared canals, the number of positive canals had increased in the period between visits. However, the number of microorganisms had only increased to 0.93% of the original number of CFU (sample 1). It is concluded that a calcium hydroxide and sterile saline slurry limits but does not totally prevent regrowth of endodontic bacteria.
TI  - Microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND, AIMS: The purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). METHODS: A total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level, were made at 6 sites per tooth. The counts (levels), % DNA probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. Significance of differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: All 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. Actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 Actinomyces species. Supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts of Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Neisseria mucosa, Streptococcus gordonii, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. Subgingival plaque samples presented significantly higher counts of Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Bacteroides forsythus and Porphykromonas gingivalis. Subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as Actinomyces species. Suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival samples were negative for the same species. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.
TI  - Oral microbiota and implant type membranes.
AB  - Candida albicans (Ca), Staphylococcus aureus (Sa), Streptococcus sanguis (Ss), Actinomyces naeslundii (An), Actinomyces odontolyticus (Ao), Porphyromona spp (P spp), Candida glabrata (Cg), Candida krusei (Ck), and Rhodotorula spp (R spp) were tested with equal pieces of biodegradable membranes. Membranes pretreated with saliva or clorhexidine and nontreated control membranes were tested in three different culture media containing 0.1 mL homologous suspension for each strain under study. Incubation was performed at 37 degrees C for 48 hours for aerobiosis and for five days for anaerobiosis. Macroscopy and microscopy were carried out. Membranes were removed, washed, and resuspended. Samples were sonicated, and the supernatant was disseminated on brain heart infusion broth or blood agar. Incubation was repeated, colony-forming unit counts were performed, and statistical analysis was carried out using analysis of variance transforming results to Log10 (x + 1), the highest interaction level was used to calculate standard error. Orthogonal contrast was used to compare the different microorganisms under study. Highest adhesion was found with Ca, Cg, Ck, Sa, and Ss. A sufficient quantity of Actinomyces could not be recovered from the membranes. Results with P spp were poor, confirming lower gram-negative adhesion. Replicate flasks with Ss and Ca were cultivated. Membranes were removed after washing and subjected to scanning electron microscopy, as were untreated control pieces. A cavelike surface was observed. Streptococcus sanguis adhering to the membranes showed extracellular projections. Candida and gram-positive cocci showed great recovery capacity.
TI  - Periodontal bacteria colonizing oral mucous membranes in edentulous patients wearing dental implants.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of the microbiota on  the oral mucosal surfaces and in the peri-implant pocket in edentulous subjects with a past history of periodontitis. Twenty edentulous subjects wearing dental implants for at least one year and with a history of periodontitis participated in this study. Clinical parameters were assessed (plaque, redness, swelling, peri-implant probing depth [PIPD], and bleeding on probing) and microbiological samples were taken (oral mucosal surfaces, saliva, plaque, and peri-implant pocket). Based on the clinical results, the group as a whole showed healthy peri-implant tissues. A mean PIPD of 3.6 mm was found. A statistically significant correlation was found between the PIPD and bleeding upon probing, plaque scores, redness, and swelling. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis were not detected. The subjects harboring Prevotella intermedia showed presence of PIPD of > or = 5 mm. All subjects harbored Peptostreptococcus spp., Fusobacterium spp., and other Prevotella species. Actinomyces odontolyticus, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter rectus, Pseudomonas spp., and enterobacteria were detected less frequently. Three subjects showed signs of overt soft tissue inflammation. They harbored higher proportions of Peptostreptococcus spp. than the other subjects. The results corroborate the suggestion that the primary source of colonization for dental implants in edentulous patients are the oral mucous membranes. The results indicate that the microbiota of subjects wearing dental implants with a past history of periodontitis are composed of bacteria associated with a healthy periodontium or gingivitis. It is suggested that elimination of the subgingival environment by extraction of all natural teeth probably initiates the disappearance of the two periodontal bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological changes associated with an altered subgingival environment induced by periodontal pocket reduction.
AB  - The purpose of the present investigation was to study the effect of an altered subgingival environment, induced by changing the local soft tissue morphology, i.e., pocket depth reduction, on the subgingival microbiota and the clinical conditions. 7 patients aged 30-60 years with generalized marginal periodontitis were selected. Patients were instructed in proper oral hygiene and all teeth were cleaned supragingivally. Mucoperiosteal flaps were raised and the bone re-contoured to eliminate angular bony defects. While the control teeth were carefully debrided and thoroughly root planed, no root instrumentation was performed on the test teeth. Calculus deposits visible to the naked eye were only chipped-off with the tip of a scaler. The flaps were apically repositioned and sutured at the level of the bone crest. Clinical parameters showed a similar pattern of response in the test and control sites over a one year observation period post therapy. Probing depths and probing attachment levels were significantly reduced one month after surgery and remained at a lower level. A significant decrease was also noted for total anaerobic viable bacterial counts. The proportion of the Gram-negative anaerobic rods decreased significantly in both groups. P. gingivalis, Fusobacterium sp., C rectus were detected significantly less often after treatment in both groups. Capnocytophaga and A. odontolyticus, on the other hand, were more frequently isolated after therapy. These findings corroborate the concept that the reduction of selected subgingival microorganisms is the key element for the success of periodontal therapy, rather than the removal of tooth substance and mineralized deposits by root instrumentation.
TI  - Coaggregation of Prevotella intermedia with oral Actinomyces species.
AB  - Five strains of Prevotella intermedia were examined for their ability to coaggregate with various gram-positive and gram-negative species of oral bacteria. Two of the P. intermedia strains coaggregated with selected Actinomyces species, P. intermedia 27 with Actinomyces viscosus T14V and Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC 12104, PK606, PK984, and PK947, and P. intermedia 113 with Actinomyces odontolyticus WVU 1546 and Actinomyces israelii WVU 838. Exposure of both Prevotella strains but not the Actinomyces strains to heat, trypsin, or proteinase K abolished most coaggregations. All pairs were disaggregated by the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate, but only those coaggregations involving P. intermedia 113 were reversed by the addition of 2.0 M urea. P. intermedia 27 was sensitive to periodate oxidation, whereas the partner strains were stable to this treatment. Most coaggregations occurred in the presence of saliva; however, reactions involving P. intermedia 27 were not as strong as those of buffer-suspended cells. Treatment of both P. intermedia 113 coaggregations pairs with proteinase K and the results obtained from suspensions of these pairs in saliva suggest that different surface molecules of this P. intermedia strain may mediate each of these coaggregations. These data suggest that all of these coaggregations involve either a protein or glycoprotein on the Prevotella strain, which may interact with carbohydrates or carbohydrate-containing molecules on the surface of the Actinomyces strain.
TI  - Changes in subgingival microbiota during puberty. A 4-year longitudinal study.
AB  - It was the purpose of the present investigation to monitor the composition of the subgingival microbiota at selected sites in individuals passing through puberty and to correlate observed changes with the development of pubertal maturation. Between the ages of 11 and 14 years, pubertal and skeletal maturation was monitored annually in 22 boys and 20 girls. During this time, subgingival microbial samples were taken every 4th to 5th month (10 times in 4 years) mesially of the upper first molars. High values in total bacterial counts were reached after the onset of puberty, followed by a decrease towards the end of the observation period. The frequency of detection of Actinomyces odontolyticus and of Capnocytophaga sp. increased with time. The frequencies of other selected species, specifically of black pigmenting Bacteriodes sp. were not found to increase when tested by linear and quadratic models of time trend. However, a statistically significant rise in the frequency of detecting B. intermedius and B. melaninogenicus was noted in the initial pubertal phase identified by the onset of testicular growth in boys (p = 0.05). A significant relationship also existed between testes growth and increase of A. odontolyticus (p less than 0.01). In girls, a similar increase was obtained for A. odontolyticus when studied in relation to the Tanner scores for breast development (p less than 0.01). The changes observed in the subgingival microbiota during puberty may be related to the development of gingivitis, which was demonstrated by a higher tendency for gingival bleeding during the course of the pubertal maturation process.
TI  - Early microbial colonization of permucosal implants in edentulous patients.
AB  - In edentulous patients, the microbial colonization of permucosal implants of sintered hydroxyapatite was studied. Samples were taken from mucosa and dentures before insertion of implants and from supra- and subgingival sites two to 10 weeks after insertion. In total, five patients and 10 implants with clinically healthy peri-implant tissues were studied. The samples were investigated by dark-field microscopy and anaerobic culture. The supragingival plaque of the implants was dominated by Gram-positive cocci and rods, the subgingival plaque by Haemophilus spp. and Veillonella parvula. A group of bacteria was found specifically related to the implants: Actinomyces odontolyticus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, Capnocytophaga sputigena, and Leptotrichia buccalis. Black-pigmented Bacteroides was not found in any of the examined samples. Spirochetes were observed in denture plaque samples and in supragingival plaque of the implants. It is concluded that bacteria known as potential periodontal pathogens colonize the permucosal implants in the first weeks after insertion. The presence of these species seems to be dependent on the ecological factors provided by the artificial gingival crevice of the permucosal implants in the edentulous mouth.
TI  - Coaggregation of oral Bacteroides species with other bacteria: central role in coaggregation bridges and competitions.
AB  - Seventy-three freshly isolated oral strains representing 10 Bacteroides spp. were tested for their ability to coaggregate with other oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. None coaggregated with any of the gram-negative strains tested, which included Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea, C. sputigena, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Strains of Bacteroides buccae, B. melaninogenicus, B. oralis, and B. gingivalis failed to coaggregate with any of the gram-positive strains tested. However, six Bacteroides spp. coaggregated with one or more species of gram-positive bacteria. Most isolates of B. buccalis, B. denticola, B. intermedius, B. loescheii, B. oris, and B. veroralis coaggregated with strains of Actinomyces israelii, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, A. odontolyticus, Rothia dentocariosa, or Streptococcus sanguis. The strongest coaggregations involved B. denticola, B. loescheii, or B. oris; 22 of 25 strains coaggregated with A. israelii. Only B. loescheii interacted with certain strains of S. sanguis; these coaggregations were lactose inhibitable and were like coaggregations between A. viscosus and the same strains of S. sanguis. In fact, B. loescheii and A. viscosus were competitors for binding to S. sanguis. Many bacteroides also acted as coaggregation bridges by mediating coaggregations between two noncoaggregating cell types (e.g., S. sanguis and A. israelii). Evidence for binding-site competition and coaggregation bridging involving noncoaggregating cell types from three different genera provides support for the hypothesis that these intergeneric cell-to-cell interactions have an active role in bacterial colonization of the oral cavity.
TI  - Plasmid content of some oral microorganisms isolated from subgingival plaque.
AB  - Eighty-five strains of bacterial species selected from the predominant cultivable dental plaque flora of patients with different periodontal pathologies were examined for their plasmid content. Microorganisms studied included: Actinomyces viscosus, A. odontolyticus, Bacteroides asaccharolyticus (B. gingivalis), B. melaninogenicus subspecies intermedius, and subspecies melaninogenicus, Capnocytophaga ochracea (B. ochraceus), and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Three B. melaninogenicus isolates showed plasmids of approximately 2.7-2.9 Mdalton (mega-dalton) molecular size. Restriction enzyme digests of the plasmids demonstrated dissimilar patterns when electrophoresed on agarose gels. In other microorganisms, including the Actinomyces species, plasmids were not observed.
