TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from sour congee in inner mongolia of china.
AB  == sour congee is a popular food in the western regions of inner mongolia in china.  it has a complex microbial population, which contributes to its unique flavor and functional properties. in this study, we chose 28 sour congee samples that were collected from different areas in inner mongolia for analysis of the microbial community of lactic acid bacteria (lab) by classical biochemical tests, 16s rrna  gene sequencing, multiplex pcr assay of reca gene and restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis of the tuf gene (encoding elongation factor tu). the results revealed that all the isolates were identified as lactobacillus (l.) paracasei (38 strains), l. fermentum (28 strains), l. plantarum (7 strains), l. brevis (4 strains), l. reuteri (2 strains), l. amylolyticus (1 strain), enterococcus (e.) faecalis (3 strains), e. italicus (2 strains) or lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (1 strain). the predominant lab were l. casei and l. fermentum in sour congee samples. the diversity of lab derived from sour congee could offer useful information for further research on sour congee, and the results demonstrated that the combination of tuf gene and rflp patterns can be considered as a useful tool for differentiation of the l. casei group.

TI  == analysis of bacterial communities of traditional fermented west african cereal foods using culture independent methods.
AB  == in this study, the microbial composition of kunu-zaki and ogi, two popular foods  in nigeria produced after natural, uncontrolled fermentation of cereals, was assessed by culture-independent molecular profiling methods. in particular, pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and construction of 16s rrna gene clone libraries revealed the presence of diverse bacterial communities. dna sequencing of the highly variable v3 region of the 16s rrna genes obtained from pcr-dgge fingerprints identified species related to weissella confusa, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus amylolyticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bacillus spp. and lactococcus lactis spp lactis from food samples obtained from northern and southern geographical locations. a more comprehensive analysis of 272 full-length 16s rrna gene inserts revealed that 70% of them were assigned to the lactobacillaceae family and 19% to the streptococcaceae family. interestingly, sequences associated with a particular food type were also identified. for example, l. plantarum, l. pantheris and l. vaccinostercus were found in ogi but not in kunu-zaki while w. confusa, streptococcus lutetiensis and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus were  found in kunu-zaki but not in ogi. phylotypes corresponding to potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus were also detected highlighting the need for controlled fermentation processes.

TI  == lactobacillus amylolyticus sp. nov., isolated from beer malt and beer wort.
AB  == some of the strains used for the biological acidification in breweries belong to  l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis or l. fermentum.  however, more recent studies showed that most strains isolated are physiologically different from the above mentioned species and were tentatively allocated to lactobacillus amylovorus. genotypic studies of 25 strains exclusively isolated from beer malts and beer worts, showed, that there were differences to the type strain of l. amylovorus concerning dna-dna similarities and the sequences of their 16s and 23s rrna genes. therefore, we propose to combine these strains in a new species of the genus lactobacillus, namely l. amylolyticus. strain dsm 11664 is proposed as the type strain. an rrna targeted oligonucleotide probe was designed that allows a fast and reliable identification of lactobacillus amylolyticus.
