TI  == effects of vanillin, quillaja saponin, and essential oils on in vitro fermentation and protein-degrading microorganisms of the rumen.
AB  == this study investigated the effects of vanillin on methanogenesis and rumen fermentation, and the responses of ruminal protein-degrading bacteria to vanillin (at concentrations of 0, 0.76 and 1.52 g/l), essential oils (clove oil, 1 g/l; origanum oil, 0.50 g/l, and peppermint oil, 1 g/l), and quillaja saponin (at concentration of 0 and 6 g/l) in vitro. methane production, degradabilities of feed substrate, and ammonia concentration decreased linearly with increasing doses of vanillin. concentration of total volatile fatty acids also decreased, whereas proportion of butyrate tended to increase linearly with increasing doses  of vanillin. protozoa population decreased, but abundances of ruminococcus flavefaciens, prevotella bryantii, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, prevotella ruminicola, clostridium aminophilum, and ruminobacter amylophilus increased with  increasing doses of vanillin. origanum and clove oils resulted in lower ammonia concentrations compared to control and peppermint oil. all the tested essential oils decreased abundances of protozoa, selenomonas ruminantium, r. amylophilus, p. ruminicola and p. bryantii, with the largest decrease resulted from origanum oil followed by clove oil and peppermint oil. the abundances of megasphaera elsdenii, c. aminophilum, and clostridium sticklandii were deceased by origanum oil while that of b. fibrisolvens was lowered by both origanum and clove oils. saponin decreased ammonia concentration and protozoal population, but increased the abundances of s. ruminantium, r. amylophilus, p. ruminicola, and p. bryantii, though the magnitude was small (less than one log unit). the results suggest that reduction of ammonia production by vanillin and saponin may not be caused by direct inhibition of major known proteolytic bacteria, and essential oils can have different inhibitory effects on different proteolytic bacteria, resulting in varying reduction in ammonia production.

TI  == rumen microbiome composition determined using two nutritional models of subacute  ruminal acidosis.
AB  == subacute ruminal acidosis (sara) is a metabolic disease in dairy cattle that occurs during early and mid-lactation and has traditionally been characterized by low rumen ph, but lactic acid does not accumulate as in acute lactic acid acidosis. it is hypothesized that factors such as increased gut permeability, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, and inflammatory responses may have a role in the  etiology of sara. however, little is known about the nature of the rumen microbiome during sara. in this study, we analyzed the microbiome of 64 rumen samples taken from eight lactating holstein dairy cattle using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (trflp) of 16s rrna genes and real-time pcr. we used rumen samples from two published experiments in which sara had been  induced with either grain or alfalfa pellets. the results of trflp analysis indicated that the most predominant shift during sara was a decline in gram-negative bacteroidetes organisms. however, the proportion of bacteroidetes organisms was greater in alfalfa pellet-induced sara than in mild or severe grain-induced sara (35.4% versus 26.0% and 16.6%, respectively). this shift was also evident from the real-time pcr data for prevotella albensis, prevotella brevis, and prevotella ruminicola, which are members of the bacteroidetes. the real-time pcr data also indicated that severe grain-induced sara was dominated by streptococcus bovis and escherichia coli, whereas mild grain-induced sara was dominated by megasphaera elsdenii and alfalfa pellet-induced sara was dominated by p. albensis. using discriminant analysis, the severity of sara and degree of inflammation were highly correlated with the abundance of e. coli and not with lipopolysaccharide in the rumen. we thus suspect that e. coli may be a contributing factor in disease onset.

TI  == biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by pure culture ruminal bacteria.
AB  == twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) within 24 h. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, fibrobacter succinogenes, lactobacillus vitulinus, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus caprinus, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with <5% of the original tnt recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. eubacterium ruminantium, lactobacillus ruminis, ruminobacter amylophilus, streptococcus bovis, and wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with 23-60% of the tnt recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. clostridium polysaccharolyticum, megasphaera elsdenii, prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/l tnt. desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, prevotella albensis, and treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the tnt. anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/l tnt. these results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming tnt.

TI  == dominance of prevotella and low abundance of classical ruminal bacterial species  in the bovine rumen revealed by relative quantification real-time pcr.
AB  == relative quantification real-time pcr was used to quantify several bacterial species in ruminal samples from two lactating cows, each sampled 3 h after feeding on two successive days. abundance of each target taxon was calculated as  a fraction of the total 16s rrna gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific and eubacterial domain-level primers. bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of members of the genus prevotella, which comprised 42% to 60% of the bacterial rrna gene copies in the samples. however, only 2% to 4% of the bacterial rrna gene copies were represented by the classical ruminal prevotella species prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola and prevotella brevis. the proportion of rrna gene copies attributable to fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus flavefaciens, selenomonas ruminantium and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were each generally in the 0.5% to 1% range. proportions for ruminobacter amylophilus and eubacterium ruminantium were lower (0.1% to 0.2%), while butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, streptococcus bovis, ruminococcus albus and megasphaera elsdenii were even less abundant, each comprising <0.03% of the bacterial rrna gene copies. the data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the  most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.

TI  == influence of dipeptidyl peptidase inhibitors on growth, peptidase activity, and ammonia production by ruminal microorganisms.
AB  == the aim was to investigate known and potential new inhibitiors of dipeptidyl peptidases (dpp) for their effects on ruminal microorganisms. gly-phe diazomethylketone (gpd), ala-ala chloromethylketone (aac), benserazide (dl-serine 2-(2,3,4- trihydroxybenzyl) hydrazide), and diprotin a (ile-pro-ile) inhibited dpp activities of prevotella albensis, p. ruminicola, p. bryantii, p. brevis, and mixed ruminal microorganisms, though incompletely and, except for diprotin a, without absolute specificity for any of the peptidases. leucine aminopeptidase activity of streptococcus bovis was also inhibited by gpd and benserazide. the inhibitors had no effect on the growth of the bacteria, except for gpd, which inhibited growth of p. albensis when only peptides were available for growth. benserazide had some inhibitory effects on the growth of megasphaera elsdenii and prevotella spp., even in the absence of peptides. the predatory activity of ciliate protozoa on bacteria was unaffected by dpp inhibitors. ammonia production from casein by mixed ruminal microorganisms was inhibited significantly (p < 0.05) by aac (29% inhibition) and benserazide (33%). it was concluded that dpp inhibitors can influence the rate of nh3 production in the rumen and may form the basis for developing protein-sparing feed additives for ruminants.

TI  == microbial monitoring by molecular tools of a two-phase anaerobic bioreactor treating fruit and vegetable wastes.
AB  == microbial consortia in a two-phase, anaerobic bioreactor using a mixture of fruit and vegetable wastes were established. bacterial and archaeal communities obtained by a culture-independent approach based on single strand conformation polymorphism analysis of total 16s rdna showed the adaptation of the microflora to the process parameters. throughout the 90 d of the study, the species composition of the bacterial community changed significantly. bacterial 16s rdna  showed at least 7 different major species with a very prominent one corresponding to a megasphaera elsdenii whereas bacterial 16s rdna of a methanization bioreactor showed 10 different major species. after two weeks, prevotella ruminicola became major and its dominance increased continuously until day 50. after an acid shock at ph 5, the 16s rdna archaeal patterns in the acidogenic reactor showed two major prominent species corresponding to methanosphaera stadtmanii and methanobrevibacter wolinii, a hydrogenotrophic bacterium.

TI  == phytase activity of anaerobic ruminal bacteria.
AB  == phytase catalyses the release of phosphate from phytate (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate), the predominant form of phosphorus in cereal grains, oilseeds  and legumes. the presence of phytase activity was investigated in 334 strains of  22 species of obligately anaerobic ruminal bacteria. measurable activities were demonstrated in strains of selenomonas ruminantium, megasphaera elsdenii, prevotella ruminicola, mitsuokella multiacidus and treponema spp. strains isolated from fermentations with cereal grains proved to have high activity, and  activity was particularly prevalent in s. ruminantium, with over 96% of the tested strains being positive. the measured phytase activity was found exclusively associated with the bacterial cells and was produced in the presence  of approximately 14 mm phosphate. the most highly active strains were all s. ruminantium, with the exception of the one mitsuokella multiacidus strain examined. phytase activity varied greatly among positive strains but activities as high as 703 nmol phosphate released (ml culture)-1 were measured for a s. ruminantium strain and 387 nmol phosphate released (ml culture)-1 for the mitsuokella multiacidus strain.

TI  == inhibition by 1,10-phenanthroline of the breakdown of peptides by rumen bacteria  and protozoa.
AB  == the rate of peptide breakdown in the rumen frequently exceeds the rate at which the amino acids released can be used for microbial growth. the final step in this often wasteful process involves the cleavage of dipeptides. the main rumen bacterial species with high dipeptidase activity, prevotella ruminicola, fibrobacter succinogenes, lachnospira multipara and megasphaera elsdenii, had activities which were inhibited > 95% by 1,10-phenanthroline, a chelator of divalent metal ions and metalloprotease inhibitor. dipeptidase activity in digesta taken from the rumen of sheep decreased by 33% in the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline, while mixed bacteria from the same samples were inhibited by 80% and the activity of mixed protozoa decreased by only 15%. thus a substantial  amount of dipeptide breakdown appears to be due to ciliate protozoa in the mixed  population. extensive washing of the protozoa increased the sensitivity of protozoal dipeptidase activity to 1,10-phenanthroline, suggesting that protozoa too have a metallo-dipeptidase activity but that it is normally protected from inhibition by 1,10-phenanthroline. breakdown of the pentapeptide, ala5, was also  inhibited 27% by 1,10-phenanthroline in the mixed population, and when trypticase, a pancreatic casein hydrolysate containing a mixture of oligopeptides, dipeptides and amino acids, was incubated with rumen fluid, the production of ammonia and free amino groups was inhibited 71% by 1,10-phenanthroline. it was concluded that metal ion chelation inhibits oligopeptidase and dipeptidase activities of rumen micro-organisms and may be a means of controlling ammonia production from peptides in the rumen.

TI  == cyclic amp in ruminal and other anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == an examination of camp levels in predominant species of ruminal bacteria and other anaerobic bacteria was conducted. cellular camp concentrations of glucose-grown cultures of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, prevotella ruminicola d31d, selenomonas ruminantium hd4 and d, megasphaera elsdenii b159, streptococcus bovis jb1, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 5482, and clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 were determined at various times during growth by a competitive binding radioimmunoassay procedure. the results were compared to those for escherichia coli nrrl b3704. the levels of camp ranged from undetectable for b. thetaiotaomicron to approximately 15 pmol/mg cell protein for p. ruminicola d31d. varying the growth substrate in a manner previously shown to elicit regulatory response did not alter the level of camp in these organisms. in general, camp concentrations present in these organisms were much lower than the 6-25 pmol/mg cell protein observed for e. coli. the levels of camp in p. ruminicola were consistently higher than levels in other anaerobes, particularly during the early exponential and stationary phases of growth. based on these data it seems unlikely that camp is involved in regulation of substrate catabolism in the anaerobic bacteria examined except in p. ruminicola where it may have an unknown  regulatory function.
