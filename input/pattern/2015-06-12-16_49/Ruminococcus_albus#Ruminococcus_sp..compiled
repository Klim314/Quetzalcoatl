TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of three Brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. The extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. The propolis extracts inhibited the growth of Fibrobacter succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, Ruminococcus albus 7, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens D1, Prevotella albensis M384, Peptostreptococcus sp. D1, Clostridium aminophilum F and Streptococcus bovis Pearl11, while R. albus 20, Prevotella bryantii B(1)4 and Ruminobacter amylophilus H18 were resistant to all the extracts. The inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (C. aminophilum F and Peptostreptococcus sp. D1) being the most sensitive. Inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. The extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (LLOS C3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. The major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and Artepillin C) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains. Only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.
TI  - Effects of disodium fumarate on ruminal fermentation and microbial communities in sheep fed on high-forage diets.
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate effects of disodium fumarate (DF) on fermentation characteristics and microbial populations in the rumen of Hu sheep fed on high-forage diets. Two complementary feeding trials were conducted. In Trial 1, six Hu sheep fitted with ruminal cannulae were randomly allocated to a 2 x 2 cross-over design involving dietary treatments of either 0 or 20 g DF daily. Total DNA was extracted from the fluid- and solid-associated rumen microbes, respectively. Numbers of 16S rDNA gene copies associated with rumen methanogens and bacteria, and 18S rDNA gene copies associated with rumen protozoa and fungi were measured using real-time PCR, and expressed as proportion of total rumen bacteria 16S rDNA. Ruminal pH decreased in the DF group compared with the control (P < 0.05). Total volatile fatty acids increased (P < 0.001), but butyrate decreased (P < 0.01). Addition of DF inhibited the growth of methanogens, protozoa, fungi and Ruminococcus flavefaciens in fluid samples. Both Ruminococcus albus and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens populations increased (P < 0.001) in particle-associated samples. Trial 2 was conducted to investigate the adaptive response of rumen microbes to DF. Three cannulated sheep were fed on basal diet for 2 weeks and continuously for 4 weeks with supplementation of DF at a level of 20 g/day. Ruminal samples were collected every week to analyze fermentation parameters and microbial populations. No effects of DF were observed on pH, acetate and butyrate (P > 0.05). Populations of methanogens and R. flavefaciens decreased in the fluid samples (P < 0.001), whereas addition of DF stimulated the population of solid-associated Fibrobacter succinogenes. Population of R. albus increased in the 2nd to 4th week in fluid-associated samples and was threefold higher in the 4th week than control week in solid samples. Analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprints revealed that there were significant changes in rumen microbiota after adding DF. Ten of 15 clone sequences from cut-out bands appearing in both the 2nd and the 4th week were 94% to 100% similar to Prevotella-like bacteria, and four sequences showed 95% to 98% similarity to Selenomonas dianae. Another 15 sequences were obtained from bands, which appeared in the 4th week only. Thirteen of these 15 sequences showed 95% to 99% similarity to Clostridium sp., and the other two showed 95% and 100% similarity to Ruminococcus sp. In summary, the microorganisms positively responding to DF addition were the cellulolytic bacteria, R. albus, F. succinogenes and B. fibrisolvens as well as proteolytic bacteria, B. fibrisolvens, P. ruminicola and Clostridium sp.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a ferulic acid esterase (Fae1A) from the rumen  fungus Anaeromyces mucronatus.
AB  - AIMS: A novel ferulic acid esterase gene from rumen fungus Anaeromyces mucronatus was cloned, heteroexpressed in Escherichia coli and characterized. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 30 clones exhibiting activity on alpha-naphthyl acetate (alpha-NA) were isolated from an A. mucronatus YE505 cDNA library. Sequence analysis revealed that these clones represented two esterase-coding sequences. The gene, fae1A, showed highest amino acid sequence identity to CE family 1 esterases from anaerobic micro-organisms such as Orpinomyces sp., Ruminococcus albus and Clostridium thermocellum. The gene comprised 828 nucleotides encoding a polypeptide of 275 amino acids. The coding sequence was cloned into the pET30a expression vector and overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Gene product Fae1A was found to exhibit activity against a number of substrates including naphthyl fatty acid esters, p-nitrophenyl fatty acid esters and hydroxylcinnamic acid esters. CONCLUSIONS: Fae1A exhibited a lower K(m) and higher catalytic efficiency (k(cat) /K(m) ) on ferulic acid esters than on alpha-NA or p-nitrophenyl acetate, suggesting that it has a higher affinity for ethyl and methyl ferulate than for the acetyl esters. It releases ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid from barley straw. Activity of Fae1A was inhibited by the serine-specific protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, indicating that a serine residue plays a role in its activity. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: To our knowledge, this is the first report of characterization of carbohydrate esterase gene from the genus of Anaeromyces.
TI  - Dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  RNA probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and Crohn's disease (CD) patients. METHODS: Oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "GoArray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16S rRNA sequences. Fecal 16S rDNA from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six CD patients were used as template to generate fluorescently labeled cRNA that was hybridized to the microarray. Differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with species-specific primer sets. RESULTS: The microarray analyses showed that Eubacterium rectale, Bacteroides fragilis group, B. vulgatus, Ruminococcus albus, R. callidus, R. bromii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the CD patients, while Enterococcus sp., Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and Listeria sp. were more abundant in the CD group. CONCLUSIONS: The microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum Firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. In addition, the microarray showed that Enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the CD patients. This microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Detection and identification of rumen bacteria constituting a fibrolytic consortium dominated by Fibrobacter succinogenes.
AB  - A fibrolytic consortium, dominated by the rumen cellulolytic bacterium Fibrobacter succinogenes, was artificially constructed on hay stems to detect and identify rumen bacteria that can potentially interact with F. succinogenes. Consortium-bacterial members were determined by DGGE and sequencing analysis targeted bacterial 16S rDNA. An artificial consortium was formed in a 2-step incubation of hay stems; the first step with group 1, 2 or 3 F. succinogenes strains, the second step with rumen fluid. After consortium formation, morphologically different bacteria were observed in association with F. succinogenes. DGGE exhibited more than 30 bands, the pattern of which depended on the F. succinogenes group. Sequencing suggested that Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Clostridium sp., F. succinogenes group 2, Prevotella ruminicola and unclassified Bacteroides were prominent in the group 1 consortium and that Treponema bryantii, B. fibrisolvens, Acinetobacter sp, and Wolinella succinogenes were prominent in the group 2 consortium. However, in the group 3 consortium, F. succinogenes-like bacteria were microscopically undetectable, whereas cellulolytic Ruminococcus albus and F. succinogenes group 1 were prominent, suggesting that the group 3 cannot be a core member of this consortium. This study is the first attempt to identify bacterial members of a fibrolytic consortium dominated by a specific bacterium.
TI  - Description of development of rumen ecosystem by PCR assay in milk-fed, weaned and finished lambs in an intensive fattening system.
AB  - This study examined the reticulo-rumen characteristics of the microbial community and its fermentative characteristics in milk-fed, at weaning and finished lambs in a conventional fattening system. Five lambs were assigned to each of three groups: milk-fed lambs slaughtered at 30 days (T30), weaned lambs slaughtered at 45 days (T45) and 'finished lambs' slaughtered at 90 days (T90). At slaughter, rumen size, fermentation parameters (pH, volatile fatty acids and microbial enzyme activity) and protozoal counts were recorded. Quantitative PCR was used to quantify the genes encoding 16S and 18S ribosomal DNA of the rumen bacterial and protozoal populations, respectively, and the sequential colonization of the rumen by cellulolytic (Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens) and amylolytic (Prevotella ruminicola, Streptococcus bovis) bacteria, and protozoa (Entodinium sp.). Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to study the development of rumen microbiota biodiversity. Intake of solid food before weaning caused a significant increase in rumen weight (p < 0.0001) and bacterial DNA (p < 0.05) and volatile fatty acid analysis concentration (p < 0.01), whereas pH declined. In milk-fed lambs, cellulolytic bacteria were evident after 30 days. Thereafter, in the 45-day and 90-day groups, the proportions of R. flavefaciens decreased and R. albus increased. Amylolytic bacteria were present in milk-fed lambs; the proportion of P. ruminicola increased in fattening lambs and S. bovis was the least abundant species. Protozoal concentrations were irregular; milk-fed lambs had a significant number of protozoa species from Entodinium and subfamily Isotrichiidae, but they disappeared at weaning. Lamb rumen were refaunated in some individuals at 90 days (Entodinium and subfamily Diplodiniinae spp.), although individual concentrations were variable.
TI  - The dynamics of major fibrolytic microbes and enzyme activity in the rumen in response to short- and long-term feeding of Sapindus rarak saponins.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the short- and long-term effects of an extract of Sapindus rarak saponins (SE) on the rumen fibrolytic enzyme activity and the major fibrolytic micro-organisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two feeding trials were conducted. In the short-term trial, four fistulated goats were fed a basal diet containing sugar cane tops and wheat pollard (65:35, w/w) and were supplemented for 7 days with SE at a level of 0.6 g kg(-1) body weight. Rumen liquor was taken before, during and after SE feeding. In the long-term trial, 28 sheep were fed the same basal diet as the goats and were supplemented for 105 days with 0.24, 0.48 and 0.72 g kg(-1) body mass of the extract. Rumen liquor was taken on days 98 and 100. Protozoal numbers were counted under the microscope. Cell wall degradation was determined by enzyme assays and the major fibrolytic micro-organisms were quantified by dot blot hybridization. Sapindus extract significantly depressed rumen xylanase activity in both trials and carboxymethylcellulase activity in the long-term trial (P < 0.01). Fibrobacter sp. were not affected by the SE in both trials, while ruminococci and the anaerobic fungi showed a short-term response to the application of saponins. Protozoal counts were decreased only in the long-term trial with sheep. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that there is an adaptation of Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Chytridiomycetes (fungi) to saponin when fed over a long period. The fact that no correlation between the cell wall degrading enzyme activities and the cell wall degrading micro-organisms was observed suggests that the organisms tracked in this experiment are not the only key players in ruminal cell wall degradation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Sapindus rarak saponins partially defaunate the rumen flora. Their negative effect on cell wall degradation, however, is not related to rumen organisms currently recognized as the major cell wall degrading species. The adaptation of microbes in the long-term feeding experiment suggests that the results from short-term trial on the ruminal microbial community have to be interpreted carefully.
TI  - Naturally occurring DNA transfer system associated with membrane vesicles in cellulolytic Ruminococcus spp. of ruminal origin.
AB  - A genetic transformation system with similarities to those reported for gram-negative bacteria was found to be associated with membrane vesicles of the ruminal cellulolytic genus Ruminococcus. Double-stranded DNA was recovered from the subcellular particulate fraction of all the cellulolytic ruminococci examined. Electron microscopy revealed that the only particles present resembled membrane vesicles. The likelihood that the DNA was associated with membrane vesicles (also known to contain cellulosomes) was further supported by the adherence of the particles associated with the subcellular DNA to cellulose powder added to culture filtrates. The particle-associated DNA comprised a population of linear molecules ranging in size from <20 kb to 49 kb (Ruminococcus sp. strain YE73) and from 23 kb to 90 kb (Ruminococcus albus AR67). Particle-associated DNA from R. albus AR67 represented DNA derived from genomic DNA of the host bacterium having an almost identical HindIII digestion pattern and an identical 16S rRNA gene. Paradoxically, particle-associated DNA was refractory to digestion with EcoRI, while the genomic DNA was susceptible to extensive digestion, suggesting that there is differential restriction modification of genomic DNA and DNA exported from the cell. Transformation using the vesicle-containing fraction of culture supernatant of Ruminococcus sp. strain YE71 was able to restore the ability to degrade crystalline cellulose to two mutants that were otherwise unable to do so. The ability was heritable and transferred to subsequent generations. It appears that membrane-associated transformation plays a role in lateral gene transfer in complex microbial ecosystems, such as the rumen.
TI  - Ethanol production from cellobiose by Zymobacter palmae carrying the Ruminocuccus albus beta-glucosidase gene.
AB  - Its metabolic characteristics suggest Zymobacter palmae gen. nov., sp. nov. could serve as a useful new ethanol-fermenting bacterium, but its biotechnological exploitation would require certain genetic improvements. We therefore established a method for transforming Z. palmae using the broad-host vector plasmids pRK290, pMFY31 and pMFY40 as a source of transforming DNA. Using electroporation, the frequency of transformation was 10(5) to 10(6) transformants/mug of DNA. To confer the ability to ferment cellobiose, which is a hydrolysis product from cellulosic materials treated enzymatically or with acid, the beta-glucosidase gene from Ruminococcus albus was introduced into Z. palmae, where its expression was driven by its endogenous promoter. About 56% of the enzyme expressed was localized on the cell-surface or in the periplasm. The recombinant Z. palmae could ferment 2% cellobiose to ethanol, producing 95% of the theoretical yield with no accumulation of organic acids as metabolic by-products. Thus, expression of beta-glucosidase in Z. palmae expanded the substrate spectrum of the strain, enabling ethanol production from cellulosic materials.
TI  - Albusin B, a bacteriocin from the ruminal bacterium Ruminococcus albus 7 that inhibits growth of Ruminococcus flavefaciens.
AB  - An approximately 32-kDa protein (albusin B) that inhibited growth of Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1 was isolated from culture supernatants of Ruminococcus albus 7. Traditional cloning and gene-walking PCR techniques revealed an open reading frame (albB) encoding a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 32,168 Da. A BLAST search revealed two homologs of AlbB from the unfinished genome of R. albus 8 and moderate similarity to LlpA, a recently described 30-kDa bacteriocin from Pseudomonas sp. strain BW11M1.
TI  - Expression and export of a Ruminococcus albus cellulase in Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens through the use of an alternative gene promoter and signal sequence.
AB  - Ruminococcal cellulase (Ruminococcus albus F-40 endoglucanase EgI) was successfully expressed in Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens OB156C, using the erm promoter from pAMbeta1. A newly identified signal peptide coding region of xynA from B. fibrisolvens 49 allowed efficient translocation of the foreign EgI into the extracellular fraction. First, B. fibrisolvens xynA with or without its own putative signal peptide (XynA SP) coding region was cloned into a shuttle vector to transform B. fibrisolvens OB156C. Both plasmids caused a 2- to 2.4-fold increase in xylanase activity. The transformant expressing XynA with the signal peptide showed a significantly higher proportion of activity in the extracellular fraction than the transformant with XynA lacking the signal peptide (75% vs. 19%), demonstrating the significance of XynA SP in the translocation of the expressed enzyme. Second, using the XynA SP coding region, secretion of EgI was attempted in B. fibrisolvens. Since the signal peptide of R. albus EgI did not function in B. fibrisolvens, it was replaced with the XynA SP. A high activity variant of EgI containing the XynA SP was transcribed using the erm promoter, resulting in a 27-fold increase in endoglucanase activity, most of which (>93%) was in the extracellular fraction of the B. fibrisolvens transformant. EgI without the XynA SP was scarcely detected in the extracellular fraction (<10%).
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel glucocerebrosidase of Paenibacillus sp. TS12.
AB  - We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of a glucocerebrosidase [EC 3.2.1.45] from Paenibacillus sp. TS12. The open reading frame of the glucocerebrosidase gene consisted of 2,493 bp nucleotides and encoded 831 amino acid residues. The enzyme exhibited no sequence similarity with a classical glucocerebrosidase belonging to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 30, but rather showed significant similarity with GH family 3 beta-glucosidases from Clostridium thermocellum, Ruminococcus albus, and Aspergillus aculeateus. The recombinant enzyme, expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, had a molecular weight of 90.7 kDa and hydrolyzed NBD-labeled glucosylceramide, but not galactosylceramide, GM1a or sphingomyelin. The enzyme was most active at pH 6.5, and its apparent Km and Vmax values for NBD-labeled glucosylceramide and p-nitrophenyl-beta-glucopyranoside were 223 microM and 1.60 micromol/min/mg of protein, and 593 microM and 112 micromol/min/mg of protein, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that Asp-223 is an essential amino acid for the catalytic reaction and possibly functions a catalytic nucleophile, as in GH family 3 beta-glucosidases. This is the first report of the molecular cloning and characterization of a glucocerebrosidase from a procaryote.
TI  - Microbial production of hydrogen: an overview.
AB  - Production of hydrogen by anaerobes, facultative anaerobes, aerobes, methylotrophs, and photosynthetic bacteria is possible. Anaerobic Clostridia are potential producers and immobilized C. butyricum produces 2 mol H2/mol glucose at 50% efficiency. Spontaneous production of H2 from formate and glucose by immobilized Escherichia coli showed 100% and 60% efficiencies, respectively. Enterobactericiae produces H2 at similar efficiency from different monosaccharides during growth. Among methylotrophs, methanogenes, rumen bacteria, and thermophilic archae, Ruminococcus albus, is promising (2.37 mol/mol glucose). Immobilized aerobic Bacillus licheniformis optimally produces 0.7 mol H2/mol glucose. Photosynthetic Rhodospirillum rubrum produces 4, 7, and 6 mol of H2 from acetate, succinate, and malate, respectively. Excellent productivity (6.2 mol H2/mol glucose) by co-cultures of Cellulomonas with a hydrogenase uptake (Hup) mutant of R. capsulata on cellulose was found. Cyanobacteria, viz., Anabaena, Synechococcus, and Oscillatoria sp., have been studied for photoproduction of H2. Immobilized A. cylindrica produces H2 (20 ml/g dry wt/h) continually for 1 year. Increased H2 productivity was found for Hup mutant of A. variabilis. Synechococcus sp. has a high potential for H2 production in fermentors and outdoor cultures. Simultaneous productions of oxychemicals and H2 by Klebseilla sp. and by enzymatic methods were also attempted. The fate of H2 biotechnology is presumed to be dictated by the stock of fossil fuel and state of pollution in future.
TI  - Response to various amounts of Aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract on ruminal metabolism in cattle.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine whether Aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract stimulated or inhibited ruminal fermentation when fed at higher than recommended doses (3 g/d). Four dietary treatments of A. oryzae fermentation extract were fed daily to six cows fitted with ruminal cannulas. For each of four periods, bromegrass hay (6% CP) with and without extract was fed for 28 d. Dacron bags containing bromegrass cell walls were ruminally incubated to determine ruminal fiber degradation. The A. oryzae fermentation extract did not affect degradation of cell walls, cellulose, or hemicellulose. Total ruminal anaerobic or cellulolytic bacteria were not different among treatments; neither were the proportions of cellulolytic species, Butyrivibrio sp., Ruminococcus albus, or Ruminococcus flavefaciens. Ruminal ammonia was not different; however, total VFA were higher, and pH tended to be lower, when 27 g/d of A. oryzae fermentation extract was fed. The proportion of VFA was not different among treatments. The A. oryzae fermentation extract fed at nine times the recommended dosage did not produce any stimulatory effects, except for total VFA, and was not inhibitory or toxic to ruminal metabolism and forage fiber degradation.
TI  - Ruminal cellulolytic bacteria and protozoa from bison, cattle-bison hybrids, and  cattle fed three alfalfa-corn diets.
AB  - Ruminal cellulolytic bacteria and protozoa and in vitro digestibility of alfalfa  fiber fractions were compared among bison, bison hybrids, and crossbed cattle (five each) when they were fed alfalfa and corn in a ratio of 100:0, 75:25, and 50:50, respectively. The total number of viable bacteria (2.16 x 10(9) to 5.44 x 10(9)/ml of ruminal fluid) and the number of cellulolytic bacteria (3.74 x 10(7) to 10.9 x 10(7)/ml) were not different among groups of animals fed each diet. The genera of protozoa in all of the animal groups were similar; however, when either the 100:0 or 50:50 diet was used the percentage of Entodinium sp. was lower and the percentage of Diplodiniinae was higher (P less than 0.05) in bison than in bison hybrids or cattle. Bacteroides succinogenes made up the largest number of cellulolytic isolates from bison (58 and 36%, respectively, on the 100:0 and 75:25 diets), which were more numerous (P less than 0.05) than those from bison hybrids (36 and 12%) and cattle (33 and 18%). This was offset by a lower number of cellulolytic Butyrivibrio isolates. The numbers of Ruminococcus albus and R. flavefaciens isolates, in general, were similar among the bovid species, although R. flavefaciens generally made up less than 10% of the cellulolytic isolates. In vitro digestibility coefficients were greater (P less than 0.05) for the bison when the 75:25 diet was used and similar for the other two diets. The concentration of ruminal volatile fatty acids was larger (P less than 0.05) in bison than in bison hybrids and cattle when the 50:50 diet was used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Urease assay and urease-producing species of anaerobes in the bovine rumen and human feces.
AB  - A growth medium and test were developed for rapid detection of urease in fermentative anaerobic bacteria. Using nonselective rumen fluid roll-tube agar medium and the new test, it was confirmed that Peptostreptococcus productus is often the most numerous urease-forming species in human feces. Also, some fecal strains of Ruminococcus albus, Clostridium innocuum, and Clostridium beijerinckii produced urease. Single strains of Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Coprococcus catus, and Streptococcus mitis that were strongly ureolytic on isolation later lost this ability. Urease activity was also detected in many strains of nonselectively isolated rumen species. They include Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, Treponema sp., Ruminococcus bromii (not previously known to be present in the rumen), Butyrivibrio sp., Bifidobacterium sp., Bacteroides ruminicola, and P. productus. Most P. productus strains contain urease; however, the uniformity of this feature in the other species noted above is not known. The urease in many of these species was not detected if the growth medium contained 0.2% or more (each) yeast extract and Trypticase.
TI  - Fermentation of isolated pectin and pectin from intact forages by pure cultures of rumen bacteria.
AB  - Studies on the rate and extent of galacturonic acid and isolated pectin digestion were carried out with nine strains of rumen bacteria (Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens H10b and D16f, Bacteroides ruminicola 23 and D31d, Lachnospira multiparus D15d, Peptostreptococcus sp. D43e, B. succinogenes A3c, Ruminococcus flavefaciens B34b, and R. albus 7). Only three strains, 23, D16f, and D31d, utilized galacturonic acid as a sole energy source, whereas all strains except A3c and H10b degraded (solubilized) and utilized purified pectin. Nutrient composition of the basal medium and separate sterilization of the substrate affected the rate and extent of fermentation for both substrates. Pectin degradation and utilization were measured with two maturity stages each of intact bromegrass and alfalfa. For bromegrass I, all strains tested (B34b, 23, D16f, D31d, D15d, and D43e) degraded a considerable amount of pectin and, with the exception of B34b, utilized most of what was degraded. Similar, but lower, results were obtained with bromegrass II, except for the two strains of B. ruminicola, 23 and D31d, which were unable to degrade and utilize pectin from this forage. All strains were able to degrade and utilize pectin from both maturity stages of alfalfa; however, values were considerably lower for strains 23 and D31d. Synergism studies, in which a limited utilizing strain, B34b, was combined with the limited degrading strain, D31d, resulted in a slight increase in degradation and a very marked increase in utilization of the pectin in all four forages. Similar results were obtained on both alfalfa substrates with a combination of strains B34b and D16f; however, no increases were observed with this combination on bromegrass.
