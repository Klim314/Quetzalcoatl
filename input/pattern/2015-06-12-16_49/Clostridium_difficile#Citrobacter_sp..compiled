TI  - Comparative analysis of fecal microflora of healthy full-term Indian infants born with different methods of delivery (vaginal vs cesarean): Acinetobacter sp. prevalence in vaginally born infants.
AB  - In this study fecal microflora of human infants born through vaginal delivery (VB) and through cesarean section (CB) were investigated using culture-independent 16S rDNA cloning and sequencing approach. The results obtained clearly revealed that fecal microbiota of VB infants distinctly differ from those in their counterpart CB infants. The intestinal microbiota of infants delivered by cesarean section appears to be more diverse, in terms of bacteria species, than the microbiota of vaginally delivered infants. The most abundant bacterial species present in VB infants were Acinetobacter sp., Bifidobacterium sp. and Staphylococcus sp. However, CB infant's fecal microbiota was dominated with Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli and Clostridium difficile. The intestinal microbiota of cesarean section delivered infants in this study was also characterized by an absence of Bifidobacteria species. An interesting finding of our study was recovery of large number of Acinetobacter sp. consisting of Acinetobacter pittii (former Acinetobacter genomic species 3), Acinetobacter junii and Acinetobacter baumannii in the VB infants clone library. Among these, Acinetobacter baumannii is a known nosocomial pathogen and Acinetobacter pittii (genomic species 3) is recently recognized as clinically important taxa within the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii (ACB) complex. Although none of the infants had shown any sign of clinical symptoms of disease, this observation warrants a closer look.
TI  - Molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  - The complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. However, studies on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. To clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16S rDNA sequences from the DNA isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16S rDNA libraries were constructed with the amplicons of PCR conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. Nine independent libraries were produced by the application of three sets of primers (set A, set B, and set C) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. Approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. The library clone with set A universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. Thus, set A primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. On the first day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, and Streptococcus mitis were present. The largest taxonomic group was L. lactis. On the third day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, S. mitis, and Streptococcus salivarius were present. On the sixth day of the life of the infant, Citrobacter, Clostridium difficile, Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter cloacae, and E. coli were present. The largest taxonomic group was E. coli. These results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after the third day.
TI  - [Effect of rokitamycin on bacterial flora in human feces].
AB  - Rokitamycin, a newly developed macrolide antibiotic was orally administered to 7  healthy male volunteers (22-25 years) for 7 consecutive days to study changes in bacterial flora and concentrations of the drug in feces, and to observe adverse reactions and laboratory test parameters. A dose of 200 mg (2 tablets: 100 mg/tablet) was given 3 times daily before meals and the fecal studies were done on the 5 days before administration (adm.) [b.a.], at the time of administration (0), and the 3rd, 5th, 7th (the final day of treatment) days during adm. [u.a.] and the 3rd, 5th, 10th, 20th, 30th days after adm. [a.a.]. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Obvious changes in mean populations of total aerobes and enterobacteriaceae were not found. In changes of each bacteria of enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli was not observed in cases from initial day of treatment to the 3rd day a.a. Cases from which Citrobacter sp. was isolated tended to increase after 3 days u.a. and gradually decrease after 3 days a.a. Among Gram-negative bacilli, cases where isolation of Pseudomonas sp. was observed increased temporarily on the 3rd u.a., Gram-positive cocci did not show particular patterns of changes. No changes in mean count of total anaerobes were observed during the course of the experiment. Among individual anaerobes, numbers of Lactobacillus and Peptococcaceae decreased slightly from the 3rd day u.a. and returned on the 5th day a.a. 2. Clostridium difficile D-1 toxin was detected in feces at amounts approximately 500 ng/g in 2 cases each on 20th and 30th day a.a., with 1 incidence occurring in the same person on the 2 separate days. 3. The drug was detected in all 7 cases on the 3rd, 5th and 7th days u.a., and in 1 cases each on the 5th and the 30th day a.a. The mean peak level was 315.5 micrograms/g on the 7th day u.a. The reason for the detection of the drug in feces in 1 case on the 30th day a.a. at a value of 5.90 micrograms/g was not clear. 4. Adverse reactions and abnormal laboratory test results due to this drug were not observed in any cases.
