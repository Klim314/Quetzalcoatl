TI  - [Characterization and distribution of Citrobacter species in a university hospital].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: [corrected] a) To identify Citrobacter strains following the conventional biochemical reaction of Brenner and col; b) to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the O'Hara's method compared with Brenner's method, and c) to determine the rate and distribution of the strains in the clinical isolates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty two clinical isolates, characterized as Citrobacter spp. were collected between May of 1994 and August of 1997. Clinical isolates included inpatients and outpatients from Hospital de Clinicas. Strains were identified following the methods of Brenner and O'Hara. RESULTS: Methods of Brenner identified 111 of 122 strains: C. freundii 59 of 111; C. koseri 18 of 111; C. werkmanii 15 of 111; C. braakii 9 of 111; C. youngae 6 of 111 and C. amalonaticus 4 of 111. O'Hara's methods identified 104 of 111 strains (94%). C. freundii was recovered most frequently from urine and feces (p Fisher < 0.026 and 0.039 respectively), while C. koseri was isolated from urine principally (p Fisher < 0.0372). CONCLUSIONS: The genus Citrobacter is an important opportunistic pathogen that can be identified in clinical microbiology laboratories using O'Hara's method.
TI  - [Identification of Citrobacter species and their occurrence in raw products and foods].
AB  - Fifty-nine strains of bacteria were tested in study that were isolated from raw materials and foods (raw milk, farm milking parlors, sausage meat, raw potatoes, cheese, frozen oven-ready foods, confectionery products, cold dishes), and they were included in the genus Citrobacter using a commercial diagnostic kit ENTEROtest 16 (Lachema a.s., Brno), numeric identification program TNW (Czech Collection of Microorganisms, Faculty of Science of Masaryk University at Brno) and identification key (O'Hara et al., 1995). The results of the ENTEROtest itself, including OXI and ONPtests, did not provide satisfactory discrimination of detected strains to the level of species since 64.4% were identified by the genus by TNW program or designated as intermediary strains. Correct species identification was obtained in 33.9% only (Tab. I). Five next conventional tests (dulcitol, alpha-methyl-glucoside, raffinose, melibiose, arginine dihydrolase) were used and their results successfully specified 94.9% tested strains to the species level (Tab. I). A dichotomic identification key (O'Hara et al., 1995) enabled to classify the strains on the basis of the results of ENTEROtest 16 and two conventional tests (dulcitol, melibiosis) relatively easily, and it can be recommended for routine identification of typical Citrobacters from foods. Only ten strains were classified in a wrong way (16.9%) due to false results in ENTEROtest (Tab. II). Tab. III shows the strains classified wrongly by both identifications systems. The tested set contained Citrobacter braakii in a majority of cases (30 strains), followed by C. freundii (17 strains), C. youngae (6 strains), 2 strains of genomospecies 10 and one strain of C. koseri, C. amalonaticus and C farmeri. Tab. IV shows the presence of Citrobacter species in the particular raw materials and foods. The most frequently present species in raw materials: C. braakii (26 strains, 68.4%), C. freundii (3 strains, 7.9%) and C. youngae (3 strains, 7.9%). Foods contained these three species only: C. freundii (14 strains, 66.7%), C. braakii (4 strains, 19.0%) and C. youngae (3 strains, 14.3%). The percentage of the three most frequently present species in raw materials is substantially different from their percentage in foods (Fig. 1). The higher percentage of C. freundii presence in foods can be ascribed to secondary contamination.
TI  - Taxonomic diversity of anaerobic glycerol dissimilation in the Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - A total of 1,123 strains representing 128 taxa in the Enterobacteriaceae (named species or subspecies and genomic species) were screened for the presence of glycerol dehydrogenases and 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase. Only eight taxa, Citrobacter freundii sensu stricto, C. youngae, C. braakii, C. werkmanii, Citrobacter genomospecies 10 and 11, Enterobacter gergoviae and Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae could grow fermentatively on glycerol and possessed both glycerol dehydrogenase type I (induced by glycerol and dihydroxyacetone) and 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase which are typical enzymes of the anaerobic glycerol dissimilation pathway. Six other species, C. koseri, E. aerogenes, E. intermedium, K. oxytoca, K. planticola and K. terrigena could not grow fermentatively on glycerol and possessed a glycerol dehydrogenase type I but no 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase. Other glycerol dehydrogenases types were found: type II (induced by glycerol and hydroxyacetone), type III (induced by glycerol only) and type IV (induced by hydroxyacetone only). They were widely distributed among the Enterobacteriaceae. Classification and identification may take advantage of tests exploring the dissimilation of glycerol.
TI  - Ability of commercial identification systems to identify newly recognized species of Citrobacter.
AB  - The genus Citrobacter was recently determined to contain 11 genetically distinct  species. In addition, the International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology no longer recognizes C. diversus and has, instead, validated the name C. koseri in its place. The 11 species are C. freundii, C. koseri, C. amalonaticus, C. farmeri, C. youngae, C. braakii, C. werkmanii, C. sedlakii, and three unnamed groups, genomospecies 9, 10, and 11. To determine the ease with which some identification systems could respond to these changes, we evaluated five systems for their potential ability to recognize current species in the genus Citrobacter. A simple dichotomous key using conventional biochemicals is presented that may be helpful to presumptively identify Citrobacter strains.
TI  - Biochemical identification of citrobacteria in the clinical laboratory.
AB  - We biochemically identified 235 Citrobacter strains to the species level on the basis of the recently proposed taxonomic changes of Brenner et al. (D. J. Brenner, P. A. D. Grimont, A. G. Steigerwalt, G. R. Fanning, E. Ageron, and C. F. Riddle, Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 43:645-658, 1993). Citrobacter isolates were initially identified as C. koseri or as members of the C. freundii complex or C. amalonaticus group on the basis of indole production, formation of H2S, malonate utilization, and acid production from D-arabitol and adonitol. On the basis of the results of these tests, 68% of the Citrobacter strains were identified as members of the C. freundii complex, 25% were C. koseri, and 8% were members of the C. amalonaticus group. By using a 15-test system recently proposed by Brenner et al. (D. J. Brenner, P. A. D. Grimont, A. G. Steigerwalt, G. R. Fanning, E. Ageron, and C. F. Riddle, Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 43:645-658, 1993) to help identify new species in the C. freundii complex and C. amalonaticus group, 81% of the C. freundii complex strains and 100% of the C. amalonaticus strains could be definitively assigned to one of the previously established or recently designated species or hybridization groups of the genus Citrobacter. Within the C. freundii complex, C. freundii predominated overall (37%), followed by C. youngae (24%), C. braakii (13%), and C. werkmanii (6%). Only one strain each of C. sedlakii and Citrobacter DNA group 11 was identified in this study. Among C. amalonaticus complex members, all were identified as C. amalonaticus with the singular exception of one fecal isolate of C. farmeri. C. freundii and C. koseri were the two Citrobacter species most commonly (80 of 93 [86%]) isolated from extraintestinal sources (genitourinary tract, wounds, blood).
TI  - Classification of citrobacteria by DNA hybridization: designation of Citrobacter  farmeri sp. nov., Citrobacter youngae sp. nov., Citrobacter braakii sp. nov., Citrobacter werkmanii sp. nov., Citrobacter sedlakii sp. nov., and three unnamed Citrobacter genomospecies.
AB  - DNA relatedness studies (hydroxyapatite method) were done on 112 strains of citrobacteria. By using the recommended definition of a genomospecies 11 genomospecies were identified in the genus Citrobacter. These genomospecies were separable by their biochemical profiles. Citrobacter koseri (Citrobacter diversus) and Citrobacter amalonaticus proved to be homogeneous species, as previously described. C. amalonaticus biogroup 1, as described by Farmer et al. (J. Clin. Microbiol. 21:46-76, 1985), was shown to be a separate homogeneous species, which was named Citrobacter farmeri sp. nov. The Citrobacter freundii complex was quite heterogeneous. C. freundii sensu stricto, as represented by the type strain, contained only 9 of 66 strains in this complex. The remaining 57 strains were members of seven genomospecies. Genomospecies 5, containing 21 strains, was named Citrobacter youngae sp. nov. Genomospecies 6, containing 15 strains, was named Citrobacter braakii sp. nov. Genomospecies 7 and 8, each containing six strains, were named Citrobacter werkmanii sp. nov. and Citrobacter sedlakii sp. nov., respectively. Genomospecies 9, 10, and 11, each containing three strains, were not named.
