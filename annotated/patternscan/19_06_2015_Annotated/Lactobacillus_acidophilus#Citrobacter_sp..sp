TI  == microbiological quality of sous and tamarind, traditional drinks consumed in jordan.
AB  == this study was conducted to evaluate the microbiological quality of sous (a drink prepared by extracting dried roots of glycyrrhiza glabra) and tamarind (a drink prepared by infusing tamarindus indica dried pulp), traditional drinks consumed in jordan. twenty-one samples of sous and 44 samples of tamarind were collected from the local market in amman, jordan. water is the major component of the drinks. sous drink is characterized by having an alkaline ph (range, 6.6 to 9.9;  mean, 8.6), whereas tamarind drink has an acidic ph (range, 1.8 to 3.7; mean, 2.8). the drinks are not processed for safety before serving, and at some vendors drinks are not properly refrigerated. the mean counts for aerobic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria, and yeasts in sous drink samples were 5.9, 5.0, and 3.8 log cfu/ml, respectively; those in tamarind drink samples were 4.0, <1, and 5.8 log cfu/ml, respectively. the lactic acid bacteria isolated were enterococcus raffinosus, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus durans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus buchneri. the yeast isolates in sous drink were from the genera candida, filobasidium, hanseniaspora, lodderomyces, pichia, and williopsis, and those in tamarind drink were from arthroascus, brettanomyces, candida, debaromyces, filobasidiella, hanseniaspora, klavispora, lodderomyces, pichia, saccharomycodes, trichosporon, and zygosaccharomyces. enterobacteriaceae were detected in two sous samples and were identified as enterobacter sakazakii and erwinia sp., and in two tamarind samples and were identified as citrobacter freundii and klebsiella pneumoniae. salmonella was detected in one sous and one tamarind sample. pseudomonas aeruginosa was detected in only one sous sample. these findings highlight the importance of application of hygienic practices throughout preparation and vending of drinks, starting with raw ingredients and continuing through preparation, storage, display, and serving.
