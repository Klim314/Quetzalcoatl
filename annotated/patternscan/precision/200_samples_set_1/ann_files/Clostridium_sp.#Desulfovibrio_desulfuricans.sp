TI  == modeling reduction of uranium u(vi) under variable sulfate concentrations by sulfate-reducing bacteria.
AB  == the kinetics for the reduction of sulfate alone and for concurrent uranium [u(vi)] and sulfate reduction, by mixed and pure cultures of sulfate-reducing bacteria (srb) at 21 +/- 3 degrees c were studied. the mixed culture contained the srb desulfovibrio vulgaris along with a clostridium sp. determined via 16s ribosomal dna analysis. the pure culture was desulfovibrio desulfuricans (atcc 7757). a zero-order model best fit the data for the reduction of sulfate from 0.1 to 10 mm. a lag time occurred below cell concentrations of 0.1 mg (dry weight) of cells/ml. for the mixed culture, average values for the maximum specific reaction rate, v(max), ranged from 2.4 +/- 0.2 micromol of sulfate/mg (dry weight) of srb. h(-1)) at 0.25 mm sulfate to 5.0 +/- 1.1 micromol of sulfate/mg (dry weight) of srb. h(-1) at 10 mm sulfate (average cell concentration, 0.52 mg [dry weight]/ml). for the pure culture, v(max) was 1.6 +/- 0.2 micromol of sulfate/mg  (dry weight) of srb. h(-1) at 1 mm sulfate (0.29 mg [dry weight] of cells/ml). when both electron acceptors were present, sulfate reduction remained zero order  for both cultures, while uranium reduction was first order, with rate constants of 0.071 +/- 0.003 mg (dry weight) of cells/ml. min(-1) for the mixed culture and 0.137 +/- 0.016 mg (dry weight) of cells/ml. min(-1) (u(0) = 1 mm) for the d. desulfuricans culture. both cultures exhibited a faster rate of uranium reduction in the presence of sulfate and no lag time until the onset of u reduction in contrast to u alone. this kinetics information can be used to design an srb-dominated biotreatment scheme for the removal of u(vi) from an aqueous source.

TI  == evidence for the bacterial origin of genes encoding fermentation enzymes of the amitochondriate protozoan parasite entamoeba histolytica.
AB  == entamoeba histolytica is an amitochondriate protozoan parasite with numerous bacterium-like fermentation enzymes including the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (por), ferredoxin (fd), and alcohol dehydrogenase e (adhe). the goal of this study was to determine whether the genes encoding these cytosolic e. histolytica fermentation enzymes might derive from a bacterium by horizontal transfer, as has previously been suggested for e. histolytica genes encoding heat shock protein 60, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase. in this study, the e. histolytica por gene and the adhe gene of a second amitochondriate protozoan parasite, giardia lamblia, were sequenced, and their phylogenetic positions were estimated in relation to por, adhe, and fd cloned from eukaryotic and eubacterial organisms. the e. histolytica por gene encodes a 1,620-amino-acid peptide that contained conserved iron-sulfur- and thiamine pyrophosphate-binding sites. the predicted e. histolytica por showed fewer positional identities to the por of g. lamblia (34%) than to the por of the enterobacterium klebsiella pneumoniae (49%), the cyanobacterium anabaena sp. (44%), and the protozoan trichomonas vaginalis (46%), which targets its por to anaerobic organelles called hydrogenosomes. maximum-likelihood, neighbor-joining, and parsimony analyses also suggested as less likely e. histolytica por sharing more recent common ancestry with g. lamblia por than with por of bacteria and the t. vaginalis hydrogenosome. the g. lamblia adhe encodes an 888-amino-acid fusion  peptide with an aldehyde dehydrogenase at its amino half and an iron-dependent (class 3) adh at its carboxy half. the predicted g. lamblia adhe showed extensive positional identities to adhe of escherichia coli (49%), clostridium acetobutylicum (44%), and e. histolytica (43%) and lesser identities to the class 3 adh of eubacteria and yeast (19 to 36%). phylogenetic analyses inferred a closer relationship of the e. histolytica adhe to bacterial adhe than to the g. lamblia adhe. the 6-kda fd of e. histolytica and g. lamblia were most similar to  those of the archaebacterium methanosarcina barkeri and the delta-purple bacterium desulfovibrio desulfuricans, respectively, while the 12-kda fd of the t. vaginalis hydrogenosome was most similar to the 12-kda fd of gamma-purple bacterium pseudomonas putida. e. histolytica genes (and probably g. lamblia genes) encoding fermentation enzymes therefore likely derive from bacteria by horizontal transfer, although it is not clear from which bacteria these amebic genes derive. these are the first nonorganellar fermentation enzymes of eukaryotes implicated to have derived from bacteria.
