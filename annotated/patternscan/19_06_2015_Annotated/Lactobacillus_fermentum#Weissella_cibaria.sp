TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characterization of some lactic acid bacteria isolated from bee pollen: a preliminary study.
AB  == in the present work, five hundred and sixty-seven isolates of lactic acid bacteria were recovered from raw bee pollen grains. all isolates were screened for their antagonistic activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. neutralized supernatants of 54 lactic acid bacteria (lab) cultures from 216 active isolates inhibited the growth of indicator bacteria. they were phenotypically characterized, based on the fermentation of 39 carbohydrates. using the simple matching coefficient and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages (upgma), seven clusters with other two members were defined at the 79% similarity level. the following species were characterized: lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus acidilactici, pediococcus pentosaceus, and unidentified lactobacilli. phenotypic characteristics of major and minor clusters were also identified. partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene of representative isolates from each cluster was performed, and ten strains were assigned to seven species:  lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus ingluviei, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus acidipiscis and weissella cibaria. the molecular method used failed to determine the exact taxonomic status of bh0900 and ah3133.

TI  == use of sourdough fermentation and mixture of wheat, chickpea, lentil and bean flours for enhancing the nutritional, texture and sensory characteristics of white bread.
AB  == this study aimed at investigating the addition of legume (chickpea, lentil and bean) flours to wheat flour bread. type i sourdough containing legumes or wheat-legume flours were prepared and propagated (back slopped) in laboratory, according to traditional protocols that are routinely used for making typical italian breads. based on kinetic of acidification and culture-dependent data, the wheat-legume sourdough was further characterized and selected for bread making. as determined by rapd-pcr and partial sequencing of 16s rdna gene analyses, lactic acid bacteria in wheat-legume sourdough included lactobacillus plantarum,  lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus fermentum, weissella cibaria, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus coryneformis, lactobacillus rossiae, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus paraplantarum. two breads containing 15% (w/w) of legume (chickpea, lentil and bean) flours were produced using selected wheat-legume sourdough (wlsb) and traditional wheat sourdough (wsb). compared to wheat yeasted bread (wyb), the level of total free amino acids (faa) was higher in wsb and wlsb. phytase and antioxidant activities were the highest in wlsb. compared to bread wyb, the addition of legume flours decreased the in vitro protein digestibility (ivpd) (wyb versus wsb). however, the dough fermentation with wslb favored an increase of ivpd. according to the levels of carbohydrates, dietary fibers and resistant starch, wsb and wlsb showed lower values of hydrolysis index (hi) compared to wyb. as showed by texture and image analyses and sensory evaluation of breads, a good acceptability was found for wsb and, especially, wlsb breads.

TI  == characterization of glucansucrase and dextran from weissella sp. tn610 with potential as safe food additives.
AB  == pear-derived weissella sp. tn610 produced extracellular glycosyltransferase activity responsible for the synthesis of soluble exopolysaccharide from sucrose. acid and dextranase-catalyzed hydrolysis revealed that the synthesized polymer was a glucan. according to (1)h and (13)c nmr analysis, the glucan produced by tn610 was a linear dextran made of 96% alpha-(1-->6) and 4% alpha-(1-->3) linkages. zymogram analysis confirmed the presence of a unique glucansucrase of approximately 180 kda in the cell-free supernatant from tn610. the crude enzyme,  optimally active at 37 degrees c and ph 5, has promising potential for application as a food additive since it catalyzes dextran synthesis in sucrose-supplemented milk, allowing its solidification. a 4257-bp product corresponding to the mature glucansucrase gene was amplified by pcr from tn610. it encoded a polypeptide of 1418 residues having a calculated molecular mass of 156.089 kda and exhibiting 96% and 95% identity with glucansucrases from lactobacillus fermentum kg3 and weissella cibaria cmu, respectively.

TI  == monitoring of the microbial communities involved in the soy sauce manufacturing process by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == soy sauce is a traditional seasoning produced through the fermentation of soybeans and wheat using microbes. in this study, the microbial communities involved in the soy sauce manufacturing process were analyzed by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). the bacterial dgge profile indicated that the bacterial microbes in the koji were weissella cibaria (weissella confusa, weissella kimchii, weissella salipiscis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus iners, or streptococcus thermophilus), staphylococcus gallinarum (or staphylococcus xylosus), and staphylococcus kloosii. in addition to these bacteria, tetragenococcus halophilus was also detected in the mash during lactic acid fermentation. the fungal dgge profile indicated that the fungal microbes in the koji were not only aspergillus oryzae but also several yeasts. in the mash, zygosaccharomyces rouxii appeared in the early fermentation stage, candida etchellsii (or candida nodaensis) and candida versatilis were detected at the middle fermentation stage, and candida etchellsii was detected at the mature fermentation stage. these results suggest that the microbial communities present during the soy sauce manufacturing process change drastically throughout its production. this is the first report to reveal the microbial communities involved in the soy sauce manufacturing process using a culture-independent method.

TI  == assessment of bacterial diversity in selected philippine fermented food products  through pcr-dgge.
AB  == the bacterial population in several philippine fermented food preparations was assessed by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) of the 16s rrna gene (16s rdna). genomic dna was isolated directly from alamang (fermented shrimp paste), burong isda (fermented fish and rice), burong hipon (fermented shrimp and rice), burong mustasa (fermented mustard leaves), tuba (sugar cane wine), suka (vinegar) and sinamak (spiced vinegar) using one of two protocols, namely - mobio dna extraction kit procedure and a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-based method. samples recalcitrant to both methods underwent enrichment in three culture broths prior to dna isolation. isolated dna was amplified using  nested primer pairs targeting the bacterial 16s rdna. pcr products were subjected to dgge to elucidate the bacterial diversity in each fermented food. 16s rdna sequence analyses revealed that lactic acid bacteria (lab) and acetic acid bacteria (aab) were dominant in the food samples. the lab identified were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus panis, lactobacillus pontis and weissella cibaria. identified aab were acetobacter pomorum, acetobacter ghanensis, acetobacter orientalis, and acetobacter pasteurianus. among these, l. fermentum, l. plantarum and w. cibaria are established probiotic bacteria, while l. panis and l. pontis are potential probiotic bacteria. this finding would increase the appeal and significance of local fermented foods to consumers. furthermore, the majority of the identified bacteria in the study have not been reported before in culture-dependent studies  of similar food preparations. as such, some of the bacterial 16s rdna obtained were cloned to have an initial partial bacterial 16s rdna library for philippine  fermented foods.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == diversity and dynamics of bacterial populations during spontaneous sorghum fermentations used to produce ting, a south african food.
AB  == ting is a spontaneously fermented sorghum food that is popular for its sour taste and unique flavour. insight of the microbial diversity and population dynamics during sorghum fermentations is an essential component of the development of starter cultures for commercial production of ting. in this study, bacterial populations associated with spontaneous sorghum fermentations were examined using a culture-independent strategy based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequence analysis of v3-16s rrna gene amplicons, and a culture-dependent strategy using conventional isolation based on culturing followed by 16s rrna and/or phes gene sequence analysis. the entire fermentation process was monitored over a 54 h period and two phases were observed with respect to ph evolution and  microbial succession. the first phase of the process (0-6h) was characterized by  relatively high ph conditions and the presence of enterococcus mundtii, albeit that this species was only detected with the culture-dependent approach. the second phase of the fermentation process (12-54 h) was characterized by increased acidity and the predominance of a broader range of lactic acid bacteria, including lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, weissella cibaria, enterococcus faecalis, and a close relative of lactobacillus curvatus, as well as some members of the enterobacteriaceae family. the lb. curvatus-like species was only detected with pcr-dgge, while the majority of the other species was only detected using the culture-dependent approach. these findings highlighted the fact that a combination of both approaches was essential in revealing the microbial diversity and dynamics during spontaneous sorghum fermentations.

TI  == characterization of dextran-producing weissella strains isolated from sourdoughs  and evidence of constitutive dextransucrase expression.
AB  == the study of exopolysaccharide production by heterofermentative sourdough lactic  acid bacteria has shown that weissella strains isolated from sourdoughs produce linear dextrans containing alpha-(1-->6) glucose residues with few alpha-(1-->3)  linkages from sucrose. in this study, several dextran-producing strains, weissella cibaria and weissella confusa, isolated from sourdough, were characterized according to carbohydrate fermentation, repetitive element-pcr fingerprinting using (gtg)(5) primers and glucansucrase activity (soluble or cell-associated). this study reports, for the first time, the characterization of dextransucrase from weissella strains using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and in situ polymer production (after incubation with sucrose) from enzymatic fractions harvested from both sucrose and glucose culture media. results demonstrate that dextransucrase activity was mainly soluble and associated with a constitutive 180-kda protein. in addition, microsequencing of the active dextransucrase from w. cibaria lbae-k39 allowed the design of specific primers that could detect the presence of glucansucrase encoding genes similar to gtfkg3 of lactobacillus fermentum kg3 and to dsrwc of w. cibaria cmu. this study  hence indicates that sourdough weissella strains synthesize original dextransucrase.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria associated with the production of plaa-som, a traditional fermented fish product of thailand.
AB  == plaa-som is a thai fermented fish product for which whole fish or fish fillets are fermented with either cooked rice or steamed sticky rice, salt, and garlic. a total of 762 lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated during plaa-som fermentation by culture on caco(3)-mrs agar plates. they were screened and grouped by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra), giving six groups that were identified by ribosomal dna sequencing as lactococcus garvieae,  streptococcus bovis, weissella cibaria, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus fermentum. freshly mixed ingredients contained low populations of lab (less than 10 cfu/g) that subsequently grew during fermentation to final populations of approximately 10(7)cfu/g. early stages of the process were dominated by the presence of lc. garvieae, s. bovis, and w. cibaria. at 48 h into fermentation, w. cibaria, p. pentosaceus, and lb. plantarum were prevalent, and gave way to a dominance of lb. plantarum that completed the fermentation. a mixture of these lab species could be considered as species for development of a starter culture for plaa-som fermentation.

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria from indonesia reveals glucansucrase and fructansucrase genes in two different weissella confusa strains from soya.
AB  == homopolysaccharide (glucan and fructan) synthesis from sucrose by sucrase enzymes in lactic acid bacteria (lab) has been well studied in the genera leuconostoc, streptococcus and lactobacillus. this study aimed to identify and characterize genes encoding glucansucrase/glucosyltransferase (gtf) and fructansucrases/fructosyltransferase (ftf) enzymes from genomic dna of 'rare' indonesian exopolysaccharide-producing lab. from a total of 63 exopolysaccharide-producing lab isolates obtained from foods, beverages and environmental samples, 18 isolates showing the most slimy and mucoid colony morphologies on sucrose were chosen for further study. by comparing bacterial growth on de man, rogosa and sharpe (mrs)-sucrose with that on mrs-raffinose, and using the results of a previous pcr screening study with degenerate primer pairs  targeting the conserved catalytic domain of gtfs, various strains were identified as producers of fructan (13), of glucan only (five) or as potential producers of  both glucan and fructan (nine). here, we report the characteristics of three gtf  genes and one ftf gene obtained from weissella confusa strains mbf8-1 and mbf8-2. strain mbf8-1 harbored two putative gtf genes with high sequence similarity to gtfb of lactobacillus reuteri 121 and gtf180 of l. reuteri 180, respectively. strain mbf8-2 possessed single gtf and ftf genes with high sequence similarity to gtfkg3 of lactobacillus fermentum kg3 and dsrwc of weissella cibaria, and ftf levansucrase of l. reuteri 121, respectively.

TI  == molecular characterization and expression analysis of the glucansucrase dsrwc from weissella cibaria synthesizing a alpha(1-->6) glucan.
AB  == weissella cibaria isolated from human saliva produces a soluble glucan that predominantly has alpha-1,6-glucosidic type linkages. using degenerated primers that were selected based on the amino acid sequences of conserved regions from known glucansucrases, a single 2.7-kb fragment was isolated. in subsequent steps, a 4969-bp product was obtained using inverse pcr. the coding region for the glucansucrase gene (dsrwc) consisted of a 4419-bp orf that encoded a 1472-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 161.998 da. the produced dsrwc glucansucrases exhibited similarity with the enzymes of the glucosylhydrolase family 70, which includes the lactobacillus fermentum glucansucrase. the expressed recombinant dsrwc (rdsrwc) synthesized oligosaccharides in the presence of maltose or isomaltose as an acceptor and the synthesized products included alpha-1,6-linked glucosyl residues in addition to the maltosyl or isomaltosyl residue. rdsrwc synthesized water-soluble polymers using sucrose as substrate. according to the (13)c-nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, the polymer that was  synthesized by rdsrwc was a linear dextran, which formed predominately alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkages. this is the first report on the molecular characterization of glucansucrase from a w. cibaria strain.

TI  == characterisation and biochemical properties of predominant lactic acid bacteria from fermenting cassava for selection as starter cultures.
AB  == a total of 375 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from fermenting cassava in south africa, benin, kenya and germany, and were characterised by phenotypic and  genotypic tests. these could be divided into five main groups comprising strains  of facultatively heterofermentative rods, obligately heterofermentative rods, heterofermentative cocci, homofermentative cocci and obligately homofermentative  rods, in decreasing order of predominance. most of the facultatively heterofermentative rods were identified by phenotypic tests as presumptive lactobacillus plantarum-group strains, which also comprised the most predominant  bacteria (54.4% of strains) isolated in the study. the next predominant group of  lactic acid bacteria (14.1% of total isolates) consisted of obligately heterofermentative rods belonging either to the genus lactobacillus or weissella, followed by the heterofermentative cocci (13.9% of isolates) belonging to the genera weissella or leuconostoc. homofermentative cocci were also isolated (13.3% of isolates). biochemical properties such as production of alpha-amylase, beta-glucosidase, tannase, antimicrobials (presumptive bacteriocin and h(2)o(2)-production), acidification and fermentation of the indigestible sugars raffinose and stachyose, were evaluated in vitro for selection of potential starter strains. a total of 32 strains with one or more desirable biochemical properties were pre-selected and identified using rep-pcr fingerprinting in combination with 16s rrna sequencing of representative rep-pcr cluster isolates.  of these strains, 18 were identified as l. plantarum, four as lactobacillus pentosus, two each as leuconostoc fallax, weissella paramesenteroides and lactobacillus fermentum, one each as leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and weissella cibaria, while two remained unidentified but could be assigned to the l. plantarum-group. these strains were further investigated for clonal relationships, using rapd-pcr with three primers, and of the 32 a total of 16 strains were finally selected for the development as starter cultures for gari production.

TI  == monitoring the lactic acid bacterial diversity during shochu fermentation by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab) during shochu fermentation was monitored by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and by bacteriological culturing. no lab were detected from fermented mashes by pcr-dgge using a universal bacterial pcr primer set. however, pcr-dgge using a new primer  specific for the 16s rdna of lactococcus, streptococcus, tetragenococcus, enterococcus, and vagococcus and two primers specific for the 16s rdna of lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella revealed that enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus nagelii, lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and weissella cibaria inhabited in shochu mashes. it was also found that the lab community composition during shochu fermentation changed after the main ingredient and water were added during the fermentation process. therefore, we confirmed that pcr-dgge using all three primers specific for groups of lab together was well suited to the study of the lab diversity in shochu mashes. the results of dgge profiles were similar to the results of bacteriological culturing. in conclusion, lab are present during shochu fermentation but not dominant.
