TI  == screening of the novel colicinogenic gram-negative rods against pathogenic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == purpose: escherichia coli (e. coli) o157:h7 is gram-negative enteric pathogen producing different types of shiga toxin. this bacterium is the most corporate cause of haemorrhagic colitis in human. administration of antibiotics (particularly sulfa drugs) against this pathogen is a debatable topic as this may increase the risk of uremic syndrome; especially in children and aged people. around the world, microbiologists are in search of alternative therapeutic methods specially probiotics against this pathogen. in the present study, we have focused on the investigation of alternate bio-therapeutics (probiotics) for the treatment of patients infected with e. coli o157:h7. this study is based on the identification of colicin-producing gram-negative bacteria (particularly enterobacteriaceae) which can competently exclude e. coli o157:h7 from the gut of the infected individual. materials and methods: hundred samples from human, animal faeces and septic tank water were analysed for nonpathogenic gram-negative rods (gnrs). results: out of these samples, 175 isolates of gnrs were checked for their activity against e. coli o157:h7. only 47 isolates inhibited the growth of  e. coli o157:h7, among which majority were identified as e. coli. these e. coli strains were found to be the efficient producers of colicin. some of the closely  related species i. e., citrobacter sp, pantoea sp. and kluyvera sp. also showed considerable colicinogenic activity. moreover, colicinogenic species were found to be nonhaemolytic, tolerant to acidic environment (ph 3) and sensitive to commonly used antibiotics. conclusion: nonhaemolytic, acid tolerant and sensitive to antibiotics suggests the possible use of these circulating endothelial cells (cec) as inexpensive and inoffensive therapeutic agent (probiotics) in e. coli o157:h7 infections.

TI  == culture-independent analysis of endophytic bacterial communities associated with  brazilian sugarcane.
AB  == sugarcane is an economically important culture in brazil. endophytic bacteria live inside plants, and can provide many benefits to the plant host. we analyzed  the bacterial diversity of sugarcane cultivar rb-72454 by cultivation-independent techniques. total dna from sugarcane stems from a commercial plantation located in parana state was extracted. partial 16s rrna genes were amplified and sequenced for library construction. of 152 sequences obtained, 52% were similar to 16s rrna from pseudomonas sp, and 35.5% to enterobacter sp. the genera pantoea, serratia, citrobacter, and klebsiella were also represented. the endophytic communities in these sugarcane samples were dominated by the families  enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonadaceae (class gammaproteobacteria).

TI  == pseudocitrobacter gen. nov., a novel genus of the enterobacteriaceae with two new species pseudocitrobacter faecalis sp. nov., and pseudocitrobacter anthropi sp. nov, isolated from fecal samples from hospitalized patients in pakistan.
AB  == four isolates of gram-negative facultatively anaerobic bacteria, three of them producing ndm-1 carbapenemase, were isolated from hospitalized patients and outpatients attending two military hospitals in rawalpindi, pakistan, and studied for their taxonomic position. initially the strains were phenotypically identified as citrobacter species. comparative analysis of 16s rrna gene sequences then showed that the four strains shared >97%, but in no case >98.3%, 16s rrna gene sequence similarities to members of the genera citrobacter, kluyvera, pantoea, enterobacter and raoultella, but always formed a separate cluster in respective phylogenetic trees. based on multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) including partial recn, rpoa, thdf and rpob gene sequence and respective amino acid sequence analysis it turned out that the strains also here always formed separate clusters. based on further comparative analyses including dna-dna hybridizations, genomic fingerprint analysis using rep- and rapd-pcrs and physiological tests, it is proposed to classify these four strains into the novel genus pseudocitrobacter gen. nov. with a new species pseudocitrobacter faecalis sp. nov. with strain 25 cit(t) (=ccm 8479(t)=lmg 27751(t)) and pseudocitrobacter  anthropi sp. nov. with strain c138(t) (=ccm 8478(t)=lmg 27750(t)), as the type strains, respectively.

TI  == bacterial species associated with sound and botrytis-infected grapes from a greek vineyard.
AB  == grape bacterial microbiota plays central roles in the quality of grapes and wine, yet its diversity remains poorly described. in the present study, bacterial species associated with sound and botrytis-infected grapes of two cultivars originating from the same vineyard were assessed. isolates were identified by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) and sequence analysis of partial 16s rrna gene. comparable counts were recorded between botrytis-infected  and sound grape samples. in all cases, the majority of isolates belonged to different species of enterobacteriaceae. the dominant species in the vineyard was klebsiella oxytoca that was found in different combinations with citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., erwinia sp., pantoea dispersa, tatumella ptyseos or  other species. in fermenting musts, those populations declined while other species evolved, like lactobacillus plantarum and enterobacter ludwigii. populations in botrytised samples persisted longer during spontaneous fermentations. present study suggests that bacterial diversity on grapes may be wider than previously described.

TI  == [intestinal enterobacteria of the hibernating apis mellifera mellifera l. bees].
AB  == dynamics of enterobacteria of normal intestinal microflora was studied in apis mellifera mellifera l. bees hibernating under snow in the western urals. the cell numbers (n) of the predominant species klebsiella oxytoca increased from 10-10(6) cfu/bee in november 2004 to 10(4)-10(7) cfu/bee in march 2005; its frequency of occurrence (p) increased from 92 to 100%. increase of providencia rettgeri (11.2004: n up to 10(6), p 25%; 03.2005: n 10(2)-10(6), p 80%) was accompanied by the substitution of morganella morganii (11.2004: n up to 10(6), p 25%) with proteus vulgaris (03.2005: n up to 10(5), p 8%). by spring, hafnia alvei and citrobacter sp., which are pathogenic to bees, disappeared (11.2004: n up to 10(5), p 13 and 10%, respectively). endophytic species pantoea agglomerans, leclecria sp., and other representatives of the "enterobacter agglomerans" group  were present in november and after the first emergence in spring (n up to 10(5);  november: p 15%; april: p 23%). in april, the number of enterobacteria decreased  to 10(5), and p. rettgeri became the predominant species (p 54%) instead of k. oxytoca (p 43%).

TI  == diverse endophytic nitrogen-fixing bacteria isolated from wild rice oryza rufipogon and description of phytobacter diazotrophicus gen. nov. sp. nov.
AB  == twenty-three nitrogen-fixing bacteria were isolated from surface-sterilized stems and roots of wild rice oryza rufipogon. four clusters were defined among these bacteria by sds-page protein patterns and further confirmed by is-pcr finger-printing analysis. phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna gene sequences showed that the representative strains ls 8 and ls 18 of cluster ii formed a monophyletic group sharing 94.0-97.3% similarities with defined enterobacterial species within the genera salmonella, citrobacter, pantoea, klebsiella, and enterobacter. dna-dna hybridization, physiological, biochemical tests, and cell morphology also revealed that these strains could be differentiated from the related enterobacterial species. based upon these results, we propose phytobacter diazotrophicus gen. nov., sp. nov. to the bacterial group represented by strains  ls 8 and ls 18. the type strain is ls 8(t) (=dsm 17806(t) = lmg 23328(t) = cgmcc  1.5339(t)). the dna g+c content of strain ls 8(t) is 58.6 +/- 0.5 mol%.

TI  == confirmation of e. coli among other thermotolerant coliform bacteria in paper mill effluents, wood chips screening rejects and paper sludges.
AB  == paper sludges are solid wastes material generated from the paper production, which have been characterized for their chemical contents. some are rich in wood  fiber and are a good carbon source, for example the primary and de-inking paper sludges. others are made rich in nitrogen and phosphorus by pressing the activated sludge, resulting from the biological water treatments, with the primary sludge, yielding the combined paper sludge. still, in the absence of sanitary effluents very few studies have addressed the characterization of their  coliform microflora. therefore, this study investigated the thermotolerant coliform population of one paper mill effluent and two paper mill sludges and wood chips screening rejects using chromogenic media. for the first series of analyses, the medium used was colilert broth and positive tubes were selected to  isolate bacteria in pure culture on macconkey agar. in a second series of analyses, double selective media, based on ss-galactosidase and ss-glucuronidase  activities, were used to isolate bacteria. first, the presence of thermotolerant  coliforms was detected in low numbers in most water effluents, but showed that the entrance of the thermotolerant coliforms was early in the industrial process. also, large numbers of thermotolerant coliforms, i.e., 7,000,000 mpn/g sludge (dry weight; d.w.), were found in combined sludges. from this first series of isolations, bacteria were purified on macconkey medium and identified as citrobacter freundii, enterobacter sp, e. sakazakii, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, k. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis, k. pneumoniae subsp.  ozaenae, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, pantoea sp, raoultella terrigena, r. planticola. second, the presence of thermotolerant coliforms was measured at more than 3,700-6,000 mpn/g (d.w) sludge, whereas e. coli was detected from 730 to more than 3,300 mpn/g (d.w.) sludge. the presence of thermotolerant coliform bacteria and e. coli was sometimes detected from wood chips screening rejects in  large quantities. also, indigenous e. coli were able to multiply into the combined sludge, and inoculated e. coli isolates were often able to multiply in wood chips and combined sludge media. in this second series of isolations, api20e and biolog identified most isolates as e. coli, but others remained unidentified. the sequences of the 16s rdna confirmed that most isolates were likely e. coli, few burkholderia spp, but 10% of the isolates remained unidentified. this study points out that the coliform bacteria are introduced by the wood chips in the water effluents, where they can survive throught the primary clarifier and regrow in combined sludges.

TI  == effect of plants and filter materials on bacteria removal in pilot-scale constructed wetlands.
AB  == due to the lack of testing units or appropriate experimental approaches, only little is known about the removal of bacteria in constructed wetlands. however, improved performance in terms of water sanitation requires a detailed understanding of the ongoing processes. therefore, we analyzed the microbial diversity and the survival of enterobacteriaceae in six pilot-scale constructed wetland systems treating domestic wastewater: two vertical sand filters, two vertical expanded clay filters and two horizontal sand filters (each planted and  unplanted). samples were taken from the in- and outflow, from the rhizosphere, and from the bulk soil at various depths. colony-forming units of heterotrophic bacteria and coliforms were analyzed and the removal of bacteria between the in-  and outflow was determined to within 1.5-2.5 orders of magnitude. to access the taxon-specific biodiversity of potential pathogens in the filters and to reduce the complexity of the analysis, specific primers for enterobacteriaceae were developed. while performing pcr-sscp analyses, a pronounced decrease in diversity from the inflow to the outflow of treated wastewater was observed. no differences were observed between the bulk soil of planted and unplanted vertical filters. some bands appeared in the rhizosphere that were not present in the bulk soil, indicating the development of specific communities stimulated by the plants. the  fingerprinting of the rhizosphere of plants grown on sand or expanded clay exhibited many differences, which show that different microbial communities exist depending on the soil type of the filters. the use of the taxon-specific primers  enabled us to evaluate the fate of the enterobacteriaceae entering the wetlands and to localize harboring in the rhizosphere. the most abundant bands of the profiles were sequenced: pantoea agglomerans was found in nearly all samples from the soil but not in the effluent, whereas citrobacter sp. could not be removed by the horizontal unplanted sand and vertical planted expanded clay filters. these results show that the community in wetland system is strongly influenced by the filtration process, the filter material and the plants.
