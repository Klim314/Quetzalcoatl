TI  == antioxidant and antibacterial activities of exopolysaccharides from bifidobacterium bifidum wbin03 and lactobacillus plantarum r315.
AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the antioxidant and antibacterial  activities of exopolysaccharide (eps) from bifidobacterium bifidum wbin03 (b-eps) and lactobacillus plantarum r315 (l-eps). the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (dpph)-radical scavenging, hydroxyl radical-scavenging, and superoxide radical-scavenging abilities were measured to evaluate antioxidant activity. inhibition of erythrocyte hemolysis and lipid peroxidation was also measured. both b-eps and l-eps had strong scavenging ability against dpph and superoxide radicals at high concentration. the inhibitory effect of b-eps on erythrocyte hemolysis was stronger than that of l-eps in a concentration range from 0.30 to 1.00 mg/ml, whereas the hydroxyl scavenging ability of l-eps (39.15 +/- 0.58%) was significantly higher than that of 0.15 mg/ml ascorbic acid (24.33 +/- 1.17%)  and b-eps (17.89 +/- 3.30%) at 0.10 mg/ml. the inhibition of lipid peroxidation of 0.50 mg/ml b-eps and l-eps was 13.48 +/- 1.74% and 12.43 +/- 0.51%, respectively, values lower than that of ascorbic acid at the same concentration (23.20 +/- 1.41%). furthermore, all these abilities were enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner. agar diffusion assay showed that both eps exhibited antibacterial activities against tested pathogens such as cronobacter sakazakii, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, staphyloccocus aureus, candida albicans, bacillus cereus, salmonella typhimurium, and shigella sonnei at 300 mug/ml. in conclusion, both eps have antimicrobial and antioxidant activities and could have applications in the food industry.

TI  == national survey outcomes on commercial probiotic food supplements in italy.
AB  == to assess whether the probiotic food supplements, produced and distributed on the italian market during 2005-2006, complied with the italian guidelines on prebiotics and probiotics, 72 samples from 29 processing plants were analyzed. the survey included 41 samples from processing plants and 31 samples of the same  brand from retailers collected at timed intervals (3, 8 and 13 months). a polyphasic approach based on a suitable analytical collection method (genotypic identification of total bacteria - differential presumptive enumeration - genotypic identification of viable bacteria) was adopted to identify and quantify the microorganisms labelled and recovered from the probiotic supplements examined. most supplements analyzed (87%) did not conform to the italian guidelines and the differences were both quantitative and qualitative (number determination, purity, types and viability of microorganisms). even though most labelled supplements (25 samples) indicated the presence of bifidobacterium bifidum, this organism was only detected sporadically and always as dead cells. unexpected results were obtained during our survey due to the absence of viability of bacillus coagulans spores in some labelled supplements. besides this, some of these supplements also contained other spore-forming species, identified as b. cereus that are toxin producing. we have also documented a widespread use of misclassified microbial species or species with fictitious names. the main factors involved in the absence of compliance were examined and the poor quality control applied by manufacturers was emphasized.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. there are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. however, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. this study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing  the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the mics  and mbcs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. the results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus, with mics of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. a concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactococcus lactis, and paenibacillus polymyxa. the mics for listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus  durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. no activity was detected against lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.
