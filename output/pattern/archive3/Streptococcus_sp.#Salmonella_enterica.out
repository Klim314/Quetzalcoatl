antimicrobial function of shbetaap, a novel hemoglobin beta chain-related antimicrobial peptide, isolated from the liver of skipjack tuna, katsuwonus pelamis.
a 2.3 kda of antimicrobial peptide was purified from an acidified liver extract of skipjack tuna, katsuwonus pelamis, by preparative acid-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and c18 reversed-phase hplc. a comparison of the amino acid sequence of the purified peptide with those of other known polypeptides revealed high homology with the c-terminus of hemoglobin beta-chain; thus, this peptide was designated as the skipjack hemoglobin beta chain-related antimicrobial peptide (shbetaap). shbetaap showed potent antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria, such as bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus iniae (minimal effective concentrations [mecs], 6.5-57.0 mug/ml), gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli d31, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica, shigella sonnei, and two vibrio parahaemolyticus species (mecs, 2.0-19.0 mug/ml), and against candida albicans (mec; 12.0 mug/ml) without significant hemolytic activity. antimicrobial activity of this peptide was heatstable and ph resistant but is sensitive to proteases and salt. shbetaap did not show membrane permeabilization and killing ability. the secondary structural prediction and the homology modeling expected that this peptide formed an amphipathic alpha-helical structure. this is the first report the purification of a novel antimicrobial peptide related to the c-terminus of hemoglobin beta-chain from marine fish.
synthesis and characterization of bactericidal silver nanoparticles using cultural filtrate of simulated microgravity grown klebsiella pneumoniae.
silver nanoparticles were synthesized by biological method using cultural filtrate of klebsiella pneumoniae cultured under simulated microgravity and silver nitrate solution as precursor. the nanoparticles exhibited typical plasmon absorption maximum of silver nanoparticles between 405 and 407 nm. spherical silver nanoparticles were found to have size between 15 and 37 nm by tem analysis. xrd pattern corresponding to planes (111), (200), (220) (311) revealed the crystalline nature of the biosynthesized silver nanoparticles. ftir spectrum proposed stabilization of silver nanoparticles by the protein molecules present in the cultural filtrate. the silver nanoparticles exhibited high bactericidal activity against salmonella enterica, escherichia coli and moderate bactericidal activity against streptococcus pyogenes.
the antimicrobial effects of propolis collected in different regions in the basque country (northern spain).
the antimicrobial activity of 19 propolis extracts prepared in different solvents (ethanol and propylene glycol) (eep/pep), was evaluated against some bacterial and fungal isolates using the agar-well diffusion method. it was verified that all the samples tested showed antimicrobial activity, although results varied considerably between samples. results revealed that both types of propolis extracts showed highly sensitive antimicrobial action against gram-positive bacteria and fungi at a concentration of 20% (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisae) with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/ml, with a moderate effect against streptococcus pyogenes (mic from 17 to 26 mg/ml). to our knowledge, this is the first study showing elevated antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria [salmonella enterica (mic from 0.6 to 1.4 mg/ml)] and lesser activity against helicobacter pylori (mic from 6 to 14 mg/ml), while escherichia coli was resistant. this concluded that the basque propolis had a strong and dose-dependent activity against most of the microbial strains tested, while database comparison revealed that phenolic substances were responsible for this inhibition, regardless of their geographical origin and the solvent employed for extraction. statistical analysis showed no significant differences (p </= 0.05) between eep and pep extracts.
bacterial carbonic anhydrases as drug targets: toward novel antibiotics?
carbonic anhydrases (cas, ec 4.2.1.1) are metalloenzymes which catalyze the hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons. many pathogenic bacteria encode such enzymes belonging to the alpha-, beta-, and/or gamma-ca families. in the last decade, the alpha-cas from neisseria spp. and helicobacter pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from escherichia coli, h. pylori,mycobacterium tuberculosis, brucella spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, and haemophilus influenzae have been cloned and characterized in detail. for some of these enzymes the x-ray crystal structures were determined, and in vitro and in vivo inhibition studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates reported. although efficient inhibitors have been reported for many such enzymes, only for neisseria spp., h. pylori, b. suis, and s. pneumoniae enzymes it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. thus, bacterial cas represent promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.
antibacterial activity in spices and local medicinal plants against clinical isolates of karachi, pakistan.
context: development of resistance in human pathogens against conventional antibiotic necessitates searching indigenous medicinal plants having antibacterial property. twenty-seven medicinal plants used actively in folklore, ayurvedic and traditional system of medicine were selected for the evaluation of their antimicrobial activity for this study. eleven plants chosen from these 27 are used as spices in local cuisine. objective: evaluation of the effectiveness of some medicinal plant extracts against clinical isolates. material and methods: nonedible plant parts were extracted with methanol and evaporated in vacuo to obtain residue. powdered edible parts were boiled three times and cooled in sterile distilled water for 2 min each and filtrate collected. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of plant extracts and filtrates/antibiotics was evaluated against clinical isolates by microbroth dilution method. results: water extract of syzygium aromaticum l. (myrtaceae) buds, methanol extracts of ficus carica l. (moraceae) and olea europaea l. (oleaceae) leaves and peganum harmala l. (nitrariaceae) seeds had mic ranges of 31.25-250 microg/ml. s. aromaticum inhibited growth of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, salmonella enterica serovar typhi and pseudomonas aeruginosa. f. carica and o. europaea inhibited growth of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and s. pyogenes whereas p. harmala was effective against s. aureus, acinetobacter calcoaceticus and candida albicans. ampicillin, velosef, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline and ceftazidime, cefotaxime, cefepime, which are used as control, had mic >/= 50 and 1.5 microg/ml, respectively, for organisms sensitive to extracts. discussion and conclusion: mono/multiextract from identified plants will provide an array of safe antimicrobial agents to control infections by drug-resistant bacteria.
synthesis of ag/cnt hybrid nanoparticles and fabrication of their nylon-6 polymer nanocomposite fibers for antimicrobial applications.
ag-coated cnts hybrid nanoparticles (ag/cnts) were prepared by ultrasonic irradiation of dimethylformamide (dmf) and silver (i) acetate precursors in the presence of cnts. the morphology of ag/cnts was characterized using x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (tem) techniques. the nylon-6 powder and 1 wt% ag/cnts mixture was dispersed uniformly using a noncontact spinning technique. the dried mixture was melted in a single screw extrusion machine and then extruded through an orifice. extruded filaments were later stretched and stabilized by sequentially passing them through a set of tension adjusters and a secondary heater. the nylon-6/ag/cnt hybrid polymer nanocomposite (hpnc) fibers, which were of approximately 80 microm size, were tested for their tensile properties. the failure stress and modulus of the extruded hpnc fibers (doped with 1% ag/cnts) was about 72.19 % and 342.62% higher than the neat extruded nylon-6 fiber, respectively. dsc results indicated an increase in the thermal stability and crystallization for hpnc fibers. the antibacterial activity of the ag-coated cnts, commercial ag, neat nylon-6 and plain cnts were evaluated. ag-coated cnts at 25 microg demonstrated good antimicrobial activity against four common bacterial pathogens as tested by the kirby-bauer assay. the mean diameters of the zones of inhibition were 27.9 +/- 6.72 mm, 19.4 +/- 3.64 mm, 21.9 +/- 4.33 mm, and 24.1 +/- 4.14 mm, respectively, for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. by comparison, those obtained using the broad spectrum antibiotic amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were 37.7 +/- 2.13 mm, 28.6 +/- 4.27 mm, 22.6 +/- 1.27 mm, and 27.0 +/- 1.41 mm, respectively, for the same strains. the zones of inhibition obtained for nylon-6 ag-coated cnt powder at 25 microg were also high, ranging from 15.2 to 25.3 mm in contrast to commercial silver or neat nylon-6, which did not inhibit the bacterial strains tested. further, the nylon-6 nanocomposite fibers infused with ag/cnts inhibited bacterial growth by 11-20%. our results suggest that nylon nanocomposite fibers infused with ag-coated cnts have significant antimicrobial activity.
prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among pigeon isolates of streptococcus gallolyticus, escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium.
thirty-three streptococcus gallolyticus, 60 escherichia coli and 18 salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium var. copenhagen strains isolated from homing pigeons (columba livia) were tested for susceptibility to the antimicrobials most commonly used to treat pigeons. minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined using the agar dilution technique. aminoglycosides (gentamicin and kanamycin), trimethoprim and flumequine were relatively inactive against the streptococci tested. acquired tetracycline resistance amounted to 85%, and lincomycin and macrolide (erythromycin) resistance to 48 and 45%, respectively. fluoroquinolone (enrofloxacin) resistance was found in four s. gallolyticus strains. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin. with the e. coli strains, resistance was found to all antibiotics tested. over one-half of them were resistant to tetracycline and to broad-spectrum penicillins (ampicillin); however, none showed extended spectrum beta-lactamase activity, implying that the cephalosporins (ceftiofur) remained active. resistance to trimethoprim, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolone ranked next. in contrast to the s. gallolyticus and e. coli strains, the s. enterica strains were susceptible to all the antimicrobials tested.
