TI  == probiotic effects of orally administered lactobacillus salivarius wb21-containing tablets on periodontopathic bacteria: a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial.
AB  == aim: this study was designed to evaluate whether the oral administration of lactobacilli could change the bacterial population in supra/subgingival plaque. material and methods: sixty-six healthy volunteers without severe periodontitis were randomized into two groups to receive lactobacilli or placebo for 8 weeks (8w): the test group (n=34) received 2.01 x 10(9) cfu/day of lactobacillus salivarius wb21 and xylitol in tablets; the control group (n=32) received placebo with xylitol. supra/subgingival plaque samples were collected at the baseline and after 4 weeks (4w) and 8w. the bacterial amounts in plaque samples were analysed  by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: the numerical sum of five selected periodontopathic bacteria in the test group was decreased significantly in subgingival plaque at 4w [odds ratio (or)=3.13, 95% confidence intervals (ci)=1.28-7.65, p=0.012]. multivariate analysis showed that significantly higher odds were obtained for the reduction of tannerella forsythia in subgingival plaque of the test group at both 4w (or=6.69, 95% ci=2.51-17.9, p<0.001) and 8w (or=3.67, 95% ci=1.45-9.26, p=0.006). conclusion: oral administration of probiotic lactobacilli reduced the numerical sum of five selected periodontopathic bacteria and could contribute to the beneficial effects on periodontal conditions.

TI  == correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult sudanese.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult sudanese. whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva  and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. there were significantly ( p< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, veillonella parvula, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus salivarius, and leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( p< or =0.01) lower percentages with treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. the detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for selenomonas sputigena, s. anginosus, streptococcus sanguis, and s. salivarius and significantly lower for porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( p< or =0.01). porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, s. sputigena, s. sanguis, and streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( p< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. this study indicates that the levels of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, s.  sanguis, and s. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and  subgingival plaque.

TI  == bacteriologic findings in tonsillitis and pericoronitis.
AB  == bacteriologic samples from 31 young men were cultured quantitatively for aerobes  and anaerobes; these samples included 31 specimens of tonsils (16 infected and 15 healthy), 16 specimens from pericoronal pockets of lower third molars (11 infected and 5 symptom-free), and 6 postoperative specimens from lower-third-molar extraction sockets. anaerobes were isolated more often from infected third molars than from infected tonsils (14.5 isolates vs. 8.4 isolates, respectively; p < .001). infected tonsil samples contained significantly more anaerobic species if an adjacent partly erupted lower third molar was present rather than absent (10.3 isolates vs. 6.9 isolates, respectively; p < .05). eubacterium aerofaciens, clostridium species, peptostreptococcus micros, and prevotella oris were frequently isolated. streptococcus salivarius was found more frequently in tonsillar specimens, whereas corynebacterium species, prevotella denticola, capnocytophaga species, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and lactobacillus species were more common in pericoronal pocket samples. thus, partial eruption of lower third molars increases the number of anaerobic bacterial species on tonsils and many species can be isolated simultaneously from both tonsils and lower third molars.
