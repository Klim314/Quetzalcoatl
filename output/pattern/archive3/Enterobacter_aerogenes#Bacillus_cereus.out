safety, efficacy and utility of methods of transferring adhesive and cohesive escherichia coli cells to microplates to avoid aerosols.
the virtual colony count (vcc) microbiological assay has been utilized for over a decade to measure the antimicrobial activity of peptides such as defensins and ll-37 against biosafety level (bsl)-1 and bsl-2 bacteria including escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and enterobacter aerogenes. in addition, a modified pipetting technique was presented in a 2011 study of defensin activity against the bsl-3 pathogen bacillus anthracis. both studies were published in the journal antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy. here i report that the method can also detect cross-contamination caused by aerosols utilizing the vcc method of data analysis by quantitative growth kinetics (qgk). the qgk threshold time, or t t, equivalent to the cycle time c t reported in 1996 by heid et al., precisely identifies when wells were inoculated.
synthesis and characterization of a series of transition metal complexes with a new symmetrical polyoxaaza macroacyclic schiff base ligand: x-ray crystal structure of cobalt(ii) and nickel(ii) complexes and their antibacterial properties.
a new symmetrical [n4o2] hexadentate schiff base ligand, (e)-n-(pyridin-2-ylmethylene)-2-(3-(2-((e)-pyridin-2-lmethyleneamino)phenoxy)naph thalen-2-yloxy)benzenamine, abbreviated to l, and its complexes of ni(ii), cu(ii), zn(ii), co(ii), cd(ii) and mn(ii) have been synthesized in the presence of metal ions. the complexes were structurally characterized by elemental analyses, ir, uv-vis, nmr and molar conductivity. the crystal structures of two complexes, [nil(ono2)2].2h2o and [colcl2]ch3oh.0.5h2o, have been determined by a single crystal x-ray diffraction study. in these complexes, the ligand is coordinated in a neutral form via pyridine and azomethine nitrogen atoms. the metal ions complete their six coordination with two coordinated nitrate or chloride ions, forming a distorted octahedral geometry. the synthesized compounds have antibacterial activity against the three gram-positive bacteria: enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus epid and also against the three gram-negative bacteria: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes and salmonella typhi. the activity data show that the complexes are more potent antibacterials than the parent schiff base.
phyto-synthesis of silver nanoscale particles using morinda citrifolia l. and its inhibitory activity against human pathogens.
leaf extract of morinda citrifolia l. was assessed for the synthesis of silver nanoscale particles under different temperature and reaction time. synthesized nanoscale (mcagnps) particles were confirmed by analysing the excitation of surface plasmon resonance (spr) using uv-visible spectrophotometer at 420 nm. further sem, hrtem analysis confirmed the range of particle size between 10 and 60 nm and sead pattern authorizes the face centered cubic (fcc) crystalline nature of the mcagnps. fourier transform infrared spectrum (ftir) of synthesized mcagnps confirms the presence of high amount of phenolic compounds in the plant extract which may possibly influence the reduction process and stabilization of nanoparticles. further, inhibitory activity of mcagnps and plant extract were tested against human pathogens like eschericia coli, pseudomonas aeroginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus cereus and enterococci sp. the results indicated that the mcagnps showed moderate inhibitory actions against human pathogens than crude plant extract, demonstrating its antimicrobial value against pathogenic diseases.
phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of labisa pumila benth.
a local herb, kacip fatimah, is famous amongst malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented. therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of labisia pumila benth. total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems. leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. hplc analyses of phenolics and flavonoids in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin, kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both gram positive (micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis b145, bacillus cereus b43, staphylococcus aureus s1431) and gram negative (enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumonia k36, escherichia coli e256, pseudomonas aeruginosa pi96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all plant parts against fusarium sp., candida sp. and mucor using the agar diffusion disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.
chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the extracts of kefe cumin (laser trilobum l.) fruits from different regions.
structural properties (using gas chromatographic analyses: gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) of some compounds (pure chemicals, essential oils, extracts, etc.) and systematic investigation of antimicrobial activities (with agar dilution and agar diffusion disc methods) were determined in the fruits of kefe cumin (laser trilobum l.) obtained from different regions (germany, india, and turkey). the main components were established as limonene (41.03-72.24%) and perillaldehyde (4.23-32.75%) in the essential oils determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. mineral contents in the fruits were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer. it was determined that the fruits were rich in potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, arsenic and aluminium minerals. the highest sodium content was found to be 9,261.28 mg/kg in the samples obtained from turkey, but the potassium content of the samples from germany and india was higher than that of kefe cumin fruits obtained from turkey. the fruit extracts had a significant antimicrobial effect on pathogen bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris (fmc 1), proteus mirabilis, bacillus cereus (fmc 19), aeromonas hydrophila (atcc 7965), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 15753), klebsiella pneumoniae (fmc 5), salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter aerogenes (ccm 2531) and escherichia coli (atcc 8739), whereas no significant antimicrobial effect of the essential oils was observed.
efficacy of plant essential oils against foodborne pathogens and spoilage bacteria associated with ready-to-eat vegetables: antimicrobial and sensory screening.
the objectives of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of plant essential oils (eos) against foodborne pathogens and key spoilage bacteria pertinent to ready-to-eat vegetables and to screen the selected eos for sensory acceptability. the eos basil, caraway, fennel, lemon balm, marjoram, nutmeg, oregano, parsley, rosemary, sage, and thyme were evaluated. the bacteria evaluated were listeria spp., staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus spp., bacillus cereus, salmonella, enterobacter spp., escherichia coli, and pseudomonas spp. quantitative antimicrobial analyses were performed using an absorbance-based microplate assay. efficacy was compared using mic, the half maximum inhibitory concentration, and the increase in lag phase. generally, gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to eos than were gram-negative bacteria, and listeria monocytogenes strains were among the most sensitive. of the spoilage organisms, pseudomonas spp. were the most resistant. oregano and thyme eos had the highest activity against all the tested bacteria. marjoram and basil eos had selectively high activity against b. cereus, enterobacter aerogenes, e. coli, and salmonella, and lemon balm and sage eos had adequate activity against l. monocytogenes and s. aureus. within bacterial species, eo efficacy was dependent on strain and in some cases the origin of the strain. on a carrot model product, basil, lemon balm, marjoram, oregano, and thyme eos were deemed organoleptically acceptable, but only oregano and marjoram eos were deemed acceptable for lettuce. selected eos may be useful as natural and safe additives for promoting the safety and quality of ready-to-eat vegetables.
succession of dominant and antagonistic lactic acid bacteria in fermented cucumber: insights from a pcr-based approach.
the goal of the investigation was to study the succession of major groups of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and their antagonism in salt-fermented cucumber using pcr. in a direct detection method as well as a short enrichment process, pcr enabled detection of leuconostoc and lactobacillus during early hours of fermentation. subsequently, lactobacillus and pediococcus emerged as the dominant genera. nucleic acid sequence of culture-independent clones confirmed the detection of pediococcus as a dominant genera emerging during late stages of fermentation. pcr also revealed time-dependent emergence of mesentericin, pediocin and plantaricin a producers and accounted for the lab succession in the fermenting samples. a total of 328 lab isolates were obtained collectively from 30 cucumber samples, of which pcr could identify an overwhelming 186 lactobacillus isolates followed by 113 pediococcus and 29 leuconostoc isolates, respectively. based on antimicrobial assay against target strain leuconostoc mesenteroides nrrl b640, 28% of the lab were bacteriocin producers, of which pediocin producers were substantial, followed by plantaricin a and mesentericin producers. the bacteriocins elaborated by the isolates were active against a large number of gram-positive target lab strains and pathogenic bacteria including bacillus cereus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus.
evaluation of the hygienic quality and associated public health hazards of raw milk marketed by smallholder dairy producers in the dar es salaam region, tanzania.
a cross-sectional study was conducted to determine three parameters of the quality of the raw milk marketed by milk selling points (msps) in dar es salaam region. total bacterial count (tbc) was used as an indicator of the microbial quality of the milk; antimicrobial residues were determined; and the california mastitis test (cmt) was used to screen for milk somatic cells as an indication of the mastitis level in the cows that provided the milk. moreover, a water sample at each msp was taken for bacteriological culturing. finally, a questionnaire survey was conducted with the milk sellers at the msps to identify risk factors for poor milk hygiene. a total of 128 milk samples and corresponding water samples were collected from randomly selected milk selling points in dar es salaam region. the mean tbc was (8.2 +/- 1.9) x 10(6) cfu/ml, and major bacterial isolates from the milk samples were escherichia coli (6.3%), bacillus cereus (6.3%), staphylococcus aureus (6.3%) and streptococcus agalactiae (6.3%), enterobacter aerogenes (5.6%) and enterococcus faecalis (4.7%). in most cases, the organisms identified in milk corresponded to those isolated from the corresponding water samples. of milk samples, 79.0% were positive to the cmt and 7.0% were positive for antimicrobial residues. tbc was normalized by log-transformation, and the possible predictors of tbc were identified by fitting two linear regression models. in a random effect model, water microbial quality, frequency of cleaning the milk containers, frequency of milk supply, milk storage time and the type of containers, and mixing of fresh and previous milk were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the mean log tbc. in a fixed effect model, in addition to these indicators, water shortage, water source and the refrigerator condition were significantly (p < or = 0.01) associated with log tbc. it was concluded that the milk sold in dar es salaam region is of poor quality and is of public health significance.
antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activity of plagiochasma appendiculatum lehm. et lind.
plagiochasma appendiculatum (aytoniaceae) of the order marchantiales is widely used in the form of paste ethnomedicinally by gaddi tribe in kangra valley for treating skin diseases. in this context, antimicrobical potential of plagiochasma appendiculatum against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. to validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing activity. the plant (alchoholic and aqueous extract) showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, and eight fungi candida albicans and cryptococcus albidus-dimorphic fungi, trichophyton rubrum-dermatophyte fungi, aspergillus niger, aspergillus flavus, aspergillus spinulosus, aspergillus terreus and aspergillus nidulans-systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and salmonella typhimurium) with an mic of 2.5 microg/disc. the results show that plagiochasma appendiculatum extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. the results also indicated that plagiochasma appendiculatum extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (sod) and catalase activity.
differential activity of a lectin from solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
a lectin isolated from the red alga solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). the lectin (500 microg/ml) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus sp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/ml but the lectin (10-1000 microg/ml) had no effect on the growth of the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and b. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. it is possible that the interaction of s. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium b. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml. the stimulation of the growth of b. cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/ml), its hapten. thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. the present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.
antimicrobial activities of several parts of pinus brutia, juniperus oxycedrus, abies cilicia, cedrus libani and pinus nigra.
in this study, the antimicrobial activities of several parts of various trees grown in the kahramanmaras region of turkey were investigated by the disc diffusion method. chloroform, acetone and methanol extracts of leaves, resins, barks, cones and fruits of pinus brutia ten., juniperus oxycedrus l., abies cilicia ant. & kotschy carr., cedrus libani a. rich. and pinus nigra arn. were prepared and tested against bacillus megaterium dsm 32, bacillus subtilis img 22, bacillus cereus fmc 19, escherichia coli dm, klebsiella pneumoniae fmc 3, enterobacter aerogenes ccm 2531, staphylococcus aureus cowan 1, mycobacterium smegmatis rut, proteus vulgaris fmc 1, listeria monocytogenes scoot a, pseudomonas aeruginosa dsm 5007, candida albicans ccm 314, candida tropicalis mdc 86 and penicillium italicum k. the results showed that antifungal effects were not observed for the whole extracts, e. coli was not inhibited by any of the plant extracts except by the chloroform and acetone extracts of the leaves of a. cilicia, which showed inhibition zones of 16-18 mm, respectively. all the plant extracts used in this study inhibited the development of the other bacteria studied. when the results of this study were compared with an ampicillin standard, it was found that the microorganisms studied were generally susceptible, intermediate or resistant to the extracts of species when compared with the ampicillin standard. on the other hand, the acetone and methanol extracts of juniperus fruits were found to be quite resistant.
repression of staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria. ii. causes of inhibition.
two food bacteria, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas sp. cs-1, inhibited an enterotoxigenic strain of staphylococcus aureus, apparently by out-competing it for nutrients. five others, bacillus cereus, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli h-52, aerobacter aerogenes, and achromobacter sp., inhibited by means of antibiotic substances which were seitz-filterable, dialyzable, and stable at 90 c for 10 min. inhibition was not caused by changes in ph, oxidation-reduction potential, or production of peroxide or fatty acids. the concentrated antibiotic material from e. coli h-52 contained amino acids but not peptides and was especially effective against staphylococci and micrococci.
