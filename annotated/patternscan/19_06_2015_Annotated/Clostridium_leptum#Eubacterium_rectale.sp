TI  == phytase modulates ileal microbiota and enhances growth performance of the broiler chickens.
AB  == phytase is well studied and explored, however, little is known about its effects  on the microbial ecology of the gastrointestinal tract. in total, 400 one-day-old female ross 308 chicks were randomly distributed to four experimental groups. the dietary treatments were arranged as a 2 x 2 complete factorial design, with the factors being adequate (pc) or insufficient calcium (ca) and digestible phosphor  (dp)(nc) and with or without 5000 phytase units (ftu)/kg of escherichia coli 6-phytase. the gastrointestinal tract ph values, ileal microbial communities and  short-chain fatty acid concentrations in the digesta were determined. the reduction in ca and dp concentration significantly affected ph in the crop and caeca, and addition of phytase to the nc resulted in a ph increase in the ileum.  the reduction in ca and dp concentration significantly lowered, while phytase supplementation increased ileal total bacterial counts. additionally, the deficient diet reduced butyrate- but increased lactate-producing bacteria. the addition of phytase increased lactobacillus sp./enterococcus sp. whereas in case  of clostridium leptum subgroup, clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale cluster, bifidobacterium sp. and streptococcus/lactococcus counts, a significant  ca and dp level x phytase interaction was found. however, the recorded interactions indicated that the effects of phytase and ca and dp levels were not  consistent. furthermore, the reduction of ca and dp level lowered clostridium perfringens and enterobacteriaceae counts. the analysis of fermentation products  showed that reducing the ca and dp content in the diet reduced total scfa, dl-lactate, and acetic acid in the ileum whereas phytase increased concentrations of these acids in the nc group. this suggests that p is a factor which limits fermentation in the ileum. it may be concluded that phytase plays a role in modulating the gut microbiota of chicken, however, this is clearly linked with the levels of p and ca in a diet.

TI  == distinct gut microbiota of healthy children from two different geographic regions of thailand.
AB  == in thailand, food consumption by people from each region is different. this can be an important environmental factor which shapes the gut microbiota further affecting their health. this study aimed to use quantitative pcr (qpcr) to investigate the intestinal microbial community in 60 healthy children (aged 8-11  years) living in specific areas, namely central (ct) and northeastern (ne) thailand where each region has its own typical food consumption. the children from ne had significantly higher consumption frequency of meat (chicken and beef), a wide variety of carbohydrate sources (noodle, fermented rice and sweet potato) including vegetables and fruit, while in ct, there was a significant preference for rice, breakfast cereal and cow milk. the qpcr analysis resulted in significantly higher abundance of lactobacilli, clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale, clostridium leptum, prevotella and bacteroides fragilis in children from the ne region. however, no significant difference in the count of bifidobacterium spp., enterobacteriaceae and methanogens was observed. considering the correlation of food sources and microbial groups, the consumption frequency of vegetables showed a moderately positive correlation coefficient of 0.42 and 0.34  to the lactobacillus group (p = 0.001) and the prevotella group (p = 0.008), respectively, while a diet of fish and beef showed a moderately negative correlation coefficient of -0.41 (p = 0.001) and -0.33 (p = 0.09) to bifidobacterium spp., respectively. our results suggested that high frequency consumption of varieties of carbohydrates, protein sources, fruits and vegetables by the ne children promoted a high abundance of bacterial species in the phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes.

TI  == smoking cessation alters intestinal microbiota: insights from quantitative investigations on human fecal samples using fish.
AB  == background: there has been a dramatic increase in investigations on the potential mechanistic role of the intestinal microbiota in various diseases and factors modulating intestinal microbial composition. we recently reported on intestinal microbial shifts after smoking cessation in humans. in this study, we aimed to conduct further microbial analyses and verify our previous results obtained by pyrosequencing using a direct quantitative microbial approach. methods: stool samples of healthy smoking human subjects undergoing controlled smoking cessation during a 9-week observational period were analyzed and compared with 2 control groups, ongoing smoking and nonsmoking subjects. fluorescence in situ hybridization was applied to quantify specific bacterial groups. results: intestinal microbiota composition was substantially altered after smoking cessation as characterized by an increase in key representatives from the phyla of firmicutes (clostridium coccoides, eubacterium rectale, and clostridium leptum subgroup) and actinobacteria (hgc bacteria and bifidobacteria) as well as a decrease in bacteroidetes (prevotella spp. and bacteroides spp.) and proteobacteria (beta- and gamma-subgroup of proteobacteria). conclusions: as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, an independent direct quantitative microbial approach, we could confirm that intestinal microbiota composition in humans is influenced by smoking. the characteristics of observed microbial shifts suggest a potential mechanistic association to alterations in body weight subsequent to smoking cessation. more importantly, regarding previously described microbial hallmarks of dysbiosis in inflammatory bowel diseases, a variety of observed microbial alterations after smoking cessation deserve further consideration in view of the divergent effect of smoking on the clinical course of crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

TI  == senior thai fecal microbiota comparison between vegetarians and non-vegetarians using pcr-dgge and real-time pcr.
AB  == the fecal microbiotas were investigated in 13 healthy thai subjects using polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). among the 186 dna bands detected on the polyacrylamide gel, 37 bands were identified as representing 11 species: bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides  ovatus, bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium colicanis, eubacterium eligenes, e. rectale, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, megamonas funiformis, prevotella copri, and roseburia intestinalis, belonging mainly to the groups of bacteroides, prevotella, clostridium, and f. prausnitzii. a dendrogram  of the pcr-dgge divided the subjects; vegetarians and non-vegetarians. the fecal  microbiotas were also analyzed using a quantitative real-time pcr focused on bacteroides, bifidobacterium, enterobacteriaceae, clostrium coccoides-eubacterium rectale, c. leptum, lactobacillus, and prevotella. the nonvegetarian and vegetarian subjects were found to have significant differences in the high abundance of the bacteroides and prevotella genera, respectively. no significant  differences were found in the counts of bifidabacterium, enterobacteriaceae, c. coccoides-e. rectale group, c. leptum group, and lactobacillus. therefore, these  findings on the microbiota of healthy thais consuming different diets could provide helpful data for predicting the health of south east asians with similar  diets.

TI  == changes in mouse gastrointestinal microbial ecology with ingestion of kale.
AB  == kale, a cultivar of brassica oleracea, has attracted a great deal of attention because of its health-promoting effects, which are thought to be exerted through  modulation of the intestinal microbiota. the present study was performed to investigate the effects of kale ingestion on the gastrointestinal microbial ecology of mice. 21 male c57bl/6j mice were divided into three groups and housed  in a specific pathogen-free facility. the animals were fed either a control diet  or experimental diets supplemented with different commercial kale products for 12 weeks. contents of the caecum and colon of the mice were processed for the determination of active bacterial populations by a bacterial rrna-based quantification method and short-chain fatty acids by hplc. rrnas of bacteroides-prevotella, the clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale group, and  clostridium leptum subgroup constituted the major fraction of microbiota regardless of the composition of the diet. the ratio of firmicutes to bacteroidetes was higher in the colon samples of one of the kale diet groups than in the control. the colonic butyrate level was also higher with the kale-supplemented diet. overall, the ingestion of kale tended to either increase  or decrease the activity of specific bacterial groups in the mouse gastrointestinal tract, however, the effect might vary depending on the nutritional composition.

TI  == development of the gut microbiota in southern indian infants from birth to 6 months: a molecular analysis.
AB  == acquisition of the gastrointestinal microbiota at birth may have long-term health impacts. we longitudinally characterised major microbial communities in the faeces of a cohort of infants using molecular methods. faecal samples were prospectively obtained at several time points after birth from eighty-three infants. real-time pcr using sybr green and primers targeted at 16s rrna gene sequences were used to quantify bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus group, bacteroides-prevotella group, enterobacteriaceae, enterococcus, clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale group, clostridium leptum group and staphylococcus. microbial community abundance was expressed relative to amplification of sequences conserved universally for domain bacteria. faecal copy number of 16s rrna genes increased non-significantly from a mean of 4.1 x 10(9)/g on day 1 to 1.1 x 10(10)/g on day 4. all microbial communities were detected from day 1 after birth. enterobacteriaceae and lactobacilli predominated on day 1, while bifidobacteria and staphylocci increased on day 4. bacteroides-prevotella and c.  coccoides-e. rectale increased by day 180. c. leptum was detected in half of the  cohort at birth and in a slightly larger percentage by 6 months. caesarean section was associated with delayed colonisation by several bacterial communities. higher socio-economic status was associated with more abundant lactobacilli and bacteroides-prevotella at 90 and 180 d. supplemental feeding was associated with a reduction in enterobacteriaceae. microbial colonisation of the  gut was well established on the first day of birth, and relative abundance of microbial communities was influenced by mode of delivery, socio-economic status and supplemental feeding. these findings may have relevance to infant nutrition and growth.

TI  == association between the abo blood group and the human intestinal microbiota composition.
AB  == background: the mucus layer covering the human intestinal epithelium forms a dynamic surface for host-microbial interactions. in addition to the environmental factors affecting the intestinal equilibrium, such as diet, it is well established that the microbiota composition is individually driven, but the host  factors determining the composition have remained unresolved. results: in this study, we show that abo blood group is involved in differences in relative proportion and overall profiles of intestinal microbiota. specifically, the microbiota from the individuals harbouring the b antigen (secretor b and ab) differed from the non-b antigen groups and also showed higher diversity of the eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides (erec) and clostridium leptum (clept) -groups in comparison with other blood groups. conclusions: our novel finding indicates that the abo blood group is one of the genetically determined host factors modulating the composition of the human intestinal microbiota, thus enabling new applications in the field of personalized nutrition and medicine.

TI  == faecal microbiota composition in vegetarians: comparison with omnivores in a cohort of young women in southern india.
AB  == the effect of vegetarian diets on faecal microbiota has been explored largely through culture-based techniques. the present study compared the faecal microbiota of vegetarian and omnivorous young women in southern india. faecal samples were obtained from thirty-two lacto-vegetarian and twenty-four omnivorous young adult women from a similar social and economic background. macronutrient intake and anthropometric data were collected. faecal microbiota of interest was  quantified by real-time pcr with sybr green using primers targeting 16s rrna genes of groups, including: clostridium coccoides group (clostridium cluster xiva), roseburia spp.-eubacterium rectale, bacteroides--prevotella group, bifidobacterium genus, lactobacillus group, clostridium leptum group (clostridium cluster iv), faecalibacterium prausnitzii, ruminococcus productus--c. coccoides,  butyrivibrio, enterococcus species and enterobacteriaceae. the groups were matched for age, socio-economic score and anthropometric indices. intake of energy, complex carbohydrates and ca were significantly higher in the omnivorous  group. the faecal microbiota of the omnivorous group was enriched with clostridium cluster xiva bacteria, specifically roseburia-e. rectale. the relative proportions of other microbial communities were similar in both groups.  the butyryl-coa coa-transferase gene, associated with microbial butyrate production, was present in greater amounts in the faeces of omnivores, and the levels were highly correlated with clostridium cluster xiva and roseburia-e. rectale abundance and to a lesser extent with clostridium leptum and f. prausnitzii abundance and with crude fibre intake. omnivores had an increased relative abundance of clostridium cluster xiva bacteria and butyryl-coa coa-transferase gene compared with vegetarians, but we were unable to identify the components of the diet responsible for this difference.

TI  == the currently used commercial dna-extraction methods give different results of clostridial and actinobacterial populations derived from human fecal samples.
AB  == recently several human health-related microbiota studies have had partly contradictory results. as some differences may be explained by methodologies applied, we evaluated how different storage conditions and commonly used dna-extraction kits affect bacterial composition, diversity, and numbers of human fecal microbiota. according to our results, the dna-extraction did not affect the diversity, composition, or quantity of bacteroides spp., whereas after a week's storage at -20 degrees c, the numbers of bacteroides spp. were 1.6-2.5 log units  lower (p < 0.05). furthermore, the numbers of predominant bacteria, eubacterium rectale (erec)-group, clostridium leptum group, bifidobacteria, and atopobium group were 0.5-4 log units higher (p < 0.05) after mechanical dna-extraction as detected with qpcr, regardless of storage. furthermore, the bacterial composition of erec-group differed significantly after different dna-extractions; after enzymatic dna-extraction, the most prevalent genera detected were roseburia (39%  of clones) and coprococcus (10%), whereas after mechanical dna-extraction, the most prevalent genera were blautia (30%), coprococcus (13%), and dorea (10%). according to our results, rigorous mechanical lysis enables detection of higher bacterial numbers and diversity from human fecal samples. as it was shown that the results of clostridial and actinobacterial populations are highly dependent on the dna-extraction methods applied, the use of different dna-extraction protocols may explain the contradictory results previously obtained.

TI  == decreased colonization of fecal clostridium coccoides/eubacterium rectale species from ulcerative colitis patients in an in vitro dynamic gut model with mucin environment.
AB  == the mucus layer in the colon, acting as a barrier to prevent invasion of pathogens, is thinner and discontinuous in patients with ulcerative colitis (uc). a recent developed in vitro dynamic gut model, the m-shime, was used to compare long-term colonization of the mucin layer by the microbiota from six healthy volunteers (hv) and six uc patients and thus distinguish the mucin adhered from the luminal microbiota. although under the same nutritional conditions, short-chain fatty acid production by the luminal communities from uc patients showed a tendency toward a lower butyrate production. a more in-depth community analysis of those microbial groups known to produce butyrate revealed that the diversity of the clostridium coccoides/eubacterium rectale and clostridium leptum group, and counts of faecalibacterium prausnitzii were lower in the luminal fractions of the uc samples. counts of roseburia spp. were lower in the mucosal fractions of the uc samples. qpcr analysis for butyryl-coa:acetate coa transferase, responsible for butyrate production, displayed a lower abundance in  both the luminal and mucosal fractions of the uc samples. the m-shime model revealed depletion in butyrate producing microbial communities not restricted to  the luminal but also in the mucosal samples from uc patients compared to hv.

TI  == use of stable isotopes to measure the metabolic activity of the human intestinal  microbiota.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota is a complex biological system comprising a vast  repertoire of microbes with considerable metabolic activity relevant to both bacterial growth and host health. greater strides have been made in the analysis  of microbial diversity than in the measurement of functional activity, particularly in vivo. stable isotope probing offers a new approach by coupling measurements of metabolic activity with microbial identification. using a low-enrichment labeling strategy in vitro, this study has identified metabolically active bacterial groups via magnetic-bead capture methodology and stable isotope ratio analysis. using five probes (eub338, bac303, bif164, erec482, and clep866), changes in the activities of key intestinal microbial groups were successfully measured by exploiting tracers of de novo rna synthesis. perturbation of the nutrient source with oligofructose generated changes in the activity of bifidobacteria as expected, but also in the bacteroides-prevotella group, the eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides group, and the clostridium leptum subgroup. changes in activity were also observed in response to the medium type. this study suggests that changes in the functional activity of the gut microbiota can be assessed using tracers of de novo nucleic acid synthesis combined with measurement of low isotopic enrichment in 16s rrna. such tracers potentially limit substrate bias because they are universally available to bacteria. this low-enrichment labeling approach does not depend on the commercial availability of specific labeled substrates and can be easily translated to in vivo probing experiments of the functional activity of the microbiota in the human gut.

TI  == low levels of faecal lactobacilli in women with iron-deficiency anaemia in south  india.
AB  == fe deficiency in women contributes significantly to maternal and child morbidity  in india. the intestinal bacterial flora may facilitate absorption of fe from the caecum and proximal colon. the present study investigated the possibility that intestinal microbiota of anaemic young women may differ from that of women with normal hb levels. the microbiota was quantified by real-time pcr in faeces of eight anaemic (hb </= 100 g/l) and twenty-six normohaemic (hb >/= 120 g/l) women  aged 18-25 years. sequences of 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) specific to bifidobacterium genus, lactobacillus acidophilus group, bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group, clostridium leptum group and eubacterium rectale were amplified and expressed (as relative difference) relative to the universally conserved bacterial 16s rdna sequences. dietary intakes of energy, carbohydrate, fibre and fe were ascertained by maintenance of  a diet diary for a week. faecal lactobacilli were significantly lower in anaemic  women (median 6.6 x 10(-8), relative difference compared with total bacteria) than in the reference group (2.9 x 10(-6); p = 0.001, unpaired t test with logarithmic transformation). there was no difference between the two groups with  respect to any of the other bacteria that were examined. intakes of energy, carbohydrate, fibre, fe and milk were similar in both the groups. fe deficiency in young women in south india was associated with low levels of lactobacilli in the faeces. the relationship between lactobacilli and fe deficiency needs to be explored further.

TI  == quantitative analysis of the intestinal bacterial community in one- to three-week-old commercially reared broiler chickens fed conventional or antibiotic-free vegetable-based diets.
AB  == aims: to explore the effect of drug-free poultry production on the intestinal microflora of broiler chickens, the bacterial community of this environment was quantitatively profiled in both conventionally reared birds and birds reared without antibiotic growth promotants (agps) on a vegetable-based diet. methods and results: quantitative, real-time pcr with group-specific 16s rdna primer sets was used to enumerate the abundance of the following chicken gastrointestinal (gi) tract phylogenetic groups: the clostridium leptum-faecalibacterium prausnitzii subgroup (clostridium genus cluster iv), the clostridium coccoides -  eubacterium rectale subgroup (clostridium cluster xiva and xivb), the bacteroides group (including prevotella and porphyromonas), bifidobacterium spp., the enterobacteriaceae, the lactobacillus group (including the genera leuconostoc, pediococcus, aerococcus and weissella), the clostridium perfringens subgroup (clostridium cluster i), enterococcus spp., veillonella spp., atopobium spp., campylobacter spp. and the domain bacteria. a species-specific 5'-nuclease (taqman) assay was also employed to specifically assess cl. perfringens abundance. ten birds were sampled from each of two commercial chicken houses, one in which feed was supplemented with agps and exogenous animal protein, and the other vegetable-based and drug-free, at 7, 14 and 21 days of age. the ileal community was dominated by two large populations, the lactobacilli and the enterobacteriaceae, with those taxa much more numerous in drug-free vegetable-based diet fed birds than those conventionally reared at the 7- and 14-day time periods. the progressive changes in microflora in both the conventional and drug-free caeca were similar to each other, with the enterobacteriaceae sequences dominating at day 7, but being replaced by obligate  anaerobe signature sequences by day 14. of note was the finding that all the day  14 and day 21 replicate caecal samples from the drug-free house were positive for campylobacter spp. averaging >10(8) 16s rdna gene copies per gram wet weight. conclusions: quantitative, real-time pcr indicates that the effects of drug-free  rearing on the chicken gi tract microbial community are most pronounced in the ileal region, but agps may be important in controlling campylobacter colonization of the caecum. significance and impact of the study: a quantitative taxonomic understanding of the shifting microbial ecology of the broiler chicken gut microbiota is important in the light of agp withdrawal. agp withdrawal has occurred in response to concerns over the transfer of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria to humans via the food production chain.

TI  == prevalence and temporal stability of selected clostridial groups in irritable bowel syndrome in relation to predominant faecal bacteria.
AB  == the differences in faecal bacterial population between irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) and control subjects have been reported in several studies. the aim of the  present study was to compare the predominant and clostridial faecal microbiota of ibs subjects and healthy controls by applying denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and a recently developed multiplexed and quantitative hybridization-based technique, transcript analysis with the aid of affinity capture (trac). according to the results, the studied clostridial groups (clostridium histolyticum, clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale, clostridium lituseburense and clostridium leptum) represented the dominant faecal microbiota  of most of the studied subjects, comprising altogether 29-87% of the total bacteria as determined by the hybridized 16s rrna. the c. coccoides-e. rectale group was the dominant subgroup of clostridia, contributing a mean of 43% of the  total bacteria in control subjects and 30% (constipation type) to 50% (diarrhoea  type) in different ibs symptom category subjects. the proportion of the c. coccoides-e. rectale group was found to be significantly lower in the constipation-type ibs subjects than in the control subjects. dna-based pcr-dgge and rna-based rt-pcr-dgge analyses targeted to the predominant bacterial population showed considerable biodiversity as well as uniqueness of the microbiota in each subject, in both control and ibs subject groups. the rt-pcr-dgge profiles of the ibs subjects further indicated higher instability of  the bacterial population compared to the control subjects. the observations suggest that clostridial microbiota, in addition to the instability of the active predominant faecal bacterial population, may be involved in ibs.

TI  == genetic diversity of viable, injured, and dead fecal bacteria assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and 16s rrna gene analysis.
AB  == a novel approach combining a flow cytometric in situ viability assay with 16s rrna gene analysis was used to study the relationship between diversity and activity of the fecal microbiota. simultaneous staining with propidium iodide (pi) and syto bc provided clear discrimination between intact cells (49%), injured or damaged cells (19%), and dead cells (32%). the three subpopulations were sorted and characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rrna gene amplicons obtained from the total and bifidobacterial communities. this analysis revealed that not only the total community but also the distinct subpopulations are characteristic for each individual. cloning and sequencing of the dominant bands of the dgge patterns showed that most of clones  retrieved from the live, injured, and dead fractions belonged to clostridium coccoides, clostridium leptum, and bacteroides. we found that some of the butyrate-producing related bacteria, such as eubacterium rectale and eubacterium  hallii, were obviously viable at the time of sampling. however, amplicons affiliated with bacteroides and ruminococcus obeum- and eubacterium biforme-like  bacteria, as well as butyrivibrio crossotus, were obtained especially from the dead population. furthermore, some bacterial clones were recovered from all sorted fractions, and this was especially noticeable for the clostridium leptum cluster. the bifidobacterial phylotypes identified in total samples and sorted fractions were assigned to bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum,  bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, and bifidobacterium  bifidum. phylogenetic analysis of the live, dead, and injured cells revealed a remarkable physiological heterogeneity within these bacterial populations; b. longum and b. infantis were retrieved from all sorted fractions, while b. adolescentis was recovered mostly from the sorted dead fraction.

TI  == composition of microbiota in content and mucus from cecae of broiler chickens as  measured by fluorescent in situ hybridization with group-specific, 16s rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes.
AB  == six group-specific 16s rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes were used to investigate the composition of the microbiota of cecal content and mucus from broiler chickens. together, the probes hybridized to as many as 94.7% of the bacteria detectable with the universal probe bact338 in the content of the cecum  of 2-d-old chicks. fewer bacteria gave signals with these probes as the birds aged, and coverage was as low as 76% for the bacteria in cecal content of a 6-wk-old chicken. in the cecal content of 2-d-old chicks, approximately 56, 34, and 3% of the bacteria detectable with the universal probe reacted with the probes enter1432 (enterics), lacto722 (lactobacillus/streptococcus/enterococcus), and bif164 (bifidobacteria), respectively. probes clept1240 (clostridium leptum subgroup), erec482 (clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale), and bacto1080 (bacteroides groups) did not produce signals. in cecal content from 1-wk-old chicks, all six probes gave signals, and in samples from 6-wk-old birds approximately 3, 9, 6, 32, 22, and 8% of the bacteria detectable with the universal probe hybridized with the probes enter1432, lacto722, bif164, clept1240, erec482, and bacto1080, respectively. at this age, the six probes detected the phylogenetic groups in similar proportions in the microbiota of cecal content and cecal mucus. the exception was the enterics probe because more  bacteria from the mucus fraction than from cecal content gave signals with this probe (13.4 vs. 4.4%, p<0.001).

TI  == direct analysis of genes encoding 16s rrna from complex communities reveals many  novel molecular species within the human gut.
AB  == the human intestinal tract harbors a complex microbial ecosystem which plays a key role in nutrition and health. although this microbiota has been studied in great detail by culture techniques, microscopic counts on human feces suggest that 60 to 80% of the observable bacteria cannot be cultivated. using comparative analysis of cloned 16s rrna gene (rdna) sequences, we have investigated the bacterial diversity (both cultivated and noncultivated bacteria) within an adult-male fecal sample. the 284 clones obtained from 10-cycle pcr were classified into 82 molecular species (at least 98% similarity). three phylogenetic groups contained 95% of the clones: the bacteroides group, the clostridium coccoides group, and the clostridium leptum subgroup. the remaining clones were distributed among a variety of phylogenetic clusters. only 24% of the molecular species recovered corresponded to described organisms (those whose sequences were available in public databases), and all of these were established  members of the dominant human fecal flora (e.g., bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, fusobacterium prausnitzii, and eubacterium rectale). however, the majority of generated rdna sequences (76%) did not correspond to known organisms and clearly  derived from hitherto unknown species within this human gut microflora.
