TI  - Antibacterial activity of berry juices, an in vitro study.
AB  - Abstract Objective. The aim of the present study was to evaluate in vitro antibacterial activities of blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices on bacteria associated with gingival inflammation. Materials and methods. The growth of selected bacteria (Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus gordonii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was studied in vitro on agar plates. The content of phenols in the different extracts was measured with HPLC-ESI-MS. Results. The spectrometric analysis identified that the highest level of the single phenols studied was found for ferulic acid (113 mug/ml) in blackcurrant juice. Sea buckthorn contained low levels of selected phenols. Total bacterial inhibition for all bacterial species studied was found at 20% berry juice concentration with pH varying between 4.1-5.4. Conclusions. The present study identified that in vitro bacterial growth on agar plates was inhibited by blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices and that low juice pH explains bacterial in vitro growth. This may have clinical implications in biofilm development, reducing the risks for both tooth decay and gingivitis.
TI  - Environment and colonisation sequence are key parameters driving cooperation and  competition between Pseudomonas aeruginosa cystic fibrosis strains and oral commensal streptococci.
AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF) patient airways harbour diverse microbial consortia that, in addition to the recognized principal pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, include other bacteria commonly regarded as commensals. The latter include the oral (viridans) streptococci, which recent evidence indicates play an active role during infection of this environmentally diverse niche. As the interactions between inhabitants of the CF airway can potentially alter disease progression, it is important to identify key cooperators/competitors and environmental influences if therapeutic intervention is to be improved and pulmonary decline arrested. Importantly, we recently showed that virulence of the P. aeruginosa Liverpool Epidemic Strain (LES) could be potentiated by the Anginosus-group of streptococci (AGS). In the present study we explored the relationships between other viridans streptococci (Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus sanguinis) and the LES and observed that co-culture outcome was dependent upon inoculation sequence and environment. All four streptococcal species were shown to potentiate LES virulence factor production in co-culture biofilms. However, in the case of S. oralis interactions were environmentally determined; in air cooperation within a high cell density co-culture biofilm occurred together with stimulation of LES virulence factor production, while in an atmosphere containing added CO2 this species became a competitor antagonising LES growth through hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, significantly altering biofilm population dynamics and appearance. Streptococcus mitis, S. gordonii and S. sanguinis were also capable of H2O2 mediated inhibition of P. aeruginosa growth, but this was only visible when inoculated as a primary coloniser prior to introduction of the LES. Therefore, these observations, which are made in conditions relevant to the biology of CF disease pathogenesis, show that the pathogenic and colonisation potential of P. aeruginosa isolates can be modulated positively and negatively by the presence of oral commensal streptococci.
TI  - Oral streptococci and nitrite-mediated interference of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The oral cavity harbors a diverse community of microbes that are physiologically  unique. Oral microbes that exist in this polymicrobial environment can be pathogenic or beneficial to the host. Numerous oral microbes contribute to the formation of dental caries and periodontitis; however, there is little understanding of the role these microbes play in systemic infections. There is mounting evidence that suggests that oral commensal streptococci are cocolonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa during cystic fibrosis pulmonary infections and that the presence of these oral streptococci contributes to improved lung function. The goal of this study was to examine the underlying mechanism by which Streptococcus parasanguinis antagonizes pathogenic P. aeruginosa. In this study, we discovered that oral commensal streptococci, including Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Streptococcus gordonii, inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa and that this inhibition is mediated by the presence of nitrite and the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by oral streptococci. The requirement of both H2O2 and nitrite for the inhibition of P. aeruginosa is due to the generation of reactive nitrogenous intermediates (RNI), including peroxynitrite. Transposon mutagenesis showed that a P. aeruginosa mutant defective in a putative ABC transporter permease is resistant to both streptococcus/nitrite- and peroxynitrite-mediated killing. Furthermore, S. parasanguinis protects Drosophila melanogaster from killing by P. aeruginosa in a nitrite-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that the combination of nitrite and H2O2 may represent a unique anti-infection strategy by oral streptococci during polymicrobial infections.
TI  - Susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, Resilon/RealSeal (RS). To determine if RS is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show RS degradation. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Emulsions of RS were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. Lipase PS served as a positive control. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade RS. The bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for RS degradation for 7 days. RESULTS: Degradation of the emulsified RS manifested in the formation of clear zones around P aeruginosa, P intermedia, P asaccharolytica, S aureus, and S epidermidis. No degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain RS emulsion. CONCLUSION: Endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade RS. These findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with RS may be impaired by a microbial insult.
TI  - Effective release of a broad spectrum antibiotic from elastin-like polypeptide-collagen composite.
AB  - Preparation of hydrogels that possess an effective antibiotic release profile and better mechanical properties compared to the traditionally used collagen hydrogels has the potential to minimize post-surgical infections and support wound healing. Toward this goal, we prepared elastin-like polypeptide (ELP)-collagen composite hydrogels that displayed a significantly higher elastic modulus compared to the collagen hydrogels. We then characterized the release behavior of the collagen and ELP-collagen hydrogels loaded with varying dosages (1-5% w/w) of a commonly used broad spectrum antibiotic, doxycycline hyclate. Both collagen and ELP-collagen hydrogels showed a gradual time dependent doxycycline release over a period of 5 days. The ELP-collagen hydrogels, in general, showed a slower release of the doxycycline compared to the collagen hydrogels. The released doxycycline was found to be effective against four bacterial strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus sanguinis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) in a dose dependent manner. Combined with their improved mechanical properties, the gradual and effective drug release from the biocompatible ELP-collagen hydrogels shown here may be beneficial for drug delivery and tissue engineering applications.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of Iranian green-tea-containing mouthrinse vs chlorhexidine  0.2%: an in vitro study.
AB  - PURPOSE: Considering the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of green tea, this study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial effect of mouthrinses containing green tea extract vs 0.2% chlorhexidine on selected microorganisms in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antibacterial activity of both mouthrinses and the pure green tea extract was assessed by using disk diffusion and the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods against five microorganisms: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aerogenosa and Escherichia coli. Growth inhibition zones were measured in mm after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. The two mouthrinses were assessed at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 mg/ml to determine the MIC, which was interpreted as the lowest concentration of the agent that completely inhibited the growth of the test species. RESULTS: 0.2% chlorhexidine produced a larger zone of growth inhibition than did the mouthrinse made of green tea extract (P < 0.01). Paradoxically, the growth inhibition zones of the tested bacteria were significantly larger in pure extract of green tea than in 0.2% chlorhexidine (P < 0.01). The chlorhexidine mouthrinse inhibited the growth of all tested species and exhibited significantly lower MICs than did the green tea mouthrinse (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Even though the mouthrinse made with green tea extract presented an in vitro antimicrobial activity inferior to 0.2% chlorhexidine, the pure extract had considerable bactericidal effect.
TI  - [Evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (SNP's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for therapeutic purposes. It is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal SNP's possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of SNP's against cariogenic bacteria: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mitis responsible for initiation of dental carries. Tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. Nanotechnology creates a new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. METHODS: Colloidal silver solution (CSS) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. Nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis and S, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs of 7 patients treated for dental carries at Department of Conservative Dentistry, Medical University of Warsaw. MIC and MBC values for CSS's were evaluated. RESULTS: CSS used in this research is of good stability. No agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. Silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. MIC values were: 12-25 ppm for S. salivarius, 25 ppm for S. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for S. mitis and 50 ppm for S. mutans, while MBC values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. After 24 hours of contact MBC values were: 25-50 ppm for S. salivarius and S. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for S. mitis and 200 ppmfor S. mutans. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial properties of CSS depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. The susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. Sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.
TI  - [Comparison of in vitro antimicrobial activities of bioaggregate and mineral trioxide aggregate].
AB  - Treatment outcome of endodontic perforations depends on successful elimination of the associated microorganisms and infected tissues as well as the effective seal of the root-end or perforation site to prevent future contamination. Ideally, perforation repair material has to be bacteriostatic or bactericidal in order to prevent bacterial contamination as well as good sealing properties and biocompatibility. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of BioAggregate (BA) and Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) on the standard strains of Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using the agar disc diffusion test. Colonies of each strains were harvested from the medium and microorganisms were diluted to obtain a suspension of approximately 108 cfu/ml. Petri plates with blood agar base with 5% sheep blood or Sabouraud dextrose agar (for C.albicans) were inoculated with experimental suspensions and BA and MTA discs prepared as 2 mm length and 6 mm diameter were placed. After 24 and 48 hours incubation, the diameters of the zones of inhibition were measured. The results of the disc diffusion tests showed that BA and MTA were effective on the tested microorganisms at 24 and 48 hours incubation periods. BA and MTA showed similar antimicrobial effects on C.albicans and E.coli. BA was more effective than MTA on S.mutans, E.faecalis and P.aeruginosa, however MTA was more effective than BA on S.sanguinis at 48 hours. When the time efficiency of the materials were compared, there was no statistically difference between 24 to 48 hours on E.coli, E.faecalis, S.mutans, S.sanguinis in both two groups (p> 0.05). There was statistically significant decrease 24 to 48 hours on C.albicans in BA and MTA groups and P.aeruginosa in BA group (p< 0.05). It can be concluded that although BA and MTA displayed similar antimicrobial efficacy on the tested microorganisms newly improved material BA demonstrated superior antimicrobial activity than other.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of different concentrations of garlic (Allium sativum) extract on dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allium sativum, commonly known as garlic, exhibits antibacterial effects against a wide range of bacteria. AIM: The objective of this in vitro study was to assess the antibacterial effect of different concentrations of garlic extract against human dental plaque microbiota. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antibacterial activities of four different concentrations of garlic extract (5%, 10%, 20%, and 100%) were evaluated against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and lactobacillus spp. using the disk diffusion method. Papers soaked in 0.2% concentration chlorhexidine gluconate and saline were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The data were subjected to one-way ANOVA and the Tukey multiple comparisons test at a 5% significance level. RESULTS: All bacterial strains were inhibited by all test materials. The inhibition zones of the different concentrations of garlic extract were not significantly different for S. mutans, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius. For P. aeruginosa and lactobacillus spp. the inhibition zones of 5%, 10% and 20% concentrations were not significantly different from one another, but they were significantly more than that of the 100% extract. CONCLUSION: The 5%, 10%, 20%, and 100% concentrations of garlic extract had similar effects, so further studies seem to be indicated on the usefulness of the 5% extract.
TI  - Suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suppuration (SUP) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. The aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with SUP in patients with chronic (CP) and aggressive (AgP) periodontitis. METHODS: A total of 156 patients with CP and 66 with AgP were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). The counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. Comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests, respectively. Associations between frequency of SUP and bacterial species were analyzed by the Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The prevalence of SUP in patients with CP was 24.4%, and in patients with AgP it was 30.3%, and the percentage of SUP sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (P >0.05). SUP sites from patients with CP had significantly higher counts of Veillonella parvula, Dialister pneumosintes, Tannerella forsythia, and Prevotella nigrescens than SUP sites from patients with AgP (P <0.005). Significant positive correlations between high frequency of SUP and high levels of Actinomyces spp, Streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with CP (P <0.05). In patients with AgP, Actinomyces oris, Propionibacterium acnes, P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with SUP, whereas Prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with SUP (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: SUP sites from patients with CP harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than SUP sites from patients with AgP. Actinomyces spp., Streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, T. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with SUP.
TI  - [Comparison of culture and real-time PCR methods in the detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae in acute otitis media effusion specimens].
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are the major etiologic agents of acute otitis media. This study was aimed to compare the detection rate of S.pneumoniae and H.influenzae by culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (Rt-PCR) in the middle ear effusions of patients diagnosed as acute otitis media. A total of 60 middle ear effusion samples collected from children with acute otitis media were included in the study. The samples were inoculated and incubated in BACTEC Ped Plus blood culture bottles and BACTEC 9120 system (BD Diagnostic Systems, MD), respectively, and the isolates were identified by conventional methods. For the molecular diagnosis of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae, ply pneumolysin gene and HIB capsule region, respectively were amplified by Rt-PCR (LightCycler, Roche Diagnostics, Germany). H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae were isolated from 5 (8.3%) and 3 (5%) of the patient samples with conventional culture methods, respectively. In addition in 11.6% of the samples other microorganisms (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus sanguinis, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans) were also isolated. On the other hand H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae were detected in 38 (63.3%) and 24 (40%) of the samples with Rt-PCR, respectively. There was about eight fold increase in the detection frequency of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae with Rt-PCR compared to culture methods. When culture was accepted as the gold standard method, the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of Rt-PCR in the detection of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae were estimated as 80%, 51% and 98.2%, respectively. As a result, Rt-PCR was shown to be a sensitive method and could be preferred for the rapid diagnosis of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae in the etiological diagnosis of acute otitis media, especially in culture negative cases.
TI  - Design, structural and spectroscopic elucidation, and the in vitro biological activities of new diorganotin dithiocarbamates.
AB  - The reaction of 2,2-dimethoxy-N-methylethyllamine or 2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane with  CS(2) in alkaline media produced two novel dithiocarbamate salts. Subsequent reactions with organotin halides yielded six new complexes: [SnMe(2){S(2)CNR(R(1))(2)}(2)] (1), [Sn(n-Bu)(2){S(2)CNR(R(1))(2)}(2)] (2), [SnPh(2){S(2)CNR(R(1))(2)}(2)] (3), [SnMe(2){S(2)CNR(R(2))(2)}(2)] (4), [Sn(n-Bu)(2){S(2)CNR(R(2))(2)}(2)] (5), [SnPh(2){S(2)CNR(R(2))(2)}(2)] (6), where R = methyl, R(1) = CH(2)CH(OMe)(2), and R(2) = 2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane. All compounds were identified in terms of infrared, (1)H and (13)C NMR, and the complexes were also characterized using (119)Sn NMR, (119)Sn Mossbauer and X-ray crystallography. The biological activity of all derivatives has been screened in terms of IC(90) and IC(50) against Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus parasiticus, Penicillium citrinum, Curvularia senegalensis, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus sanguinis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella typhimurium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the results correlated well with a performed study of structure-activity relationship (SAR). Complexes (3), (5) and (6) displayed the best IC(90) and IC(50) in the presence of the fungi, greater than that of miconazole, used as control drug.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of sphingoid bases and fatty acids against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - There is growing evidence that the role of lipids in innate immunity is more important than previously realized. How lipids interact with bacteria to achieve a level of protection, however, is still poorly understood. To begin to address the mechanisms of antibacterial activity, we determined MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of lipids common to the skin and oral cavity--the sphingoid bases D-sphingosine, phytosphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine and the fatty acids sapienic acid and lauric acid--against four Gram-negative bacteria and seven Gram-positive bacteria. Exact Kruskal-Wallis tests of these values showed differences among lipid treatments (P < 0.0001) for each bacterial species except Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. D-sphingosine (MBC range, 0.3 to 19.6 mug/ml), dihydrosphingosine (MBC range, 0.6 to 39.1 mug/ml), and phytosphingosine (MBC range, 3.3 to 62.5 mug/ml) were active against all bacteria except S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa (MBC > 500 mug/ml). Sapienic acid (MBC range, 31.3 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mitis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum but not active against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa, Corynebacterium bovis, Corynebacterium striatum, and Corynebacterium jeikeium (MBC > 500 mug/ml). Lauric acid (MBC range, 6.8 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against all bacteria except E. coli, S. marcescens, and P. aeruginosa (MBC > 500 mug/ml). Complete killing was achieved as early as 0.5 h for some lipids but took as long as 24 h for others. Hence, sphingoid bases and fatty acids have different antibacterial activities and may have potential for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention in infection.
TI  - Influence of hyaluronic acid on bacterial and fungal species, including clinically relevant opportunistic pathogens.
AB  - Hyaluronic acid (HA) has several clinical applications (aesthetic surgery, dermatology, orthopaedics and ophtalmology). Following recent evidence, suggesting antimicrobial and antiviral properties for HA, we investigated its effects on 15 ATCC strains, representative of clinically relevant bacterial and fungal species. The in vitro system employed allowed to assess optical density of broth cultures as a measure of microbial load in a time-dependent manner. The results showed that different microbial species and, sometimes, different strains belonging to the same species, are differently affected by HA. In particular, staphylococci, enterococci, Streptococcus mutans, two Escherichia coli strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida glabrata and C. parapsilosis displayed a HA dose-dependent growth inhibition; no HA effects were detected in E. coli ATCC 13768 and C. albicans; S. sanguinis was favoured by the highest HA dose. Therefore, the influence of HA on bacteria and fungi warrants further studies aimed at better establishing its relevance in clinical applications.
TI  - Reduced-oxidized difference spectral analysis and chemiluminescence-based Scatchard analysis demonstrate selective binding of myeloperoxidase to microbes.
AB  - Myeloperoxidase (MPO), a microbicidal haloperoxidase of neutrophil leukocytes, was observed to selectively bind to bacteria. Binding was quantified by dithionite-reduced minus oxidized (R-O) difference spectral analysis. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed large MPO binding by R-O difference spectral analysis, whereas Streptococcus sanguinis did not. For increased sensitivity, free and microbe-bound MPO and chloroperoxidase (CPO) activities were quantified by acid-optimum haloperoxidase-dependent chemiluminescence (CL) measurements, and these data were used for Scatchard analysis. The MPO bound/free (B/F) CL ratio was 49.5 for P. aeruginosa, 14.6 for Staphylococcus aureus, 2.8 for E. coli, 0.7 for Candida albicans and 0.4 for S. sanguinis. By comparison, the CPO B/F CL ratio was 0.03 for P. aeruginosa, 0.09 for S. aureus, 0.31 for E. coli, 0.18 for C. albicans and 0.16 for S. sanguinis. As a member of the lactic acid family of bacteria and a viridans streptococcus, S. sanguinis does not synthesize cytochromes and is catalase-negative. The metabolic products of S. sanguinis, i.e. lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, provide optimal acidity and substrate for MPO oxidation of chloride to hypochlorite. Hypochlorite can react with organic substrates to yield dehydrogenated or chlorinated products, but when peroxide is not limiting, hypochlorite reacts with peroxide yielding singlet oxygen. The reactivity of hypochlorite is dependent on substrate availability. The microsecond half-life of electronically excited singlet oxygen restricts reactivity to within a radius of <0.25 microm; i.e. the reactivity of singlet oxygen is both substrate and half-life dependent. Poor MPO binding provides protection and possibly competitive advantage to viridans streptococci.
TI  - Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE gene loci in viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. However, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (CF) airways has not yet been examined. The aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (VGS), in terms of MICs and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs). METHODS: The MICs of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the QRDRs for 190 isolates of VGS, originating from the sputa of adult CF patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. VGS organisms included Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus australis and Streptococcus mutans. Ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and QRDRs within the gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MICs >/=8 mg/L) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (MICs 4 mg/L). As a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive VGS organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-CF patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. Five novel QRDR PCR assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the CF VGS population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential QRDR resistance mutations. Double mutations in gyrA and parC/parE led to MICs of 16 to >64 mg/L, while single mutations in parC or parE resulted in MICs of 8-32 mg/L and 8 mg/L, respectively. The mean homologies of each species to Streptococcus pneumoniae R6 were: gyrA, 70.3%-95%; gyrB, 69.6%-96.2%; parC, 76.1%-94.8%; and parE, 70.7%-94.7%. The close relatives of S. pneumoniae, S. mitis and S. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of P. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with CF may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal VGS flora, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the Streptococcus milleri group.
TI  - Myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  - Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. The present study provides direct evidence of MPO binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. The microbicidal effectiveness of H(2)O(2) and of OCl(-) was compared to that of MPO plus H(2)O(2). Synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining Streptococcus sanguinis, a H(2)O(2)-producing microbe showing low MPO binding, with high-MPO-binding Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous H(2)O(2), with and without MPO, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [RBCs]). Selectivity of MPO microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the MPO MIC and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) for 82 bacteria including E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. Both H(2)O(2) and OCl(-) destroyed RBCs at submicrobicidal concentrations. Nanomolar concentrations of MPO increased H(2)O(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. Streptococci plus MPO produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and RBCs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. MPO directly killed H(2)O(2)-producing S. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-H(2)O(2)-producing E. faecalis. The MPO MICs and MBCs for E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus were significantly lower than those for E. faecalis. The streptococcal studies showed much higher MIC/MBC results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. E. faecalis MPO binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. Selective MPO binding results in selective killing.
TI  - Mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  - The oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. When this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. Generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. The mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. Several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the Streptococcus (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis) and Staphylococcus (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis. In addition, some members of both the Streptococcus and the Staphylococcus genera, as well as Porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. The current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. The pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.
TI  - Bactericidal activity in filtrated supernatant of Streptococcus sanguinis against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - In the past decade, multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) infection has become a serious clinical problem, due to the limitation of drug choices to fight against the bacteria. Here we explored the bactericidal activity in the filtrated supernatant of Streptococcus (S.) sanguinis against Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa. S. sanguinis is one of the alpha-hemolytic streptococci that commonly reside in the human oral cavity. A strain of S. sanguinis, isolated from the sputum of a pulmonary-disease patient, was cultured for overnight. The filtered supernatant was tested for bactericidal effect using the minimum bactericidal concentration method on 20 strains of P. aeruginosa, including two MDRP and five mucoid-type strains. The viable number of P. aeruginosa was decreased with time after exposing to the filtrated supernatant of S. sanguinis, and collapsed bacteria were detected with electron microscopy. Of the 20 strains, 19 (95%) strains of P. aeruginosa were affected by bactericidal effect. Among other species of bacteria examined, the filtrated supernatant of S. sanguinis showed remarkable bactericidal effect on 49% of indole-positive Proteus species (4/9 strains) and 60% of Acinetobacter (A.) baumannii (6/10 strains). We next investigated the property of bactericidal activity in filtrated supernatant by treating with proteinase K or autoclave. There was no change in the bactericidal activity of the filtrated supernatant after each treatment, excluding the involvement of protein and plasmid. Here, we identify the bactericidal activity in the filtrated supernatant of S. sanguinis against MDRP. This unexpected observation may contribute to the development of a novel therapeutic drug against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Binding of porcine ficolin-alpha to lipopolysaccharides from Gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acids from Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Protein(s) reactive with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) was isolated from porcine nonimmune serum. The molecular weight of the purified protein was found to be mainly 40 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. The N-terminal 10 amino acid sequence of the purified protein were found to be identical to that of porcine ficolin-alpha reported previously. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the purified protein was found to react with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from different Gram-negative bacteria such as Esherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella abortus equi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexeneri, and Serratia marcescens and with lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus sanguis, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The purified protein also reacted with E. coli O26 isolated from food poisoning and bovine feces and heat-treated Gram-positive bacteria such as S. aureus, B. cereus, B. subtilis, Enterococcus faecium, and Corynebacterum bovis. On the other hand, porcine IgG isolated from nonimmune serum showed different reactivity with these LPS, LTA, and heat-treated bacterial cells. From the present findings, purified porcine serum protein reactive with GlcNAc is concluded to be ficolin-alpha playing an important role(s) in innate immunity against microbial infection with Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
TI  - Infective endocarditis in patients with liver cirrhosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Infective endocarditis complicating liver cirrhosis is infrequently reported. This study evaluated the clinical features of infective endocarditis in Taiwanese patients with liver cirrhosis. METHODS: All cases of infective endocarditis occurring in patients with liver cirrhosis from December 1995 to December 2002 were included in this study. Data were collected by retrospective chart review. RESULTS: Twenty six patients (18 males, 8 females) with median age 6 years (range, 43 to 87) were included. The etiology of liver cirrhosis was hepatitis virus infection in 20 patients. There were 7 nosocomial infections. Bacterial pathogens were identified in 25 patients, with Staphylococcus aureus (n = 8), viridans streptococci (n = 4), Streptococcus sanguis (n = 2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2), and Enterococcus faecalis (n = 2) the most common isolates. The hospital mortality rate was 27%. Patients with in-hospital death were more likely to have a history of uremia, staphylococcal infection, nosocomial infection and less likely to have aortic valve infection. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of patients with infective endocarditis and liver cirrhosis was poor. Infection with Staphylococcus species was a dominant cause and methicillin resistance was common.
TI  - The effects of chlorhexidine gluconate (0.12%) on the antimicrobial properties of tooth-colored ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate.
AB  - The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether the substitution of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for sterile water as a mixing agent would enhance the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) against Actinomyces odontolyticus (ATCC17982), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC2586), Streptococcus sanguis (ATCC10556), Enterococcus faecalis (ER3/2S), Escherichia coli (SM10lambdapir), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC6538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (UME), and Candida albicans (ATCC10261). Two wells of 5-mm diameter were made in triplicate agar plates inoculated with standardized suspensions of each microorganism. MTA (33 mg) mixed with chlorhexidine (12 microl) or sterile water (12 microl) was placed to fill each well. Plates were incubated at 37 degrees C as required for microbial growth. A blinded, independent observer measured zones of inhibition. All MTA samples inhibited microbial growth regardless of mixing agent. MTA/chlorhexidine showed significantly larger zones of inhibition (p < 0.0002, paired t test). In conclusion, substituting 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for water enhanced the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored ProRoot MTA.
TI  - Preliminary evaluation of bioactive glass S53P4 as an endodontic medication in vitro.
AB  - Calcium hydroxide is the "gold standard" endodontic medication, but it may fail to eliminate certain facultative bacteria and yeasts found in root canal systems. In this study, standardized bovine dentin blocks infected with Enterococcus faecalis were treated with an aqueous calcium hydroxide or bioactive glass S53P4 (BAG) powder suspension. While calcium hydroxide was ineffective, the BAG suspension eliminated the infection in the sampled dentin layers after 5 days. In a direct exposure test, preincubation with human dentin boosted the BAG-killing efficacy against E. faecalis ATCC29212, Candida albicans CCUG19915, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC9027, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC10556, and S. mutans ATCC25175. BAG placed in the root canals of extracted teeth did not alter root-dentin pH. Consequently, the conditions under which the microbiota were killed were not pH-mediated. Further studies are ongoing to help clarify the antimicrobial BAG effect in the presence of dentin.
TI  - Lactoferrampin: a novel antimicrobial peptide in the N1-domain of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of bovine lactoferrin is attributed to lactoferricin,  situated in the N1-domain. Based on common features of antimicrobial peptides, a second putative antimicrobial domain was identified in the N1-domain of lactoferrin, designated lactoferrampin. This novel peptide exhibited candidacidal activity, which was substantially higher than the activity of lactoferrin. Furthermore, lactoferrampin was active against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not against the fermenting bacteria Actinomyces naeslundii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis. Notably, lactoferrampin is located in the N1-domain in close proximity to lactoferricin, which plays a crucial role in membrane-mediated activities of lactoferrin.
TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of 'MGP' gutta-percha in vitro.
AB  - AIM: To determine whether 'MGP' gutta-percha (Westport, CT, USA), a commercially  available gutta-percha containing iodoform, inhibits the growth of potential endodontic pathogens. METHODOLOGY: Inocula of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus sanguis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces odontolyticus were spread onto the surface of agar plates. 'MGP' gutta-percha cones presoaked in sterile water were transferred to the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees C aerobically or anaerobically as required for optimal growth. Identical studies were performed using iodoform-free gutta-percha and sterile paper disks saturated with 10% povidone-iodine. Following incubation, zones of inhibition around the 'MGP' gutta-percha, iodoform-free gutta-percha and disks were evaluated. RESULTS: Povidone-iodine inhibited all the strains. Iodoform-free gutta-percha inhibited S. sanguis and A. odontolyticus. 'MGP' gutta-percha inhibited S. aureus, S. sanguis, A. odontolyticus and F. nucleatum. Neither iodoform-free gutta-percha nor 'MGP' gutta-percha inhibited growth of E. faecalis, E. coli or P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to iodoform-free gutta-percha, iodoform-containing 'MGP' gutta-percha had an inhibitory effect in vitro on S. aureus and F. nucleatum, but not on E. faecalis, E. coli or P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Defense mechanisms of urinary bladder: studies on antimicrobial polypeptides from bladder mucosa.
AB  - The acid-soluble extract of the bladder mucosal surface was obtained by washing out the bladder with dilute acetic acid in the presence of protease inhibitors. The wash-out materials from rats, rabbits, pigs, and humans manifested strong bactericidal activity against E. coli in vitro. The ultrafiltrate of the human material, which contained two major peptides with apparent molecular masses of 6.7 kD and 8.5 kD, respectively, showed potent bactericidal activity against E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus sanguis. Three antibacterial polypeptides (PiBPs) were purified from the porcine material. The molecular masses of PiBP-5, PiBP-11 and PiBP-25 were 5773.3 Da, 11127.8 Da and 25073 Da, respectively. PiBP-5 was unusually rich in glycine, serine and threonine residues (20.0, 16.3 and 10.4 mol%, respectively), and N-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed that PiBP-5 was homologous (83.3% identity in an 18 residue overlay) to the "tail" of human cytokeratin-7. Although the amino acid compositions of PiBP-11 and PiBP-25 were established, both had blocked N-termini and primary sequence data were not obtained. These results provided evidence indicating that the presence of peptides in the bladder mucosa could enable it to kill adherent bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Hydrastis canadensis extract and its major isolated alkaloids.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of extract and isolated major alkaloids (berberine, beta-hydrastine, canadine and canadaline) of Hydrastis canadensis L. (Ranunculaceae) was evaluated against 6 strains of microorganism: Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25 993 and ATCC 6538P), Streptococcus sanguis (ATCC 10 556), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25 922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27 853). Bactericidal activity was evaluated by contact test by measuring the "killing time" on a low density bacterial inoculum, and bacteriostatic activity in liquid medium by M.I.C. values. The results provide a rational basis for the traditional antibacterial use of Hydrastis canadensis.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of histidine-rich polypeptides in human parotid saliva].
AB  - Two ultrasensitive antibacterial assays were applied to determine the antibacterial activity of histidine-rich polypeptides (HRPs) in human parotid saliva. The results not only confirmed the potent antibacterial activity of HRPs against Streptococcus mutans MT6R, but also showed for the first time that HRPs were effectively antibacterial to Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ML-35p and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Among HRPs, HRP3, HRP5 and HRP6 were the major antibacterial components which were active against S. mutans, S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, whereas HRP1 was only effective against E. coli. S. sanguis was resistant to the action of HRPs. These results suggest that HRPs are actually a family of endogenous antibiotic peptides with broad antimicrobial spectrum including fungi, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and may play an important role in the prevention of various infection diseases in the oral cavity as well as in the resistance to caries.
TI  - [Bact-Alert system for hemocultures: evaluation of terminal subcultures].
AB  - Few laboratory microbiological procedures are as important as the isolation of microorganisms from blood. To evaluate the usefulness of the terminal subcultures, 5669 blood cultures giving negative results after 7 days of incubation in the Bact/Alert System (Organon Teknika) were studied. Bottles were distributed as follows: 1562 adult aerobic bottles, 119 adult anaerobic bottles, 3960 pediatric bottles and 28 FAN bottles. From 5669 blood cultures, 10 subcultures that yielded growth had not been detected by the system. These included 5 adult aerobic bottles and 5 pediatric bottles, 7 of these microorganisms were considered contaminants according to clinical data (2 Micrococcus spp, 1 staphylococci coagulase negative, 1 Burkholderia cepacia, 1 Peptoestreptococcus spp, 1 Corynebacterium spp, 1 Scedosporium spp) while the other 3 were considered true bacteremia (1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 Proteus mirabilis, 1 Streptococcus sanguis), although no one made any change in treatment on the basis of the previous isolation. Based on these results the routinary utilization of terminal subcultures is not advisable and should be used only for special cases or a second system of blood culture should be added according to clinical or epidemiological data.
TI  - Colorimetric indicators of microbial contamination in corneal preservation medium.
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare acid-base and oxidation-reduction indicators and to investigate the effect of buffer and temperature on the colorimetric detection of microbial growth in corneal preservation media. METHODS: Corneal preservation media containing gentamicin, without or with HEPES buffer, were prepared with either phenol red or AlamarBlue indicators (AccuMed International, Westlake, OH, U.S.A.). Both media were inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, or Candida albicans and then incubated at 4 degrees C, 22 degrees C, or 35 degrees C. The pH or percent reduction were determined hourly for eight hours, then daily for one week. RESULTS: The length of time before a confirmed change in pH or reduction occurred varied by microorganism, storage temperature, and buffering capacity. At 4 degrees C, none of the microorganisms caused a detectable pH change in buffered medium within one day after inoculation, although two bacterial species reduced AlamarBlue within four hours. At 22 degrees C and 35 degrees C, all bacteria except P. aeruginosa produced a pH shift within a few hours, and all tested bacterial species reduced AlamarBlue. For bacteria producing detectable pH changes, HEPES-buffered medium took longer to change than medium without HEPES. C. albicans was not detectable in HEPES-buffered medium at any temperature by phenol red and was only detectable by AlamarBlue after 2-3 days at 22 degrees C and 35 degrees C. CONCLUSION: Acidic shifts in refrigerated corneal preservation medium do not occur during contamination by several microorganisms. AlamarBlue, a redox indicator, is more sensitive than phenol red in detecting some bacteria. C. albicans is not reliably detected by pH or redox indicators.
TI  - IB-367, a protegrin peptide with in vitro and in vivo activities against the microflora associated with oral mucositis.
AB  - Although the microflora associated with oral mucositis initiated by cytotoxic therapy is not well characterized, several studies suggest that reduction of the microbial load in the oral cavity has some clinical benefit. The MICs of IB-367, a synthetic protegrin analog, ranged from 0.13 to 64 microgram/ml for gram-positive bacteria (Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, and Staphylococcus aureus) and from 0.06 to 8 microgram/ml for gram-negative species (Klebsiella, Escherichia, and Pseudomonas). IB-367 exhibited rapid, microbicidal activity against both log- and stationary-phase cultures of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. At concentrations near the MICs for these two organisms (4 and 2 microgram/ml, respectively), IB-367 reduced viability by more than 3 logs in less than 16 min. Similarly, IB-367 effected a 4-log reduction of the endogenous microflora in pooled human saliva within 2 min at 250 microgram/ml, a concentration readily attained by local delivery. After nine serial transfers at 0.5x the MIC, the MIC of IB-367 for MRSA and P. aeruginosa increased only two to four times. In a phase I clinical study with healthy volunteers, IB-367 was well tolerated, with no detectable systemic absorption. One hour after treatment with 9 mg of IB-367, the prevalence of gram-negative bacteria and yeast was reduced, and the density of the predominant gram-positive oral flora was decreased 1,000 times. IB-367's properties (speed of killing, breadth of spectrum, and lack of resistance) make the compound a strong candidate for the prophylaxis of oral mucositis. Phase II clinical trials with IB-367 are under way for this indication in immunocompromised subjects.
TI  - An evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: Facultative aerobes-anaerobes: Candida albicans ATCC 10231; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212; Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27,853; Streptococcus mitis ATCC 9811; Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419; and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556. Microaerophiles: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522. Obligate anaerobes: Actinomyces odontolyticus ATCC 17929; Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25,586; Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277; and Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845. Each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. Results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.
TI  - Pacemaker-related endocarditis. Report of 7 cases and review of the literature.
AB  - We report on 7 patients with pacemaker endocarditis diagnosed during the workup of long-standing fever. Persistent positive blood cultures and echocardiography led to the diagnosis in 6 patients whereas autopsy was diagnostic in another. Causative microorganisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis (3), Staphylococcus lugdunensis (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), Streptococcus bovis (1), and Streptococcus mitis-Streptococcus sanguis (1). Pulmonary embolism was present in nearly 50% of the cases, a figure clearly higher than previously reported. In all but 1 case the initial medical approach was not successful, and thus the pacing system was finally removed. None of the cases relapsed after the removal. We have reviewed the literature regarding pacemaker endocarditis, particularly with respect to treatment.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of GV129606, a new broad-spectrum trinem.
AB  - GV129606 is a new parenteral trinem antibiotic belonging to the beta-lactam class. It combines broad-spectrum activity (against gram-negative and -positive bacteria, aerobes and anaerobes), with high potency and resistance to beta-lactamases. Comparative in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities were determined for GV129606 against more than 400 recent clinical isolates (aerobes, including beta-lactamase producers, and anaerobes), using representative antibacterial agents (meropenem, piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin for aerobes and metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin, and clindamycin for anaerobes). Against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococci, GV129606 and meropenem were the most active of the drugs tested. GV129606 showed an MIC for 90% of strains tested (MIC90) ranging from < or =0.015 to 0.06 microg/ml against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, GV129606, meropenem, and cefpirome showed MIC90s of < or =0.015 and 1 microg/ml, respectively. Meropenem was the most active compound against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae with MIC90s of < or =0.5 microg/ml. Against these species, GV129606 possessed activity superior to those of piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, and gentamicin, with MIC90s of < or =8 microg/ml, but its activity was two- to sixfold less than that of ciprofloxacin (with the exception of Proteus rettgeri and Providencia stuartii). Haemophilus spp., Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also included in the spectrum of GV129606. GV129606 showed good antianaerobe activity, similar to metronidazole. It was stable against all clinically relevant beta-lactamases (similar to meropenem). The in vitro activity was confirmed in vivo against septicemia infections induced in mice by selected gram-positive and -negative bacteria with 50% effective doses (ED50s) of < or =0.05 and < or =0.5 mg/kg of body weight/dose, respectively. GV129606 was as effective as meropenem against septicemia in mice caused by ceftazidime-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, exhibiting an ED50 of 0.33 mg/kg/dose.
TI  - The bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. A prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  - Obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. In the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. From March 1992 to February 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. The obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. Chest ultrasound (US) and US-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. Microorganisms were isolated from seven of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. A total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, Bacteroides fragilis, two Peptostreptococcus species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides species, Veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and Escherichia coli). In five cases the isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. The results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. Pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. The pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Novel automated microbial screening of platelet concentrates.
AB  - The recovery of bacteria and the speed of detection of microbial growth in platelet concentrates (PC) were studied, comparing a novel automated blood culture system (BacT/Alert) with two traditional methods. Full-scale experiments were performed with a total of 33 units of PC (average content 320 x 10(9) platelets per unit) obtained from pooled buffy coats. Six strains known as possible PC contaminants were tested: S. epidermidis, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, B. cereus, E. aerogenes, and S. sanguis. Using an inoculum of 50-98 bacteria/ml, bacterial contamination was detected in all of 11 PCs on 132 sampling occasions. With a small inoculum (0.3-9 bacteria/ml), the bacterial contamination was detected in all PCs in which abundant growth appeared, but failed to be detected in some instances where the bacterial content was very small. All of 11 uninoculated PC controls were negative. With the automated method the time for detection of a culture-positive PC was 6-16 h, clearly shorter than with the two manual-visual systems. The new system provides a rapid, reliable, and labour-saving method for screening of bacterial contamination in PCs. This would increase safety particularly if the present 5-day shelf life were extended.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of cytotoxic drugs may influence isolation of bacteria and fungi from blood cultures.
AB  - The potential antimicrobial activity of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and adriamycin against Gram positive and negative bacteria and Candida albicans was examined. The time taken for different microbial inocula to turn a simulated blood culture positive in the presence of different concentrations of these drugs was measured. Doxorubicin retarded the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus sanguis in a concentration dependent manner. Cyclophosphamide and vincristine showed minimal antimicrobial activity. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were unaffected by any of the drugs. An inoculum dependent effect was seen with some combinations of microbial inocula and cytotoxic drug concentrations.
TI  - [A clinical study on panipenem/betamipron in chronic respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Panipenem/betamipron (CS-976, PAPM/BP), a new carbapenem antibiotic, was administered a single dose of 500 mg or 750 mg via intravenous drip infusion twice a day for treatment of chronic respiratory infection to study its clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and safety. Twenty nine cases were studied for the efficacy evaluation. Only the safety evaluation was made in 6 cases which were judged to be unsuitable, because in some of them pneumonia and other diseases were not specified as the subject diseases, of serious illness in some the conditions were too serious, and in the other cases the duration of administration was insufficient since administration had to be discontinued due to side-effects. The duration of administration was 6 to 18 days with 1 g divided into 2 doses daily or 4 to 15 days with 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily. When clinical efficacies were classified according to different diseases, this preparation was effective in 11 cases and slightly effective in 1 case of 12 cases of chronic bronchitis with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. It was effective in 10 cases, slightly effective in 1 case and ineffective in 1 case of 12 cases of bronchiectasis with an efficacy rate of 83.3%. It was slightly effective in 2 and ineffective in 1 out of 3 cases of diffuse panbronchiolitis, and was effective in 2 cases of pulmonary emphysema with infections. PAPM/BP was given at a dose level of 1 g in 2 divided doses daily to 17 cases and that of 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily to 10 cases. For the remaining 2 cases, changes in the dose level were made in middle course of treatment. The efficacy rate in the 1 g regimen was 76.5% and that with the 1.5 g regimen was 90%. The overall results in the 29 cases included 23 effective, 4 slightly effective and 2 ineffective cases, thus the overall efficacy rate was 79.3%. As pathogens, 11 species including 24 strains were isolated and identified from 19 cases. They were Gram-positive cocci including 2 strains each of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus viridans and a strain of Streptococcus spp., and Gram-negative rods including 9 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 1 strain each of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas spp.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Disinfection by endodontic irrigants and dressings of experimentally infected dentinal tubules.
AB  - The effect of endodontic irrigants and dressings was tested on bacteria in bovine dentin specimens experimentally infected with Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Standardized, cylindrical dentin test pieces were prepared and cleaned by ultrasonic treatment with EDTA and sodium hypochlorite. The specimens were infected with the test organism for periods up to 14 days, and the degree of infection into the tubules was monitored using Brown & Brenn stain, scanning electron microscopy, and culturing of dentin dust from sequential bur samples starting from the pulpal side. E. faecalis rapidly infected the whole length of the tubules; S. sanguis required up to 2 weeks for complete infection; E. coli only penetrated to some 600 microns, even after prolonged incubation periods. P. aeruginosa infected dentin quickly, but apparently in very low numbers. E. faecalis persisted for at least 10 d after withdrawal of nutrient support, whereas the other 3 organisms died within 4 to 48 h. Endodontic medicaments were applied to infected specimen for comparison of antibacterial potency. Camphorated p-monochlorophenol was generally more efficient than Calasept, and of the irrigants tested, iodine potassium iodide appeared more potent than sodium hypochlorite or chlorhexidine. The presence of a smear layer delayed, but did not eliminate, the effect of the medicaments.
TI  - An in vitro study of the antibacterial and antifungal properties of an irreversible hydrocolloid impression material impregnated with disinfectant.
AB  - The difficulties associated with the disinfection of alginate (irreversible hydrocolloid) materials have resulted in the development of an irreversible hydrocolloid impression material impregnated with an antimicrobial compound, didecyldimethyl ammonium chloride. This investigation assessed the antibacterial and antifungal properties in vitro of this innovative irreversible hydrocolloid material by using the agar well technique. The microorganisms used were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus odontolyticus rodriguez, Actinomyces odontolyticus, mixed salivary organisms, and Candida albicans. The results showed an absence of activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Varying degrees of antibacterial activity were exhibited against the other microorganisms. It is concluded that it is not know whether the limited antibacterial and antifungal effect demonstrated in this study is sufficient to prevent bacterial and fungal colonization of the impression surface in the mouth during clinical practice.
TI  - Interbacterial adhesion between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and indigenous oral bacteria isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Interbacterial adhesion between strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and strains of  indigenous oral bacteria, both of which were isolated from the oral cavity of cystic fibrosis patients, was investigated by the phenomenon of the coaggregation reaction. A total of 22 strains of P. aeruginosa were isolated from the oral cavity of 17 patients and examined for their abilities to coaggregate with 5 strains each of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, and Actinomyces naeslundii. Coaggregation reactions were common between these oral bacteria and both the mucoid and nonmucoid variants of P. aeruginosa. All strains of P. aeruginosa were also able to agglutinate neuraminidase-treated or untreated human erythrocytes of blood types A, B, and O. Positive coaggregation reactions were further characterized by determining the effects of several sugars, and of heat and protease treatments of the bacteria. None of the coaggregtion reactions were inhibited by 0.05 M lactose, galactose, glucose, fucose, or mannose. All coaggregation reactions were dependent upon heat- and protease-sensitive components of the Pseudomonas. Thus, the interbacterial adhesions between P. aeruginosa and the oral bacteria studied appears to involve adhesins on the Pseudomonas cell, which bind to complementary receptors, on the cell surfaces of oral bacteria. The apparent prevalence and diversity of interbacterial adhesions between P. aeruginosa strains originating from the oral cavity of cystic fibrosis patients and strains of the indigenous oral bacteria suggest that some of these reactions may affect the extent to which P. aeruginosa colonizes in the oral cavity of cystic fibrosis patients, and thereby, influence susceptibility of the host to infection.
TI  - Bactericidal action of carbon dioxide laser radiation in experimental dental root canals.
AB  - The ability of a carbon dioxide laser to sterilize the root canal of human teeth  has been investigated. Three oral bacteria, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, and Actinomyces viscosus, and three other bacteria, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used as experimental organisms. Exposure of cells on glass slides to laser radiation showed there was little difference in the exposure required to kill these six organisms. Complete recovery of bacteria from the root canal was initially a problem and was only achieved when bacterial manipulations and removal were carried out in rapid succession, within 5 min of inoculation. However, the geometry of the instrumented canal and the laser alignment were major factors in achieving consistent cell death of oral bacteria in the root canals. Using sets of 10 teeth, four repeated exposures of 10 W for 1 s was found to sterilize 4 or more of the teeth.
TI  - Microbial adhesion to fibronectin in vitro correlates with production of endocarditis in rabbits.
AB  - Microbial adhesion to the constituents of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) is an important early event in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. Fibronectin is a ubiquitous mammalian glycoprotein with diverse functions which binds to certain bacteria but not to others. In this study, we determined that fibronectin is present on the surface of NBTE (after catheter-induced aortic valve trauma) but not on normal rabbit cardiac valvular endothelium. The adhesion of various bacteria and yeasts to human fibronectin in tissue culture wells was then measured. Microorganisms with a high isolation frequency from endocarditis cases (Staphylococcus aureus, Candida tropicalis, C. albicans, Streptococcus faecalis, S. sanguis) bound significantly better (P less than 0.01) to fibronectin in vitro than other organisms (Escherichia coli, C. krusei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) rarely implicated in this disease. Microbial adhesion to fibronectin correlated closely with the propensity of each organism to produce endocarditis in rabbits (e.g., ID50) with preexistent NBTE. A similar distribution was noted after binding of soluble radiolabeled fibronectin to bacteria in suspension. The results suggest that fibronectin, expressed on the surface of NBTE, may mediate microbial adhesion of circulating organisms to initiate colonization during the early pathogenesis of infective endocarditis.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.

AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
