TI  == prevalence of nim genes in anaerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria isolated in south africa.
AB  == this study investigated the prevalence of nim genes (proposed to encode a 5-nitroimidazole resistance product) in 64 anaerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria. employing universal nim gene primers, 458-bp amplified fragments were recorded as presumptive positives in 22/64 strains at an annealing temperature of 52 degrees c and 15/64 strains at 62 degrees c, of which seven were propionibacteria. dna sequencing confirmed the presence of nima genes in propionibacterium spp. (five strains), actinomyces odontolyticus (one strain), prevotella bivia (one strain) and clostridium bifermentans (one strain) and nimb  genes from five strains of bacteroides fragilis. nima genes were predominant in propionibacteria indicating a potential nima gene source in anaerobic environments.

TI  == the synergistic effect of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the synergistic interaction of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime against 187 clinically significant anaerobic organisms was investigated. fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces odontolyticus, propionibacteria, lactobacilli, peptostreptococci, streptococcus intermedius and veillonella were sensitive to cefotaxime. both eubacterium lentum and streptococcus morbillorum were resistant. the susceptibility of the clostridia varied from 0.125 to greater than 256 mg/l;  only 20% of species demonstrated synergy between cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of cefotaxime against members of the genus bacteroides ranged from 0.0625 to greater than 256 mg/l. the mic50 of cefotaxime to bacteroides fragilis and b. vulgatus was lowered from 6 and 4 mg/l, respectively, to 2 and 1 mg/l, respectively, when 4 mg/l desacetylcefotaxime was added to the medium. full or partial synergy was demonstrated by 50.7% of the bacteroides species tested. while cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime act synergistically against many members of the genus bacteroides, the mic of at least 10% of strains is not affected by this combination.
