TI  == predominant bacteria recovered from a periodontitis site in a hamster model raised by silk-ligature with porphyromonas gingivalis infection.
AB  == we isolated oral bacteria that coexisted with porphyromonas gingivalis in a hamster periodontitis model. as predominant bacteria in the periodontitis site, collinsella-reltaed strains, eubacterium-reltaed strains, streptococcus suis-related strains, and veillonella parvula-reltaed strains were detected. in addition, actinomyces, bacteroides, and p. gingivalis were also isolated predominantly. the results suggest that the bacterial composition of the periodontitis site in hamsters is complex, as in human periodontitis.

TI  == fluid- or surface-phase human salivary scavenger protein gp340 exposes different  bacterial recognition properties.
AB  == salivary scavenger receptor cysteine-rich protein gp340 aggregates streptococci and other bacteria as part of the host innate defense system at mucosal surfaces. in this article, we have investigated the properties of fluid-phase gp340 and hydroxylapatite surface-adsorbed gp340 in aggregation and adherence, respectively, of viridans group streptococci (e.g., streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans), non-viridans group streptococci (e.g., streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus suis), and oral actinomyces. fluid-phase gp340 and surface-phase gp340 bioforms were differentially recognized by streptococci, which formed three phenotypic groupings according to their modes of interaction with gp340. group i streptococci were aggregated by and adhered to gp340, and group ii streptococci preferentially adhered to surface-bound gp340, while group  iii streptococci were preferentially aggregated by gp340. each species of streptococcus tested was found to contain strains representative of at least two  of these gp340 interaction groupings. the gp340 interaction modes i to iii and sugar specificities of gp340 binding strains coincided for several species. many  gp340 interactions were sialidase sensitive, and each of the interaction modes (i to iii) for s. gordonii was correlated with a variant of sialic acid specificity. adherence of s. gordonii dl1 (challis) to surface-bound gp340 was dependent upon  expression of the sialic acid binding adhesin hsa. however, aggregation of cells  by fluid-phase gp340 was independent of hsa and involved sspa and sspb (antigen i/ii family) polypeptides. conversely, both gp340-mediated aggregation and adherence of s. mutans ng8 involved antigen i/ii polypeptide. deletion of the mga virulence regulator gene in s. pyogenes resulted in increased cell aggregation by gp340. these results suggest that salivary gp340 recognizes different bacterial receptors according to whether gp340 is present in the fluid phase or surface bound. this phase-associated differential recognition by gp340 of streptococcal species of different levels of virulence and diverse origins may mediate alternative host responses to commensal or pathogenic bacterial phenotypes.

TI  == biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the calgary biofilm device (cbd) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (mbec) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin g, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine  for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the cbd under selected conditions. the biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. biofilms composed of arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium renale, or corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but  as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. biofilm and planktonic streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. planktonic escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and  trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against e. coli growing as a biofilm. salmonella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. planktonic and biofilm pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. the cbd provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.

TI  == the gram-positive tonsillar and nasal flora of piglets before and after weaning.
AB  == aims: to investigate gram-positive nasal and tonsillar microbial flora of piglets before and after weaning. methods and results: the nasal and tonsillar gram-positive bacterial flora of 20 non-weaned piglets (2 weeks of age) and 20 weaned piglets (6 weeks of age), obtained from four different piggeries, was quantified by culture and identified by tdna-pcr. the most widely occurring species from nasal conchae before as well as after weaning in the different piglets investigated were streptococcus suis and rothia nasimurium. after weaning a wide variety of lactobacillus species appeared but in low numbers. in the tonsils, strep. suis, strep. dysgalactiae, s. hyicus, s. aureus, arcanobacterium  pyogenes and actinomyces hyovaginalis were the species isolated from the largest  number of pigs before and after weaning. s. aureus and most lactobacilli became more prevalent after weaning. bacteria not known to be associated with pigs found in the present study included r. nasimurium, strep. gallolyticus, pediococcus pentosaceus and some lactobacillus species. conclusions: over 30 different gram-positive bacterial species may occur in nasal conchae and tonsils of unweaned piglets at 2 weeks of age and of 6-week-old weaned piglets. significance and impact of the study: this study demonstrated that weaning is associated with  changes in prevalence of only a small minority of the highly diversified bacterial flora of the nares and tonsils of pigs.

TI  == microbiology and pathology of fibrinous pericarditis in danish slaughter pigs.
AB  == the prevalence of fibrinous pericarditis detected at slaughter in danish slaughter pigs is approximately 0.02%. the microbiology and pathology of this disorder was studied through 46 field cases collected at slaughter from may 1994  to august 1995. mycoplasmas (mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, m. hyosynoviae and m. hyorhinis) were isolated from the pericardium in 38 cases and from the joints in  six. m. hyopneumoniae dominated with 33 isolates from the pericardium. actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae was isolated from the pericardium in three cases  (as mono-infection in one and together with m. hyopneumoniae in two cases) and actinomyces pyogenes was isolated from the pericardium twice (as mono-infection in one case and together with m. hyopneumoniae in another). a. pyogenes was also  present in the lung, liver and kidney in one of these cases. streptococcus suis was isolated together with mycoplasmas from the pericardium in three cases. the pericardium was sterile in three cases and contained a low grade mixed flora in two; the latter is believed to be a result of the slaughter procedure rather than an infection. no chlamydiae were found in connection with the microbiological examination. parvovirus was found in one case in the pericardium and in two cases in the spleen. forty-five cases were subacute to chronic. the gross pathological  examination showed that bronchopneumonia, chronic pleuritis and synovitis or a low grade arthritis occurred in most cases. only the arthritic lesions are believed to be pathogenetically concurrent with the pericarditis. slight evidence of stasis of the liver and/or periangiolar edema was present in six cases. the histopathological examination confirmed the above mentioned findings. bacterial colonies were found within the fibrinous layer on the pericardium in all cases from which either a. pleuropneumoniae, a. pyogenes or s. suis was isolated. it is concluded that in this study mycoplasmas, particularly m. hyopneumoniae, are the  more likely cause of fibrinous pericarditis in slaughter pigs.

TI  == effect of different diets on oral bacteria and caries activity in sprague-dawley  rats.
AB  == the conventional rat model of dental caries has been used extensively to measure  the contribution of various inoculated bacteria or diets to dental caries production. only limited information is available on the effect of different diets on the oral bacterial community as a whole. in the present study, using selective and non-selective media, the oral bacterial populations of 21-day-old sprague-dawley rats fed diets with commercial rat and mouse cubes (control), high-starch (56%) and sucrose (56%) diets for 21 days were investigated. the high-starch diet did not significantly change the proportion of oral bacteria compared with the control group; the high-sucrose diet significantly enhanced the total cultivable bacteria, particularly actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus rattus and streptococcus suis-like bacteria. the order of diets with respect to the production of dental caries was sucrose > starch > normal. thus the high-sucrose diet changed the oral bacterial population of sprague-dawley rats and these changes were reflected in the increased level of dental caries.

TI  == bacterial isolation from slaughtered pigs associated with endocarditis, especially the isolation of streptococcus suis.
AB  == bacterial isolation from slaughtered pigs with endocarditis was carried out from  1985 to 1994. a total of 495 (0.025%) out of 2,006,127 pigs were diagnosed as having endocarditis. though bacteria were significantly isolated from 399 of the  495 pigs, bacteria could not be isolated in 96 pigs (19.4%). in 11 pigs, 2 bacterial species were isolated from heart lesion. streptococcus suis was isolated from 127 cases (25.7%), streptococcus dysgalactiae from 75 (15.2%), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae from 63 (12.7%), actinomyces pyogenes from 39 (7.9%), pasteurella multocida from 11 (2.2%). staphylococcus aureus from 10 (2.0%), and streptococcus porcinus from 8 (1.6%). among the 99 isolates biochemically identified as s. suis, the major serotype was s. suis type 2 (35.4%). the remainder of the typable isolates were identified as serotypes 1/2 (2.0%) and 9 (1.0%). a total of 61 isolates (61.6%) were untypable.

TI  == an abattoir survey of pneumonia and pleuritis in slaughter weight swine from 9 selected herds. iv. bacteriological findings in chronic pneumonic lesions.
AB  == a total of 855 pig lungs were collected at slaughter and evaluated macroscopically. bacteriological examinations were carried out on tissue samples  from chronic pleuropneumonic lesions (n = 196) and from chronic bronchopneumonic  lesions with suppuration (n = 14). samples from normal lung tissue (n = 22) were  also included. pasteurella multocida was isolated from 54%, actinobacillus (haemophilus) pleuropneumoniae from 11%, and streptococcus spp. from 14% of the pneumonic lesions, respectively. from normal lung tissue p. multocida was isolated from 3 (14%) of the samples, a. pleuropneumoniae was not recovered and streptococci were isolated from only 1 (5%) of these samples. the above mentioned bacterial species were recovered either in pure cultures or mixed with various other microbes. a total of 109 p. multocida strains were further characterized by capsular serotyping and testing for production of dermonecrotic toxin. ninety-nine (91%) of the strains were capsular type a 10 (9%) were type d. out of the type a and the type d strains 94% and 90% were toxigenic, respectively. most  of the a. pleuropneumoniae strains were serotype 2. strains of serotypes 1 and 7  were also identified. the majority of the streptococci were identified as either  streptococcus suis or streptococcus dysgalactiae. actinomyces pyogenes was isolated from 14% of the lesions and anaerobic bacteria from 18%, respectively. the significance of the various bacterial species in relation to the development  of chronic pneumonic lesions is discussed. special attention is paid to p. multocida, and it is concluded that this bacterial species is probably of importance for the development of both types of chronic pneumonias.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility of selected veterinary bacterial pathogens to ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin and norfloxacin.
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, and norfloxacin were tested for approximately ten clinical isolates of each of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, actinobacillus suis, actinomyces pyogenes, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, haemophilus parasuis, haemophilus somnus, pasteurella haemolytica, pasteurella multocida, rhodococcus equi, streptococcus equi, streptococcus suis and streptococcus zooepidemicus. ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin had similar activity and were more  active than norfloxacin. all isolates had an mic of 1.0 microgram/ml or less for  ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin, and these drugs had particularly marked activity  against the gram-negative bacteria tested.

TI  == streptococcus suis infection in swine. a sixteen month study.
AB  == a total of 349 isolates of streptococcus suis retrieved from different tissues from diseased pigs were examined in this study. only 48% of them could be categorized as one of serotypes 1 to 8 and 1/2. among typable isolates, serotype  2 was the most prevalent (23%), followed by serotype 3 (10%). the majority of all isolates originated from lungs, meninges/brain, and multiple tissues. forty-one percent of typable isolates and 33% of untypable isolates were retrieved in pure  culture. other isolates were found in conjunction with pasteurella multocida, escherichia coli, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, actinomyces pyogenes, and other streptococci. typable s. suis isolates were more frequently isolated from pigs between five and ten weeks of age, while untypable isolates were mostly found in animals aged more than 24 weeks. no obvious monthly and/or seasonal variation of the prevalence of isolation of s. suis could be detected.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial properties of el-870, a new semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotic.
AB  == a new macrolide antibiotic, el-870, 20-deoxo-20-(3,5-dimethylpiperidin-1-yl)desmycosin, has been prepared by chemical modification of desmycosin. in vitro, against selected animal bacterial pathogens, it inhibited growth of pasteurella multocida, pasteurella haemolytica, mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, streptococcus suis, actinomyces pyogenes and certain other bacteria at levels of 6.25 micrograms/ml or less. in general, the mics for gram-negative enteric bacteria have been greater than 50 micrograms/ml. concentrations equivalent to 4 x the mic value were bactericidal for pasteurella sp. el-870 had other antibacterial properties which were characteristic of macrolide antibiotics.
