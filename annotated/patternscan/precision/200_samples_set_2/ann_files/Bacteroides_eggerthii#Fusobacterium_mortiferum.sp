TI  == numerical taxonomy of bacteroides and other genera of gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  == a numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of bacteroides, polyphyromonas, prevotella [not prevotella (labroue, 1976)] and fusobacterium. isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. computation of similarity coefficients was  followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. at the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) fusobacterium mortiferum, f. necrogenes, f. necrophorum, f. nucleatum and f.  varium; (3) b. caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. fragilis, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b stercoris, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformus and b. vulgatus; (4) b. splanchnicus; (5) porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) b. bivius (prevotella bivia); (7) b. disiens (p. disiens); (8) b. intermedius (p. intermedia);and (9) b. melaninogenicus (p. melaninogenica). single isolates of b. ruminicola (p. ruminicola), b. denticola (p. denticola) and b. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.

TI  == beta-lactamase production and susceptibilities to amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ticarcillin, ticarcillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, imipenem, and metronidazole of 320 non-bacteroides fragilis bacteroides isolates  and 129 fusobacteria from 28 u.s. centers.
AB  == beta-lactamase production (nitrocefin disk method) and agar dilution susceptibility of amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ticarcillin, ticarcillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, imipenem, and metronidazole were determined for 320 bacteroides species (not bacteroides fragilis group) and 129 fusobacteria from 28 u.s. centers. overall, 64.7% of bacteroides species and 41.1% of fusobacteria were beta-lactamase positive. among the bacteroides species, positivity rates were highest for b. bivius (85.0%), followed by b. splanchnicus  (83.3%), b. eggerthii (77.8%), and b. oralis (77.1%); 54.5% of black-pigmented bacteroides species were beta-lactamase positive. among the fusobacteria, fusobacterium mortiferum showed the highest rate of beta-lactamase positivity (76.9%). mics of amoxicillin (128 micrograms/ml) and ticarcillin (64 micrograms/ml) for 90% of all beta-lactamase-positive strains were reduced to 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively, with the addition of clavulanate. mics of amoxicillin and ticarcillin for 90% of all beta-lactamase-negative strains were 1 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively, and greater than or equal to 98.4% of the strains were susceptible to the beta-lactams tested. of the beta-lactamase-producing strains, 45.9% were susceptible to amoxicillin at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml and 93.4% were susceptible to ticarcillin at less than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml; the addition of clavulanate raised the rates to 90.4 and 100%, respectively. all strains were susceptible to cefoxitin,  imipenem, and metronidazole. the activity of amoxicillin against 29 beta-lactamase-producing strains (10 bacteroides species and 19 fusobacteria) was not enhanced by the addition of clavulanate; however, 82.7% of these strains were susceptible to amoxicillin, and all were susceptible to ticarcillin. although beta-lactamase positivity is on the increase in non-b. fragilis group bacteroides species and fusobacteria, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ticarcillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, and metronidazole should be suitable for the treatment of infections with these strains. the addition of clavulanate does not appreciably improve the  efficacy of ticarcillin against these organisms.
