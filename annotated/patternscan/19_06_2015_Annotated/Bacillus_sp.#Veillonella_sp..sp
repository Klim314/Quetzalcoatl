TI  == analysis of interaction property of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside with human gut microbiota.
AB  == calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside as the major isoflavonoids in astragali radix has  been investigated intensively and has been reported to possess a wide range of pharmacological properties. however, the route and metabolites of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside by human intestinal bacteria are not well understood and its metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. therefore, the objective of this study was to screen the ability of the bacteria  to metabolize calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside and assess the effect of this compound on the intestinal bacteria. finally, five strains including bacteroides  sp.13, and sp.58, clostridium sp.21-2, veillonella sp.43-1, and bacillus sp.46 were isolated from human intestinal bacteria and were studied their abilities to  convert calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside. a total of six metabolites were identified in human incubated solution by ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (uplc-q-tof-ms). the results indicated that hydrolysis, demethylation, dehydroxylation and acetylation were the major metabolism of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside. on the other hand, different strains of intestinal bacteria have varying degrees of growth sensitivity to calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside. growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as enterobacter, enterococcus, clostridium and bacteroides was significantly repressed by calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside, while commensal probiotics such as lactobacillus, bifidobacterium were less severely affected. this indicates that calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population.  our observation provided further evidence for the importance of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside in human health and diseases.

TI  == effect of liquiritin on human intestinal bacteria growth: metabolism and modulation.
AB  == licorice is one of the oldest and most frequently used prescribed traditional chimese medicines. however, the route and metabolites of liquiritin by human intestinal microflora are not well understood and its metabolites may accumulate  to exert physiological effects. therefore, our objective was to screen the ability of the bacteria to metabolize liquiritin and assess the effect of this compound on the intestinal bacteria. finally, six strains, comprising bacteroides sp. 22 and sp.57, veillonella sp. 31 and sp.48, bacillus sp. 46 and clostridium sp. 51, were isolated and their abilities to convert liquiritin studied. a total  of five metabolites were identified using ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in human incubated solution. the results indicated that hydrolysis, hydrogenation, methylation, deoxygenation and acetylation were the major routes of metabolism of liquiritin.  on the other hand, effect of liquiritin on different strains of intestinal bacteria growth was detected using an emax precision microplate reader. growth of certain pathogenic bacteria, such as enterobacter, enterococcus, clostridium and  bacteroides, was significantly repressed by liquiritin, while growth of commensal probiotics such as lactobacillus and bifidobacterium was less severely affected.  our observation provided further evidence for the importance of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism, and the potential activity of liquiritin in human health and disease.

TI  == identification of isoquercitrin metabolites produced by human intestinal bacteria using uplc-q-tof/ms.
AB  == in this paper, ultraperformance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (uplc-q-tof/ms) and the metabolynx software combined with mass  defect filtering were applied to identity the metabolites of isoquercitrin using  an intestinal mixture of bacteria and 96 isolated strains from human feces. the human incubated samples collected for 72 h in the anaerobic incubator and extracted with ethyl acetate were analyzed by uplc-q-tof/ms within 10 min. the parent compound and five metabolites were identified by eight isolated strains, including bacillus sp. 17, veillonella sp. 23 and 32 and bacteroides sp. 40, 41,  56, 75 and 88 in vitro. the results indicate that quercetin, acetylated isoquercitrin, dehydroxylated isoquercitrin, hydroxylated quercetin and hydroxymethylated quercetin are the major metabolites of isoquercitrin. furthermore, a possible metabolic pathway for the biotransformation of isoquercitrin was established in intestinal flora. this study will be helpful for understanding the metabolic route of isoquercitrin and the role of different intestinal bacteria in the metabolism of natural compounds.

TI  == identification of rutin deglycosylated metabolites produced by human intestinal bacteria using uplc-q-tof/ms.
AB  == in this paper, rutin was metabolized by human intestinal bacteria and five isolated strains including bacillus sp. 52, bacteroides sp. 45, 42, 22 and veillonella sp. 32, the metabolites were identified using ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (uplc-q-tof/ms). as a result, bacillus sp. 52 and bacteroides sp. 45 could metabolize rutin to quercetin 3-o-glucoside and leucocyanidin. bacteroides sp. 42 and veillonella sp. 32 could convert rutin to leucocyanidin. bacteroides sp. 22 could hydrolyze rutin to quercetin-3-o-glucoside. in order to further explain the metabolism pathway of rutin, the beta-d-glucosidase and alpha-l-rhamnosidase activities of five strains were determined. bacteroides sp. 22 could produce alpha-l-rhamnosidase but did not produce beta-d-glucosidase or beta-d-glucosidase activity was too low to be detected. the other four strains all demonstrated alpha-l-rhamnosidase and beta-d-glucosidase activities. furthermore, alpha-l-rhamnosidase and beta-d-glucosidase activities of veillonella sp. 32 and  bacteroides sp. 42 were higher than those of bacteroides sp. 45 and bacillus sp.  52. based on these results, we can propose the deglycosylated rout of rutin: rutin was metabolized to be quercetin-3-o-glucoside by alpha-l-rhamnosidase produced from these bacteria, thereafter, quercetin-3-o-glucoside was further metabolized by beta-d-glucosidase to form leucocyanidin. because of the higher enzyme activity in veillonella sp. 32 and bacteroides sp. 42, quercetin-3-o-glucoside was completely metabolized to leucocyanidin by these two  bacteria. due to the lack of beta-d-glucosidase activity, bacteroides sp. 22 could not further metabolize quercetin-3-o-glucoside to leucocyanidin. this study will be helpful for understanding the deglycosylated rout of rutin and the role of different intestinal bacteria on the metabolism of natural compounds.

TI  == [effects of antibiotics and anti-bacterial components of preparations for local treatment of suppurative wounds on pathogens of odonto- genic infections].
AB  == the results of identification and sensitivity assay of 156 strains of pathogens causing odontogenic infections are presented. in the sensitivity assay antibacterial drugs were used. 42.3 percent of the strains were obligate anaerobes belonging to bacteroides, fusobacterium, peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, veillonella and actinomyces. significant differences in the microbial sensitivity to the drugs used for general and local therapy were detected. there was observed high sensitivity of the obligate anaerobes to gramicidin (0.02 micrograms/ml), nitazol (10 micrograms/ml), levomycetin and tetracycline (60 micrograms/ml). antiseptics such as dioxidine and chlorhexidine  used locally showed satisfactory results. the above mentioned drugs and especially levomycetin were also rather active against facultative organisms in associations of pathogens causing odontogenic infections: bacillus coagulans, b.  licheniformis, pseudomonas sp., acinetobacter calcoaceticus, staphylococcus sp. and streptococcus sp.

TI  == effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  == growth and acid production of glucose-grown gram-positive and gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02  to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. all gram-positive rods, i.e. actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gram-positive cocci, i.e. streptococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. while gram-negative cocci, i.e. veillonella sp and neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. saccharin caused a significant reduction  in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.

TI  == [effect of solid substrates of microbial colony development].
AB  == bacteria have been found to grow differently at contact sites to both organic and anorganic solids as on pure agar media. of 16 ad hoc selected bacterial strains,  the following species (arranged in decreasing order) responded with stronger colony formation: bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, streptococcus sanguis, s. saprophyticus, s. faecalis, escherichia coli, micrococcus flavus, actinomyces viscosus, veillonella sp., enterobacter liquefaciens, yersinia enterocolitica. lactobacillus casei behaved neutral. proteus vulgaris, y. enterocolitica and chromobacterium violaceum grow on certain media only in the presence of solid particles. the yeasts endomyces lactis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, rhodotorula mucilaginosa and cryptococcus nigricans did not respond to solid particles during colony formation. the kind of protein-animal (meat) or vegetable (soy beans)-did  not influence the behaviour of the microorganisms in these experiments.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in tonsils of children with recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == tonsils were obtained from 50 children suffering from recurrent tonsillitis. patients' ages ranged from 2.5 to 17 years (mean 6 years); 29 were males and 21 females. the tonsils were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained in all patients, yielding an average of  7.8 isolates (4.1 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. there were 207 anaerobes isolated. the predominant isolates were 101 bacteroides sp (including 10 b fragilis group, and 47 b melaninogenicus group), 29 fusobacterium sp, 34 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (25 peptococcus sp and 9 peptostreptococcus sp) and 16 veillonella sp. there were 185 aerobic isolates. the predominant isolates were 41 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 24 staphylococcus aureus, 19 beta-hemolytic streptococci (11 group a, 4 group b, and 2 each group c and f), 14 haemophilus sp (including 12 h influenzae type b) and 5 h parainfluenzae. beta-lactamase production was noted in 56 isolates recovered from 37 tonsils. these were all isolates of s aureus (24) and b fragilis (10), 15 of 47 b melaninogenicus (32%),  5 of the 12 b oralis (42%), and 2 of 12 h influenzae type b (17%). our findings indicate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of deep tonsillar flora in children with recurrent tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in 74% of the patients.

TI  == bacteremia after upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.
AB  == during 24 months, 200 upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed on 193 patients. blood cultures were obtained before and five and 30 minutes after the procedure using thiol (50 ml) and trypticase soy broth (100 ml) media. the mean endoscopic time was 34 minutes. sixteen patients developed bacteremia (8%). twelve groups of microorganisms were detected in positive blood cultures: streptococcus (5 species), lactobacillus sp, veillonella alcalescens, staphylococcus aureus, staph epidermidis, propioni-bacterium acnes, corynebacterium acnes, and bacillus subtilis. seven patients had positive blood cultures at five and 30 minutes, eight at five minutes, and one at 30 minutes only. there was no clear correlation of bacteremia with the age or previous history of the patient, biopsy, active bleeding, endoscopic time, or findings. a  follow-up study of all patients for six months to two years indicated no complications related to endoscopy and/or bacteremia.
