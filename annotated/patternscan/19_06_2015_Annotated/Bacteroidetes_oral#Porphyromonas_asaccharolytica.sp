TI  == eikenella corrodens and porphyromonas asaccharolytica pleural empyema in a diabetic patient with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome on noninvasive ventilation.
AB  == eikenella corrodens is a normal inhabitant of the human oral cavity and gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. pleuropulmonary infections by this microorganism are uncommon. pulmonary aspiration is a chief predisposing condition. although the outcome is usually favorable, its distinctive antibiotic  sensitivity pattern makes bacterial identification an important feature in dealing with this infection. the authors report a case of pleural empyema caused  by co-infection with eikenella corrodens and porphyromonas asaccharolytica, in an immunocompetent diabetic patient with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, followed  by a discussion on the role of noninvasive ventilation in the development of this infection.

TI  == a rare case of lemierre`s syndrome caused by porphyromonas asaccharolytica.
AB  == lemierre's syndrome is only very rarely caused by porphyromonas asaccharolytica.  here, we report the case of a 35-year-old man who developed a left peritonsillar  abscess, thrombophlebitis of the left internal jugular vein, and septic embolization of both lungs. anaerobic p. asaccharolytica was isolated in the blood cultures, and we subsequently confirmed the diagnosis as lemierre's syndrome. our case indicates that although p. asaccharolytica is not commonly found in oral cavities, this organism may still cause lemierre's syndrome. consequently, when it is detected in blood cultures, the treating physician should perform the medical examination while keeping in mind the possibility that the patient could have lemierre's syndrome.

TI  == 16s-23s rrna gene internal transcribed spacer sequences for analysis of the phylogenetic relationships among species of the genus porphyromonas.
AB  == the 16s-23s rrna gene internal transcribed spacer (its) regions of 11 reference strains of porphyromonas species, together with bacteroides distasonis and tannerella forsythensis, were analysed to examine interspecies relationships. compared with the phylogenetic tree generated using 16s rrna gene sequences, the  resolution of the its sequence-based tree was higher, but species positioning and clustering were similar with both approaches. the recent separation of porphyromonas gulae and porphyromonas gingivalis into distinct species was confirmed by the its data. in addition, analysis of the its sequences of 24 clinical isolates of porphyromonas asaccharolytica plus the type strain atcc 25260(t) divided the sequences into two clusters, of which one was alpha-fucosidase-positive (like the type strain) while the other was alpha-fucosidase-negative. the latter resembled the previously studied unusual extra-oral isolates of 'porphyromonas endodontalis-like organisms' (pelos) which  could therefore be called 'porphyromonas asaccharolytica-like organisms' (palos), based on the genetic identification. moreover, the proposal of alpha-fucosidase-negative p. asaccharolytica strains as a new species should also be considered.

TI  == porphyromonas uenonis sp. nov., a pathogen for humans distinct from p. asaccharolytica and p. endodontalis.
AB  == three porphyromonas species (porphyromonas asaccharolytica, p. endodontalis, and  the novel species that is the subject of the present report, p. uenonis) are very much alike in terms of biochemical characteristics, such as enzyme profiles and cellular fatty acid contents. p. asaccharolytica is distinguished from the other  two species by virtue of production of alpha-fucosidase and glyoxylic acid positivity. the novel species is difficult to differentiate from p. endodontalis  phenotypically and was designated a p. endodontalis-like organism for some time.  however, p. endodontalis is recovered almost exclusively from oral sources and also grows poorly on biolog universal agar, both characteristics that are in contrast to those of the other two organisms. furthermore, p. uenonis is glycerol positive in the biolog an microplate system. both p. asaccharolytica and p. uenonis are positive by 13 other tests in the biolog system, whereas p. endodontalis is negative by all of these tests. p. asaccharolytica grew well in both solid and liquid media without supplementation with 5% horse serum, whereas  the other two species grew poorly without supplementation. sequencing of 16s rrna revealed about 10% divergence between the novel species and p. endodontalis but less than 2% sequence difference between the novel species and p. asaccharolytica. subsequent dna-dna hybridization studies documented that the novel organism was indeed distinct from p. asaccharolytica. we propose the name porphyromonas uenonis for the novel species. we have recovered p. uenonis from four clinical infections in adults, all likely of intestinal origin, and from the feces of six children.

TI  == whole genomic dna probe for detection of porphyromonas endodontalis.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to develop a dna probe for porphyromonas endodontalis. pure cultures of p. endodontalis were grown in typ medium, in an anaerobic chamber. dna was extracted from the p. endodontalis and labeled using the genius system by boehringer mannheim. the labeled p. endodontalis dna was used in dot-blot hybridization reactions with homologous (p. endodontalis) and unrelated bacterial samples. to determine specificity, strains of 40 other oral bacterial species (e.g. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica,  and prevotella intermedia) were spotted and reacted with the p. endodontalis dna  probe. none of the panel of 40 oral bacteria hybridized with the p. endodontalis  probe, whereas the blot of the homologous organism showed a strong positive reaction. to determine the sensitivity of the probe, dilutions of a p. endodontalis suspension of known concentration were blotted onto a nylon membrane and reacted with the probe. the results of our investigation indicate that the dna probe that we have prepared specifically detects only p. endodontalis and can detect at least 3 x 10(4) cells.

TI  == absence of porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides fragilis and chlamydia pneumoniae in human subgingival plaque.
AB  == little is known about the presence of common medical pathogens in the human oral  cavity. using a 16s rrna-based pcr identification method, this study determined the occurrence of porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides fragilis and chlamydia pneumoniae in subgingival plaque from 50 adults with advanced periodontitis. each patient contributed samples from 3 deep periodontal pockets collected by paper points. the pcr primers were for p. asaccharolytica 5'-ctc tag cta gag tgt act gg-3' and 5'-ata ggg ttt ata gat tag ctc tct-3', for b. fragilis  5'-aat gat tcc gca tgg ttt cat ta-3' and 5'-gcg gtg att gct cac tga ca-3', and for c. pneumoniae 5'- tga caa ctg tag aaa tac agc-3' and 5'-cgc ctc tct cct ata aat-3'. the primers yielded a single amplicon with the respective reference strains and produced no amplicon with colonies of 25 groups of oral organisms. none of the three test species were detected in any of the 50 pooled subgingival  samples tested. p. asaccharyolytica, b. fragilis and c. pneumoniae do not seem to be part of the periodontopathic microbiota in humans.

TI  == construction of a plasmid vector for transformation of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == a host-vector system for transformation of porphyromonas gingivalis was constructed using a set (1) strains that can incorporate plasmid dna by electroporation regardless of its source and (2) stable vector plasmids with a selectable marker. first, restriction-negative mutants were isolated, because p.  gingivalis possesses restriction modification systems by which dna introduced by  transformation even from heterologous strains of the same species is excluded. for screening of the mutants, plasmid pe5-2 was employed since it could be transconjugated (mobilized) to p. gingivalis from escherichia coli and is able to replicate in this species, albeit not stably. pe5-2 dna prepared from e coli was  introduced by electroporation into chemically mutagenized p. gingivalis cells. by this method, three putative restriction-negative clones were selected. these strains exhibited a capacity for electroporation with plasmid dnas both from e. coli and from various p. gingivalis strains at a similar efficiency. using one of the derivatives thus obtained, yh522, we then screened for plasmids that could replicate stably in p. gingivalis. since no plasmids were found from p. gingivalis, cryptic plasmids from other species of black-pigmented oral anaerobic rods were examined for their ability to transform p. gingivalis. a series of plasmids constructed by ligation with pbr322 for replication in e. coli and the ecori-b fragment from pbf4 containing erythromycin resistance were prepared from  e. coli and were used for electroporation of p. gingivalis. among these, a recombinant plasmid containing the replicon of pyhba1 from porphyromonas asaccharolytica, designated pyh400, was found to be incorporated into the restriction-negative p. gingivalis strain and replicated stably. this set of recipient strains and stable plasmids with a selectable marker constitutes the first practical host-vector system for this species.

TI  == update on the taxonomy and the clinical and laboratory characteristics of pigmented anaerobic gram-negative rods.
AB  == pigmented anaerobic gram-negative rods are currently categorized as 17 species distributed in three genera: prevotella, porphyromonas, and bacteroides. these organisms are often encountered in clinical specimens but are also found as part  of the indigenous flora on various mucosal surfaces. several studies are presently assessing the association of individual species with health and disease. for example, porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas endodontalis are key putative pathogens in adult periodontitis and root canal infections, respectively. porphyromonas asaccharolytica is prevalent in extraoral infections. the porphyromonas species of animal origin have been isolated from infected bite  wounds in humans. isolates closely resembling bacteroides levii have been recovered from various types of human infections. according to preliminary reports, prevotella intermedia tends to be associated more often with periodontal disease than with a healthy oral cavity. in the laboratory, enzyme profiling facilitates the identification of these pigmented rods. beta-lactamase production is more common among prevotella species (30%-50%) than among porphyromonas species (< 10%).

TI  == oligonucleotide probes to the 16s ribosomal rna: implications of sequence homology and secondary structure with particular reference to the oral species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == eight oligonucleotides based upon regions of the small subunit 16s ribosomal rna  gene sequences were analysed against a background of their position within the molecule and their two-dimensional structure to rationalise their use in recognising prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. the 41 clinical isolates from both oral and respiratory sites and two reference strains were subjected to dna-dna hybridisation and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to confirm their identity. alignment of oligonucleotide probes designated i bi-2 to  i bi-6 (for p. intermedia) and 2bi-2 (for p. nigrescens) with the 16s rrna suggested that these probes lacked specificity or were constructed from hypervariable regions. a 52-mer oligonucleotide (designated bi) reliably detected both species. because of the high degree of concordance between the 16s rrnas of  both species, it was necessary to vary the stringency of hybridisation conditions for detection of both species. thus probe i bi-i recognised p. intermedia while i bi-i detected both p. intermedia and p. nigrescens at low stringency. however, under conditions of high stringency only p. nigrescens was recognised by probe 2bi-i. these probes were highly specific and did not hybridise with dna from the  closely related p. corporis, nor other periodontal pathogens such as fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola and several pigmented species such as prevotella melaninogenica, p. denticola, p. loescheii, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, py. endodontalis, py. gingivalis, py. levii, and py. macacae.

TI  == degradation of immunoglobulin g by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == several subgingival microorganisms were tested for their ability to utilize human immunoglobulin g (igg) as a substrate for growth. this was done using a protein-free chemically defined medium, supplemented with igg. stimulation of growth was observed for capnocytophaga ochracea, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella oralis, lactobacillus catenaforme and streptococcus intermedius. immunoelectrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and a protein assay demonstrated that p. intermedia and p. endodontalis completely degraded the protein chains of igg. partial breakdown of igg was observed for p. asaccharolytica and c. ochracea, whereas p. oralis cleaved the igg heavy chain, yielding fc and fab fragments. all these bacteria utilized igg as a substrate for growth. binding studies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, revealed complete loss of in vitro antigen-antibody binding capacity after incubation of specific igg with p. endodontalis and partial loss of binding with  p. intermedia, p. gingivalis, c. ochracea or fusobacterium nucleatum. degradation or inactivation of igg by oral bacteria is thought to be important in the causation of polymicrobial infections.

TI  == the gingival immune response to periodontal pathogens in juvenile periodontitis.
AB  == a gingival explant culture system was utilized to evaluate the reactivity of local immunoglobulins produced by juvenile periodontitis tissue. gingival explant culture supernatant fluids were screened, via a standardized dot-immunobinding assay, for antibodies reactive to: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, eikenella  corrodens, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, capnocytophaga ochracea, eubacterium nodatum and fusobacterium nucleatum and one  nonoral microorganism, porphyromonas asaccharolytica. of the 75 juvenile periodontitis supernatant fluids tested, the organisms that reacted with the highest numbers of supernatant fluids were e. nodatum (72%) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (49%). more juvenile periodontitis than healthy tissue samples showed supernatant fluid reactivity to p. intermedia, c. ochracea, e. nodatum and p. micros. no significant difference was observed between the juvenile periodontitis group supernatant fluids reactivity and the supernatant fluids of the other periodontal disease groups tested. cluster analysis revealed  the association, as determined by supernatant fluid reactivity, of p. micros and  c. ochracea in the juvenile periodontitis group. the data from this investigation are consistent with a hypothesis of multiple possible etiologies of periodontal destruction in juvenile periodontitis and other forms of periodontal diseases.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivicanis sp. nov. and porphyromonas crevioricanis sp. nov., isolated from beagles.
AB  == two new species, porphyromonas gingivicanis and porphyromonas crevioricanis, are  proposed for black-pigmented, asaccharolytic, anaerobic, nonmotile, non-spore-forming, gram-negative, rod-shaped organisms. these organisms were isolated from the gingival crevicular fluids of beagles. p. gingivicanis and p. crevioricanis do not grow in the presence of 20% bile. they exhibit less than 5%  dna-dna homology with the type strains of porphyromonas gingivalis (strain atcc 33277), porphyromonas endodontalis (strain atcc 35406), and porphyromonas asaccharolytica (strain atcc 25260), which were isolated from humans, or with the type strains of porphyromonas salivosa (strain nctc 11632) and porphyromonas circumdentaria (strain nctc 12469), which were isolated from cats. the major cellular fatty acid of p. gingivicanis and p. crevioricanis is 13-methyltetradecanoic acid (iso-c15:0 acid). glutamate and malate dehydrogenases are present in both species, and 6-phosphogluconate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenases are absent; neither organism exhibits trypsin activity. p. gingivicanis and p. crevioricanis produce large amounts of acetic and isovaleric  acids and minor amounts of isobutyric and succinic acids as end products of metabolism in gam medium. p. gingivicanis also produces large amounts of butyric  acid and small amounts of propionic acid, while p. crevioricanis produces large amounts of propionic acid and minor amounts of butyric and phenylacetic acids. the g+c contents of the dna of p. gingivicanis is 41 to 42 mol%; the g+c content  of the dna of p. crevioricanis is 44 to 45 mol%. catalase is produced by p. gingivicanis but not by p. crevioricanis; strains of p. crevioricanis agglutinate sheep erythrocytes, but strains of p. gingivicanis do not.(abstract truncated at  250 words)

TI  == porphyromonas canoris sp. nov., an asaccharolytic, black-pigmented species from the gingival sulcus of dogs.
AB  == a new species, porphyromonas canoris, is proposed for black-pigmented asaccharolytic strains isolated from subgingival plaque samples from dogs with naturally occurring periodontal disease. this bacterium is an obligately anaerobic, nonmotile, non-spore-forming, gram-negative, rod-shaped organism. on laked rabbit blood or sheep blood agar plates, colonies are light brown to greenish brown after 2 to 4 days of incubation and dark brown after 14 days of incubation. colonies on egg yolk agar and on nonhemolyzed sheep blood agar are orange. the cells do not grow in the presence of 20% bile and have a guanine-plus-cytosine content of 49 to 51 mol%. the type strain is vpb 4878 (= nctc 12835). the average levels of dna-dna hybridization between p. canoris strains and other members of the genus porphyromonas are as follows: porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277t (t = type strain), 6.5%; porphyromonas gingivalis cat strain vpb 3492, 5%; porphyromonas endodontalis atcc 35406t, 1%; porphyromonas salivosa nctc 11362t, 5%; and porphyromonas circumdentaria nctc 12469t, 6%. the level of hybridization between p. canoris nctc 12835t dna and porphyromonas asaccharolytica atcc 25260t dna is 3%. p. canoris cells produce major amounts of acetic, propionic, isovaleric, and succinic acids and minor amounts of isobutyric and butyric acids as end products of metabolism in cooked meat medium. the major cellular fatty acid is 13-methyltetradecanoic acid (iso-c15:0). glutamate and malate dehydrogenases are present, as are glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (65.7 nmol mg of protein-1 min-1) and  6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity (63.0 nmol mg of protein-1 min-1).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == hydrolytic enzymes and lectin-binding activity of black-pigmented anaerobic rods.
AB  == recent taxonomic studies on black-pigmented anaerobic rods, a group of bacteria found on mucosal surfaces of humans and animals, led to the subdivision of existing species and to the creation of new species. the aim of this study was to characterize all 11 currently recognized species of black-pigmented bacteria (55  strains) for their ability to hydrolyse a variety of natural and synthetic substrates and for their lectin reactivity. although most of the strains demonstrated some activity against proteinaceous substrates, porphyromonas gingivalis was the only species able to hydrolyse type i collagen. most strains possessed glycylprolyl protease activity, elastase-like activity and phospholipase c activity, whereas trypsin-like activity was restricted to p. gingivalis, porphyromonas salivosa and bacteroides macacae. beta-lactamase activity was demonstrated in five strains belonging to the saccharolytic group. the lectin reactivity of the bacteria was determined by a dot-blot procedure using horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated lectins. three lectins, lotus a, rca-i and cona, failed to react with any of the bacteria tested. wga reacted strongly with the cell surface of human biotypes of asaccharolytic black-pigmented bacteria (p. gingivalis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica and porphyromonas endodontalis) and prevotella intermedia. the animal biotype strains of p. gingivalis showed a higher affinity for sba and pna than for wga.

TI  == phylogeny of bacteroides, prevotella, and porphyromonas spp. and related bacteria.
AB  == the phylogenetic structure of the bacteroides subgroup of the cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroides (cfb) phylum was examined by 16s rrna sequence  comparative analysis. approximately 95% of the 16s rrna sequence was determined for 36 representative strains of species of prevotella, bacteroides, and porphyromonas and related species by a modified sanger sequencing method. a phylogenetic tree was constructed from a corrected distance matrix by the neighbor-joining method, and the reliability of tree branching was established by bootstrap analysis. the bacteroides subgroup was divided primarily into three major phylogenetic clusters which contained most of the species examined. the first cluster, termed the prevotella cluster, was composed of 16 species of prevotella, including p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and the ruminal species p. ruminicola. two oral species, p. zoogleoformans and p. heparinolytica, which had been recently placed in the genus prevotella, did not fall within the prevotella cluster. these two species and six species of bacteroides, including the type species b. fragilis, formed the second cluster, termed the bacteroides cluster. the third cluster, termed the porphyromonas cluster, was divided into two subclusters. the first contained porphyromonas gingivalis, p. endodontalis, p. asaccharolytica, p. circumdentaria, p. salivosa,  [bacteroides] levii (the brackets around genus are used to indicate that the species does not belong to the genus by the sensu stricto definition), and [bacteroides] macacae, and the second subcluster contained [bacteroides] forsythus and [bacteroides] distasonis. [bacteroides] splanchnicus fell just outside the three major clusters but still belonged within the bacteroides subgroup. with few exceptions, the 16 s rrna data were in overall agreement with  previously proposed reclassifications of species of bacteroides, prevotella, and  porphyromonas. suggestions are made to accommodate those species which do not fit previous reclassification schemes.

TI  == effects of root planing on the distribution of microorganisms adult periodontitis sites.
AB  == the aims of this study were to identify the microbial species present in subgingival plaque in patients with adult periodontitis, and to investigate the effects of root planing upon the microbial flora for 12 months following root planing. microorganisms from samples of subgingival plaque obtained from adult periodontitis sites in 15 patients were cultured, both aerobically and anaerobically, on a variety of media and identified. prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas asaccharolytica were the most frequently identified species before  treatment. bacteroides ureolyticus, the prevotella veroralis/buccalis complex and other microorganisms including capnocytophaga ochracea, species of streptococci,  staphylococci and diphtheroids were also frequently isolated. root planing improved periodontal health, and was accompanied by reductions in the frequencies with which p. intermedia, p. asaccharolytica, the p. veroralis/buccalis complex and c. ochracea were isolated. regular scaling and oral hygiene reviews maintained the clinical improvements and balance in favour of beneficial microbial species during the study.

TI  == susceptibility of porphyromonas gingivalis and p. asaccharolytica to the non-oxidative killing mechanisms of human neutrophils.
AB  == neutrophils are essential for host defence against bacterial dental plaque and the pathogenic bacterial species within it, but in anaerobic environments such as the gingival crevice neutrophils can kill bacteria only with non-oxidative microbicidal compounds stored in their granules. porphyromonas gingivalis w83, a  pathogenic plaque species, and the avirulent non-oral type-strain p. asaccharolytica were incubated anaerobically with intact neutrophils and with compounds extracted from normal human neutrophil granules. the killing of bacteria and the inactivation of lysozyme, cathepsin g, elastase, bacterial-permeability increasing factor and defensins by culture supernatants were assayed. p. asaccharolytica but not p. gingivalis was killed under anaerobic conditions by intact neutrophils. p. gingivalis was also resistant to neutrophil  granule compounds, its viability being reduced from a mean of 3.3 x 10(6) to 6.1  x 10(4) c.f.u/ml in 60 min by 400 micrograms/ml neutrophil granule extract, as compared to a reduction from 4.4 x 10(6) to 2.3 x 10(3) c.f.u/ml for p. asaccharolytica. p. gingivalis culture supernatant inactivated cathepsin g, elastase, bacterial-permeability increasing factor and defensins. resistance to neutrophil non-oxidative killing mechanisms may be an important virulence factor  for p. gingivalis.
