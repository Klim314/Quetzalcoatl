antimicrobial, antitumor and brine shrimp lethality assay of ranunculus arvensis  l. extracts.
to investigate the antitumor activity, brine shrimp lethality assay, antibacterial and antifungal activity of methanol extract (me), water extract (we), acetone extract (ae), chloroform extract (ce), methanol-water extract (mwe), methanol-acetone extract (mae), methanol-chloroform extract (mce) of ranunculus arvensis (l.). antitumor activity was evaluated with agrobacterium tumefaciens (at10) induced potato disc assay. cytotoxicity was evaluated with brine shrimp lethality assay. antibacterial activity was evaluated with six bacterial strains including escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, bordetella bronchiseptica, klebsiella pneumoniae, micrococcus luteus and streptococcus anginosus and antifungal screening was done against five fungal strains including aspergillus niger, a. flavus, a. fumigates, fusarium solani and mucor species by using disc diffusion method. best antitumor activity was obtained with me and we, having highest ic50 values 20.27 +/- 1.62 and 93.01 +/- 1.33mug/disc. brine shrimp lethality assay showed lc50 values of ae, mae and me were obtained as 384.66 +/- 9.42mug/ml, 724.11 +/- 8.01mug/ml and 978.7 +/-8.01 mug/ml respectively. we of r. arvensis revealed weak antimicrobial result against the tested microorganisms. on the other hand, the antifungal activity of the plant extracts was found to be insignificant. these findings demonstrate that extracts of r. arvensis possesses significant antitumor activity. further extensive study is necessary to assess the therapeutic potential of the plant.
antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activity of plagiochasma appendiculatum lehm. et lind.
plagiochasma appendiculatum (aytoniaceae) of the order marchantiales is widely used in the form of paste ethnomedicinally by gaddi tribe in kangra valley for treating skin diseases. in this context, antimicrobical potential of plagiochasma appendiculatum against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. to validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing activity. the plant (alchoholic and aqueous extract) showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, and eight fungi candida albicans and cryptococcus albidus-dimorphic fungi, trichophyton rubrum-dermatophyte fungi, aspergillus niger, aspergillus flavus, aspergillus spinulosus, aspergillus terreus and aspergillus nidulans-systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and salmonella typhimurium) with an mic of 2.5 microg/disc. the results show that plagiochasma appendiculatum extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. the results also indicated that plagiochasma appendiculatum extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (sod) and catalase activity.
[reactivity to bacterial peptidoglycans in a phagocytosis system. the range of immunological specificity of escherichia coli peptidoglycan].
the antigenic specificity of e. coli m17 peptidoglycans (pg) was studied in the test system based on the stimulation of neutrophils with pg opsonized with the whole and exhausted igg fraction of human serum. within the generic taxon, the pg under study were similar in their antigenic properties. the opsonic activity of igg exhausted with the preparations of different e. coli strains decreased by 93.2-95.8%. an essential difference of e. coli pg from similar components of other representatives of the family enterobacteriaceae was observed: in experiments with serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri the decrease of opsonic activity was 47.6-79.3%. after the removal of antibodies to pg of remote taxons (staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, branchamella catarrhalis) the decrease of the opsonic effect was less noticeable (9.7-33.8%). the results are discussed from the viewpoint of the immunological peculiarity of pg at different taxonomic levels.
