TI  == effect of beta-lactamase inhibitors on beta-lactamases from anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == three beta-lactamase inhibitors in clinical use--clavulanic acid, sulbactam and tazobactam--were investigated for their activity on beta-lactamases from bacteroides uniformis, clostridium butyricum and fusobacterium nucleatum. purification of the beta-lactamases was carried out by anion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration and fplc. the inactivation of beta-lactamase activity was determined spectrophotometrically with nitrocefin as substrate. various concentrations of the inhibitors were preincubated at 30 degrees c together with the enzyme for different periods of time before determination of the beta-lactamase activity. the three beta-lactamases tested were more susceptible to tazobactam than to clavulanic acid and sulbactam. clavulanic acid  and sulbactam reduced the enzyme activity of the bacteroides uniformis beta-lactamase more effectively than the clostridium butyricum and fusobacterium  nucleatum beta-lactamases.

TI  == effect of clavulanic acid, sulbactam and tazobactam on three different beta-lactamases from bacteroides uniformis, clostridium butyricum and fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == the effect of three beta-lactamase inhibitors, clavulanic acid, sulbactam and tazobactam used in clinical practice were compared for their activity against purified beta-lactamases from bacteroides uniformis, clostridium butyricum and fusobacterium nucleatum. the enzymes from b. uniformis and c. butyricum were produced in fermenters under controlled growth conditions and the enzyme from f.  nucleatum was produced in batch cultures. purification of the beta-lactamases was achieved by anion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration and fplc-technique. the degree of inactivation of beta-lactamase activity was determined spectrophotometrically with nitrocefin as the substrate. the inhibitors in various concentrations were preincubated at 30 degrees c together with the enzyme for different time periods (0.5-120 min) before determination of the remaining beta-lactamase activity. the inhibitors all decreased the activity of the beta-lactamases investigated. clavulanic acid and sulbactam were capable of reducing the enzyme activity of the b. uniformis beta-lactamase more effectively  than the c. butyricum and f. nucleatum beta-lactamases. all beta-lactamases tested were more susceptible to tazobactam than to clavulanic acid and sulbactam.
