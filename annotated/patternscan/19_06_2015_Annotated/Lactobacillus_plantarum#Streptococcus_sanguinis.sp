TI  == antibacterial action of chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == objectives: the antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. methods:  the agar diffusion assay with cervitec((r)) and cervitecplus((r)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. in a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (cervitecplus((r)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (cervitec((r)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas intermedia. friedman/wilcoxon tests and u-test were used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05). results: most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: cervitec((r))/cervitecplus((r)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. however, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at  any time. the total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. a tendency to higher counts of a. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. conclusion: both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.

TI  == oral microbial profile discriminates breast-fed from formula-fed infants.
AB  == objectives: little is known about the effect of diet on the oral microbiota of infants, although diet is known to affect the gut microbiota. the aims of the present study were to compare the oral microbiota in breast-fed and formula-fed infants, and investigate growth inhibition of streptococci by infant-isolated lactobacilli. methods: a total of 207 mothers consented to participation of their 3-month-old infants. a total of 146 (70.5%) infants were exclusively and 38 (18.4%) partially breast-fed, and 23 (11.1%) were exclusively formula-fed. saliva from all of their infants was cultured for lactobacillus species, with isolate identifications from 21 infants. lactobacillus isolates were tested for their ability to suppress streptococcus mutans and s sanguinis. oral swabs from 73 infants were analysed by the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) and by quantitative polymerase chain reaction for lactobacillus gasseri. results: lactobacilli were cultured from 27.8% of exclusively and partially breast-fed infants, but not from formula-fed infants. the prevalence of 14 homim-detected taxa, and total salivary lactobacilli counts differed by feeding method. multivariate modelling of homim-detected bacteria and possible confounders clustered samples from breast-fed infants separately from formula-fed infants. the microbiota of breast-fed infants differed based on vaginal or c-section delivery. isolates of l plantarum, l gasseri, and l vaginalis inhibited growth of the cariogenic s mutans and the commensal s sanguinis: l plantarum >l gasseri >l  vaginalis. conclusions: the microbiota of the mouth differs between 3-month-old breast-fed and formula-fed infants. possible mechanisms for microbial differences observed include species suppression by lactobacilli indigenous to breast milk.

TI  == the effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  == objectives: our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. methods: twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (ms) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. the polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. the samples were cultured for ms, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. a part of the samples were subjected to dna-dna hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. paracasei, l. rhamnose, l. plantarum, streptococcus gordonii, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, veillonella parvula. results: the ms counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (p<.01) in the  xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. also the plaque ms percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (p<.01). the salivary ms counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. the dna-dna hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. conclusions: within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced ms counts in plaque  but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  == bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of  ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.

TI  == mobilization and location of the genetic determinant of chloramphenicol resistance from lactobacillus plantarum catc2r.
AB  == the mobilization of a nonconjugative plasmid (pcat) that mediates chloramphenicol resistance in lactobacillus plantarum catc2r was achieved by comobilization with  the conjugative plasmid pam beta 1. the conjugation studies confirmed that the 8.5-kb pcat in l. plantarum catc2r contains the gene responsible for chloramphenicol resistance and that the plasmid has several unique restriction sites which make it useful for genetic studies in carnobacterium spp. cloning studies showed that the gene responsible for chloramphenicol resistance is located in the 2.6-kb ecorv-sali region of pcat. this was confirmed by probing the 3.0-kb bglii fragment of pcat with a biotin-labeled 1.6-kb bsteii-hpaii fragment from the streptococcal-derived plasmid pva797(cmr). expression of chloramphenicol resistance in carnobacterium as well as in other lactobacillus species was achieved by electrotransformation using donor dna from pcat.

TI  == conjugal transfer of group b streptococcal plasmids and comobilization of escherichia coli-streptococcus shuttle plasmids to lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == the antibiotic resistance group b streptococcal plasmids, pip501 and pva797, were conjugally transferred from streptococcus faecalis to lactobacillus plantarum. the escherichia coli-streptococcus shuttle plasmids, pva838 and psa3, were mobilized from s. sanguis to l. plantarum by pva797 via cointegrate formation. pva838 readily resolved from pva797 and was present in l. plantarum as deletion derivatives. the pva797::psa3 cointegrate failed to resolve in l. plantarum.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

TI  == binding of lectins to streptococcus mutans cells and type-specific polysaccharides, and effect on adherence.
AB  == the lectin concanavalin a (con a) agglutinated the cells of 13 of 15 strains of the seven serotypes of streptococcus mutans in an 18-h incubation period. strains of types a, d, f, and g agglutinated within 2 h. strains of a, d, and f were also agglutinated in 2 h by the castor bean lectin rca. s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s.  bovis, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, and lactobacillus plantarum were agglutinated within 2 h. the s. mutans type f polysaccharide was precipitated by  con a. the a, b, c, d, and e polysaccharides were not precipitated. glucan from d and e strains of s. mutans and dextran t2000 were also precipitated by con a. d-glucose inhibited the agglutination of type f cells by con a and the agglutination of type d cells by d-galactose. the quantity of [acetyl-3h]con a bound was not proportional to the degree of agglutination. cells grown in sucrose medium bound more con a than those grown in glucose medium. after treatment with  dextranase, the sucrose-grown cells bound two- to fourfold more con a. the binding of con a to the type-specific polysaccharide or to teichoic acid could not be determined by the use of specific antibody due to the binding of con a to  the antibody globulin on the cell surface. con a bound to s. mutans cells did not inhibit the activity of cell-bound glucosyltransferase, glucan synthesis, and in  vitro adherence. bound con a also did not inhibit the ability of heat-treated cells to bind glucosyltransferase, synthesize glucan, and produce in vitro adherence.
