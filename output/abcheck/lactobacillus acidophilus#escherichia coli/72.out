regulation of the il-10/il-12 axis in human dendritic cells with probiotic bacteria.
in this study, we have used monocyte-derived dendritic cells (dcs) to design a screening model for the selection of microorganisms with the ability to suppress dc-secreted il-12p70, a critical cytokine for the induction of t-helper cell type 1 immune responses under inflammatory conditions. by the treatment of dcs with cocktails containing tlr agonists and proinflammatory cytokines, the cells increased the secretion of the th1-promoting cytokine il-12p70.
clinically used probiotics were tested for their il-10- and il-12p70-stimulating properties in immature dcs, and showed a dose-dependent change in the il-10/il-12p70 balance.
lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm() and the probiotic mixture vsl#3 showed a strong induction of il-12p70, whereas lactobacillus salivarius ls-33 and bifidobacterium infantis 35624 preferentially induced il-10.
escherichia coli nissle 1917 induced both il-10 and il-12p70, whereas the probiotic yeast saccharomyces boulardii induced low levels of cytokines.
when combining these microorganisms with the th1-promoting cocktails, e. coli nissle 1917 and b. infantis 35624 were potent suppressors of il-12p70 secretion in an il-10-independent manner, indicating a suppressive effect on th1-inducing antigen-presenting cells.
the present model, using cocktail-stimulated dcs with potent il-12p70-stimulating capacity, may be used as an efficient tool to assess the anti-inflammatory properties of microorganisms for potential clinical use.
