TI  == probiotic features of lactobacillus strains isolated from ragusano and pecorino siciliano cheeses.
AB  == in the present study 177 lactobacillus spp. strains, isolated from ragusano and pecorino siciliano cheeses, were in vitro screened for probiotic traits, and their characteristics were compared to those of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, commercial strain. based on acidic and bile salt resistance, thirteen lactobacillus strains were selected. the multiplex-pcr application revealed that  nine strains belonged to l. rhamnosus species and four to lactobacillus paracasei species. all selected strains were further investigated for transit tolerance in  simulated upper gastrointestinal tract (gi), for adhesion capacity to human intestinal cell lines, for hydrophobicity, for co-aggregation and auto-aggregation and for antimicrobial activities. moreover, antibiotic resistance, hemolytic and bile salt hydrolase activities were investigated for safety assessment. viable counts after simulated gastric and duodenal transit revealed that overall the selected lactobacilli tolerated better pancreatic juice and bile salts than acidic juice. in particular, three l. rhamnosus strains (fs10, fs2, and ps11) and one l. paracasei strain (pm8) increased their cell density after the simulated gi transit. the same strains showed also high percentage of auto-aggregation and co-aggregation with escherichia coli. all strains were effective against both staphylococcus aureus and e. coli and variability was achieved versus listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus faecalis  used as pathogenic indicator strains. different behavior was revealed by strains  for adhesion ability and hydrophobicity, which are not always linked each other and are strongly strain-dependent. from the safety point of view, no isolate showed hemolytic and bile salt hydrolase activities, except one, and most of the  strains were sensitive to a broad range of clinical antibiotics. this work showed that the l. rhamnosus fs10 and the l. paracasei pm8 are good promising probiotic  candidates for further in vivo investigations.

TI  == biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  == "nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in trentino-alto adige, italy. this study identified lactic acid bacteria (lab) developing during maturation of "nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential  to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). a total  of 1,059 lab isolates were screened using random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and differentiated into 583 clusters. lab strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. lab species most frequently isolated were lactobacillus paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus, and leuconostoc mesenteroides. the 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing gaba by  high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). about 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce gaba. most gaba producers were lactobacillus paracasei but other gaba producing species included  lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, pediococcus pentosaceus, and streptococcus thermophilus. no enterococcus faecalis or sc. macedonicus isolates produced gaba. the isolate producing the highest amount of gaba (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a sc. thermophilus.

TI  == the influence of the wooden equipment employed for cheese manufacture on the characteristics of a traditional stretched cheese during ripening.
AB  == the influence of the wooden equipment used for the traditional cheese manufacturing from raw milk was evaluated on the variations of chemico-physical characteristics and microbial populations during the ripening of caciocavallo palermitano cheese. milk from two farms (a, extensive; b, intensive) was processed in traditional and standard conditions. chemical and physical traits of cheeses were affected by the farming system and the cheese making technology, and changed during ripening. content in nacl and n soluble was lower, and paste consistency higher in cheese from the extensive farm and traditional technology,  whereas ripening increased the n soluble and the paste yellow and consistency. the ripening time decreased the number of all lactic acid bacteria (lab) groups,  except enterococci detected at approximately constant levels (10(4) and 10(5) cfu g(-1) for standard and traditional cheeses, respectively), till 120 d of ripening. in all productions, at each ripening time, the levels detected for enterococci were lower than those for the other lab groups. the canonical discriminant analysis of chemical, physical and microbiological data was able to  separate cheeses from different productions and ripening time. the dominant lab were isolated, phenotypically characterised and grouped, genetically differentiated at strain level and identified. ten species of lab were found and  the strains detected at the highest levels were pediococcus acidilactici and lactobacillus casei. ten strains, mainly belonging to lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus fermentum showed an antibacterial activity. the comparison of the polymorphic profiles of the lab strains isolated from the wooden vat with those of the strains collected during maturation, showed the persistence of three enterococci in traditional cheeses, with enterococcus faecalis found at dominant  levels over the enterococcus population till 120 d; the absence of these strains  in the standard productions evidenced the contribution of vat lab during caciocavallo palermitano cheese ripening.

TI  == effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  == bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. cell-free supernatants (cfs) were prepared from growth of enterococcus faecalis atcc 19433, pseudomonas fluorescens atcc 13525, escherichia coli 08, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, bacillus subtilis 168, bacillus coagulans 185a, b. coagulans 7050, clostridium sporogenes pa3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus salivarius, and streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. the inhibitory effects of cfs on  the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and tulane virus in raw 264.7 and llcmk2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of cfs or after exposure of host cells to cfs. slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and tulane virus in the continuous presence of cfs  of b. subtilis 168 and e. faecalis 19433, respectively. cfs cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. virus persisted in the cfs that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of cfs on virions. the viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from infant faeces as potential probiotic starter cultures for fermented sausages.
AB  == a total of 109 lactic acid bacteria isolated from infant faeces were identified by partial 16s rrna, cpn60 and/or phes sequencing. lactobacillus was the most prevalent genus, representing 48% of the isolates followed by enterococcus (38%). lactobacillus gasseri (21%) and enterococcus faecalis (38%) were the main species detected. a further selection of potential probiotic starter cultures for fermented sausages focused on lactobacillus as the most technologically relevant  genus in this type of product. lactobacilli strains were evaluated for their ability to grow in vitro in the processing conditions of fermented sausages and for their functional and safety properties, including antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens, survival from gastrointestinal tract conditions (acidity, bile and pancreatin), tyramine production, antibiotic susceptibility and aggregation capacity. the best strains according to the results obtained were lactobacillus casei/paracasei ctc1677, l. casei/paracasei ctc1678, lactobacillus  rhamnosus ctc1679, l. gasseri ctc1700, l. gasseri ctc1704, lactobacillus fermentum ctc1693. those strains were further assayed as starter cultures in model sausages. l. casei/paracasei ctc1677, l. casei/paracasei ctc1678 and l. rhamnosus ctc1679 were able to lead the fermentation and dominate (levels ca. 10(8) cfu/g) the endogenous lactic acid bacteria, confirming their suitability as probiotic starter cultures.

TI  == immunostimulatory cpg motifs in the genomes of gut bacteria and their role in human health and disease.
AB  == toll-like receptor (tlr) signalling plays an important role in epithelial and immune cells of the intestine. tlr9 recognizes unmethylated cpg motifs in bacterial dna, and tlr9 signalling maintains the gut epithelial homeostasis. here, we carried out a bioinformatic analysis of the frequency of cpg motifs in the genomes of gut commensal bacteria across major bacterial phyla. the frequency of potentially immunostimulatory cpg motifs (all cpg hexamers) or purine-purine-cg-pyrimidine-pyrimidine hexamers was linearly dependent on the genomic g+c content. we found that species belonging to proteobacteria, bacteroidetes and actinobacteria (including bifidobacteria) carried high counts of gtcgtt, the optimal motif stimulating human tlr9. we also found that enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus rhamnosus, whose strains have been marketed as probiotics, had high counts of gtcgtt motifs. as gut bacterial species differ significantly in their genomic content of cpg motifs, the overall load of cpg motifs in the intestine depends on the species assembly of microbiota and their cell numbers. the optimal cpg motif content of microbiota may depend on the host's physiological status and, consequently, on an adequate level of tlr9 signalling. we speculate that microbiota with increased numbers of microbes with cpg motif-rich dna could better support mucosal functions in healthy individuals and improve the t-helper  1 (th1)/th2 imbalance in allergic diseases. in autoimmune disorders, cpg motif-rich dna could, however, further increase the th1-type immune responsiveness. estimation of the load of microbe-associated molecular patterns,  including cpg motifs, in gut microbiota could shed new light on host-microbe interactions across a range of diseases.

TI  == utilization of major fucosylated and sialylated human milk oligosaccharides by isolated human gut microbes.
AB  == human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) are not digested in the proximal intestine. in distal intestine, hmos collectively modify the microbiota, but the response of individual bacteria to individual components of the hmos is not well defined. here, each of 25 major isolates of the human intestinal microbiota was fed individual major fucosylated and sialylated hmos in anaerobic culture. this allowed for an assessment of the influence of specific hmos on the growth and metabolic products of individual microbiota bacteria. most bifidobacteria spp. and bacteroides spp. grew, induced alpha-l-fucosidase activity, and produced abundant lactate or short-chain fatty acids (scfas) when fed 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-fl), 3-fl, and lactodifucotetraose (ldft). lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc7830, enterococcus faecalis atcc19433, and streptococcus thermophilus atcc19258 exhibited slight growth, ph reduction, and lactate production when supplemented with 2'-fl or 3-fl, but not ldft. supplementation with 3'-sialyllactose (3'-sl) and 6'-sl promoted moderate growth of bifidobacterium longum jcm7007, 7009, 7010, 7011, 1272, 11347, atcc15708, bacteroides vulgatus atcc8482, and b. thetaiotaomicron atcc29148; accordingly, these bacteria exhibited greater neuraminidase activity and produced copious lactate, scfa, or both. lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc7830 also consumed 6'-sl. in contrast, clostridium spp., l. rhamnosus atcc53103, e. faecalis atcc29200, staphylococcus spp., enterobacter spp., and escherichia coli k12 did not consume milk oligosaccharides nor produce appreciable acidic fermentation products. specific bifidobacteria and bacteroides differentially digest specific individual hmos, with the major fucosylated milk oligosaccharides most strongly stimulating key species of mutualist symbionts. this suggests strategies for treating dysbiosis of the microbiota and associated inflammatory disorders.

TI  == distribution of antimicrobial-resistant lactic acid bacteria in natural cheese in japan.
AB  == to determine and compare the extent of contamination caused by antimicrobial-resistant lactic acid bacteria (lab) in imported and domestic natural cheeses on the japanese market, lab were isolated using deman, rogosa and sharpe (mrs) agar and mrs agar supplemented with six antimicrobials. from 38 imported and 24 japanese cheeses, 409 lab isolates were obtained and their antimicrobial resistance was tested. the percentage of lab resistant to dihydrostreptomycin, erythromycin, and/or oxytetracycline isolated from imported  cheeses (42.1%) was significantly higher than that of lab resistant to dihydrostreptomycin or oxytetracycline from cheeses produced in japan (16.7%; p=0.04). antimicrobial resistance genes were detected in enterococcus faecalis (tetl, tetm, and ermb; tetl and ermb; tetm) e. faecium (tetm), lactococcus lactis (tets), lactobacillus (lb.), casei/paracasei (tetm or tetw), and lb. rhamnosus (ermb) isolated from seven imported cheeses. moreover, these e. faecalis isolates were able to transfer antimicrobial resistance gene(s). although antimicrobial resistance genes were not detected in any lab isolates from japanese cheeses, lb. casei/paracasei and lb. coryniformis isolates from a japanese farm-made cheese were resistant to oxytetracycline (minimal inhibitory concentration [mic], 32 microg/ml). leuconostoc isolates from three japanese farm-made cheeses were also  resistant to dihydrostreptomycin (mic, 32 to >512 microg/ml). in conclusion, the  present study demonstrated contamination with antimicrobial-resistant lab in imported and japanese farm-made cheeses on the japanese market, but not in japanese commercial cheeses.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == evaluation of impact of exposure of sudan azo dyes and their metabolites on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == sudan azo dyes are banned for food usage in most countries, but they are illegally used to maintain or enhance the color of food products due to low cost, bright staining, and wide availability of the dyes. in this report, we examined the toxic effects of these azo dyes and their potential reduction metabolites on  11 prevalent human intestinal bacterial strains. among the tested bacteria, cell  growth of 2, 3, 5, 5, and 1 strains was inhibited by sudan i, ii, iii, iv, and para red, respectively. at the tested concentration of 100 mum, sudan i and ii inhibited growth of clostridium perfringens and lactobacillus rhamnosus with decrease of growth rates from 14 to 47%. sudan ii also affected growth of enterococcus faecalis. growth of bifidobacterium catenulatum, c. perfringens, e.  faecalis, escherichia coli, and peptostreptococcus magnus was affected by sudan iii and iv with decrease in growth rates from 11 to 67%. c. perfringens was the only strain in which growth was affected by para red with 47 and 26% growth decreases at 6 and 10 h, respectively. 1-amino-2-naphthol, a common metabolite of the dyes, was capable of inhibiting growth of most of the tested bacteria with inhibition rates from 8 to 46%. however, the other metabolites of the dyes had no effect on growth of the bacterial strains. the dyes and their metabolites had less effect on cell viability than on cell growth of the tested bacterial strains. clostridium indolis and clostridium ramosum were the only two strains with about a 10 % decrease in cell viability in the presence of sudan azo dyes. the present results suggested that sudan azo dyes and their metabolites potentially affect the human intestinal bacterial ecology by selectively inhibiting some bacterial species, which may have an adverse effect on human health.

TI  == characterization of certain bacterial strains for potential use as starter or probiotic cultures in dairy products.
AB  == the present work was aimed at characterizing 12 strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) to obtain improved potential starter or probiotic cultures that could be used for making dairy products from ewe's milk and cow's milk. eight strains with antimicrobial properties, isolated from ewe's milk and from cheese made from ewe's and/or cow's milk, were studied. they were identified as enterococcus faecalis (five strains), lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (one strain of each species). additionally, four strains were obtained from the american type culture collection: lactobacillus casei 393 (isolated from cheese), l. lactis subsp. lactis 11454 (origin nonspecified and a producer of nisin), and two strains isolated from human feces (l. paracasei subsp. paracasei 27092 and lactobacillus  rhamnosus 53103, antibacterial agent producer). all e. faecalis strains showed at least one virulence factor (either hemolysin or gelatinase), which emphasizes the importance of these studies in this species. both l. lactis strains and most lactobacillus spp. were good acidifiers in ewe's milk and cow's milk at 30 degrees c. high beta-galactosidase activity, as well as aminopeptidase activities that favor the development of desirable flavors in cheese, were detected in all lactobacillus spp. strains. furthermore, l. rhamnosus atcc 53103 showed alpha-fucosidase activity (thought to help colonization of the intestine) and lack of alpha-glucosidase activity (a trait considered positive for diabetic and  obese humans). this last enzymatic activity was also lacking in l. lactis atcc 11454. l. mesenteroides was the only strain d(2)-lactic acid producer. the selection of any particular strain for probiotic or dairy cultures should be performed according to the technological and/or functional abilities needed.

TI  == diversity and dynamics of bacterial populations during spontaneous sorghum fermentations used to produce ting, a south african food.
AB  == ting is a spontaneously fermented sorghum food that is popular for its sour taste and unique flavour. insight of the microbial diversity and population dynamics during sorghum fermentations is an essential component of the development of starter cultures for commercial production of ting. in this study, bacterial populations associated with spontaneous sorghum fermentations were examined using a culture-independent strategy based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequence analysis of v3-16s rrna gene amplicons, and a culture-dependent strategy using conventional isolation based on culturing followed by 16s rrna and/or phes gene sequence analysis. the entire fermentation process was monitored over a 54 h period and two phases were observed with respect to ph evolution and  microbial succession. the first phase of the process (0-6h) was characterized by  relatively high ph conditions and the presence of enterococcus mundtii, albeit that this species was only detected with the culture-dependent approach. the second phase of the fermentation process (12-54 h) was characterized by increased acidity and the predominance of a broader range of lactic acid bacteria, including lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, weissella cibaria, enterococcus faecalis, and a close relative of lactobacillus curvatus, as well as some members of the enterobacteriaceae family. the lb. curvatus-like species was only detected with pcr-dgge, while the majority of the other species was only detected using the culture-dependent approach. these findings highlighted the fact that a combination of both approaches was essential in revealing the microbial diversity and dynamics during spontaneous sorghum fermentations.

TI  == potential beneficial properties of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from smoked salmon.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the probiotic properties of strains isolated from smoked salmon and previously identified as bacteriocin producers. methods and results: strains  lactobacillus curvatus et06, et30 and et31, lactobacillus fermentum et35, lactobacillus delbrueckii et32, pediococcus acidilactici et34 and enterococcus faecium et05, et12 and et88 survived conditions simulating the gastrointestinal tract (git) and produced bacteriocins active against several strains of listeria  monocytogenes, but presented very low activity against other lactic acid bacteria (lab). cell-free supernatants containing bacteriocins, added to 3-h-old cultures  of l. monocytogenes 603, suppressed growth over 12 h. auto-aggregation was strain-specific, and values ranged from 7.2% for et35 to 12.1% for et05. various  degrees of co-aggregation with l. monocytogenes 603, lactobacillus sakei atcc 15521 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 19443 were observed. adherence of the bacteriocinogenic strains to caco-2 cells was within the range reported for lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, a well-known probiotic. the highest levels of hydrophobicity were recorded for lact. curvatus (61.9-64.6%), lact. fermentum (78.9%), lact. delbrueckii (43.7%) and ped. acidilactici (51.3%), which are higher than the one recorded for lact. rhamnosus gg (53.3%). these strains were highly sensitive to several antibiotics and affected by several drugs from different generic groups in a strain-dependent manner. conclusions: smoked salmon is a rich source of probiotic lab. all strains survived conditions simulating the git and produced bacteriocins active against various pathogens. adherence to caco-2 cells was within the range reported for lact. rhamnosus gg, a well-known probiotic. in addition, the high hydrophobicity readings recorded define the strains as good probiotics.

TI  == preservation of viability and antibacterial activity of lactobacillus spp. in calcium alginate beads.
AB  == the objective of the study was to produce calcium alginate beads able to deliver  lactobacillus spp. (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus bulgaricus and lactobacillus lactis) with preserved viability and antibacterial activity. four types of beads, containing entrapped (e), surface and entrapped (es), surface (s) and concentrated surface and entrapped lactobacilli (c(es)) were prepared and physically characterized. the antibacterial activity of lactobacilli cultures before and after immobilization,  freeze-drying and throughout storage was studied in relationship to the viable number of lactobacilli. multi-resistant clinical isolates (methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus, vancomycine-resistant enterococcus faecalis, vim-2-metalo-beta-lactamase producing pseudomonas aeruginosa and ctx-m-15-beta-lactamase producing strains: escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae) were used as indicator strains. alginate beads in which lactobacilli  proliferated to the beads surface (es and c(es)) differed significantly from the  other types of beads in their physicochemical properties, showing smoother surface morphology, more spherical shape, bigger weight, lower calcium content, density and crushing force. lactobacilli cultures, at high cell concentrations (10(8)cfu/ml) were active against both gram-positive and negative multi-resistant bacteria. beads containing both entrapped and surface lactobacilli (es) resulted  in viability and antibacterial activity most similar to non-processed lactobacilli cultures. the viability and antibacterial activity of the immobilized lactobacilli remained stable after 6 months storage.

TI  == effect of probiotic bacterial strains of lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and enterococcus on enteroaggregative escherichia coli.
AB  == the effects of nine probiotic strains of lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and enterococcus on the growth, adhesion activity, and biofilm formation of enteroaggregative escherichia coli (eaggec) were examined. the culture supernatant of the e. faecium strain, with or without ph adjustment to a neutral  ph, had a strong bactericidal effect on eaggec, including induction of membrane damage and cell lysis. supernatants of the l. casei ss. casei and l. casei ss. rhamnosus strains also had a bactericidal effect on eaggec, but this activity was abolished by ph adjustment to a neutral ph. no inhibitory effect of the culture supernatants of bifidobacterium or e. faecalis strains was detected. adhesion of  eaggec to intestinal epithelial cells was not inhibited by the bacterial strains  tested. two strains of l. casei enhanced eaggec biofilm formation, which was characterized by increased bacterial proliferation. these results suggest that the three different bacterial species; lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and enterococcus, have different effects on eaggec, and that further analysis is required for the practical use of these bacteria as probiotics against eaggec infection.

TI  == sudan azo dyes and para red degradation by prevalent bacteria of the human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == sudan azo dyes have genotoxic effects and ingestion of food products contaminated with sudan i, ii, iii, iv, and para red could lead to exposure in the human gastrointestinal tract. in this study, we examined thirty-five prevalent species  of human intestinal bacteria to evaluate their capacity to degrade sudan dyes and para red. among these tested bacterial strains, 23, 13, 33, 30, and 29 out of 35  species tested were able to reduce sudan i, ii, iii, iv, and para red, respectively, to some extent. bifidobacterium infantis, clostridium indolis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and ruminococcus obeum were able  to reduce completely all four tested sudan dyes and para red. escherichia coli and peptostreptococcus magnus were the only two strains that were not able to reduce any of the tested sudan dyes and para red to any significant extent. metabolites of the reduction of the tested sudan dyes and para red by e. faecalis were isolated and identified by hplc and lc/esi-ms analyses and compared with authentic standards. thus it appears that the ability to reduce sudan dyes and para red except sudan ii is common among bacteria in the human colon.

TI  == characterization of a small erythromycin resistance plasmid plfe1 from the food-isolate lactobacillus plantarum m345.
AB  == this paper reports the complete 4031 bp nucleotide sequence of the small erythromycin resistance plasmid plfe1 isolated from the raw-milk cheese isolate lactobacillus plantarum m345. analysis of the sequence revealed the coding regions for the erythromycin resistance determinant erm(b). a replication initiation protein repb was identified belonging to the repb proteins of the pmv158 family of rolling-circle replicating plasmids. the transcriptional repressor protein copg and a small counter transcribed rna, two elements typically involved in replication control within this family were also found. a putative replication initiation site including a single-strand origin (sso) -like region succeeded by a characteristic pmv158 family double-strand origin (dso) was located upstream of the replication region. an open reading frame following a typical origin of transfer (orit) site and coding for a putative truncated mobilization (mob) protein with a size of 83 aa was detected. the product of the  putative mob gene showed large similarity to the n-terminal region of the pmv158  family of pre/mob proteins, but was much smaller than other proteins of this family. we therefore suggest that the mob function in plfe1 is supplied in trans  from another plasmid present in l. plantarum m345.filter-mating experiments showed that plfe1 has a broad host-range with transconjugants obtained from lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, listeria innocua, the opportunistic  pathogen enterococcus faecalis and the pathogen listeria monocytogenes.

TI  == phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from "alheira", a traditional fermented sausage produced in portugal.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from "alheira", a fermented sausage produced  in portugal. lab were identified to genus and species level by phenotypic characteristics, using genus or species-specific primers and sequencing of the gene encoding 16s rrna. two-hundred and eighty-three isolates were grouped into 14 species. lactobacillus plantarum was isolated from all sausages and enterococcusfaecalis from most of the samples. low numbers of lactobacillus paraplantarum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus zeae, lactobacillus paracasei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, pediococcus pentosaceus, pediococcus acidilactici, weissella cibaria, weissella viridescens and enterococcus faecium were recorded. the genetic heterogeneity of  l. plantarum and e. faecalis strains were determined by numerical analysis of dna banding patterns obtained by rapd-pcr. strains of l. plantarum and e. faecalis were different from different producers. this study forms the basis from which starter cultures could be selected for production of "alheira".

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria in two flemish artisan raw milk gouda-type cheeses.
AB  == pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) was used to study the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in two flemish artisan raw milk gouda-type cheeses. in parallel, conventional culturing was performed. isolates were identified using (gtg)(5)-pcr and sequence analysis of 16s rrna and phes genes. discriminant analysis revealed some differences in overall lab diversity between the two batches and between the two cheeses. within each batch, the diversity of 8- and 12-week-old cheeses was relatively similar. conventional isolation mainly revealed the presence of lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus rhamnosus and pediococcus pentosaceus. pcr-dgge revealed the presence of three species of which no isolates were recovered, i.e. enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus gallinarum. conversely, not all isolated bacteria were detected by  pcr-dgge. we recommend the integrated use of culture-dependent and -independent approaches to maximally encompass the taxonomic spectrum of lab occurring in gouda-type and other cheeses.

AB  == a total of 567 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains were isolated from the stool samples of longevous people in regions of hotan, xinjiang and bama, guangxi, china. in order to reduce the number of strains for further examinations, 36 isolates were screened out for further examination whilst the other strains, which had lower probiotic properties, were not suitable for yogurt production due to the absence of growth in ph 3.5 mrs medium and no curding during fermentation, and so were excluded. the result of identification by api, sequence analysis of 16s rrna and random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis showed that there were three strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, 10 strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus, three strains of lactobacillus casein, three strains of lactobacillus  brevis, two strains of enterococcus faecium, two strains of enterococcus faecalis, four strains of bifdibacterium infantis, three strains of bifdibacterium brevise, three strains of bifdibacterium bifidium, two strains of  bifdibacterium adolecentis and one strain of bifdibacterium longam among the 36 isolates. these strains were evaluated by in vitro methods including survival upon exposure to ph 2.0, 3.0 and/or 0.3% oxgall and adhesion to the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line caco-2 as well as antimicrobial activity against potential pathogens. the results presented here show that l. rhamnosus lv108, l.  rhamnosus f, b. brevise r39 and b. infantis r42 are acid and bile tolerant, adhere to the cultured human intestinal caco-2 cell line, antagonistic activity against potential pathogenic bacteria infection in vitro, and so are potential strains for probiotic use.

TI  == analysis of vaginal lactic acid producing bacteria in healthy women.
AB  == vaginal lactic acid-producing bacteria of 80 pre-menopausal women were studied by isolation on blood and deman-rogosa-sharpe agar, pcr with group-specific primers  for lactobacillus-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), and pcr with specific primers for v3 region in 16s rrna-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (ttge). conventional isolation method on media detected only one  lactobacillus (lactobacillus brevis) while ttge detected only lactobacillus sp. dgge detected seven lactobacillus species; l. coleohominis, l. crispatus, l. iners, l. reuteri, l. rhamnosus, l. vaginalis, and leuconostoc lactis. l. acidophilus and l. gasseri, which are prevalent in western women, were not detected in korean women. furthermore, l. rhamnosus, leuc. lactis, l. coleohominis, and weissella cibaria, which were not previously reported in the vaginal microbiota of korean women, were detected. the five most prevalent labs in vaginal microbiota in korean women were l. iners, enterococcus faecalis, l. crispatus, leuc. lactis, and w. cibaria.

TI  == characterization of dominant lactic acid bacteria isolated from sao jorge cheese, using biochemical and ribotyping methods.
AB  == aims: to identify, using phenotypic and genotypic methods, the dominant lactic acid bacteria (lab) present in sao jorge cheese - one of the 11 portuguese cheeses currently bearing an appellation d'origine protegee status. methods and results: a total of 225 isolates from milk, curd and cheeses throughout ripening  were identified to the genus level, 108 to the species level and ten to the strain level. phenotypic methods indicated that lactobacilli, followed by enterococci, were the dominant bacteria. the most frequently isolated species were lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, enterococcus faecalis and  enterococcus faecium. ribotyping differentiated three l. paracasei, two e. faecalis and one lactobacillus plantarum types. enterococcus spp. exhibited the highest esterase and beta-galactosidase activities among all isolates. conclusions: the dominant lab in sao jorge cheese are l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, e. faecalis and e. faecium. enterococcus likely plays a leading role upon acidification and aroma development in said cheese. significance and impact of the study: our results support that a combination of conventional biochemical methods with genotypic methods allows for a thorough characterization and identification of isolates. despite the limited number of isolates subject to molecular subtyping, a few specific enterococcus and lactobacillus strains were found that are promising ones for development of a starter culture. hence, l. paracasei and e. faecalis are good candidates for a tentative starter culture, designed for manufacturing of sao jorge cheese at large - which takes advantage of actual isolates, in attempts to eventually standardize the quality of said cheese variety.

TI  == g-csf-mediated inhibition of jnk is a key mechanism for lactobacillus rhamnosus-induced suppression of tnf production in macrophages.
AB  == lactobacillus rhamnosus is a human commensal with known immunomodulatory properties. to date the mechanism of these immunomodulatory effects is not well understood. to unravel the immunomodulatory signalling mechanism, we investigated the effects of two strains of l. rhamnosus, l. rhamnosus gg and gr-1, in modulating production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf) in human monocytic cell line thp-1 and mouse macrophages. live l. rhamnosus gg and gr-1 or their spent culture supernatant induced minuscule amounts of tnf production but large quantities of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (g-csf) in macrophages compared with those induced by pathogenic escherichia coli gr-12 and enterococcus faecalis. by using neutralizing antibodies and g-csf receptor knockout mice, we demonstrated that g-csf secreted from l. rhamnosus gg- and gr-1-exposed macrophages suppressed tnf production induced by e. coli- or lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages through a paracrine route. the suppression of tnf production by g-csf was mediated through activation of stat3 and subsequent inhibition of c-jun-n-terminal kinases (jnks). the inhibition of jnk activation required stat3alpha-mediated de novo protein synthesis. this demonstrates a novel role of g-csf in l. rhamnosus-triggered anti-inflammatory effects and its mechanism in the suppression of tnf production in macrophages.

TI  == rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by m13-generated, rapd-pcr fingerprint databases.
AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == alkali-resistant bacteria in root canal systems.
AB  == the aim of this study was to isolate and identify alkali-resistant bacteria from  the dentin of infected root canals. bacteria from homogenized dentin powder made  up from infected root canal walls from human teeth were cultured on buffer-enriched brain heart infusion agar supplemented with 4% sheep blood (bhi-blood agar), adjusted to ph 7.0, 9.0 or 10.0. incubation took place for 7 days at 37 degrees c in an anaerobic glove box. bacterial strains selected according to colony and morphology were subcultured in buffer-enriched bhi broth  adjusted to ph 9.0, 10.0 or 11.0 to confirm their growth as alkali-resistant bacteria. polymerase chain reaction amplification using specific primer sets and  16s rdna sequence analysis was performed for identification of alkali-resistant isolates. in the present study, 37 teeth extracted from 37 patients were used for preparation of the dentin powder samples. bacteria were detected in 25 samples when standard bhi-blood agars (ph 7.0) were used. of these, 29 strains from 15 samples were alkali resistant, 25 strains growing at ph 9.0 and 4 at ph 10.0. the alkali-resistant strains included enterococcus faecium (10 strains) and enterococcus faecalis (2 strains), enterobacter cancerogenus (1 strains), fusobacterium nucleatum (1 strains), klebsiella ornithinolytica (2 strains), lactobacillus rhamnosus (2 strains), streptococcus anginosus (2 strains), streptococcus constellatus (3 strains), and streptococcus mitis (2 strains). three strains were also identified as bacteria of genus firmicutes or staphylococcus at the genus level. the present study showed that many bacterial species in infected root canal dentin were alkali-resistant at ph 9.0 and/or ph 10.0, and belonged mainly to the genus enterococcus.

TI  == [search of promising strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus for the development of new biopreparations].
AB  == for the first time the species composition of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in  clinically healthy young children has been studied. as revealed in this study, the dominating species of bifidobacteria are b. longum, b. adolescentis and b. infantis, while the dominating species of lactobacilli are lactobacillus acidophilus and l. rhamnosus. in 83 isolated cultures of bifidobacteria and 34 isolated species of lactobacilli the activity of acid formation and the antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium perfringens have been tested. b. longum strain 58b, b. infantis strain 37b, l. rhamnosus strain 12l and l. acidophilus strain 27l, typical for children of this age group, having good antagonistic activity and pronounced acid-forming properties, have been selected. these strains hold good promise to be used as the basis for the development of a  complex probiotic preparation for correcting intestinal microflora in young children.

TI  == probiotic activities of lactobacillus casei rhamnosus: in vitro adherence to intestinal cells and antimicrobial properties.
AB  == the interest of probiotics as remedies for a broad number of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases has gained wide interest over the last few years, but little is known about their underlying mechanism of action. in this study, the probiotic activities of a human isolate of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus strain (lcr35) were investigated. using intestinal caco-2 cell line in an in vitro model, we demonstrated that this strain exhibited adhesive properties. the  inhibitory effects of lcr35 organisms on the adherence of three pathogens, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) and klebsiella pneumoniae, were determined. a decrease in the number of adhering pathogens was observed, using either preincubation, postincubation or coincubation of the pathogens with lcr35. moreover, the antibacterial activities  of cell-free lcr35 supernatant was examined against nine human pathogenic bacteria, etec, epec, k. pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile. the growth of all strains was inhibited, as measured by determining the number of viable bacteria over time, but no bactericidal activity was detected in this in vitro assay. together, these findings suggest that this probiotic strain could be used to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by a large variety of pathogens.

TI  == weissella confusa (basonym: lactobacillus confusus) bacteremia: a case report.
AB  == infection with lactobacillus is rare, and only a handful of species have been identified as being clinically significant: lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus leichmannii. the literature contains one case report of bacteremia caused by weissella confusa (basonym: lactobacillus confusus), but  the clinical significance of the infection was unclear. we describe a case of w.  confusa bacteremia in a 46-year-old man with a history of abdominal aortic dissection and repair. this procedure was complicated by gut ischemia, which necessitated massive small bowel resection. he subsequently developed short-bowel syndrome, which required him to have total parenteral nutrition. he later developed an enterococcus faecalis aortic valve endocarditis that required a coronary artery bypass graft and aortic root replacement with homograft and 6 weeks of intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin. three months prior to his most recent admission, he was diagnosed with klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia and candidemia. at the present admission, he had fever (t(max), 39.5 degrees c) and chills of 2 days' duration and was admitted to the intensive care unit because of hemodynamic instability. blood cultures grew k. pneumoniae and w. confusa in four of four blood culture bottles (both aerobe and anaerobe bottles). imaging studies failed to find any foci of infection. a transesophageal echocardiogram revealed no vegetations. a culture of the patient's hickman catheter tip was negative. the patient was treated with piperacillin-tazobactam and gentamicin. his condition improved, and he was discharged home, where he completed 4 weeks of piperacillin-tazobactam therapy. lactobacillemia seldom results in mortality; however, it may be a marker of a serious underlying disease. it is usually seen in patients who have a complex medical history or in patients who receive multiple antibiotics. lactobacillus spp. are generally associated with polymicrobial infections, and when isolated from the blood, they need to be considered possible pathogens. the presence of a vancomycin-resistant, gram-positive coccobacilli on a blood culture should alert clinicians to the possibility of bacteremia caused by w. confusa or other small gram-positive rods.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == effect of nutrient composition on the in vitro growth of urogenital lactobacilli  and uropathogens.
AB  == previous clinical studies have shown that nutrients and probiotic agents can alter the composition of the vaginal flora. the present in vitro study has shown  that uropathogens have a growth advantage over lactobacilli, but potentially there are natural substances that could be applied vaginally to stimulate lactobacilli growth to the detriment of the pathogens. when chemically defined medium representative of vaginal fluid at ph 5.5 was supplemented with skim milk, it acted as a better substrate for lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 than for uropathogenic bacteria and candida albicans. lactobacillus mrs medium, even at ph 4.5, supports the growth of pathogens, but when supplemented with ascorbic acid or edta, lactobacillus growth was significantly higher. when l. rhamnosus gr-1 was coincubated in a combined nutrient composition of vitamins and lactose, it survived better than escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis. these in vitro results provide a basis for testing nutritional supplements to alter the urogenital flora in an attempt to enhance restoration and maintenance of a normal disease-free state.

TI  == the colonization of a simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem by a  probiotic strain fed on a fermented oat bran product: effects on the gastrointestinal microbiota.
AB  == the effects of lactobacillus-gg-fermented oat bran product on the microbiota and  its metabolic activity in the human gut were investigated, using a simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (shime), by analysing the bacterial population, shortchain fatty acids and gas production. in addition, the effects of fermented oat bran supernatant and supernatant samples from reactors 4, 5 and  6 (large intestine) on the growth of escherichia coli ihe 13047, enterococcus faecalis vtt e-93203, lactobacillus rhamnosus vtt e-94522 (lactobacillus gg) and  lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis vtt e-90414 were monitored to ascertain possible stimulatory/inhibitory effects by an in vitro turbidometric method. our experiments showed that lactobacillus gg colonized the shime reactor and this colonization could be maintained for several weeks without extra supplementation. oat bran feeding also favoured the growth of bifidobacteria and caused an increase in the production of acetic, propionic and butyric acid as well as ch4 and co2. however, the effects of oat bran, either on bacterial populations or on  their metabolic activity, were not directly dose-dependent. in turbidometric measurements, the supernatant of fermented oat bran exerted an inhibitory effect  of lactobacillus gg, but stimulated the growth of enterococci.

TI  == vancomycin resistance factor of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg in relation to enterococcal vancomycin resistance (van) genes.
AB  == lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (atcc 53103) is a probiotic strain used in fermented dairy products in many countries and is also used as a food supplement in the form of freeze-dried powder. the relationship of the vancomycin resistance factor in l. rhamnosus gg and the vancomycin resistance (van) genes of enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium were studied using polymerase chain reaction (pcr), southern hybridization and conjugation methods. our results show that the vancomycin resistance determinant in l. rhamnosus gg is not closely related to enterococcal van genes, since no pcr product was amplified in l. rhamnosus gg with any of the three sets of vana primers used, and enterococcal vana, vanb, vnh, vanx, vanz, vany, vans and vanr genes did not hybridize with dna of l. rhamnosus gg. this strain does not contain plasmids and transfer of chromosomal vancomycin resistance determinant from l. rhamnosus gg to enterococcal species was not detected. our results are in accordance with previous findings of intrinsically vancomycin-resistant lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == inhibition of initial adhesion of uropathogenic enterococcus faecalis by biosurfactants from lactobacillus isolates.
AB  == in this study, 15 lactobacillus isolates were found to produce biosurfactants in  the mid-exponential and stationary growth phases. the stationary-phase biosurfactants from lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus 36 and atcc 7469, lactobacillus fermentum b54, and lactobacillus acidophilus rc14 were investigated further to determine their capacity to inhibit the initial adhesion of uropathogenic enterococcus faecalis 1131 to glass in a parallel-plate flow chamber. the initial deposition rate of e. faecalis to glass with an adsorbed biosurfactant layer from l. acidophilus rc14 or l. fermentum b54 was significantly decreased by approximately 70%, while the number of adhering enterococci after 4 h of adhesion was reduced by an average of 77%. the surface activity of the biosurfactants and their activity inhibiting the initial adhesion of e. faecalis 1131 were retained after dialysis (molecular weight cutoff, 6,000  to 8,000) and freeze-drying. fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the freeze-dried biosurfactants from l.  acidophilus rc14 and l. fermentum b54 were richest in protein, while those from l. casei subsp. rhamnosus 36 and atcc 7469 had relatively high polysaccharide and phosphate contents.

AB  == lactobacillus gg, a recently characterized l. rhamnosus gg strain (atcc 53103), has been shown to exert inhibitory activity against a variety of bacterial species, including streptococci. we isolated and studied the effect of the inhibitory substance of lactobacillus gg on some oral streptococci. the inhibitory activity of the isolated substance was weak, but some growth inhibition was observed in streptococcus sobrinus pretreated with the substance in comparison with untreated controls. zones of growth inhibition on agar plates  were apparent only at ph values below 5, indicating that the inhibitory activity  was restricted to a low ph range. growth curve experiments showed a statistically significant inhibition between series with and without the isolated substance (p  < 0.05). the ultrastructure of s. sobrinus was not affected when treated with the inhibitory substance. the lactobacillus gg itself did not ferment sucrose. the results offer interesting perspectives for future research focusing on the protective function of normal flora and in the attempt to replace harmful bacterial species in oral microflora with less harmful ones.
