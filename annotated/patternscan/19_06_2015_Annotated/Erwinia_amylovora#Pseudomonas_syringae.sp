TI  == natural phenolic metabolites from endophytic aspergillus sp. ifb-yxs with antimicrobial activity.
AB  == prompted by the pressing necessity to conquer phytopathogenic infections, the antimicrobial compounds were characterized with bioassay-guided method from the ethanol extract derived from the solid-substrate fermentation of aspergillus sp.  ifb-yxs, an endophytic fungus residing in the apparently healthy leave of ginkgo  biloba l. the aim of this work was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and mechanism(s) of these bioactive compounds against phytopathogens. among the compounds, xanthoascin (1) is significantly inhibitory on the growth of the phytopathogenic bacterium clavibacter michiganense subsp. sepedonicus with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 0.31mug/ml, which is more potent  than streptomycin (mic 0.62mug/ml), an antimicrobial drug co-assayed herein as a  positive reference. moreover, terphenyl derivatives 3, 5 and 6 are also found to  be active against other phytopathogens including xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae swings, xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola swings, erwinia amylovora and pseudomonas syringae pv. lachrymans etc. the antibacterial mechanism of xanthoascin (1) was addressed to change the cellular permeability of the phytopathogens, leading to the remarkable leakage of nucleic acids out of the cytomembrane. the work highlights the possibility that xanthoascin (1), an analogue of xanthocillin which is used to be an approved antibiotic, may find its renewed application as a potent antibacterial agrichemical. this study contributes to the development of new antimicrobial drugs, especially against c.  michiganense subsp. sepedonicus.

TI  == infection processes of xylem-colonizing pathogenic bacteria: possible explanations for the scarcity of qualitative disease resistance genes against them in crops.
AB  == key message: disease resistance against xylem-colonizing pathogenic bacteria in crops. plant pathogenic bacteria cause destructive diseases in many commercially  important crops. among these bacteria, eight pathogens, ralstonia solanacearum, xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, x. campestris pv. campestris, erwinia amylovora, pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii, clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis, pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae, and xylella fastidiosa, infect their host plants through different infection sites and paths and eventually colonize the xylem tissues of their host plants, resulting in wilting  symptoms by blocking water flow or necrosis of xylem tissues. noticeably, only a  relatively small number of resistant cultivars in major crops against these vascular bacterial pathogens except x. oryzae pv. oryzae have been found or generated so far, although these pathogens threaten productivity of major crops.  in this review, we summarize the lifestyles of major xylem-colonizing bacterial pathogens and then discuss the progress of current research on disease resistance controlled by qualitative disease resistance genes or quantitative trait loci against them. finally, we propose infection processes of xylem-colonizing bacterial pathogens as one of possible reasons for why so few qualitative disease resistance genes against these pathogens have been developed or identified so far in crops.

TI  == hrpg and hrpv proteins from the type iii secretion system of erwinia amylovora form a stable heterodimer.
AB  == bacterial type iii secretion systems (t3sss) are specialized multicomponent nanomachines that mediate the transport of proteins either to extracellular locations or directly into eukaryotic host cell cytoplasm. erwinia amylovora, the main agent of rosaceous plants fireblight disease, employs an hrp/hrc1 t3ss to accomplish its pathogenesis. the regulatory network that controls the activation  of this t3ss is largely unknown in e. amylovora. however, in pseudomonas syringae pathovars, the hrpg/hrpv complex has been shown to directly regulate the activity of transcription factor hrps and consequently the upregulation of the hrp/hrc1 t3ss related genes. in this work, we report the successful recombinant production and purification of a stable e. amylovora hrpg/hrpv complex, using ppropet, a bicistronic expression vector. furthermore, we present the first solution structure of this complex based on small-angle x-ray scattering data.

TI  == diverse and bioactive endophytic aspergilli inhabit cupressaceae plant family.
AB  == aspergilli are filamentous, cosmopolitan and ubiquitous fungi which have significant impact on human, animal and plant welfare worldwide. due to their extraordinary metabolic diversity, aspergillus species are used in biotechnology  for the production of a vast array of biomolecules. however, little is known about aspergillus species that are able to adapt an endophytic lifestyle in cupressaceae plant family and are capable of producing cytotoxic, antifungal and  antibacterial metabolites. in this work, we report a possible ecological niche for pathogenic fungi such as aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillus flavus. indeed, our findings indicate that a. fumigatus, a. flavus, aspergillus niger var. niger and a. niger var. awamori adapt an endophytic lifestyle inside the cupressaceous plants including cupressus arizonica, cupressus sempervirens var. fastigiata, cupressus semipervirens var. cereiformis, and thuja orientalis. in addition, we found that extracts of endophytic aspergilli showed significant growth inhibition and cytotoxicity against the model fungus pyricularia oryzae and bacteria such as bacillus sp., erwinia amylovora and pseudomonas syringae. these endophytic aspergilli also showed in vitro antifungal effects on the cypress fungal phytopathogens including diplodia seriata, phaeobotryon cupressi and spencermartinsia viticola. in conclusion, our findings clearly support the endophytic association of aspergilli with cupressaceae plants and their possible  role in protection of host plants against biotic stresses. observed bioactivities of such endophytic aspergilli may represent a significant potential for bioindustry and biocontrol applications.

TI  == antiproliferative, antifungal, and antibacterial activities of endophytic alternaria species from cupressaceae.
AB  == recent research has shown the bioprospecting of endophytic fungi from cupressaceae. here, we further uncover that the healthy cypress plants such as cupressus arizonica, cupressus sempervirens var. cereiformis, and thuja orientalis host highly bioactive endophytic alternaria fungal species. indeed, endophytic alternaria alternata, alternaria pellucida, and alternaria tangelonis  were recovered from healthy cupressaceous trees. biodiversity and bioactivity of  recovered endophytic alternaria species were a matter of biogeography and host identity. we further extracted such alternaria's metabolites and highlighted their significant antiproliferative, growth inhibitory, and antibacterial activities against the model target fungus pyricularia oryzae and the model pathogenic bacteria bacillus sp., erwinia amylovora, and pseudomonas syringae. in vitro assays also indicated that endophytic alternaria species significantly inhibited the growth of cypress fungal phytopathogens diplodia seriata, phaeobotryon cupressi, and spencermartinsia viticola. in conclusion, since the recovered alternaria species were originally reported as pathogenic and allergenic fungi, our findings suggest a possible ecological niche for them inside the foliar tissues of cupressaceous trees. moreover, in this study, the significant bioactivities of endophytic alternaria species in association with cupressaceae plant family are reported.

TI  == scavenging iron: a novel mechanism of plant immunity activation by microbial siderophores.
AB  == siderophores are specific ferric iron chelators synthesized by virtually all microorganisms in response to iron deficiency. we have previously shown that they promote infection by the phytopathogenic enterobacteria dickeya dadantii and erwinia amylovora. siderophores also have the ability to activate plant immunity. we have used complete arabidopsis transcriptome microarrays to investigate the global transcriptional modifications in roots and leaves of arabidopsis (arabidopsis thaliana) plants after leaf treatment with the siderophore deferrioxamine (dfo). physiological relevance of these transcriptional modifications was validated experimentally. immunity and heavy-metal homeostasis  were the major processes affected by dfo. these two physiological responses could be activated by a synthetic iron chelator ethylenediamine-di(o-hydroxyphenylacetic) acid, indicating that siderophores eliciting activities rely on their strong iron-chelating capacity. dfo was able to protect arabidopsis against the pathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv tomato dc3000. siderophore treatment caused local modifications of iron distribution in leaf cells visible by ferrocyanide and diaminobenzidine-h(2)o(2)  staining. metal quantifications showed that dfo causes a transient iron and zinc  uptake at the root level, which is presumably mediated by the metal transporter iron regulated transporter1 (irt1). defense gene expression and callose deposition in response to dfo were compromised in an irt1 mutant. consistently, plant susceptibility to d. dadantii was increased in the irt1 mutant. our work shows that iron scavenging is a unique mechanism of immunity activation in plants. it highlights the strong relationship between heavy-metal homeostasis and immunity.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides against pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae and erwinia amylovora: chemical synthesis, secondary structure, efficacy, and mechanistic investigations.
AB  == we report on structurally modified dodecapeptide amides (kyklfkkilkfl-nh2 ) and two analogs of a hexapeptide amide (wrwycr-nh2 ) with antibacterial activity against the gram negative pathogens pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (psa) and erwinia amylovora (ea). dodecapeptide minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) ranged from 3.2 to 15.4 microm, with the unmodified peptide being the most potent against both pathogens. the unmodified dodecapeptide also had 32-58% alpha-helicity in membrane mimetic environments (50% v/v trifluoroethanol and 30  mm sds micelles). structural modifications which included branching, acylation, and conjugation with 5-nitro-2-furaldehyde (nfa) proved detrimental to both antimicrobial activity and alpha-helicity. scanning electron microscopy (sem) revealed distinct morphological changes to bacterial cells treated with the different peptides, leading to blistering of the membrane and cell lysis. mics of the hexapeptide amide were 3.9-7.7 microm against both pathogens. the hexapeptide acid did not show anti-bacterial activity against either pathogen. however, the nfa conjugated hexapeptide acid was more active than the parent peptide or nfa alone with mics of 1.6-3.2 microm against the pathogens. sem analysis revealed shriveling and collapse of bacterial cells treated with the hexapeptide, whereas  shortening and compactness on exposure to streptomycin. a colorimetric assay demonstrated that the dodecapeptides were likely to act by targeting the bacterial membrane, whereas the hexapeptides, streptomycin, and nfa were not, thereby supporting the morphological changes observed during sem. to the best of  our knowledge, this appears to be the first report of antimicrobial peptide activity against psa, a pathogen that is currently devastating the kiwifruit industry internationally.

TI  == harpins, multifunctional proteins secreted by gram-negative plant-pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == harpins are glycine-rich and heat-stable proteins that are secreted through type  iii secretion system in gram-negative plant-pathogenic bacteria. many studies show that these proteins are mostly targeted to the extracellular space of plant  tissues, unlike bacterial effector proteins that act inside the plant cells. over the two decades since the first harpin of pathogen origin, hrpn of erwinia amylovora, was reported in 1992 as a cell-free elicitor of hypersensitive response (hr), diverse functional aspects of harpins have been determined. some harpins were shown to have virulence activity, probably because of their involvement in the translocation of effector proteins into plant cytoplasm. based on this function, harpins are now considered to be translocators. their abilities of pore formation in the artificial membrane, binding to lipid components, and oligomerization are consistent with this idea. when harpins are applied to plants directly or expressed in plant cells, these proteins trigger diverse beneficial responses such as induction of defense responses against diverse pathogens and insects and enhancement of plant growth. therefore, in this review, we will summarize the functions of harpins as virulence factors (or translocators) of bacterial pathogens, elicitors of hr and immune responses, and plant growth enhancers.

TI  == the fire blight pathogen erwinia amylovora requires the rpon gene for pathogenicity in apple.
AB  == rpon is a sigma(54) factor regulating essential virulence gene expression in several plant pathogenic bacteria, including pseudomonas syringae and pectobacterium carotovorum. in this study, we found that mutation of rpon in the  fire blight pathogen erwinia amylovora caused a nonpathogenic phenotype. the e. amylovora rpon tn5 transposon mutant rpon1250::tn5 did not cause fire blight disease symptoms on shoots of mature apple trees. in detached immature apple fruits, the rpon1250::tn5 mutant failed to cause fire blight disease symptoms and grew to population levels 12 orders of magnitude lower than the wild-type. in addition, the rpon1250::tn5 mutant failed to elicit a hypersensitive response when infiltrated into nonhost tobacco plant leaves, and rpon1250::tn5 cells failed to express hrpn protein when grown in hrp (hypersensitive response and pathogenicity)-inducing liquid medium. a plasmid-borne copy of the wild-type rpon gene complemented all the rpon1250::tn5 mutant phenotypes tested. the rpon1250::tn5 mutant was prototrophic on minimal solid and liquid media, indicating that the rpon1250::tn5 nonpathogenic phenotype was not caused by a defect in basic metabolism or growth. this study provides clear genetic evidence  that rpon is an essential virulence gene of e. amylovora, suggesting that rpon has the same function in e. amylovora as in p. syringae and pe. carotovorum.

TI  == the bacterial effector dspa/e is toxic in arabidopsis thaliana and is required for multiplication and survival of fire blight pathogen.
AB  == the type iii effector dspa/e is an essential pathogenicity factor of the phytopathogenic bacterium erwinia amylovora. we showed that dspa/e was required for transient bacterial growth in nonhost arabidopsis thaliana leaves, as an e. amylovora dspa/e mutant was unable to grow. we expressed dspa/e in a. thaliana transgenic plants under the control of an oestradiol-inducible promoter, and found that dspa/e expressed in planta restored the growth of a dspa/e mutant. dspa/e expression in these transgenic plants led to the modulation by at least two-fold of the expression of 384 genes, mostly induced (324 genes). both induced and repressed genes contained high proportions of defence genes. dspa/e expression ultimately resulted in plant cell death without requiring a functional salicylic acid signalling pathway. analysis of a. thaliana transgenic seedlings expressing a green fluorescent protein (gfp):dspa/e fusion indicated that the fusion protein could only be detected in a few cells per seedling, suggesting the degradation or absence of accumulation of dspa/e in plant cells. consistently, we found that dspa/e repressed plant protein synthesis when injected by e. amylovora or when expressed in transgenic plants. thus, we conclude that dspa/e is toxic to a. thaliana: it promotes modifications, among which the repression of protein synthesis could be determinant in the facilitation of necrosis and bacterial growth.

TI  == gene-for-gene relationship in the host-pathogen system malus x robusta 5-erwinia  amylovora.
AB  == fire blight is a destructive bacterial disease caused by erwinia amylovora affecting plants in the family rosaceae, including apple. host resistance to fire blight is present mainly in accessions of malus spp. and is thought to be quantitative in this pathosystem. in this study we analyzed the importance of the e. amylovora effector avrrpt2(ea) , a homolog of pseudomonas syringae avrrpt2, for resistance of malus x robusta 5 (mr5). the deletion mutant e. amylovora ea1189deltaavrrpt2(ea) was able to overcome the fire blight resistance of mr5. one single nucleotide polymorphism (snp), resulting in an exchange of cysteine to serine in the encoded protein, was detected in avrrpt2(ea) of several erwinia strains differing in virulence to mr5. e. amylovora strains encoding serine (s-allele) were able to overcome resistance of mr5, whereas strains encoding cysteine (c-allele) were not. allele specificity was also observed in a coexpression assay with arabidopsis thaliana rin4 in nicotiana benthamiana. a homolog of rin4 has been detected and isolated in mr5. these results suggest a system similar to the interaction of rps2 from a. thaliana and avrrpt2 from p. syringae with rin4 as guard. our data are suggestive of a gene-for-gene relationship for the host-pathogen system mr5 and e. amylovora.

TI  == assessment of the relevance of the antibiotic 2-amino-3-(oxirane-2,3-dicarboxamido)-propanoyl-valine from pantoea agglomerans biological control strains against bacterial plant pathogens.
AB  == the epiphyte pantoea agglomerans 48b/90 (pa48b) is a promising biocontrol strain  against economically important bacterial pathogens such as erwinia amylovora. strain pa48b produces the broad-spectrum antibiotic 2-amino-3-(oxirane-2,3-dicarboxamido)-propanoyl-valine (apv) in a temperature-dependent manner. an apv-negative mutant still suppressed the e. amylovora population and fire blight disease symptoms in apple blossom experiments under greenhouse conditions, but was inferior to the pa48b wild-type  indicating the influence of apv in the antagonism. in plant experiments with the  soybean pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea both, pa48b and the apv-negative mutant, successfully suppressed the pathogen. our results demonstrate that the p. agglomerans strain pa48b is an efficient biocontrol organism against plant pathogens, and we prove its ability for fast colonization  of plant surfaces over a wide temperature range.

TI  == top 10 plant pathogenic bacteria in molecular plant pathology.
AB  == many plant bacteriologists, if not all, feel that their particular microbe should appear in any list of the most important bacterial plant pathogens. however, to our knowledge, no such list exists. the aim of this review was to survey all bacterial pathologists with an association with the journal molecular plant pathology and ask them to nominate the bacterial pathogens they would place in a  'top 10' based on scientific/economic importance. the survey generated 458 votes  from the international community, and allowed the construction of a top 10 bacterial plant pathogen list. the list includes, in rank order: (1) pseudomonas  syringae pathovars; (2) ralstonia solanacearum; (3) agrobacterium tumefaciens; (4) xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae; (5) xanthomonas campestris pathovars; (6) xanthomonas axonopodis pathovars; (7) erwinia amylovora; (8) xylella fastidiosa;  (9) dickeya (dadantii and solani); (10) pectobacterium carotovorum (and pectobacterium atrosepticum). bacteria garnering honourable mentions for just missing out on the top 10 include clavibacter michiganensis (michiganensis and sepedonicus), pseudomonas savastanoi and candidatus liberibacter asiaticus. this  review article presents a short section on each bacterium in the top 10 list and  its importance, with the intention of initiating discussion and debate amongst the plant bacteriology community, as well as laying down a benchmark. it will be  interesting to see, in future years, how perceptions change and which bacterial pathogens enter and leave the top 10.

TI  == genomic distribution and divergence of levansucrase-coding genes in pseudomonas syringae.
AB  == in the plant pathogenic bacterium, pseudomonas syringae, the exopolysaccharide levan is synthesized by extracellular levansucrase (lsc), which is encoded by two conserved 1,296-bp genes termed lscb and lscc in p. syringae strain pg4180. a third gene, lsca, is homologous to the 1,248-bp lsc gene of the bacterium erwinia amylovora, causing fire blight. however, lsca is not expressed in p. syringae strain pg4180. herein, pg4180 lsca was shown to be expressed from its native promoter in the lsc-deficient e. amylovora mutant, ea7/74-ls6, suggesting that lsca might be closely related to the e. amylovora lsc gene. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that lscb and lscc homologs in several p. syringae strains are  part of a highly conserved 1.8-kb region containing the orf, flanked by 450-452-bp and 49-51-bp up- and downstream sequences, respectively. interestingly, the 450-452-bp upstream sequence, along with the initial 48-bp orf sequence encoding for the n-terminal 16 amino acid residues of lsc, were found to be highly similar to the respective sequence of a putatively prophage-borne glycosyl hydrolase-encoding gene in several p. syringae genomes. minimal promoter regions of lscb and lscc were mapped in pg4180 by deletion analysis and were found to be located in similar positions upstream of lsc genes in three p. syringae genomes. thus, a putative 498-500-bp promoter element was identified, which possesses the prophage-associated com gene and dna encoding common n-terminal sequences of all 1,296-bp lsc and two glycosyl hydrolases. since the gene product of the non-expressed 1,248-bp lsca is lacking this conserved n-terminal region but is otherwise highly homologous to those of lscb and lscc, it was concluded that lsca might have been the ancestral lsc gene in e. amylovora and p. syringae. our data indicated that its highly expressed paralogs in p. syringae are probably derived from subsequent recombination events initiated by insertion of the 498-500-bp promoter element, described herein, containing a translational start site.

TI  == peptidotriazoles with antimicrobial activity against bacterial and fungal plant pathogens.
AB  == we designed and prepared peptidotriazoles based on the antimicrobial peptide bp100 (lyslysleuphelyslysileleulystyrleu-nh(2)) by introducing a triazole ring in the peptide backbone or onto the side chain of a selected residue. these compounds were screened for their in vitro growth inhibition of bacterial and fungal phytopathogens, and for their cytotoxic effects on eukaryotic cells and tobacco leaves. their proteolytic susceptibility was also analyzed. the antibacterial activity and the hemolysis were influenced by the amino acid that was modified with the triazole as well as by the absence of presence of a substituent in this heterocyclic ring. we identified sequences active against the bacteria xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vesicatoria, erwinia amylovora, pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (mic of 1.6-12.5 mum), and against the fungi fusarium oxysporum (mic<6.2-12.5 mum) with low hemolytic activity (0-23% at 50 mum), high  stability to protease digestion and no phytotoxicity. these peptidotriazoles constitute good candidates to design new antimicrobial agents.

TI  == the hrpn effector of erwinia amylovora, which is involved in type iii translocation, contributes directly or indirectly to callose elicitation on apple leaves.
AB  == erwinia amylovora is responsible for fire blight of apple and pear trees. its pathogenicity depends on a type iii secretion system (t3ss) mediating the translocation of effectors into the plant cell. the dspa/e effector suppresses callose deposition on apple leaves. we found that e. amylovora and pseudomonas syringae dc3000 tts mutants or peptide flg22 do not trigger callose deposition as strongly as the dspa/e mutant on apple leaves. this suggests that, on apple leaves, callose deposition is poorly elicited by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps) such as flg22 or other pamps harbored by tts mutants and is mainly elicited by injected effectors or by the t3ss itself. callose elicitation  partly depends on hrpw because an hrpw-dspa/e mutant elicits lower callose deposition than a dspa/e mutant. furthermore, an hrpn-dspa/e mutant does not trigger callose deposition, indicating that hrpn is required to trigger this plant defense reaction. we showed that hrpn plays a general role in the translocation process. thus, the hrpn requirement for callose deposition may be explained by its role in translocation: hrpn could be involved in the translocation of other effectors inducing callose deposition. furthermore, hrpn may also directly contribute to the elicitation process because we showed that purified hrpn induces callose deposition.

TI  == improvement of the efficacy of linear undecapeptides against plant-pathogenic bacteria by incorporation of d-amino acids.
AB  == a set of 31 undecapeptides, incorporating 1 to 11 d-amino acids and derived from  the antimicrobial peptide bp100 (kklfkkilkyl-nh(2)), was designed and synthesized. this set was evaluated for inhibition of growth of the plant-pathogenic bacteria erwinia amylovora, pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, and xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vesicatoria, hemolysis, and protease degradation.  two derivatives were as active as bp100, and 10 peptides displayed improved activity, with the all-d isomer being the most active. twenty-six peptides were less hemolytic than bp100, and all peptides were more stable against protease degradation. plant extracts inhibited the activity of bp100 as well as that of the d-isomers. ten derivatives incorporating one d-amino acid each were tested in an infectivity inhibition assay with the three plant-pathogenic bacteria by using detached pear and pepper leaves and pear fruits. all 10 peptides studied were active against e. amylovora, 6 displayed activity against p. syringae pv. syringae, and 2 displayed activity against x. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria. peptides bp143 (kklfkkilkyl-nh(2)) and bp145 (kklfkkilkyl-nh(2)), containing one  d-amino acid at positions 4 and 2 (underlined), respectively, were evaluated in whole-plant assays for the control of bacterial blight of pepper and pear and fire blight of pear. peptide bp143 was as effective as streptomycin in the three  pathosystems, was more effective than bp100 against bacterial blight of pepper and pear, and equally effective against fire blight of pear.

TI  == fibrillin4 is required for plastoglobule development and stress resistance in apple and arabidopsis.
AB  == the fibrillins are a large family of chloroplast proteins that have been linked with stress tolerance and disease resistance. fibrillin4 (fib4) is found associated with the photosystem ii light-harvesting complex, thylakoids, and plastoglobules, which are chloroplast compartments rich in lipophilic antioxidants. for this study, fib4 expression was knocked down in apple (malus 3  domestica) using rna interference. plastoglobule osmiophilicity was decreased in  fib4 knockdown (fib4 kd) tree chloroplasts compared with the wild type, while total plastoglobule number was unchanged. compared with the wild type, net photosynthetic co(2) fixation in fib4 kd trees was decreased at high light intensity but was increased at low light intensity. furthermore, fib4 kd trees produced more anthocyanins than the wild type when transferred from low to high light intensity, indicating greater sensitivity to high light stress. relative to the wild type, fib4 kd apples were more sensitive to methyl viologen and had higher superoxide levels during methyl viologen treatment. arabidopsis (arabidopsis thaliana) fib4 mutants and fib4 kd apples were more susceptible than their wild-type counterparts to the bacterial pathogens pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato and erwinia amylovora, respectively, and were more sensitive to ozone-induced tissue damage. following ozone stress, plastoglobule osmiophilicity decreased in wild-type apple and remained low in fib4 kd trees; total plastoglobule number increased in fib4 kd apples but not in the wild type. these  results indicate that fib4 is required for plastoglobule development and resistance to multiple stresses. this study suggests that fib4 is involved in regulating plastoglobule content and that defective regulation of plastoglobule content leads to broad stress sensitivity and altered photosynthetic activity.

AB  == methods, objective: we amplified the 1026 bp hrp (hypersensitive response and pathogenicity) gene from pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea isolate psg12 genomic  dna by pcr technique, and then constructed expression vector pgex-hrpz(psg12) with regular molecular cloning operation. the recombinant plasmid was transformed into bl21(de3). recombinant protein was induced by isopropylthio-beta-d-galacgoside (iptg). results: the molecular mass of the fusion protein is 61kda analyzed by sds-page. the protein, similar to the other known harpins, was heat-stable, which contained abundant glycine(g), but had no cysteine. furthermore, this protein was sensitive to protease k and able to trigger hypersensitive response (hr) in common tobacco. the hr elicitation by the protein in tobacco was inhibited by eukayotic metabolic inhibitors, nh4 vo3 and lacl3. the hrpz gene showed 79% identity to hrpz(psg) which cloned from p. syringae pv. glycinea (psg r0) in japan and 79 - 99% identity to other hrpz in genbank. however, it did not show any sequence identity with those of other genus of gram-negative plant pathogenic bacteria. conclusion: in summary, hrpz(psg12) was a novel gene that was cloned by us from p. syringae pv. glycinea, and this is the first report to express hrpz(psg12) gene in bl21.

AB  == the epiphyte pantoea agglomerans 48b/90, which has been isolated from soybean leaves, belongs to the enterobacteriaceae, as does the plant pathogen erwinia amylovora, which causes fire blight on rosaceous plants such as apples and leads  to severe economic losses. since p. agglomerans efficiently antagonizes phytopathogenic bacteria, the p. agglomerans strain c9-1 is used as a biocontrol  agent (blightban c9-1). here we describe the bioassay-guided isolation of a peptide antibiotic that is highly active against the plant pathogen e. amylovora  and pathovars of pseudomonas syringae, and we elucidate its structure. bioassay-guided fractionation using anion-exchange chromatography followed by hydrophobic interaction liquid chromatography yielded the bioactive, highly polar antibiotic. the compound was identified as 2-amino-3-(oxirane-2,3-dicarboxamido)-propanoyl-valine by using high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. this peptide was found to be produced by three of the nine p. agglomerans strains analyzed. notably, the biocontrol strain p. agglomerans c9-1  also produces 2-amino-3-(oxirane-2,3-dicarboxamido)-propanoyl-valine. previously, 2-amino-3-(oxirane-2,3-dicarboxamido)-propanoyl-valine has been characterized only from serratia plymuthica. 2-amino-3-(oxirane-2,3-dicarboxamido)-propanoyl-valine has been shown to inhibit  the growth of the human pathogen candida albicans efficiently, but its involvement in the defense of epiphytes against phytopathogenic bacteria has not  been investigated so far.

TI  == biophysical investigations on the aggregation and thermal unfolding of harpin(pss) and identification of leucine-zipper-like motifs in harpins.
AB  == harpins are heat-stable, glycine-rich proteins secreted by gram-negative bacteria, which induce hypersensitive response (hr) in non-host plants. in this study, the thermal unfolding and aggregation of harpin(pss) from pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae have been investigated by biophysical approaches. differential scanning calorimetric studies indicate that thermal unfolding of harpin(pss) is a complex process involving three distinct transitions. cd spectroscopy revealed that the secondary structure of the protein, which is predominantly alpha-helical, remains unchanged until the onset of transition 2, above which the alpha-helical content decreases while the beta-sheet content increases. dynamic light scattering measurements yielded the hydrodynamic radius  (r(h)) of harpin(pss) as room temperature as 20.54 + or - 6.19 nm, which decreases to 9.35 nm at 61 degrees c. these results could be explained in terms of the following thermal unfolding pathway for harpin(pss): oligomer-->dimer-->partially unfolded dimer-->unfolded monomer. sequence analysis indicated the presence of at least two leucine-zipper-like motifs in harpin(pss)  and several other harpins, whereas computational modelling studies suggest that most of them are located on helices present on protein surfaces, suggesting that  they can take part in the formation of oligomeric aggregates, which may be responsible for hr elicitation by harpins and their high thermal stability.

TI  == improve bioavailability of harpin protein on plant use plga based nanoparticle.
AB  == harpins can induce systemic acquired resistance (sar) pathway on scores of non-host plant, provide protection against a range of pathogens. in this study, we demonstrated that applied recombinant harpinz pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato  (rhrpz) on tobacco with three kinds of methods: infiltrating from micro-pore into leaf; injecting into petiole, and spraying on leaf, there is great difference in  assimilation of protein because of the poor osmosis of tobacco leaves, and with multi-application of rhrpz, the stimulation effect decreased. we prepared poly d,l-lactide-co-glycolide nanoparticles containing rhrpz (rhrpz plga nps). to study the drug effect, we analyzed the change ratio of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (pal) activity and pr-5db gene expression after administration of rhrpz and rhrpz plga nps on tobacco leaves. the results show that rhrpz could elicit a rapid and transient increase in both pal activity and pr-5db expression, but the  effect decreased after multi-application. while sprayed rhrpz plga nps on leaves, both the change ratio of pal activity and pr-5db expression were comparatively smooth and durable. our study suggested that rhrpz nps could help protein enter leaf epidermis and cell wall, release rhrpz in situ continuously, and enhance the bioavailability of rhrpz.

AB  == the xylem-limited, insect-transmitted bacterium xylella fastidiosa causes pierce's disease in grapes through cell aggregation and vascular clogging. gaca controls various physiological processes and pathogenicity factors in many gram-negative bacteria, including biofilm formation in pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000. cloned gaca of x. fastidiosa was found to restore the hypersensitive response and pathogenicity in gaca mutants of p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000 and erwinia amylovora. a gaca mutant of x. fastidiosa (dac1984) had significantly reduced abilities to adhere to a glass surface, form biofilm, and incite disease symptoms on grapevines, compared with the parent (a05). cdna microarray analysis identified 7 genes that were positively regulated by gaca, including xada and hsf, predicted to encode outer membrane adhesion proteins, and 20 negatively regulated genes, including gumc and an antibacterial polypeptide toxin gene, cvac. these results suggest that gaca of x. fastidiosa regulates many factors, which contribute to attachment and biofilm formation, as well as some physiological processes that may enhance the adaptation and tolerance of x. fastidiosa to environmental stresses and the competition within the host xylem.

TI  == wtse, an avre-family type iii effector protein of pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii, causes cell death in non-host plants.
AB  == pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii (pnss) causes stewart's bacterial wilt of sweet corn and leaf blight of maize. the pathogenicity of pnss depends on synthesis of extracellular polysaccharide and an hrp type iii secretion system. wtse, a type iii secreted effector protein, is essential for the virulence of pnss on corn. it belongs to the avre family of effectors, which includes dspa/e from erwinia amylovora and avre1 from pseudomonas syringae. previously, wtse was  shown to cause disease-associated cell death in its host plant, sweet corn. here, we examine the biological activity of wtse in several non-host plants. wtse induced cell death in nicotiana benthamiana, tobacco, beet and arabidopsis thaliana when it was transiently produced in plant cells following agroinfiltration or translocated into plant cells from pnss, escherichia coli or  pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola (pph). wtse-induced cell death in n. benthamiana, tobacco and beet resembled a hypersensitive response and in n. benthamiana it was delayed by cycloheximide. interestingly, wtse strongly promoted the growth of pnss in n. benthamiana prior to the onset of cell death. deletion derivatives of wtse that failed to induce cell death in n. benthamiana and tobacco also did not complement wtse mutants of pnss for virulence in sweet corn, indicating a correlation between the two activities. wtse also induced cell death in a. thaliana, where it suppressed basal defences induced by pph. thus, wtse has growth-promoting, defence-suppressing and cell death-inducing activities in non-host plants. expression of wtse also prevented the growth of yeast, possibly due to an innate toxicity to eukaryotic cells.

AB  == here we report on the effect of the bacterial elicitor harpin from pseudomonas syringae on arabidopsis thaliana with an emphasis on transcriptional profiling and on changes of the mitochondrial proteome. interestingly, of the currently about 400 identified mitochondrial proteins, transcriptional profiling by genome-wide dna-microarray analyses revealed a total of 192 genes that showed significant changes in transcript abundance in response to the bacterial elicitor. the most dramatic changes were observed for the mitochondrial protein import apparatus of which 70% of all genes were induced. proteomic analyses by 2d-page and maldi-tof mass spectrometry for peptide fingerprint analysis confirmed the corresponding changes within the mitochondrial proteome in 28 cases. strikingly, we found an accumulation of virtually all members of the tca cycle. in sum, our results point to an involvement of mitochondria in the response of plant cells to the harpin elicitor, which becomes apparent both at the transcriptomic as well as proteomic level.

TI  == identification of harpins in pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000, which are functionally similar to hrpk1 in promoting translocation of type iii secretion system effectors.
AB  == harpins are a subset of type iii secretion system (t3ss) substrates found in all  phytopathogenic bacteria that utilize a t3ss. pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000 was previously reported to produce two harpins, hrpz1 and hrpw1. dc3000 was shown here to deploy two additional proteins, hopak1 and hopp1, which have the harpin-like properties of lacking cysteine, eliciting the hypersensitive response (hr) when partially purified and infiltrated into tobacco leaves, and possessing a two-domain structure similar to that of the hrpw1 class of harpins.  unlike the single-domain harpin hrpz1, the two-domain harpins have c-terminal enzyme-like domains: pectate lyase for hopak1 and lytic transglycosylase for hopp1. genetic techniques to recycle antibiotic markers were applied to dc3000 to generate a quadruple harpin gene polymutant. the polymutant was moderately reduced in the elicitation of the hr and translocation of the t3ss effector avrpto1 fused to a cya translocation reporter, but the mutant was unaffected in the secretion of avrpto1-cya. the dc3000 hrpk1 gene encodes a putative translocator in the hrpf/nopx family and was deleted in combination with the four harpin genes. the hrpk1 quadruple harpin gene polymutant was strongly reduced in  hr elicitation, virulence, and translocation of avrpto1-cya into plant cells but  not in the secretion of representative t3ss substrates in culture. hrpk1, hrpz1,  hrpw1, and hopak1, but not hopp1, were independently capable of restoring some hr elicitation to the hrpk1 quadruple harpin gene polymutant, which suggests that a  consortium of semiredundant translocators from three protein classes cooperate to form the p. syringae t3ss translocon.

TI  == the map kinase kinase mkk2 affects disease resistance in arabidopsis.
AB  == the arabidopsis mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) kinase 2 (mkk2) was shown to mediate cold and salt stress responses through activation of the two map kinases mpk4 and mpk6. transcriptome analysis of plants expressing constitutively active mkk2 (mkk2-ee plants) showed altered expression of genes induced by abiotic stresses but also a significant number of genes involved in defense responses. both mpk4 and mpk6 became rapidly activated upon pseudomonas syringae  pv. tomato dc3000 infection and mkk2-ee plants showed enhanced levels of mpk4 activation. although mkk2-ee plants shared enhanced expression of genes encoding  enzymes of ethylene (et) and jasmonic acid (ja) synthesis, et, ja, and salicylic  acid (sa) levels did not differ dramatically from those of wild-type or mkk2-null plants under ambient growth conditions. upon p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000 infection, however, mkk2-ee plants showed reduced increases of ja and sa levels.  these results indicate that mkk2 is involved in regulating hormone levels in response to pathogens. mkk2-ee plants were more resistant to infection by p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000 and erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, but showed enhanced sensitivity to the fungal necrotroph alternaria brassicicola. our data indicate that mkk2 plays a role in abiotic stress tolerance and plant disease resistance.

TI  == dspa/e, a type iii effector of erwinia amylovora, is required for early rapid growth in nicotiana benthamiana and causes nbsgt1-dependent cell death.
AB  == summary dspa/e is a pathogenicity factor of erwinia amylovora that is translocated into the plant cell cytoplasm through an hrp type iii secretion system. transient expression of dspa/e in nicotiana benthamiana or yeast induced  cell death, as it does in n. tabacum and apple as described previously. dspa/e-induced cell death in n. benthamiana was not inhibited by coexpression of  avrptob of pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, which inhibits programmed cell death  (pcd) induced by several other elicitors in plants. silencing of nbsgt1, the expression of which is required for pcd mediated by several resistance proteins of plants, prevented dspa/e-induced cell death in n. benthamiana. however, silencing of nbrar1, or two map kinase kinase genes, which are required for pcd associated with many resistance genes in plants, did not prevent cell death induced by dspa/e. silencing of nbsgt1 also compromised non-host resistance against e. amylovora. e. amylovora grew rapidly within the first 24 h after infiltration in n. benthamiana, and dspa/e was required for this early rapid growth. however, bacterial cell numbers decreased after 24 h in trv-vector-transformed plants, whereas a dspa/e mutant strain grew to high populations in nbsgt1-silenced plants. our results indicate that dspa/e enhances  virulence of e. amylovora in n. benthamiana, but the bacteria are then recognized by the plant, resulting in pcd and death of bacterial cells or restriction of bacterial cell growth.

TI  == amyloidogenesis of type iii-dependent harpins from plant pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == harpins are heat-stable, glycine-rich type iii-secreted proteins produced by plant pathogenic bacteria, which cause a hypersensitive response (hr) when infiltrated into the intercellular space of tobacco leaves; however, the biochemical mechanisms by which harpins cause plant cell death remain unclear. in this study, we determined the biochemical characteristics of hpag, the first harpin identified from a xanthomonas species, under plant apoplast-like conditions using electron microscopy and circular dichroism spectroscopy. we found that his(6)-hpag formed biologically active spherical oligomers, protofibrils, and beta-sheet-rich fibrils, whereas the null hr mutant his(6)-hpag(l50p) did not. biochemical analysis and hr assay of various forms of  hpag demonstrated that the transition from an alpha-helix to beta-sheet-rich fibrils is important for the biological activity of protein. the fibrillar form of his(6)-hpag is an amyloid protein based on positive staining with congo red to produce green birefringence under polarized light, increased protease resistance, and beta-sheet fibril structure. other harpins, such as hrpn from erwinia amylovora and hrpz from pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, also formed curvilinear protofibrils or fibrils under plant apoplast-like conditions, suggesting that amyloidogenesis is a common feature of harpins. missense and deletion mutagenesis of hpag indicated that the rate of hpag fibril formation is  modulated by a motif present in the c terminus. the plant cytotoxicity of hpag is unique among the amyloid-forming proteins that occur in several microorganisms. structural and morphological analogies between hpag and disease-related amyloidogenic proteins, such as abeta protein, suggest possible common biochemical characteristics in the induction of plant and animal cell death.

AB  == autoinducers are important for cellular communication of bacteria. the luxs gene  has a central role in the synthesis of autoinducer-2 (ai-2). the gene was identified in a shotgun library of erwinia amylovora and primers designed for pcr amplification from bacterial dna. supernatants of several erwinia amylovora strains were assayed for ai-2 activity with a vibrio harveyi mutant and were positive. many other plant-associated bacteria also showed ai-2 activity such as  erwinia pyrifoliae and erwinia tasmaniensis. the luxs genes of several bacteria were cloned, sequenced, and complemented escherichia coli strain dh5alpha and a salmonella typhimurium mutant, both defective in luxs, for synthesis of ai-2. assays to detect ai-2 activity in culture supernatants of several pseudomonas syringae pathovars failed, which may indicate the absence of ai-2 or synthesis of another type. several reporter strains did not detect synthesis of an acyl homoserine lactone (ahl, ai-1) by erwinia amylovora, but confirmed ahl-synthesis  for erwinia carotovora ssp. atroseptica and pantoea stewartii.

TI  == the erwinia amylovora avrrpt2ea gene contributes to virulence on pear and avrrpt2ea is recognized by arabidopsis rps2 when expressed in pseudomonas syringae.
AB  == the enterobacterium erwinia amylovora is a devastating plant pathogen causing necrotrophic fire blight disease of apple, pear, and other rosaceous plants. in an attempt to identify genes induced during infection of host plants, we identified and cloned a putative effector gene, avrrpt2ea. the deduced amino-acid sequence of the translated avrrpt2ea protein is homologous to the effector protein avrrpt2 previously reported in pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. these two proteins share 58% identity (70% similarity) in the functional domain; however, the secretion and translocation signal domain varied. the avrrpt2ea promoter region contains a typical 'hrp box,' which suggests that avrrpt2ea is regulated by the alternative sigma factor, hrpl. avrrpt2ea was detected in all e. amylovora strains tested but not in other closely related erwinia species. an avrrpt2ea deletion mutant was reduced in its ability to cause systemic infection on immature pear fruits as compared with the wild-type strain, indicating that avrrpt2ea acts as a virulence factor on its native host. growth of p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000 expressing avrrpt2ea was 10-fold higher than that of p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000 in an arabidopsis rps2 mutant, indicating that avrrpt2ea promotes virulence of p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000 on arabidopsis similar to p. syringae pv. tomato avrrpt2. when avrrpt2ea was expressed in p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000 in its native form, a weak hypersensitive response (hr) was induced in arabidopsis; however, a hybrid protein containing the p. syringae pv. tomato avrrpt2 signal sequence, when expressed from the p syringae pv. tomato avrrpt2 promoter, caused a strong hr. thus, the signal sequence and promoter of avrrpt2ea may affect its expression, secretion, or translocation, singly or in combination, in p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000. these results indicated that avrrpt2ea is genetically recognized by the rps2 disease resistance gene in arabidopsis when expressed in p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000. the results  also suggested that although distinct pathogens such as e. amylovora and p. syringae may contain similar effector genes, expression and secretion of these effectors can be under specific regulation by the native pathogen.

AB  == the enterobacterium erwinia amylovora is a devastating plant pathogen causing necrotrophic fire blight disease of apple, pear, and other rosaceous plants. in this study, we used a modified in vivo expression technology system to identify e. amylovora genes that are activated during infection of immature pear tissue, a process that requires the major pathogenicity factors of this organism. we identified 394 unique pear fruit-induced (pfi) genes on the basis of sequence similarity to known genes and separated them into nine putative function groups including host-microbe interactions (3.8%), stress response (5.3%), regulation (11.9%), cell surface (8.9%), transport (13.5%), mobile elements (1.0%), metabolism (20.3%), nutrient acquisition and synthesis (15.5%), and unknown or hypothetical proteins (19.8%). known virulence genes, including hrp/hrc components of the type iii secretion system, the major effector gene dspe, type ii secretion, levansucrase (lsc), and regulators of levansucrase and amylovoran biosynthesis, were upregulated during pear tissue infection. known virulence factors previously identified in e. (pectobacterium) carotovora and pseudomonas syringae were identified for the first time in e. amylovora and included heca hemagglutinin family adhesion, peh polygalacturonase, new effector hopptoc(ea), and membrane-bound lytic murein transglycosylase mlte(ea). an insertional mutation within hopptoc(ea) did not result in reduced virulence; however, an mlte(ea) knockout mutant was reduced in virulence and growth in immature pears. this study suggests that e. amylovora utilizes a variety of strategies during plant infection and to overcome the stressful and poor nutritional environment of its plant hosts.

AB  == reporter gene-based transcriptional fusions are increasingly being used to address questions in microbial ecology, with constitutively expressed fusions enabling microbe tracking and inducible fusions reporting the presence of environmental signals. to more readily apply this technology to a variety of bacterial species, we examined species specificity in the expression of three promoters of interest. a comparison of two potentially constitutive promoters, each fused to the reporter gene gfp, showed that the nptii promoter (p(nptii)) was expressed in a broader range of species (100% of 11 tested) than the lacz promoter (p(lacz)) (75% of 11 tested), and thus has broader applicability for marking bacteria than p(lacz). for the species that expressed p(lacz), however,p(lacz) was expressed 3-fold more than p(nptii), on average. the escherichia coli prou promoter, which is induced by low water potential in e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, pantoea agglomerans, and pseudomonas syringae, was  shown to be similarly responsive to water potential in strains of clavibacter michiganensis, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, and sinorhizobium meliloti, as well as mildly osmoresponsive in agrobacterium tumefaciens, supporting its broad use as a reporter of water potential. surprisingly, this promoter was not regulated by water potential in strains of staphylococcus aureus and erwinia amylovora, illustrating heretofore unrecognized species specificity in prou inducibility, as well as potential limitations in the species that can serve as bioreporters of water potential.

AB  == harpin from pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola (hrpz) elicits a rapid cell death response in tobacco plants. multiple signaling components, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk), reactive oxygen species (ros) and salicylic acid (sa), have been reported to be involved in this cell death process, but the interaction between these molecules is poorly understood. here we show through utilizing plants manipulated in sipk expression levels that lack  of sipk results in increased sensitivity to harpin with concomitant accumulation  of higher levels of ros. conversely, sipk-overexpressing plants show reduced sensitivity to harpin relative to wild-type plants, and display reduced ros accumulation. harpin-induced cell death was found to be conditional on the ability of the plant to accumulate sa, whereas harpin induction of mapk activation and ros accumulation are not. however, harpin-induced ros accumulation is required for activation of sipk and wound-induced protein kinase. transcriptional profiling revealed that suppression of sipk signaling also affects early expression of a range of pathogen- and stress-responsive genes during harpin challenge.

TI  == the hrp pathogenicity island of erwinia amylovora and identification of three novel genes required for systemic infectiondouble dagger.
AB  == summary sequence analysis of the region bordering the hrp/dsp gene cluster of erwinia amylovora strain ea321, which causes fire blight, revealed characteristics of pathogenicity islands (pais). included are genes for a phage integrase, a trna(phe), several orthologues of genes of yapi, a pai of yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and several putative virulence genes with hrpl-dependent promoter motifs. the island is designated the hrp pai of e. amylovora. it is comprised of a chromosomal region of c. 62 kb with 60 open reading frames (orfs). comparison of the hrp pai of e. amylovora with those of four closely related bacteria showed that orfb, a homologue of avrbst of xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, and orfa, its putative chaperone gene, are present only in the hrp pai of e. amylovora. as regions flanking the hrp/dsp gene cluster are quite diverse, addition and deletion may have occurred during divergent evolution of the five bacteria. among orfs of the pai of ea321, three new hrpl-dependent genes were identified. because they are required for full virulence in apple, they were designated hsvc, hsvb and hsva (hrp-associated systemic virulence). they encode a homologue of an amidinotransferase for phaseolotoxin biosynthesis and homologues  of a nikkomycin-biosynthetic protein of pseudomonas syringae.

TI  == the abi2-dependent abscisic acid signalling controls hrpn-induced drought tolerance in arabidopsis.
AB  == hrpn, a protein produced by the plant pathogenic bacterium erwinia amylovora, has been shown to stimulate plant growth and resistance to pathogens and insects. here we report that hrpn activates abscisic acid (aba) signalling to induce drought tolerance (dt) in arabidopsis thaliana l. plants grown with water stress. spraying wild-type plants with hrpn-promoted stomatal closure decreased leaf transpiration rate, increased moisture and proline levels in leaves, and alleviated extents of damage to cell membranes and plant drought symptoms caused  by water deficiency. in plants treated with hrpn, aba levels increased; expression of several aba-signalling regulatory genes and the important effector  gene rd29b was induced or enhanced. induced expression of rd29b, promotion of stomatal closure, and reduction in drought severity were observed in the abi1-1 mutant, which has a defect in the phosphatase abi1, after hrpn was applied. in contrast, hrpn failed to induce these responses in the abi2-1 mutant, which is impaired in the phosphatase abi2. inhibiting wild-type plants to synthesize aba eliminated the role of hrpn in promoting stomatal closure and reducing drought severity. moreover, resistance to pseudomonas syringae developed in abi2-1 as in  wild-type plants following treatment with hrpn. thus, an abi2-dependent aba signalling pathway is responsible for the induction of dt but does not affect pathogen defence under the circumstances of this study.

TI  == a family of conserved bacterial effectors inhibits salicylic acid-mediated basal  immunity and promotes disease necrosis in plants.
AB  == salicylic acid (sa)-mediated host immunity plays a central role in combating microbial pathogens in plants. inactivation of sa-mediated immunity, therefore, would be a critical step in the evolution of a successful plant pathogen. it is known that mutations in conserved effector loci (cel) in the plant pathogens pseudomonas syringae (the delta cel mutation), erwinia amylovora (the dspa/e mutation), and pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii (the wtse mutation) exert particularly strong negative effects on bacterial virulence in their host plants  by unknown mechanisms. we found that the loss of virulence in delta cel and dspa/e mutants was linked to their inability to suppress cell wall-based defenses and to cause normal disease necrosis in arabidopsis and apple host plants. the delta cel mutant activated sa-dependent callose deposition in wild-type arabidopsis but failed to elicit high levels of callose-associated defense in arabidopsis plants blocked in sa accumulation or synthesis. this mutant also multiplied more aggressively in sa-deficient plants than in wild-type plants. the hopptom and avre genes in the cel of p. syringae were found to encode suppressors of this sa-dependent basal defense. the widespread conservation of the hopptom and avre families of effectors in various bacteria suggests that suppression of sa-dependent basal immunity and promotion of host cell death are important virulence strategies for bacterial infection of plants.

TI  == the erwinia chrysanthemi ec16 hrp/hrc gene cluster encodes an active hrp type iii secretion system that is flanked by virulence genes functionally unrelated to the hrp system.
AB  == erwinia chrysanthemi is a host-promiscuous plant pathogen that possesses a type iii secretion system (ttss) similar to that of the host-specific pathogens e. amylovora and pseudomonas syringae. the regions flanking the ttss-encoding hrp/hrc gene clusters in the latter pathogens encode various ttss-secreted proteins. dna sequencing of the complete e. chrysanthemi hrp/hrc gene cluster and approximately 12 kb of the flanking regions (beyond the previously characterized  heca adhesin gene in the left flank) revealed that the e. chrysanthemi ttss genes were syntenic and similar (>50% amino-acid identity) with their e. amylovora orthologs. however, the hrp/hrc cluster was interrupted by a cluster of four genes, only one of which, a homolog of lytic transglycosylases, is implicated in  ttss functions. furthermore, the regions flanking the hrp/hrc cluster lacked genes that were likely to encode ttss substrates. instead, some of the genes in these regions predict abc transporters and methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins that could have alternative roles in virulence. mutations affecting all of the genes in the regions flanking or interrupting the hrp/hrc cluster were constructed in e. chrysanthemi cucpb5047, a mutant whose reduced pectolytic capacity can enhance the phenotype of minor virulence factors. mutants were screened in witloof chicory leaves and then in potato tubers and nicotiana clevelandii seedlings. mu dii1734 insertion in one gene, designated vira, resulted in strongly reduced virulence in all three tests. vira is immediately downstream of heca, has an unusually low g+c content of 38%, and predicts an unknown protein of 111 amino acids. the e. chrysanthemi ttss was shown to be active by its ability to translocate avrpto-cya (a p. syringae ttss effector fused to an adenylate cyclase reporter that is active in the presence of eukaryote calmodulin) into n. benthamiana leaf cells. however, vira(1-61)-cya was not translocated into plant cells, and vira expression was not affected by mutations in e. chrysanthemi hrp regulator genes hrpl and hrps. thus, the 44-kb region of the e. chrysanthemi ec16 genome that is centered on the hrplhrc cluster encodes a potpourri of virulence factors, but none of these appear to be a ttss effector.

TI  == molecular differentiation of erwinia amylovora strains from north america and of  two asian pear pathogens by analyses of pfge patterns and hrpn genes.
AB  == in order to determine a possible genomic divergence of erwinia amylovora'fruit tree' and raspberry strains from north america, several isolates were differentiated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) analysis, the size of short dna sequence repeats (ssrs) and the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of their hrpn genes. by pfge analysis european strains are highly related, whereas strains from north america were diverse and were further distinguished by the ssr numbers from plasmid pea29. the e. amylovora strains from europe showed identical hrpn sequences in contrast to the american isolates  from fruit trees and raspberry. those were related to each other, but distinguishable by their hrpn patterns. the asian pear pathogens differed in hrpn among each other and from e. amylovora. erwinia pyrifoliae isolates and the erwinia strains from japan were ordered via their hrpn sequences in agreement with the pfge patterns. for all three pathogens, dendrograms from pfge and sequence data indicate an evolutionary diversity within the species in spite of a genetic conservation for parts of the hrpn genes suggesting a long persistence of the asian pear pathogens in korea and japan as well as of fire blight in north america. some of the divergent american e. amylovora isolates share pfge patterns with the relatively uniform european strains.

TI  == the deltaflid mutant of pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci, which secretes flagellin monomers, induces a strong hypersensitive reaction (hr) in non-host tomato cells.
AB  == to investigate the role of flagella and monomer flagellin in the interaction between pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci and plants, non-polar flic and flid mutants were produced. the orfs for flic and flid are deleted in the deltaflic and deltaflid mutants, respectively. both mutants lost all flagella and were non-motile. the deltaflic mutant did not produce flagellin, whereas the deltaflid mutant, which lacks the hap2 protein, secreted large amounts of monomer flagellin into the culture medium. inoculation of non-host tomato leaves with wild-type p.  syringae pv. tabaci or the deltaflid mutant induced a hypersensitive reaction (hr), whereas the deltaflic mutant propagated and caused characteristic symptom-like changes. in tomato cells in suspension culture, wild-type p. syringae pv. tabaci induced slight, visible hr-like changes. the deltaflic mutant did not induce hr, but the deltaflid mutant induced a remarkably strong hr. expression of the hsr203j gene was rapidly and strongly induced by inoculation with the deltaflid mutant, compared to inoculation with wild-type p. syringae pv. tabaci. furthermore, introduction of the flic gene into the deltaflic mutant restored motility and hr-inducing ability in tomato. these results, together with our previous study, suggest that the flagellin monomer of pv. tabaci acts as a strong elicitor to induce hr-associated cell death in non-host tomato cells.

TI  == bacteriocin serratine-p as a biological tool in the control of fire blight erwinia amylovora.
AB  == fire blight, caused by the bacterium erwinia amylovora (burill winslow et al.), is the most important bacterial disease in european pear growing. it can cause a  lot of damage in some countries on apple and on pear trees in orchards and also in the fruit tree nurseries. in belgium, the disease is present since 1972. control of fire blight in belgian fruit orchards is made on a broad basis of measurements in and around the fruit trees. the use of an antibiotic is allowed for application only during the primary blossom period under strict controlled regulations. the use of antobiotics in agriculture is strongly discussed on the european level today and will probably disappear in the near future. therefore, the research on fire blight control concentrates on the possibilities of biological control with antagonistic bacteria such as pantoea agglomerans (erwinia herbicola), bacillus subtilis or pseudomonas syringae strain a 506. the  use of serratine-p, a phage tail-like bacteriocin, produced by serratia plymiticum, shows an interesting antibacterial activity against erwinia amylovora. its mode of action consists in the perforation of the cytoplasmic membrane of the target cell, inducing perturbations in cellular exchanges and a final lysis of the bacterial cell. in this paper some trials are discussed on the use of serratine-p at different doses and on different infection types on pear trees. the results indicate interesting protection possibilities on blossom- and  fruit infections.

TI  == the regulatory cascade that activates the hrp regulon in erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae.
AB  == the pathogenicity of erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae (ehg) is dependent on a plasmid (ppath(ehg)) that harbors the hrp gene cluster and additional virulence genes. the hrp regulatory cascade of ehg comprises an hrpxy operon encoding a two-component system; hrps encoding a transcriptional factor of the ntrc family and hrpl encoding an alternative sigma factor. results obtained suggest the following signal transduction model for activating the hrp regulon: phosphorylated hrpy activates hrps, hrps activates hrpl, and hrpl activates genes containing "hrp box" promoter. this model was supported by studies on the effects of mutations in the regulatory genes on pathogenicity and complementation analysis. nonpolar mutations in hrpx did not affect virulence or transcription of downstream genes. site-directed mutagenesis of the conserved aspartate 57 in hrpy suggested that its phosphorylation is crucial for activating the hrp regulatory cascade. studies on the effects of mutations in the hrp regulatory genes on transcriptional activity of downstream genes or of their isolated promoters in planta showed dependency of hrps expression on active hrpy, of hrpl expression on active hrps, and of hrpn or hrpj expression on active hrpl. these results were also partially supported by overexpression of regulatory genes under in vitro conditions. the hrpxy is constitutively expressed with high basal levels under repressive conditions, in contrast to hrps and hrpl, which exhibit low basal expression levels and are environmentally regulated.

TI  == the hrpx/hrpy two-component system activates hrps expression, the first step in the regulatory cascade controlling the hrp regulon in pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii.
AB  == a regulatory cascade activating hrp/hrc type iii secretion and effector genes was delineated in pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii, a bacterial pathogen of corn. four hrp regulatory genes were characterized: hrpx and hrpy encode the sensor kinase and response regulator, respectively, of a two-component signal transduction system; hrps encodes an ntrc-like transcriptional enhancer; and hrpl encodes an alternative sigma factor. epistasis analysis, expression studies using gene fusions, and genetic reconstruction of each step in escherichia coli were used to delineate the following pathway: hrpy activates hrps and also positively  autoregulates the hrpxy operon. in turn, hrps is required for full activation of  the sigma54-dependent hrpl promoter. finally, hrpl controls expression of all known hrp and wts genes. in vitro, hrps and all downstream hrp genes were regulated by ph and salt concentration. mutants with in-frame deletions in hrpx were still partially virulent on corn but were unable to sense the chemical or metabolic signals that induce hrp genes in vitro. site-directed mutagenesis of hrpy indicated that aspartate 57 is the probable phosphorylation site and that it is needed for activity. these findings suggest that both hrpx and an alternate mechanism are involved in the activation of hrpy in planta.

TI  == erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora and erwinia-derived elicitors hrpn and peha  trigger distinct but interacting defense responses and cell death in arabidopsis.
AB  == we have used an hrp-positive strain of the soft rot pathogen erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora to elucidate plant responses to this bacterial necrotroph. purified virulence determinants, harpin (hrpn) and polygalacturonase (peha), were used as tools to facilitate this analysis. we show that hrpn elicits lesion formation in arabidopsis and tobacco and triggers systemic resistance in arabidopsis. establishment of resistance is accompanied by the expression of salicylic acid (sa)-dependent, but also jasmonate/ethylene (ja/et)-dependent, marker genes pr1 and pdf1.2, respectively, suggesting that both sa-dependent and  ja/et-dependent defense pathways are activated. use of pathway-specific mutants and transgenic nahg plants show that both pathways are required for the induction of resistance. arabidopsis plants treated simultaneously with both elictors peha, known to trigger only ja/et-dependent defense signaling, and hrpn react with accelerated and enhanced induction of the marker genes pr1 and pdf1.2 both locally and systemically. this mutual amplification of defense gene expression involves both sa-dependent and ja/et-dependent defense signaling. the two elicitors produced by e. carotovora subsp. carotovora also cooperate in triggering increased production of superoxide and lesion formation.

TI  == modulation of defense responses of malus spp. during compatible and incompatible  interactions with erwinia amylovora.
AB  == erwinia amylovora is the causal agent of fire blight, a disease affecting members of subfamily maloideae. in order to analyze mechanisms leading to compatible or incompatible interactions, early plant molecular events were investigated in two  genotypes of malus with contrasting susceptibility to fire blight, after confrontation with either e. amylovora or the incompatible tobacco pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci. many defense mechanisms, including generation of an oxidative burst and accumulation of pathogenesis-related proteins, were elicited in both resistant and susceptible genotypes by the two pathogens at similar rates and according to an equivalent time course. this elicitation was linked with the functional hypersensitive reaction and pathogenicity (hrp) cluster of e. amylovora, because an hrp secretion mutant did not induce such responses. however, a delayed induction of several genes of various branch pathways of the phenylpropanoid metabolism was recorded in tissues of the susceptible genotype challenged with the wild-type strain of e. amylovora, whereas these genes were quickly induced in every other plant-bacteria interaction, including interactions with the hrp secretion mutant. this suggests  the existence of hrp-independent elicitors of defense in the fire blight pathogen as well as hrp-dependant mechanisms of suppression of these nonspecific inductions.

TI  == a gene in the pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato hrp pathogenicity island conserved  effector locus, hopptoa1, contributes to efficient formation of bacterial colonies in planta and is duplicated elsewhere in the genome.
AB  == the ability of pseudomonas syringae to grow in planta is thought to be dependent  upon the hrp (type iii secretion) system and multiple effector proteins that this system injects into plant cells. orf5 in the conserved effector locus of the p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000 hrp pathogenicity island was shown to encode a hrp-secreted protein and to have a similarly secreted homolog encoded in an effector-rich pathogenicity island located elsewhere in the genome. these putative effector genes were designated hopptoa1 and hopptoa2, respectively. dna  gel blot analysis revealed that sequences hybridizing with hopptoa1 were widespread among p. syringae pathovars, and some strains, like dc3000, appear to  have two copies of the gene. uida transcriptional fusions revealed that expression of hopptoa1 and hopptoa2 can be activated by the hrpl alternative sigma factor. hopptoa1 and hopptoa1/hopptoa2 double mutants were not obviously different from wild-type p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000 in their ability to produce symptoms or to increase their total population size in host tomato and arabidopsis leaves. however, confocal laser-scanning microscopy of gfp (green fluorescent protein)-labeled bacteria in arabidopsis leaves 2 days after inoculation revealed that the frequency of undeveloped individual colonies was higher in the hopptoa1 mutant and even higher in the hopptoa1/hopptoa2 double mutant. these results suggest that hopptoa1 and hopptoa2 contribute redundantly to the formation of p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000 colonies in arabidopsis leaves.

AB  == we have identified a new plant gene, atcox17, encoding a protein that shares sequence similarity to cox17, a cu-binding protein from yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae) and vertebrates that mediates the delivery of cu to the mitochondria  for the assembly of a functional cytochrome oxidase complex. the newly characterized arabidopsis protein has six cys residues at positions corresponding to those known to coordinate cu binding in the yeast homolog. moreover, we show that the arabidopsis cox17 cdna complements a cox17 mutant of yeast restoring the respiratory deficiency associated with that mutation. these two lines of evidence indicate that the plant protein identified here is a functional equivalent of yeast cox17 and might serve as a cu delivery protein for the plant mitochondria.  cox17 was identified by investigating the hypersensitive response-like necrotic response provoked in tobacco (nicotiana tabacum) leaves after harpin inoculation. atcox17 expression was activated by high concentrations of cu, bacterial inoculation, salicylic acid treatment, and treatments that generated no and hydrogen peroxide. all of the conditions inducing cox17 are known to inhibit mitochondrial respiration and to produce an increase of reactive oxygen species,  suggesting that gene induction occurs in response to stress situations that interfere with mitochondrial function.

AB  == we developed improved virulence assays for erwinia chrysanthemi 3937 on african violet varieties and devised a new method for the construction of precise bacterial gene knockouts. these methods were tested by constructing mutations in  genes suspected to be involved with plant interactions. the virulence of the hrpg and hrcc mutant strains (both gene products presumed to be involved in protein secretion) was greatly reduced on leaves of semitolerant african violet varieties. an hrpn mutant strain produced delayed symptoms on african violet leaves and an hrpn delta pel (delta pel = five major pectate lyase genes deleted) double mutant was nonpathogenic. the hrcc and hrpg mutants did not produce a rapid hypersensitive response (hr) in tobacco, unlike the wild-type bacterium, and the hrpn mutant gave a reduced hr. the results, therefore, establish the importance of hrp genes in the virulence of e. chrysanthemi and their ability to  elicit hr on nonhosts. the data also suggest that other effector proteins secreted by the hrp system are required for full virulence and hr elicitation.

TI  == activation of the oxidative burst in aequorin-transformed nicotiana tabacum cells is mediated by protein kinase- and anion channel-dependent release of ca2+ from internal stores.
AB  == the source of ca2+ involved in transducing an oxidative-burst defense signal was  examined in aequorin-transformed tobacco (nicotiana tabacum l.) cells using modulators of ca2+ entry. treatments that either increased or decreased the influx of ca2+ from external stores were found to have little effect on the magnitude or kinetics of an osmotically stimulated oxidative burst. in contrast,  treatments that reduced the discharge of ca2+ from internal stores inhibited dilution-activated h2o2 production. curiously, most of the modulators commonly employed in animal studies as internal ca(2+)-release inhibitors were neither effective in blocking discharge of intracellular ca2+ nor in preventing the oxidative burst. when three different biochemical elicitors of the oxidative burst were similarly examined, both the h2o2 production and ca2+ fluxes stimulated were found to be sensitive to modulators of internal ca2+ release, but neither was impacted by alterations in externally derived ca2+ influx. we hypothesize, therefore, that the oxidative burst does not depend on the influx of external ca2+, but instead may generally be mediated by the release of internal ca2+ in a manner that depends on the proper function of kinases and anion channels. these ca2+ pulses trigger downstream signaling events that include the  activation of ca(2+)-regulated protein kinases, which are required for stimulation of the oxidative burst.

TI  == measurement of stress-induced ca(2+) pulses in single aequorin-transformed tobacco cells.
AB  == signaling patterns measured in large cell populations are the sum of differing signals from separate cells, and thus, the detailed kinetics of ca(2+) pulses can often be masked. in an effort to evaluate whether the cytosolic ca(2+) pulses previously reported in populations of elicitor- and stress-stimulated tobacco cells accurately represent the pulses that occur in individual cells, a study of  single cell ca(2+) fluxes in stress-stimulated tobacco cells was undertaken. individual aequorin-transformed cells were isolated from a tobacco suspension culture and placed directly on a sensitive photo-multiplier tube mounted in a dark chamber. ca(2+)-dependent luminescence was then monitored after stimulation  with hypo- or hyper-osmotic shock, cold shock, or defense elicitors (oligogalacturonic acid and harpin). hypo-osmotic shock induced a biphasic ca(2+) transient in 67% of the single cells tested that exhibited similar kinetics to the biphasic pulses measured repeatedly in 1ml cell suspensions. in contrast, 33% of the stimulated cells displayed ca(2+) flux patterns that were not previously seen in cell suspension studies. additionally, because only 29% of the cells tested responded with measurable ca(2+) pulses to oligogalacturonic acid and 33%  to the harpin protein, we conclude that not all cells in a suspension are simultaneously sensitive to stimulation with defense elicitors. in contrast, all  cells tested responded with an immediate ca(2+) influx after cold or hyperosmotic shock. we conclude that in many cases the ca(2+) signaling patterns of single cells are accurately represented in the signaling patterns of large populations,  but that single cell measurements are still required to characterize the ca(2+) fluxes of the less prominent cell populations.

AB  == mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapks) are key enzymes that mediate adaptive responses to various abiotic and biotic stresses, including pathogen challenge. the proteinaceous bacterial elicitor harpin (secreted by pseudomonas syringae pv  syringae) activates two mapks in suspension cultures of arabidopsis var. landsberg erecta. in this study, we show that harpin and exogenous hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) activate myelin basic protein kinases in arabidopsis leaves.  using anti-atmpk4 and anti-atmpk6 antibodies, we identify the harpin-activated mapks in both leaves and suspension cultures as atmpk4 and atmpk6, and show that  h(2)o(2), generated by arabidopsis cells in response to challenge with harpin, activates only atmpk6. however, treatments with catalase, which removes h(2)o(2), or diphenylene iodonium, which inhibits superoxide and h(2)o(2) production, do not inhibit harpin-induced activation of atmpk4 or atmpk6. in addition, activation of atmpk4 but not atmpk6 is inhibited by the mapk kinase inhibitor pd98059. neither harpin nor h(2)o(2) has any effect on atmpk4 or atmpk6 gene expression. in addition, the expression of atmekk1, atmek1, or atmkk2, previously shown to be potential functional partners of atmpk4, were not affected by either  harpin or h(2)o(2) treatments. these data suggest that harpin activates several signaling pathways, one leading to stimulation of the oxidative burst and others  leading to the activation of atmpk4 or atmpk6.

TI  == visualization of secreted hrp and avr proteins along the hrp pilus during type iii secretion in erwinia amylovora and pseudomonas syringae.
AB  == pili are required for protein and/or dna transfer from bacteria to recipient plant or bacterial cells, based on genetic evidence. however, it has never been shown directly that the effector proteins or dna are localized along or inside the pili in situ. failure to visualize an association of effector proteins/dna with pili is the central issue in the debate regarding the exact function of pili in protein and dna transfer. in this study, a newly developed in situ immunogold  labelling procedure enabled visualization of the specific localization of type iii effector proteins of erwinia amylovora and pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato along the hrp pilus, but not along the flagellum or randomly in the intercellular space. in contrast, pele, a pectate lyase secreted via the type ii protein secretion system, was not associated with the hrp pilus. these results provide direct evidence that type iii secretion occurs only at the site of hrp pilus assembly and that the hrp pilus guides the transfer of effector proteins outside  the bacterial cell, favouring the 'conduit/guiding filament' model.

TI  == a harpin binding site in tobacco plasma membranes mediates activation of the pathogenesis-related gene hin1 independent of extracellular calcium but dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinase activity.
AB  == harpin from the bean halo-blight pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv phaseolicola (harpin(psph)) elicits the hypersensitive response and the accumulation of pathogenesis-related gene transcripts in the nonhost plant tobacco. here, we report the characterization of a nonproteinaceous binding site for harpin(psph) in tobacco plasma membranes, which is assumed to mediate the activation of plant  defense responses in a receptor-like manner. binding of 125i-harpin(psph) to tobacco microsomal membranes (dissociation constant = 425 nm) and protoplasts (dissociation constant = 380 nm) was specific, reversible, and saturable. a close correlation was found between the abilities of harpin(psph) fragments to elicit the transcript accumulation of the pathogenesis-related tobacco gene hin1 and to  compete for binding of 125i-harpin(psph) to its binding site. another elicitor of the hypersensitive response and hin1 induction in tobacco, the phytophthora megasperma-derived beta-elicitin beta-megaspermin, failed to bind to the putative harpin(psph) receptor. in contrast to activation by beta-megaspermin, harpin(psph)-induced activation of the 48-kd salicylic acid-responsive mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) and hin1 transcript accumulation were independent of extracellular calcium. moreover, use of the mapk kinase inhibitor  u0126 revealed that mapk activity was essential for pathogenesis-related gene expression in harpin(psph)-treated tobacco cells. thus, a receptor-mediated mapk-dependent signaling pathway may mediate the activation of plant defense responses induced by harpin(psph).

TI  == effects of the two-component system comprising gaca and gacs of erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora on the production of global regulatory rsmb rna, extracellular enzymes, and harpinecc.
AB  == posttranscriptional regulation mediated by the regulator of secondary metabolites (rsm) rsma-rsmb pair is the most important factor in the expression of genes for  extracellular enzymes and harpinecc in erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. rsma is a small rna-binding protein, which acts by lowering the half-life of a mrna species. rsmb specifies an untranslated regulatory rna and neutralizes the rsma effect. it has been speculated that gaca-gacs, members of a two-component system, may affect gene expression via rsma. because expa, a gaca homolog, and exps (or rpfa), a gacs homolog, have been identified in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, we examined the effects of these gaca and gacs homologs on the expression of rsma, rsmb, and an assortment of exoprotein genes. the gaca gene of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain 71 stimulated transcription of genes for several extracellular enzymes (pel-1, a pectate lyase gene; peh-1, a polygalacturonase gene; and celv, a cellulase gene), hrpnecc (an e. carotovora subsp. carotovora gene specifying the elicitor of hypersensitive reaction), and rsmb in gaca+ and gacs+ e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strains. similarly, the e. carotovora subsp. carotovora gaca gene stimulated csrb (rsmb) transcription in escherichia coli. a gacs- mutant of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain ah2 and a gaca- mutant of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain ecc71 compared with their parent strains produced very low levels of rsmb, pel-1, peh-1, celv, and hrpnecc transcripts but produced similar levels of rsma rna and rsma protein as well as transcripts of hyperproduction of extracellular enzymes (hex) hexa, kdgr (repressor of genes for uronate and pectate catabolism), rsmc, and rpos (gene for sigma-s, an alternate sigma factor). the levels of rsmb, pel-1, peh-1, celv, and  hrpnecc transcripts as well as production of pectate lyase, polygalacturonase, cellulase, protease, and harpinecc proteins were stimulated in gacs- and gaca- mutants by gacs+ or gaca+ plasmids, respectively. the gaca effect on exoenzyme genes and hrpnecc was abrogated in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora mutants deficient in rsma and rsmc or rsma, rsmc, and rsmb rna. the expression of lacz transcriptional fusions of rsmb of erwinia amylovora and erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae was markedly reduced in a gaca- and a gacs- mutant of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. southern blot hybridization revealed the presence of gaca  and gacs homologs in all tested strains of soft-rotting erwinia spp. and several  nonsoft-rotting erwinia species such as e. amylovora, e. rhapontici, e. herbicola, e. stewartii, and e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae. these findings establish that the gaca-gacs system controls transcription of rsmb of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, e. amylovora, and e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae and  support the hypothesis that the effects of this two-component system on extracellular protein production in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora is mediated,  at least in part, via the levels of rsmb transcripts.

TI  == evidence for the involvement of an oxidative stress in the initiation of infection of pear by erwinia amylovora.
AB  == involvement of an oxidative burst, usually related to incompatible plant/pathogen interactions leading to hypersensitive reactions, was investigated with erwinia amylovora, the causal agent of fire blight of maloideae subfamily of rosaceae, in interaction with pear (pyrus communis; compatible situation) and tobacco (nicotiana tabacum; incompatible situation). as expected, this necrogenic bacterium induced in tobacco a sustained production of superoxide anion, lipid peroxidation, electrolyte leakage, and concomitant increases of several antioxidative enzymes (ascorbate peroxidases, glutathion reductases, glutathion-s-transferases, and peroxidases), in contrast to the compatible pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv tabaci, which did not cause such reactions. in pear leaves, however, inoculations with both the disease- and the hypersensitive  reaction-inducing bacteria (e. amylovora and p. syringae pv tabaci, respectively) resulted in superoxide accumulation, lipid peroxidation, electrolyte leakage, and enzyme induction at similar rates and according to equivalent time courses. the unexpected ability of e. amylovora to generate an oxidative stress even in compatible situation was linked to its functional hrp (for hypersensitive reaction and pathogenicity) cluster because an hrp secretion mutant of the bacteria did not induce any plant response. it is suggested that e. amylovora uses the production of reactive oxygen species as a tool to provoke host cell death during pathogenesis to invade plant tissues. the bacterial exopolysaccharide could protect this pathogen against the toxic effects of oxygen species since a non-capsular mutant of e. amylovora induced locally the same responses than the wild type but was unable to further colonize the plant.

TI  == expression of metallothionein in the liver and kidney of rats is influenced by excess dietary histidine.
AB  == it is well known that excess dietary histidine induces the metabolic changes in copper and zinc. therefore, this study was carried out to clarify whether excess  dietary histidine alters the gene expressions of metallothionein-1 and metallothionein-2 in the liver and kidney. male rats were fed the control (ad libitum and pair-fed) or histidine-excess (50 g of l-histidine per kg of diet) diet for 0, 1 and 3 days. the levels of liver metallothionein-1 and metallothionein-2 mrna were markedly lower in the rats fed the histidine-excess diet as compared to those of the control (ad libitum and pair-fed) diet, when fed for 1 or 3 days. the levels of renal metallothionein-1 and metallothionein-2 mrna in the rats fed the histidine-excess diet were higher or tended to be higher as compared with the rats fed the control (ad libitum and pair-fed) diet when fed for 1 or 3 days, respectively. at the same time, hepatic copper content was decreased and renal zinc content was increased by dietary histidine. it thus appears, that such a response on the level of liver metallothionein mrna might be related to the contents of liver copper, but of kidney metallothionein mrna might be due to the content of zinc.

TI  == hexa of erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora strain ecc71 negatively regulates production of rpos and rsmb rna, a global regulator of extracellular proteins, plant virulence and the quorum-sensing signal, n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone.
AB  == the soft-rotting bacterium, erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora (e. c. carotovora), produces an array of extracellular enzymes (= exoenzymes), including pectate lyase (pel), polygalacturonase (peh), cellulase (cel) and protease (prt), as well as harpinecc, the elicitor of hypersensitive reaction (hr). the production of these exoenzymes and harpinecc responds to plant products and the quorum-sensing signal [n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone; ohl] and is subject to both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. hexa of e. c. carotovora strain ecc71 (hereafter hexa71), like that of another e. c. carotovora strain, negatively controls the production of exoenzymes, ohl and virulence in e. c. carotovora strain ecc71. in addition to exoenzymes, hexa71 negatively regulates the expression of hrpnecc, the structural gene for harpinecc. exoenzyme overproduction is abolished by ohl deficiency in a hexa- and ohll- double mutant, indicating that hexa and ohl are components of a common regulatory pathway controlling exoenzyme production. hexa71 negatively affects rpos, as the levels of this alternative sigma factor are higher in the hexa- mutant than in the hexa+ strain. however, a hexa- and rpos double mutant produces higher levels of exoenzymes and transcripts of pel-1, peh-1 and celvgenes than the hexa- and rpos+ parent. thus, the elevated levels of rpos protein in the hexa- mutant do not account for exoenzyme overproduction. the following evidence  associates for the first time the phenotypic changes in the hexa mutant to overproduction of rsmb rna, a global regulator of exoenzymes, harpinecc, ohl and  secondary metabolites. analyses of rsmb transcripts and expression of an rsmb-laczoperon fusion in e. c. carotovora strain ecc71 revealed that hexa71 negatively regulates transcription of rsmb. multiple copies of hexa71+ dna suppress various phenotypes, including exoenzyme production in e. c. carotovora strain ecc71, and concomitantly inhibit the production of rsmb, pel-1, peh-1, celv and hrpnecc transcripts. multiple copies of rsmb+ dna, on the other hand, stimulate exoenzyme production by relieving the negative effects of a chromosomal copy of hexa+. the occurrence of hexa homologues and the negative effect of the dosage of hexa71 dna on rsmb transcripts were also detected in other e. c. carotovora strains as well as erwinia carotovora atroseptica and erwinia carotovora betavasculorum. extrapolating from the findings with lrha, the escherichia coli homologue of hexa, and the presence of spre homologues in e. carotovora subspecies, we propose that hexa71 controls several regulatory pathways in e. carotovora including rsmb transcription and the production of spreecc which, in turn, affects rpos levels. a model is presented that integrates the findings presented here and our current knowledge of the major regulatory network that controls exoprotein production in soft-rotting erwinia carotovora subspecies.

AB  == hypersensitive reaction and pathogenicity (hrp) genes are required for pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (pst) dc3000 to cause disease in susceptible tomato and arabidopsis thaliana plants and to elicit the hypersensitive response  in resistant plants. the hrp genes encode a type iii protein secretion system known as the hrp system, which in pst dc3000 secretes hrpa, hrpz, hrpw, and avrpto and assembles a surface appendage, named the hrp pilus, in hrp-gene-inducing minimal medium. hrpa has been suggested to be the hrp pilus structural protein on the basis of copurification and mutational analyses. in this study, we show that an antibody against hrpa efficiently labeled hrp pili, whereas antibodies against hrpw and hrpz did not. immunogold labeling of bacteria-infected arabidopsis thaliana leaf tissue with an hrp pilus antibody revealed a characteristic lineup of gold particles around bacteria and/or at the  bacterium-plant contact site. these results confirm that hrpa is the major structural protein of the hrp pilus and provide evidence that hrp pili are assembled in vitro and in planta.

TI  == visualization of harpin secretion in planta during infection of apple seedlings by erwinia amylovora.
AB  == erwinia amylovora is a gram-negative pathogenic bacterium that infects pear and apple trees as well as other plants from the rosaceae family. e. amylovora pathogenicity is dependent on a functional hrp type iii secretion system. harpin, a protein playing a major role in virulence, has been shown to be exported in vitro via the type iii secretion apparatus. the data presented here focus on harpin detection in planta after infection of apple seedlings with the wild-type  strain cfpb 1430. using a specific harpin antiserum, harpin was not detected inside the host plant cells, but was found associated with the bacteria and secreted. the extracellular localization of harpin is in agreement with the physiological effects induced by purified harpin when applied as an exogenous elicitor. harpin was not found associated with the host plant cell wall, a result that weakens its postulated role in cell wall loosening. a differential labelling was observed at the bacterial level: for some bacteria, harpin was exclusively cytoplasmic, whereas in others, it appeared as small patches over the bacterial outer membrane or associated with extracellular linear structures. all the bacteria present within the same area were similarly labelled, suggesting co-ordination in the secretion process. all observations suggest that harpin is synthesized in the bacterial cytoplasm and that secretion occurs from this cytoplasmic pool upon sensing of a plant or bacterial signal.

AB  == the identification of gram-negative pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria commonly isolated from an orchard phylloplane may result in a time consuming and  tedious process for the plant pathologist. the paper provides a simple "one-step" protocol that uses the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to amplify intergenic spacer regions between 16s and 23s genes and a portion of 16s gene in the prokaryotic rrna genetic loci. amplified 16s rdna, and restriction fragment length polymorphisms (rflp) following ecori digestion produced band patterns that readily distinguished between the plant pathogen erwinia amylovora (causal agent  of fire blight in pear and apple) and the orchard epiphyte pantoea agglomerans (formerly e. herbicola). the amplified dna patterns of 16s-23s spacer regions may be used to differentiate e. amylovora at the intraspecies level. isolates of e. amylovora obtained from raspberries exhibited two major fragments while those obtained from apples showed three distinct amplified dna bands. in addition, the  size of the 16s-23s spacer region differs between pseudomonas syringae and pseudomonas fluorescens. the rflp pattern generated by haeiii digestion may be used to provide a rapid and accurate identification of these two common orchard epiphytes.

TI  == homologous and heterologous desensitization and synergy in pathways leading to the soybean oxidative burst.
AB  == because the h2o2 and o2- generated during a pathogen-triggered oxidative burst could either protect or destroy a besieged plant cell, their synthesis might be expected to be tightly regulated. we have examined the nature of this regulation  as it is communicated between homologous and heterologous oxidative-burst pathways, using both chemical (oligogalacturonic acid, harpin, fensulfothion) and mechanical (osmotic stress) stimuli to induce the burst. we report here that the  above three chemical elicitors attenuate a subsequent oxidative burst induced in  cultured soybean (glycine max l.) cells by either the same (homologous desensitization) or a different chemical elicitor (heterologous desensitization). further, when the magnitude of the initial oxidative burst is maximal, the cells  remain refractory to subsequent elicitation for at least 10 min and then revive their sensitivities to re-stimulation with a half-time of >20 min. mechanical stimulation of the oxidative burst appears to be regulated by a different set of  constraints. although initiation of a mechanically induced burst leads to attenuation of a subsequent mechanically induced burst, the same mechanical stimulus is peculiarly unable to reduce a subsequent chemically induced burst. the converse is also true, suggesting that heterologous desensitization of the oxidative burst does not extend to mixed chemical and mechanical/osmotic stimuli. however, communication between these disparate forms of elicitation is still demonstrated to occur, since low-level chemical stimuli strongly synergize concurrent low-level osmotic stimuli and vice versa. furthermore, the pattern of  synergy changes dramatically if one stimulus is administered immediately prior to the other. taken together, these data demonstrate that significant cross-talk occurs among the different signaling pathways of the oxidative burst and that the overall process is tightly regulated.

TI  == regulation of hrp genes and type iii protein secretion in erwinia amylovora by hrpx/hrpy, a novel two-component system, and hrps.
AB  == two novel regulatory components, hrpx and hrpy, of the hrp system of erwinia amylovora were identified. the hrpxy operon is expressed in rich media, but its transcription is increased threefold by low ph, nutrient, and temperature levels--conditions that mimic the plant apoplast. hrpxy is autoregulated and directs the expression of hrpl; hrpl, in turn, activates transcription of other loci in the hrp gene cluster (z.-m. wei and s. v. beer, j. bacteriol. 177:6201-6210, 1995). the deduced amino -acid sequences of hrpx and hrpy are similar to bacterial two-component regulators including vsra/vsrd of pseudomonas  (ralstonia) solanacearum, degs/degu of bacillus subtilis, and uhpb/uhpa and narx/narp, narl of escherichia coli. the n-terminal signal-input domain of hrpx contains pas domain repeats. hrps, located downstream of hrpxy, encodes a protein with homology to wtsa (hrps) of erwinia (pantoea) stewartii, hrpr and hrps of pseudomonas syringae, and other delta54-dependent, enhancer-binding proteins. transcription of hrps also is induced under conditions that mimic the plant apoplast. however, hrps is not autoregulated, and its expression is not affected  by hrpxy. when hrps or hrpl were provided on multicopy plasmids, both hrpx and hrpy mutants recovered the ability to elicit the hypersensitive reaction in tobacco. this confirms that hrps and hrpl are not epistatic to hrpxy. a model of  the regulatory cascades leading to the induction of the e. amylovora type iii system is proposed.

TI  == cdna cloning and characterization of a plant protein that may be associated with  the harpinpss-mediated hypersensitive response.
AB  == hypersensitive response-assisting protein (hrap) is a novel plant protein that can intensify the harpinpss-mediated hypersensitive response (hr) in harpinpss-insensitive plants, such as the vegetative stage of sweet pepper. in this report, we identified a hrap cdna clone from sweet pepper (capsicum annuum cv. ecw). the sequence of this cdna clone showed no appreciable similarity to any other known sequences. however, it contained three positively charged regions, a  typical signal peptide and a camp-dependent phosphorylation site. the hrap mrna accumulated preferentially during the incompatible interaction of sweet pepper leaves with a pathogenic bacterium, pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. when the hrap gene transcription level was high, the sweet pepper leaves readily expressed the harpinpss-mediated hr. the hrap gene transcription level in sweet pepper was  also higher during the reproductive stage than during the vegetative stage. the hrap distribution in an individual plant and different plant species was investigated. we found that all the organs of sweet pepper, except fruit, could express two different forms of hrap. moreover, the hrap gene was presented in many plant species including tobacco, arabidopsis, and rice. in conclusion, our results suggest that the hrap gene is widely distributed throughout the plant world and its transcription level correlates with plant sensitivity to harpinpss. the interaction between hrap and harpinpss reveals a novel way to interpret the interaction mechanism between plants and bacterial pathogens.

TI  == assembly and function of type iii secretory systems.
AB  == type iii secretion systems allow yersinia spp., salmonella spp., shigella spp., bordetella spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa and enteropathogenic escherichia coli adhering at the surface of a eukaryotic cell to inject bacterial proteins across  the two bacterial membranes and the eukaryotic cell membrane to destroy or subvert the target cell. these systems consist of a secretion apparatus, made of  approximately 25 proteins, and an array of proteins released by this apparatus. some of these released proteins are "effectors," which are delivered into the cytosol of the target cell, whereas the others are "translocators," which help the effectors to cross the membrane of the eukaryotic cell. most of the effectors act on the cytoskeleton or on intracellular-signaling cascades. a protein injected by the enteropathogenic e. coli serves as a membrane receptor for the docking of the bacterium itself at the surface of the cell. type iii secretion systems also occur in plant pathogens where they are involved both in causing disease in susceptible hosts and in eliciting the so-called hypersensitive response in resistant or nonhost plants. they consist of 15-20 hrp proteins building a secretion apparatus and two groups of effectors: harpins and avirulence proteins. harpins are presumably secreted in the extracellular compartment, whereas avirulence proteins are thought to be targeted into plant cells. although a coherent picture is clearly emerging, basic questions remain to be answered. in particular, little is known about how the type iii apparatus fits together to deliver proteins in animal cells. it is even more mysterious for plant cells where a thick wall has to be crossed. in spite of these haunting questions, type iii secretion appears as a fascinating trans-kingdom communication device.

TI  == receptor-mediated increase in cytoplasmic free calcium required for activation of pathogen defense in parsley.
AB  == transient influx of ca(2+) constitutes an early element of signaling cascades triggering pathogen defense responses in plant cells. treatment with the phytophthora sojae-derived oligopeptide elicitor, pep-13, of parsley cells stably expressing apoaequorin revealed a rapid increase in cytoplasmic free calcium ([ca(2+)](cyt)), which peaked at approximately 1 microm and subsequently declined to sustained values of 300 nm. activation of this biphasic [ca(2+)](cyt) signature was achieved by elicitor concentrations sufficient to stimulate ca(2+)  influx across the plasma membrane, oxidative burst, and phytoalexin production. sustained concentrations of [ca(2+)](cyt) but not the rapidly induced [ca(2+)](cyt) transient peak are required for activation of defense-associated responses. modulation by pharmacological effectors of ca(2+) influx across the plasma membrane or of ca(2+) release from internal stores suggests that the elicitor-induced sustained increase of [ca(2+)](cyt) predominantly results from the influx of extracellular ca(2+). identical structural features of pep-13 were  found to be essential for receptor binding, increases in [ca(2+)](cyt), and activation of defense-associated responses. thus, a receptor-mediated increase in [ca(2+)](cyt) is causally involved in signaling the activation of pathogen defense in parsley.

AB  == the host range of the gall-forming bacterium erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae (ehg) is restricted to gypsophila whereas erwinia herbicola pv. betae (ehb) attacks beet as well as gypsophila. both pathovars contain an indigenous plasmid  (ppath(ehg or ppath(ehb)) that harbors pathogenicity genes, including the hrp gene cluster. a cosmid library of ehg824-1 plasmid dna was mobilized into ehb4188 and the transconjugants were screened for pathogenicity on beet. one ehb transconjugant harboring the cosmid pla173 of ppatheb induced a hypersensitive-like response and abolished pathogenicity on beet. transposon mutagenesis of an open reading frame (orf) located on this cosmid eliminated its  affect on pathogenicity. marker exchange of this mutation into ehg824-1 caused a  substantial reduction in gall size on gypsophila and caused ehg824-1 to extend its host range and incite galls on beet. the orf (1.5 kb) was designated as pthg  (pathogenicity gene on gypsophila). dna sequence analysis of pthg revealed no significant homology to known genes in the data bank. only remnants of the pthg sequences were identified on the ppath of ehb4188. the deduced protein lacked an  n-terminal signal peptide but contained a short trans-membrane helix in its c terminus. the gene product, as determined by expression in escherichia coli and western blots (immunoblots), was a 56-kda protein.

TI  == harpin-induced hypersensitive cell death is associated with altered mitochondrial functions in tobacco cells.
AB  == mitochondria play important roles in animal apoptosis and are implicated in salicylic acid (sa)-induced plant resistance to viral pathogens. in a previous study, we demonstrated that sa induces rapid inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation in tobacco cells. in the present study, we report that plant programmed cell death induced during pathogen elicitor-induced hypersensitive response (hr) is also associated with altered mitochondrial functions. harpin, an hr elicitor produced by erwinia amylovora, induced inhibition of atp synthesis in tobacco cell cultures. inhibition of atp synthesis occurred almost immediately after incubation with harpin and preceded hypersensitive cell death induced by the elicitor. diphenylene iodonium, an inhibitor of the oxidative burst, did not block harpin-induced inhibition of atp  synthesis or cell death, suggesting that oxidative burst was not the direct cause for these two harpin-induced processes. unlike sa, harpin had no significant effect on total respiratory o2 uptake of treated cells. however, respiration of harpin-treated tobacco cells became very sensitive to the alternative oxidase inhibitors salicyl-hydroxamic acid and n-propyl gallate. thus, harpin treatment resulted in reduced capacity of mitochondrial cytochrome pathway electron transport, which could lead to the observed inhibition of atp synthesis. given the recently demonstrated roles of mitochondria in apoptosis, this rapid inhibition of mitochondrial functions may play a role in harpin-induced hypersensitive cell death.

AB  == elicitation of arabidopsis thaliana (l.) heynh. suspension cultures with the bacterial protein harpin (from pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae) induced the activation of two kinases of 39 and 44 kda, as demonstrated by in-gel kinase assays using myelin basic protein (mbp) as a substrate. both these kinases appeared to be tyrosine-phosphorylated upon activation, as demonstrated by treatment with tyrosine phosphatase and immunoprecipitation using an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody. an inhibitor of mammalian mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) activation, pd98059, inhibited harpin-induced mbpk activation, but did not inhibit the activity of these kinases. pd98059 also inhibited harpin-induced programmed cell death and defence  gene expression, suggesting the involvement of harpin-induced mapks in defence responses in arabidopsis thaliana.

TI  == harpin induces disease resistance in arabidopsis through the systemic acquired resistance pathway mediated by salicylic acid and the nim1 gene.
AB  == harpin, the product of the hrpn gene of erwinia amylovora, elicits the hypersensitive response and disease resistance in many plants. harpin and known inducers of systemic acquired resistance (sar) were tested on five genotypes of arabidopsis thaliana to assess the role of sar in harpin-induced resistance. in wild-type plants, harpin elicited systemic resistance to peronospora parasitica and pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, accompanied by induction of the sar genes pr-1 and pr-2. however, in experiments with transgenic arabidopsis plants containing the nahg gene which prevents accumulation of salicylic acid (sa), harpin neither elicited resistance nor activated sar gene expression. harpin also failed to activate sar when applied to nim1 (non-inducible immunity) mutants, which are defective in responding to sa and regulation of sar. in contrast, mutants compromised in responsiveness to methyl jasmonate and ethylene developed  the same resistance as did wild-type plants. thus, harpin elicits disease resistance through the nim1-mediated sar signal transduction pathway in an sa-dependent fashion. the site of action of harpin in the sar regulatory pathway  is upstream of sa.

TI  == rsmc of the soft-rotting bacterium erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora negatively controls extracellular enzyme and harpin(ecc) production and virulence by modulating levels of regulatory rna (rsmb) and rna-binding protein (rsma).
AB  == previous studies have shown that the production of extracellular enzymes (pectate lyase [pel], polygalacturonase [peh], cellulase [cel], and protease [prt]) and harpin(ecc) (the elicitor of hypersensitive reaction) in erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora is regulated by rsma, an rna-binding protein, and rsmb, a regulatory rna (rsm stands for regulator of secondary metabolites) (y. liu et al., mol. microbiol. 29:219-234, 1998). we have cloned and characterized a novel  regulatory gene, rsmc, that activates rsma production and represses extracellular enzyme and harpin(ecc) production, rsmb transcription, and virulence in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora. in an rsmc knockout mutant of e. carotovora subsp.  carotovora ecc71 carrying the chromosomal copy of the wild-type rsma(+) allele, the basal levels of pel, peh, cel, prt, and harpin(ecc) as well as the amounts of rsmb, pel-1, peh-1, celv, and hrpn(ecc) transcripts are high, whereas the levels  of rsma transcripts and rsma protein are low. furthermore, the expression of an rsma-lacz gene fusion is lower in the rsmc(-) mutant than in the rsmc(+) parent.  conversely, the expression of an rsmb-lacz operon fusion is higher in the rsmc(-) mutant than in the rsmc(+) parent. these observations establish that rsmc negatively regulates rsmb transcription but positively affects rsma production. indeed, comparative studies with an rsmc(-) mutant, an rsma(-) mutant, and an rsma(-) rsmc(-) double mutant have revealed that the negative effects on exoprotein production and virulence are due to the cumulative regulatory effects  of rsmc on rsma and rsmb. exoprotein production by the rsmc(-) mutant is partially dependent on the quorum sensing signal, n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine  lactone. southern blot data and analysis of pcr products disclosed the presence of rsmc sequences in e. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, e. carotovora subsp. betavasculorum, and e. carotovora subsp. carotovora. these findings collectively  support the idea that rsma and rsmb expression in these plant pathogenic erwinia  species is controlled by rsmc or a functional homolog of rsmc.

(py), isolated from apple orchards in new york and washington states, is predominantly  associated with stra-strb genes carried on conjugal plasmids (r plasmids). none of 128 resistant erwinia amylovora strains from the eastern and western usa hybridized with a stra-strb probe, smp3. resistant py strains transfered r plasmids to ps. syringae pv. papulans and to py in vitro at frequencies of 10(-1)-10(-2) per recipient cell whereas ps. syringae pv. papulans transferred its plasmids at frequencies of 10(-2) to below detectable levels. transfer of r plasmids to p. agglomerans was not detected and resistant p. agglomerans did not  transfer their r plasmids to any recipients. r plasmids were found to be highly diverse as measured by dna fingerprint analysis. transfer-deficient transposon mutants of r plasmid pcpp519 were generated, and 3.9 kb ecori and 3.0 kb smai fragments that hybridized with a tn5 probe were cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences of the 3.9 kb fragment were similar to proteins involved in  replication, nicking at orit, and piliation in other bacteria.

TI  == kdgrecc negatively regulates genes for pectinases, cellulase, protease, harpinecc, and a global rna regulator in erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora.
AB  == erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora produces extracellular pectate lyase (pel),  polygalacturonase (peh), cellulase (cel), and protease (prt). the concerted actions of these enzymes largely determine the virulence of this plant-pathogenic bacterium. e. carotovora subsp. carotovora also produces harpinecc, the elicitor  of the hypersensitive reaction. we document here that kdgrecc (kdg, 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate; kdgr, general repressor of genes involved in pectin and  galacturonate catabolism), a homolog of the e. chrysanthemi repressor, kdgrech and the escherichia coli repressor, kdgreco, negatively controls not only the pectinases, pel and peh, but also cel, prt, and harpinecc production in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora. the levels of pel-1, peh-1, celv, and hrpnecc transcripts are markedly affected by kdgrecc. the kdgrecc- mutant is more virulent than the kdgrecc+ parent. thus, our data for the first time establish a  global regulatory role for kdgrecc in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora. another novel observation is the negative effect of kdgrecc on the transcription of rsmb  (previously aeph), which specifies an rna regulator controlling exoenzyme and harpinecc production. the levels of rsmb rna are higher in the kdgrecc- mutant than in the kdgrecc+ parent. moreover, by dnase i protection assays we determined that purified kdgrecc protected three 25-bp regions within the transcriptional unit of rsmb. alignment of the protected sequences revealed the 21-mer consensus  sequence of the kdgrecc-binding site as 5'-g/aa/ta/tgaaa[n6]tttcag/tg/ta-3'. two  such kdgrecc-binding sites occur in rsmb dna in a close proximity to each other within nucleotides +79 and +139 and the third kdgrecc-binding site within nucleotides +207 and +231. analysis of lacz transcriptional fusions shows that the kdgr-binding sites negatively affect the expression of rsmb. kdgrecc also binds the operator dnas of pel-1 and peh-1 genes and represses expression of a pel1-lacz and a peh1-lacz transcriptional fusions. we conclude that kdgrecc affects extracellular enzyme production by two ways: (i) directly, by inhibiting  the transcription of exoenzyme genes; and (ii) indirectly, by preventing the production of a global rna regulator. our findings support the idea that kdgrecc  affects transcription by promoter occlusion, i.e., preventing the initiation of transcription, and by a roadblock mechanism, i.e., by affecting the elongation of transcription.

TI  == cellular locations of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae hrcc and hrcj proteins, required for harpin secretion via the type iii pathway.
AB  == the complete hrp-hrc-hrma cluster of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61 encodes 28 polypeptides. a saprophytic bacterium carrying this cluster is capable of secreting hrpz-a harpin encoded by hrpz-in an hrp-dependent manner, which suggests that this cluster contains sufficient components to assemble functional  type iii secretion machinery. sequence data show that hrcj and hrcc are putative  outer membrane proteins, and nonpolar mutagenesis demonstrates they are all required for hrpz secretion. in this study, we investigated the cellular localization of the hrcc and hrcj proteins by triton solubilization, sucrose-gradient isopycnic centrifugation, and immunogold labeling of the bacterial cell surface. our results indicate that hrcc is indeed an outer membrane protein and that hrcj is located between both membranes. their membrane  localization suggests that they might be involved in the formation of a supramolecular structure for protein secretion.

TI  == the pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato hrpw protein has domains similar to harpins and pectate lyases and can elicit the plant hypersensitive response and bind to pectate.
AB  == the host-specific plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae elicits the hypersensitive  response (hr) in nonhost plants and secretes the hrpz harpin in culture via the hrp (type iii) secretion system. previous genetic evidence suggested the existence of another harpin gene in the p. syringae genome. hrpw was found in a region adjacent to the hrp cluster in p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000. hrpw encodes a 42. 9-kda protein with domains resembling harpins and pectate lyases (pels), respectively. hrpw has key properties of harpins. it is heat stable and glycine rich, lacks cysteine, is secreted by the hrp system, and is able to elicit the hr when infiltrated into tobacco leaf tissue. the harpin domain (amino acids 1 to 186) has six glycine-rich repeats of a repeated sequence found in hrpz, and a purified hrpw harpin domain fragment possessed hr elicitor activity. in contrast, the hrpw pel domain (amino acids 187 to 425) is similar to pels from nectria haematococca, erwinia carotovora, erwinia chrysanthemi, and bacillus subtilis, and a purified pel domain fragment did not elicit the hr. neither this fragment nor the full-length hrpw showed pel activity in a230 assays under a variety of reaction conditions, but the pel fragment bound to calcium pectate, a major constituent of the plant cell wall. the dna sequence of the p. syringae pv. syringae b728a hrpw was also determined. the pel domains of the two predicted hrpw proteins were 85% identical, whereas the harpin domains were only 53% identical. sequences hybridizing at high stringency with the p. syringae pv. tomato hrpw were found in other p. syringae pathovars, pseudomonas viridiflava, ralstonia (pseudomonas) solanacearum, and xanthomonas campestris. deltahrpz::nptii or hrpw::omegaspr p. syringae pv. tomato mutants were little reduced in hr elicitation activity in tobacco, whereas this activity was significantly reduced in a hrpz hrpw double mutant. these features of hrpw and its product suggest that p. syringae produces multiple harpins and that the target of these proteins is in the plant cell wall.

TI  == hrpw of erwinia amylovora, a new harpin that contains a domain homologous to pectate lyases of a distinct class.
AB  == harpins, such as hrpn of erwinia amylovora, are extracellular glycine-rich proteins that elicit the hypersensitive reaction (hr). we identified hrpw of e. amylovora, which encodes a protein similar to known harpins in that it is acidic, rich in glycine and serine, and lacks cysteine. a putative hrpl-dependent promoter was identified upstream of hrpw, and western blot analysis of hrpl mutants indicated that the production of hrpw is regulated by hrpl. hrpw is secreted via the hrp (type iii) pathway based on analysis of wild-type strains and hrp secretion mutants. when infiltrated into plants, hrpw induced rapid tissue collapse, which required active plant metabolism. the hr-eliciting activity was heat stable and protease sensitive. thus, we concluded that hrpw is  a new harpin. hrpw of e. amylovora consists of two domains connected by a pro and ser-rich sequence. a fragment containing the n-terminal domain was sufficient to  elicit the hr. although no pectate lyase activity was detected, the c-terminal region of hrpw is homologous to pectate lyases of a unique class, suggesting that hrpw may be targeted to the plant cell wall. southern analysis indicated that hrpw is conserved among several erwinia species, and hrpw, provided in trans, enhanced the hr-inducing ability of a hrpn mutant. however, hrpw did not increase the virulence of a hrpn mutant in host tissue, and hrpw mutants retained the wild-type ability to elicit the hr in nonhosts and to cause disease in hosts.

AB  == plant-pathogenic bacteria produce various extracellular polysaccharides (epss) which may function as virulence factors in diseases caused by these bacteria. the eps levan is synthesized by the extracellular enzyme levansucrase in pseudomonas  syringae, erwinia amylovora, and other bacterial species. the lsc genes encoding  levansucrase from p. syringae pv. glycinea pg4180 and p. syringae pv. phaseolicola ncppb 1321 were cloned, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. heterologous expression of the lsc gene in escherichia coli was found in four and two genomic library clones of strains pg4180 and ncppb 1321, respectively. a 3. 0-kb psti fragment common to all six clones conferred levan synthesis on e. coli when further subcloned. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a 1,248-bp open reading frame (orf) derived from pg4180 and a 1,296-bp orf derived from ncppb 1321, which were both designated lsc. both orfs showed high homology to the e. amylovora and zymomonas mobilis lsc genes at the nucleic  acid and deduced amino acid sequence levels. levansucrase was not secreted into the supernatant but was located in the periplasmic fraction of e. coli harboring  the lsc gene. expression of lsc was found to be dependent on the vector-based plac promoter, indicating that the native promoter of lsc was not functional in e. coli. insertion of an antibiotic resistance cassette in the lsc gene abolished levan synthesis in e. coli. a pcr screening with primers derived from lsc of p. syringae pv. glycinea pg4180 allowed the detection of this gene in a number of related bacteria.

AB  == changes in gene expression induced in tobacco leaves by the harpin hrpn protein elicitor were examined, and a new cdna, piox (for pathogen-induced oxygenase), with homology to genes encoding cyclooxygenase or prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase (pghs), was identified. in addition to the amino acid identity determined, the protein encoded by piox is predicted to have a structural core similar to that of ovine pghs-1. moreover, studies of protein functionality demonstrate that the piox recombinant protein possesses at least one of the two enzymatic activities of pghss, that of catalyzing the oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. piox transcripts accumulated after protein elicitor  treatment or inoculation with bacteria. expression of piox was induced in tissues responding to inoculation with both incompatible and compatible bacteria, but rna and protein accumulation differed for both types of interactions. we show that expression of piox is rapidly induced in response to various cellular signals mediating plant responses to pathogen infection and that activation of piox expression is most likely related to the oxidative burst that takes place during  the cell death processes examined. cyclooxygenase catalyzes the first committed step in the formation of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, which are lipid-derived signal molecules that mediate many cellular processes, including the immune response in vertebrates. the finding of tobacco piox suggests that more similarities than hitherto expected will be found between the lipid-based responses for plant and animal systems.

TI  == negative regulation of hrp genes in pseudomonas syringae by hrpv.
AB  == mutations in the five hrp and hrc genes in the hrpc operon of the phytopathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61 have different effects on bacterial interactions with host and nonhost plants. the hrcc gene within the hrpc operon encodes an outer membrane component of the hrp secretion system that is conserved in all type iii protein secretion systems and is required for most pathogenic phenotypes and for secretion of the hrpz harpin to the bacterial milieu. the other four genes (in order), hrpf, hrpg, (hrcc), hrpt, and hrpv, appear to be unique to the group i hrp clusters found in certain phytopathogens (e.g., p. syringae and erwinia amylovora) and are less well understood. we initiated an examination of their role in hrp regulation and secretion by determining the effects of functionally nonpolar nptii cartridge insertions in each gene on the production and secretion of hrpz, as determined by immunoblot analysis of cell fractions. p. syringae pv. syringae 61 hrpf, hrpg, and hrpt mutants were unable to secrete hrpz, whereas the hrpv mutant overproduced and secreted the protein. this suggested that hrpv is a negative regulator of hrpz production. further immunoblot assays showed that the hrpv mutant produced higher levels of proteins  encoded by all three of the major hrp operons tested-hrcj (hrpz operon), hrcc (hrpc operon), and hrcqb (hrpu operon)-and that constitutive expression of hrpv in trans abolished the production of each of these proteins. to determine the hierarchy of hrpv regulation in the p. syringae pv. syringae 61 positive regulatory cascade, which is composed of hrprs (proteins homologous with sigma54-dependent promoter-enhancer-binding proteins) and hrpl (alternate sigma factor), we tested the ability of constitutively expressed hrpv to repress the activation of hrcj production that normally accompanies constitutive expression of hrpl or hrprs. no repression was observed, indicating that hrpv acts upstream  of hrprs in the cascade. the effect of hrpv levels on transcription of the hrpz operon was determined by monitoring the levels of beta-glucuronidase produced by  a hrpa'::uida transcriptional fusion plasmid in different p. syringae pv. syringae 61 strains. the hrpv mutant produced higher levels of beta-glucuronidase than the wild type, a hrcu (type iii secretion) mutant produced the same level as the wild type, and the strain constitutively expressing hrpv in trans produced low levels equivalent to that of a hrps mutant. these results suggest that hrpf,  hrpg, and hrpt are all components of the type iii protein secretion system whereas hrpv is a negative regulator of transcription of the hrp regulon.

AB  == the species pseudomonas syringae encompasses plant pathogens with differing host  specificities and corresponding pathovar designations. p. syringae requires the hrp (type iii protein secretion) system, encoded by a 25-kb cluster of hrp and hrc genes, in order to elicit the hypersensitive response (hr) in nonhosts or to  be pathogenic in hosts. dna sequence analysis of the hrpc and hrprs operons of p. syringae pv. syringae 61 (brown spot of beans), p. syringae pv. glycinea u1 (bacterial blight of soybeans), and p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000 (bacterial speck of tomatos) revealed that the 13 genes comprising the right half of the hrp cluster (including those in the previously sequenced hrpz operon) are conserved and identically arranged. the hrpc operon is comprised of hrpf, hrpg, hrcc, hrpt, and hrpv. hrcc encodes a putative outer membrane protein that is conserved in all type iii secretion systems. the other four genes appear to be characteristic of group i hrp systems, such as those possessed by p. syringae and erwinia amylovora. the predicted products of these four genes in p. syringae pv. syringae 61 are hrpf (8 kda), hrpg (15.4 kda), hrpt (7.5 kda), and hrpv (13.4 kda). hrpt is a putative outer membrane lipoprotein. hrpf, hrpg, and hrpv are all hydrophilic proteins lacking n-terminal signal peptides. the hrpg, hrcc, hrpt, and hrpv proteins of p. syringae pathovars syringae and tomato (the two most divergent pathovars) had at least 76% amino acid identity with each other, whereas the hrpf proteins of these two pathovars had only 36% amino acid identity. the hrpf proteins of p. syringae pathovars syringae and glycinea also showed significant similarity to the hrpa pilin protein of p. syringae pathovar tomato. functionally nonpolar mutations were introduced into each of the genes in the hrpc operon of p. syringae pv. syringae 61 by insertion of an nptii cartridge lacking a transcription terminator. the mutants were assayed for their ability to elicit the hr in nonhost tobacco leaves or to multiply and cause disease in host  bean leaves. mutations in hrpf, hrcc, and hrpt abolished or greatly reduced the ability of p. syringae pv. syringae 61 to elicit the hr in tobacco. the hrpg mutant had only weakly reduced hr activity, and the activity of the hrpv mutant was indistinguishable from that of the wild type. each of the mutations could be  complemented, but surprisingly, the hrpv subclone caused a reduction in the hr elicitation ability of the deltahrpv::nptii mutant. the hrpf and hrcc mutants caused no disease in beans, whereas the hrpg, hrpt, and hrpv mutants had reduced  virulence. similarly, the hrcc mutant grew little in beans, whereas the other mutants grew to intermediate levels in comparison with the wild type. these results indicate that hrpc and hrpf have essential functions in the hrp system, that hrpg and hrpt contribute quantitatively but are not essential, and that hrpv is a candidate negative regulator of the hrp system.

TI  == characterization of a novel rna regulator of erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora that controls production of extracellular enzymes and secondary metabolites.
AB  == the enterobacterium erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora strain 71 (hereafter ecc71) produces extracellular enzymes such as pectate lyase isozymes (pels), cellulase (cel), polygalacturonase (peh) and protease (prt). these enzymes degrade plant cell wall components and are largely responsible for the elicitation of soft-rot diseases in plants and plant products. ecc71 also produces harpinecc, the elicitor of hypersensitive reaction (hr) and the quorum-sensing signal, n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (ohl). ohl controls extracellular enzyme and harpinecc production. the levels of these enzymes, as well as the expression of hrpnecc, the structural gene for harpinecc, and ohll, the gene specifying ohl synthesis, are negatively regulated by rsmaa. rsmb, formerly aeph, on the other hand, positively regulates extracellular enzyme production. 6his-rsma recombinant protein purified from e. coli binds rsmb rna as indicated by gel mobility shift assays. rsmb comprises 547 bp dna, which is transcribed from a single start site immediately after a sigma70-like promoter. in ecc71, two rsmb rna species are detected: a full-length 479 base rsmb rna and  a 259 base rsmb' rna. rsmb' dna hybridizes with the 259 base and the 479 base transcripts. a 3' rnase protection assay revealed that the 259 base and the 479 base rna species end at the same position immediately after the putative rho-independent terminator. the expression of rsmb-lacz transcriptional fusions established that the rsmb' rna is not produced because of the activation of an internal promoter. these data strongly suggest that the 259 base rsmb' rna is derived by processing of the primary rsmb rna. in ecc71, rsmb' expression driven  by the lac promoter causes overproduction of pel, peh, cel and prt, and accumulation of pel-1, peh-1, hrpnecc and ohll transcripts. by contrast, a plasmid with the rsmb' dna sequence deleted fails to cause overproduction of the  extracellular enzymes in ecc71. the rsmb' effect also occurs in escherichia coli  as glycogen accumulation is stimulated in the presence of rsmb'. in vivo and in vitro translation as well as mutational analysis of rsmb' have established that rsmb' rna does not yield a translational product. therefore, we concluded that the rsmb' rna itself functions as the regulator. indeed, the expression rsmb' dna leads to neutralization of the negative effects of the rna-binding protein, rsma, in ecc71 and serratia marcescens strain sm274. we propose a model that explains how rsma and rsmb control the expression of genes for extracellular enzymes.

AB  == rpos (sigma-s or sigma-38) controls a large array of genes that are expressed during stationary phase and under various stress conditions in escherichia coli and other bacteria. we document here that plant pathogenic and epiphytic erwinia  species, such as e. amylovora; e. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, betavasculorum,  and carotovora; e. chrysanthemi; e. herbicola; e. rhapontici; and e. stewartii, possess rpos genes and produce the alternate sigma factor. we show that rpos transcription in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora is driven from a major promoter  which resides within the nlpd gene located upstream of rpos as in e. coli. rpos-  e. carotovora subsp. carotovoa strain ac5061, constructed by marker exchange, is  more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, carbon starvation, and acidic ph than its rpos+ parent strain, ac5006. the basal levels of extracellular pectate lyase, polygalacturonase, and cellulase as well as those of transcripts of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora hrpn (hrpnecc), the gene for the elicitor of the hypersensitive reaction, are higher in the rpos- strain than in the rpos+ parent. likewise, compared to ac5006, ac5061 causes more extensive maceration of celery petioles. our findings with the rpos- mutant and strains carrying multiple copies rpos+ dna reveal that rpos positively controls rsma expression. we also present evidence that supports the hypothesis that the rpos effect on extracellular enzyme levels, hrpnecc expression, and virulence manifests itself by the modulation of rsma expression.

TI  == harpin and hydrogen peroxide both initiate programmed cell death but have differential effects on defence gene expression in arabidopsis suspension cultures.
AB  == programmed cell death is increasingly viewed as a key component of the hypersensitive disease resistance response of plants. the generation of reactive  oxygen species (ros) such as h2o2 triggers a cell death programme in arabidopsis  suspension cultures following challenge with the bacterial elicitor harpin. both  harpin and exogenous h2o2 initiate a cell death pathway that requires gene expression, and also act as signalling molecules to induce the expression of plant defence genes encoding enzymes such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (pal), glutathione s-transferase (gst) and anthranilate synthase (asa1), an enzyme of phytoalexin biosynthesis in arabidopsis. h2o2 induces the expression of pal1 and  gst but not that of asa1. harpin initiates two signalling pathways, one leading to increased ros generation and expression of pal1 and gst mrna, and another leading to increased gst and asa1 expression, independent of h2o2.

AB  == the "disease-specific" (dsp) region next to the hrp gene cluster of erwinia amylovora is required for pathogenicity but not for elicitation of the hypersensitive reaction. a 6.6-kb apparent operon, dspef, was found responsible for this phenotype. the operon contains genes dspe and dspf and is positively regulated by hrpl. a blast search revealed similarity in the dspe gene to a partial sequence of the avre locus of pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato. the entire avre locus was sequenced. homologs of dspe and dspf were found in juxtaposed operons and were designated avre and avrf. introduced on a plasmid, the dspef locus rendered p. syringae pv. glycinea race 4 avirulent on soybean. an e. amylovora dspe mutant, however, elicited a hypersensitive reaction in soybean. the avre locus in trans restored pathogenicity to dspe strains of e. amylovora, although restored strains were low in virulence. dspe and avre are large (198 kda and 195 kda) and hydrophilic. dspf and avrf are small (16 kda and 14 kda) and acidic with predicted amphipathic alpha helices in their c termini; they resemble chaperones for virulence factors secreted by type iii secretion systems of animal pathogens.

TI  == dspa, an essential pathogenicity factor of erwinia amylovora showing homology with avre of pseudomonas syringae, is secreted via the hrp secretion pathway in a dspb-dependent way.
AB  == in erwinia amylovora, the dsp region, required for pathogenicity on the host plant but not for hypersensitive elicitation on tobacco, is separated from the hrp region by 4 kb. the genetic analysis reported in this paper showed that this  4kb region is not required for pathogenicity on pear seedlings. the environmental conditions allowing expression of a dsp::lacz fusion were examined: expression was barely detected in rich medium at 30 degrees c, and the highest expression was observed in m9 galactose minimal medium at 25 degrees c. a dsp::uida fusion appeared to be expressed only in a hrpl-proficient strain, indicating that the dsp region, like the hrp region, is positively controlled via the alternative a factor hrpl. sequence analysis revealed that the dsp cluster encodes two genes, dspa (5517 bp) and dspb (420 bp), and that the insertions leading to the dsp::lacz and the dsp::uida fusions were within dspa. a hrpl-dependent promoter sequence (ggaacc-n15-caaca) was identified upstream of dspa, and primer extension analysis detected four transcriptional starts 7, 8, 9 and 10 bp downstream of this sequence. a sigma70 promoter sequence (ttgccc-n16-gataat) was observed upstream of dspb. the functionality of this second promoter was confirmed by complementation analysis. this promoter allowed constitutive expression of dspb,  as measured by the expression of a dspb::uida fusion in rich medium. in m9 galactose medium, however, hrpl was shown to activate dspb, as expression of the  dspb::uida fusion was twofold higher in a hrpl+ background than in a hrpl- background. transposon insertions in either dspa or dspb led to a non-pathogenic  phenotype. thus, both dspa and dspb were required for e. amylovora pathogenicity, as dspb could be expressed independently of dspa. dspa and dspb were visualized as polypeptides with apparent sizes of 190 kda and 15.5 kda, respectively, when encoded in the t7 polymerase/promoter system. dspa, which showed homology with the protein predicted from the partial sequence of pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato avre transcriptional unit iii, was shown to be secreted into the external  medium via the hrp secretion pathway. dspb was predicted to be acidic, like the syc chaperone of yersinia. a chaperone role for dspb was suggested further by the fact that dspa secretion required a functional dspb protein.

TI  == the presence of hrp genes on the pathogenicity-associated plasmid of the tumorigenic bacterium erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae.
AB  == the pathogenicity-associated plasmid (ppath) of erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae (ehg), which is present only in pathogenic strains, contains a gene cluster encoding indole-3-acetic acid and cytokinin biosynthesis. the transposon-reporter tn3-spice was used to generate nonpathogenic mutants on two overlapping cosmids,  pla150 and pla352, of the ppath. a cluster of such mutations, which spanned 16 kb, mapped approximately 15 kb from the gene cluster involved in phytohormone biosynthesis. non-pathogenic mutants also failed to elicit the hypersensitive reaction (hr) on tobacco. pathogenicity and hr were restored concomitantly to these mutants by in trans complementation with wild-type ehg dna. a 3.8-kb hindiii dna fragment that complemented the hrp mutants was sequenced and six complete and two partial open reading frames (orfs) were identified. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the eight orfs showed striking homology and co-linearity with hrp genes of e. amylovora as well as with other plant and mammalian pathogenic bacterial genes encoding proteins of the type iii secretion  system. limited dna sequencing at various sites on the remaining 11-kb region of  pla352 also showed high identity to hrp proteins of e. amylovora, e. stewartii, and pseudomonas syringae. these results suggest that hrp genes are mandatory for  gall formation by e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae.

TI  == molecular characterization and expression of the erwinia carotovora hrpnecc gene, which encodes an elicitor of the hypersensitive reaction.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of hrpnecc dna, cloned from erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora strain ecc71, reveals a coding region of 1,068 bp which matches the size of hrpnecc transcripts. hrpnecc is predicted to encode a glycine-rich protein of approximately 36 kda. like the elicitors of the hypersensitive reaction (hr) produced by e. chrysanthemi (harpinech) and e. amylovora (harpinea), the deduced 36-kda protein does not possess a typical signal sequence, but it contains a putative membrane-spanning domain. in escherichia coli strains overexpressing hrpnecc, the 36-kda protein has been identified as the hrpnecc product by western blot analysis using anti-harpinech antibodies. the 36-kda protein fractionated from e. coli elicits the hr in tobacco leaves. moreover, a hrpn- and rsma- double mutant (rsma = regulator of secondary metabolites) does not produce this 36-kda protein or elicit the hr, although this strain, like the rsma- and hrpn+ bacteria, overproduces extracellular enzymes and macerates celery petioles. these observations demonstrate that hrpnecc encodes the elicitor of the hr, designated harpinecc. the levels of hrpnecc transcripts are affected in both rsma+ and rsma- strains by media composition and carbon sources, although the mrna levels are substantially higher in the rsma- strains.  the expression of hrpnecc in ecc71 is cell density dependent and is activated by  the quorum-sensing signal, n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (ohl). by contrast, hrpnecc expression in an rsma- strain is independent of cell density, and substantial expression occurs in the absence of ohl. the effects of cultural  conditions and the occurrence of putative cis-acting sequences, such as consensus sigma 54 promoters and an hrp promoter upstream of the transcriptional start site, indicate that the production of harpinecc in wild-type rsma+ e. carotovora  subsp. carotovora is tightly regulated. these observations, taken along with the  finding that the hr is caused by rsma- mutants but not by rsma+ strains (cui et al., 1996, mol. plant-microbe interact. 9:565-573), strongly support the idea that the inability of the wild-type pectolytic e. carotovora subsp. carotovora to elicit the hr is due to the lack of a significant level of harpinecc production.

TI  == the hrpa and hrpc operons of erwinia amylovora encode components of a type iii pathway that secretes harpin.
AB  == a 6.2-kb region of dna corresponding to complementation groups ii and iii of the  erwinia amylovora hrp gene cluster was analyzed. transposon mutagenesis indicated that the two complementation groups are required for secretion of harpin, an elicitor of the hypersensitive reaction. the sequence of the region revealed 10 open reading frames in two putative transcription units: hrpa, hrpb, hrcj, hrpd,  and hrpe in the hrpa operon (group iii) and hrpf, hrpg, hrcc, hrpt, and hrpv in the hrpc operon (group ii). from promoter regions of the hrpa, hrpc, and hrpn operons, sequences similar to those of the hrpl-dependent promoters of pseudomonas syringae pathovars were identified with a consensus sequence of 5'-ggaac-n17-18-cactnaa-3'. the protein products of seven genes, hrpa, hrcj, hrpe, hrpf, hrpg, hrcc, and hrpv, were visualized with a t7 polymerase/promoter expression system. hrcc, hrcj, and hrpt sequences contained potential signal peptides, and hrcc appeared to be envelope associated based on a tnphoa translational fusion. comparison of deduced amino acid sequences indicated that many of the proteins are homologous to proteins that function in the type iii protein secretion pathway. hrcc is a member of the yscc-containing subgroup in the puld/piv superfamily of outer membrane proteins. hrcj is a member of a lipoprotein family that includes yscj of yersinia spp., mxij of shigella flexneri, and nolt of rhizobim fredii. additional similarities were detected between hrpb and ysci and between hrpe and yscl. hrcj and hrpe were similar to flagellar biogenesis proteins flif and flih, respectively. in addition, hrpa, hrpb, hrcj, hrpd, hrpe, hrpf, and hrcc showed various degrees of similarity to corresponding proteins of p. syringae. comparison of hrp clusters with respect to gene organization and similarity of individual proteins confirms that the hrp systems of e. amylovora and p. syringae are closely related to each other and distinct from those of ralstonia (pseudomonas) solanacearum and xanthomonas campestris. possible implications of extensive similarities between the e. amylovora and p. syringae hrp systems in pathogenesis mechanisms are discussed.

TI  == programmed cell death: a way of life for plants.
AB  == cell death in higher plants has been widely observed in predictable patterns throughout development and in response to pathogenic infection. genetic, biochemical, and morphological evidence suggests that these cell deaths occur as  active processes and can be defined formally as examples of programmed cell death (pcd). intriguingly, plants have at least two types of pcd, an observation that is also true of pcd in animals [schwartz, l. m., smith, w.w., jones, m. e. e. & osborne, b. a. (1993) proc. natl. acad. sci. usa 90, 980-984]. thus, in plants, pcd resembles either a common form of pcd seen in animals called apoptosis or it  resembles a morphologically distinct form of cell death. the ubiquitous occurrence and necessity of pcd for plant development and defense suggest that the underlying mechanisms of regulation and execution of these processes merit further examination.

TI  == hrp gene-dependent induction of hin1: a plant gene activated rapidly by both harpins and the avrpto gene-mediated signal.
AB  == two classes of bacterial genes are involved in the elicitation of the plant hypersensitive response (hr) in resistant plants: hrp genes and avr genes. hrp genes have been shown to be involved in the production and secretion of a new class of bacterial virulence/avirulence proteins, including harpin of erwinia amylovora and harpinpss of pseudomonas syringae. the ability of avr genes in the  elicitation of the hr/resistance is dependent on functional hrp genes. the relationships between harpins and avr gene products are not known. this study investigates the plant genes induced by harpins and the effect of avr genes on the expression of such plant genes. a tobacco gene highly induced by harpins was  isolated by a subtractive hybridization method. induction of hin1 by p.s. pv. syringae 61 (pss61) was found to be dependent on functional bacterial hrp genes.  p. fluorescens (a saprophyte) or hrp mutants defective in the hrp secretion pathway did not induce hin1 significantly. a hin 1-related gene in tomato cv. rio grande-ptor was found to be rapidly induced by p. s. pv. tomato t1 (a virulent bacterium on rio grande-ptor) containing the avrpto gene, which mediates the elictation of the hr/resistance in a pto plant resistance gene-dependent manner.  the induction of hin1 by bacteria correlates with production of harpins in planta. the putative open reading frame of hin1 encodes a novel protein of 221 amino acids. the data suggest that harpins and the avrpto-mediated signal induce  a common plant gene in the elicitation of the hr.

TI  == the rsma- mutants of erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora strain ecc71 overexpress hrpnecc and elicit a hypersensitive reaction-like response in tobacco leaves.
AB  == erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora wild-type strain ecc71 does not elicit the hypersensitive reaction (hr) in tobacco leaves. by mini-tn5-km and chemical mutagenesis we have isolated rsma- mutants of ecc71 that produce high basal levels of pectate lyases, polygalacturonase, cellulase, and protease; they also are hypervirulent. the rsma- mutants, but not their parent strains, elicit an hr-like response in tobacco leaves. this reaction is characterized by the rapid appearance of water soaking followed by tissue collapse and necrosis. the affected areas remain limited to the region infiltrated with bacterial cells, and the symptoms closely resemble a typical hr, e.g., the reactions caused by pseudomonas syringae pv. pisi. moreover, low concentrations of cells of the mini-tn5-km insertion rsma- mutant, ac5070, infiltrated into tobacco leaf tissue  prevent elicitation of the rapid necrosis by ac5070 or by p. syringae pv. pisi. elicitation of the hr-like response by the mutants is not affected by the deficiency of n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone, the cell density (quorum) sensing signal. cloning and sequence analysis have disclosed that e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain ecc71 possesses a homolog of e. chrysanthemi hrpn known  to encode an elicitor of the hr; the corresponding ecc71 gene is designated hrpnecc. northern (rna) blot data show that the level of hrpnecc mrna is considerably higher in the rsma- mutants than in the rsma+ strains. moreover, a low copy plasmid carrying the rsma+ allele severely reduces the level of the hrpnecc transcripts in the rsma- mutants. these constructs, like the rsma+ e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strains, do not elicit the hr-like response. these data taken along with the effects of rsma on exoenzyme production and pathogenicity (a. chatterjee et al., 1995, appl. environ. microbiol. 61:1959-1967) demonstrate that this global regulator gene plays a critical role in plant interaction of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora.

TI  == generation of active oxygen in elicited cells of arabidopsis thaliana is mediated by a nadph oxidase-like enzyme.
AB  == suspension-cultured cells of arabidopsis thaliana generated active oxygen species (aos) (measured by luminol-dependent chemiluminescence) following challenge with  the bacterial protein elicitor harpin or the protein kinase activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. these responses were blocked by inhibitors of superoxide dismutase (sod), nadph oxidase and protein kinase. harpin treatment also resulted in an increase in cell death, a response reduced by inhibitors of aos generation  or aos scavengers. extracellular sod activity was found to be present in cell culture medium. immunoblotting of arabidopsis extracts revealed the presence of proteins immunologically related to the human neutrophil nadph oxidase complex, and cell-free reconstitution assays showed that human neutrophil cytosol combined with arabidopsis membranes could initiate superoxide generation. these data suggest that the enzyme catalysing the generation of superoxide in elicited arabidopsis cells is similar to the mammalian nadph oxidase and that a signalling cascade leading to aos generation involves protein phosphorylation.

TI  == erwinia amylovora secretes harpin via a type iii pathway and contains a homolog of yopn of yersinia spp.
AB  == type iii secretion functions in flagellar biosynthesis and in export of virulence factors from several animal pathogens, and for plant pathogens, it has been shown to be involved in the export of elicitors of the hypersensitive reaction. typified by the yop delivery system of yersinia spp., type iii secretion is sec independent and requires multiple components. sequence analysis of an 11.5-kb region of the hrp gene cluster of erwinia amylovora containing hrpi, a previously characterized type iii gene, revealed a group of eight or more type iii genes corresponding to the virb or lcrb (yscn-to-yscu) locus of yersinia spp. a homolog of another yop secretion gene, yscd, was found between hrpi and this group downstream. immediately upstream of hrpi, a homolog of yopn was discovered. yopn  is a putative sensor involved in host-cell-contact-triggered expression and transfer of protein, e.g., yope, to the host cytoplasm. in-frame deletion mutagenesis of one of the type iii genes, designated hrct, was nonpolar and resulted in a hrp- strain that produced but did not secrete harpin, an elicitor of the hypersensitive reaction that is also required for pathogenesis. cladistic  analysis of the hrpi (herein renamed hrcv) or lcrd protein family revealed two distinct groups for plant pathogens. the yersinia protein grouped more closely with the plant pathogen homologs than with homologs from other animal pathogens;  flagellar biosynthesis proteins grouped distinctly. a possible evolutionary history of type iii secretion is presented, and the potential significance of the similarity between the harpin and yop export systems is discussed, particularly with respect to a potential role for the yopn homolog in pathogenesis of plants.

TI  == hrpl activates erwinia amylovora hrp gene transcription and is a member of the ecf subfamily of sigma factors.
AB  == hrpl of erwinia amylovora ea321 encodes a 21.7-kda regulatory protein, similar to members of the ecf (extra cytoplasmic functions) subfamily of eubacterial rna polymerase sigma factors. hrpl is a single-gene operon in complementation group vi of the e. amylovora hrp gene cluster. its product is required by ea321 to elicit the hypersensitive response (hr) and to cause disease. hrpl controls the expression of five independent hrp loci, including hrpn, which encodes harpin, a  proteinaceous elicitor of the hr. hrpl is environmentally regulated, and its expression is affected by hrps, another regulatory gene of the hrp gene cluster of e. amylovora. pcpp1078, a multicopy plasmid carrying hrpl, is able to restore  hr-eliciting ability to hrps mutants. a conserved motif was identified upstream of the hrpi and hrpn operons, which are transcriptionally regulated by hrpl. this conserved motif shares a high degree of similarity with other biochemically defined or putative ecf-dependent promoter sequences, including sequences upstream of streptomyces coelicolor daga p2, pseudomonas aeruginosa algd, pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61 hrpz, and p. syringae pv. tomato avrd. in spite of the similarity between the hrpl genes of e. amylovora and p. syringae 61, no functional cross-complementation was observed.

AB  == mutants of the soft-rot pathogen erwinia chrysanthemi ec16 that are deficient in  the production of the pectate lyase isozymes pelabce can elicit the hypersensitive response (hr) in tobacco leaves. the hrpnech gene was identified in a collection of cosmids carrying e. chrysanthemi hrp genes by its hybridization with the erwinia amylovora hrpnea gene. hrpnech appears to be in a  monocistronic operon, and it encodes a predicted protein of 340 amino acids that  is glycine-rich, lacking in cysteine, and highly similar to hrpnea in its c-terminal half. escherichia coli dh5 alpha cells expressing hrpnech from the lac promoter of pbluescript ii accumulated hrpnech in inclusion bodies. the protein was readily purified from cell lysates carrying these inclusion bodies by solubilization in 4.5 m guanidine-hcl and reprecipitation upon dialysis against dilute buffer. hrpnech suspensions elicited a typical hr in tobacco leaves, and elicitor activity was heat-stable. tn5-gusa1 mutations were introduced into the cloned hrpnech and then marker-exchanged into the genomes of e. chrysanthemi strains ac4150 (wild type), cucpb5006 (delta pelabce), and cucpb5030 (delta pelabce outd::tnphoa). hrpnech::tn5-gusa1 mutations in cucpb5006 abolished the ability of the bacterium to elicit the hr in tobacco leaves unless complemented with an hrpnech subclone. an hrpnech::tn5-gusa1 mutation also reduced the ability of ac4150 to incite infections in witloof chicory leaves, but it did not reduce the size of lesions that did develop. purified hrpnech and e. chrysanthemi strains cucpb5006 and cucpb5030 elicited hr-like necrosis in leaves of tomato, pepper, african violet, petunia, and pelargonium, whereas hrpnech mutants did not.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == levansucrase (ec 2.4.1.10), an exoenzyme of pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola, was purified to homogeneity from the cell supernatant by chromatography on tmae-fraktogel and butyl-fraktogel. the enzyme has molecular masses of 45 kda under denaturing conditions and 68 kda during gel filtration of  the native form. in isoelectric focusing, active bands appeared at ph 3.55 and 3.6. maximum sucrose cleaving activities were measured at ph 5.8 to 6.6 and 60 degrees c. the enzyme was highly tolerant to denaturing agents, proteases, and repeated freezing and thawing. the molecular weight of the produced levan depended on temperature, salinity, and sucrose concentration. the enzyme had levan-degrading activity and did not accept raffinose as a substrate. comparison  of the n-terminal amino acid sequence with the predicted amino acid sequence of levansucrases from erwinia amylovora and zymomonas mobilis showed 88 and 69% similarity, respectively, in amino acids 5 to 20. no similarity could be detected to levansucrases of gram-positive bacteria in the first 20 amino acids. by comparison of all levansucrases which have been sequenced to date, the enzyme seems to be conserved in the gram-negative bacteria. the rheological behavior of  the product levan prompted a new assessment of the enzyme's role in pathogenesis. depending on formation conditions, levan solutions exclude other polymer solutions. this behavior supports the presumption that the levansucrase is important in the early phase of infection by creating a separating layer between  bacteria and plant cell wall to prevent the pathogen from recognition.

AB  == the hrp/hrma gene cluster of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae pss61 has been shown to form a minimum genetic unit sufficient to enable nonpathogenic bacteria, such as escherichia coli, to elicit the hypersensitive response associated with disease resistance. the biochemical functions of most of these genes have not been established. the nucleotide sequence of a 4.3-kb ssti-bglii fragment carrying hrp apparent translational units v, vi, and vii revealed one partial open reading frame (orf) and five complete orfs producing 35,126-, 48,866-, 17,308-, 20,482-, and 26,364-da gene products (hrpj3, j4, j5, u1, u2, respectively). the production of these proteins was confirmed by using t7 rna polymerase-directed expression. the partial orf was found to be identical to the  c terminus of hrpj2. the absence of apparent transcriptional terminators and promoters between hrpi (hrpj2), hrpj3, hrpj4, and hrpj5 together with the observation that the hrpl-dependent hrpj promoter directs expression of hrpj3-j5  indicates that these genes form a single operon controlled by the hrpl-dependent  hrpj promoter. a second hrpl-dependent promoter consensus sequence was also identified upstream of hrpu1 and demonstrated to function as a hrpl-dependent promoter, thus indicating that hrpu1, hrpu2, and additional downstream genes may  be part of a second operon. the deduced product of hrpj3 exhibits similarity to flig of salmonella typhimurium, a cytoplasmic protein that regulates flagellar rotation and biogenesis. hrpj4 shares extensive similarity with the flii family of atpase-like proteins and retains the known functional domains conserved among  this family of proteins. hrpj5 has properties similar to the s. typhimurium flij. neither hrpu1 nor hrpu2 exhibit significant similarity to known proteins. secretion of harpinpss by e. coli mc4100 transformants carrying phir11::tnphoa derivatives was blocked in hrpj4, j5, and u2 mutants. in view of the previously reported similarity of hrpj2 to the lcrd super-family that includes flha, these results predict that the gene products of the hrpj and hrpu operons form an inner membrane complex for translocation of proteins similar to that used by the flagellar biogenesis system of s. typhimurium.

TI  == hrpi of erwinia amylovora functions in secretion of harpin and is a member of a new protein family.
AB  == hrpi, a 78-kda protein, functions in the secretion of harpin, a proteinaceous elicitor of the hypersensitive response from erwinia amylovora. the predicted amino acid sequence of hrpi is remarkably similar to that of lcrd of yersinia species, the first member of a recently described protein family. other proteins  of the family are mixa from shigella flexneri, inva from salmonella typhimurium,  flha from caulobacter crescentus, hrpi from pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, hrpo from pseudomonas solanacearum, and hrpc2 from xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria. cells of e. amylovora containing mutated hrpi genes or cells of escherichia coli containing the cloned hrp gene cluster with mutated hrpi produce but do not export harpin. when similar cells with functional hrpi genes were grown at 25 degrees c, but not at 37 degrees c, harpin was exported to the culture supernatant. direct evidence that hrpi is involved in the secretion of a  virulence protein has been offered. two other loci of the hrp gene cluster are involved in the regulation of harpin, and four other loci also are involved in the secretion of harpin. since harpin and other proteins likely to be secreted by the lcrd family of proteins lack typical signal peptides, their secretion mechanism is distinct from the general protein export pathway.

TI  == nucleotide sequence and properties of the hrma locus associated with the pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61 hrp gene cluster.
AB  == the hrma locus, isolated from pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61, is essential  for phenotypic expression of the p. s. pv. syringae 61 hrp cluster in escherichia coli strains and enables bacteria carrying the hrp/hrm gene cluster to elicit the hypersensitive response (hr) associated with plant disease resistance. the phenotype of p. s. pv syringae 61 hrma mutants (pathogenicity+, delayed hr) was distinct from that of hrp mutants. the locus was localized to a 3.6-kb bamh1-ecor1 fragment whose nucleotide sequence was determined. a single open reading frame was identified that encodes for a 41,457-da protein of unknown biochemical function. production of the deduced protein product was confirmed by  using t7 rna polymerase-directed expression of the locus and n-terminal sequence  analysis of the isolated hrma. the deduced protein product did not exhibit homology with any of the characterized avr genes or the hrpn product of erwinia amylovora. transcription was shown to initiate 37 nucleotides upstream of the translational start from an apparent sigma 70 promoter. two hrp genes were shown  to act as positive transcriptional factors for hrma expression. expression of hrma in p. syringae pv. glycinea race 4 did not exhibit the phenotypic properties of an avr gene or hrpn, but suggested that this locus may serve a regulatory function. a homolog to hrma was present in strains of only three of the 23 p. syringae pathovars tested.

TI  == pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae harpinpss: a protein that is secreted via the hrp pathway and elicits the hypersensitive response in plants.
AB  == the ability of p. syringae to elicit the hypersensitive response in nonhost plants or pathogenesis in hosts is controlled by hrp genes. the p. syringae pv. syringae 61 hrpz gene encodes harpinpss, a 34.7 kd extracellular protein that elicits hypersensitive necrosis in tobacco and other plants. harpinpss is heat stable, glycine rich, dissimilar in amino acid sequence to any known protein, produced only in apoplastic fluid-mimicking minimal media, and secreted in a hrph-dependent manner. the carboxy-terminal 148 amino acid portion of harpinpss contains two directly repeated sequences of ggglgtp and qtgt and is sufficient and necessary for elicitor activity. the necrosis elicited by harpinpss is an active response of the plant, which can be inhibited by alpha-amanitin, cycloheximide, lanthanum chloride, or sodium vanadate.

TI  == homology between the hrpo protein of pseudomonas solanacearum and bacterial proteins implicated in a signal peptide-independent secretion mechanism.
AB  == a region of approximately 22 kb of dna defines the large hrp gene cluster of strain gmi1000 of pseudomonas solanacearum. the majority of mutants that map to this region have lost the ability to induce disease symptoms on tomato plants and are no longer able to elicit a hypersensitive reaction (hr) on tobacco, a non-host plant. in this study we present the complementation analysis and nucleotide sequence of a 4772 bp region of this hrp gene cluster. three complete  open reading frames (orfs) are predicted within this region. the corresponding putative proteins, hrpn, hrpo and hpap, have predicted sizes of 357, 690 and 197  amino acids, respectively, and predicted molecular weights of 38,607, 73,990 and  21,959 dalton, respectively. hrpn and hrpo are both predicted to be hydrophobic proteins with potential membrane-spanning domains and hpap is rich in proline residues. a mutation in hpap (for hrp associated) does not affect the hr on tobacco or the disease on tomato plants. none of the proteins is predicted to have an n-terminal signal sequence, which would have indicated that the proteins  are exported. considerable sequence similarities were found between hrpo and eight known or predicted prokaryotic proteins: lcrd of yersinia pestis and y. enterocolitica, flbf of caulobacter crescentus, flha of bacillus subtilis, mxia and virh of shigella flexneri, inva of salmonella typhimurium and hrpc2 of xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria. these homologies suggest that certain hrp genes of phytopathogenic bacteria code for components of a secretory system, which is related to the systems for secretion of flagellar proteins, ipa proteins of shigella flexneri and the yersinia yop proteins. furthermore, these homologous proteins have the common feature of being implicated in a distinct secretory mechanism, which does not require the cleavage of a signal peptide. the sequence  similarity between hrpo and hrpc2 is particularly high (66% identity and 81% similarity) and the amino acid sequence comparison between these two proteins presented here reveals the first such sequence similarity to be shown between hrp proteins of p. solanacearum and x. campestris. an efflux of plant electrolytes was found to be associated with the interactions between p. solanacearum and both tomato and tobacco leaves. this phenomenon may be part of the mechanism by which  hrp gene products control and determine plant-bacterial interactions, since hrpo  mutants induced levels of leakage which were significantly lower than those induced by the wild type on each plant.

TI  == nucleotide sequence analysis of a transposon (tn5393) carrying streptomycin resistance genes in erwinia amylovora and other gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a class ii tn3-type transposable element, designated tn5393 and located on plasmid pea34 from streptomycin-resistant strain ca11 of erwinia amylovora, was identified by its ability to move from pea34 to different sites in plasmids pgem3zf(+) and pucd800. nucleotide sequence analysis reveals that tn5393 consists of 6,705 bp with 81-bp terminal inverted repeats and generates 5-bp duplications  of the target dna following insertion. tn5393 contains open reading frames that encode a putative transposase (tnpa) and resolvase (tnpr) of 961 and 181 amino acids, respectively. the two open reading frames are separated by a putative recombination site (res) consisting of 194 bp. two streptomycin resistance genes, stra and strb, were identified on the basis of their dna sequence homology to streptomycin resistance genes in plasmid rsf1010. stra is separated from tnpr by  a 1.2-kb insertion element designated is1133. the tnpa-res-tnpr region of tn5393  was detected in pseudomonas syringae pv. papulans psp36 and in many other gram-negative bacteria harboring stra and strb. except for some strains of erwinia herbicola, these other gram-negative bacteria lacked insertion sequence is1133. the prevalence of stra and strb could be accounted for by transposition of tn5393 to conjugative plasmids that are then disseminated widely among gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == hrp genes of pseudomonas solanacearum are homologous to pathogenicity determinants of animal pathogenic bacteria and are conserved among plant pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the majority of bacterial plant diseases are caused by members of three bacterial genera, pseudomonas, xanthomonas, and erwinia. the identification and characterization of mutants that have lost the abilities to provoke disease symptoms on a compatible host and to induce a defensive hypersensitive reaction (hr) on an incompatible host have led to the discovery of clusters of hrp genes (hypersensitive reaction and pathogenicity) in phytopathogenic bacteria from each of these genera. here, we report that predicted protein sequences of three hrp genes from pseudomonas solanacearum show remarkable sequence similarity to key virulence determinants of animal pathogenic bacteria of the genus yersinia. we also demonstrate dna homologies between p. solanacearum hrp genes and hrp gene clusters of p. syringae pv. phaseolicola, xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris,  and erwinia amylovora. by comparing the role of the yersinia determinants in the  control of the extracellular production of proteins required for pathogenicity, we propose that hrp genes code for an export system that might be conserved among many diverse bacterial pathogens of plants and animals but that is distinct from  the general export pathway.

TI  == harpin, elicitor of the hypersensitive response produced by the plant pathogen erwinia amylovora.
AB  == a proteinaceous elicitor of the plant defense reaction known as the hypersensitive response was isolated from erwinia amylovora, the bacterium that causes fire blight of pear, apple, and other rosaceous plants. the elicitor, named harpin, is an acidic, heat-stable, cell-envelope-associated protein with an apparent molecular weight of 44 kilodaltons. harpin caused tobacco leaf lamina to collapse and caused an increase in the ph of bathing solutions of suspension-cultured tobacco cells. the gene encoding harpin (hrpn) was located in the 40-kilobase hrp gene cluster of e. amylovora, sequenced, and mutated with tn5tac1. the hrpn mutants were not pathogenic to pear, did not elicit the hypersensitive response, and did not produce harpin.

TI  == biolistic transformation of prokaryotes: factors that affect biolistic transformation of very small cells.
AB  == five bacterial species were transformed using particle gun-technology. no pretreatment of cells was necessary. physical conditions (helium pressure, target cell distance and gap distance) and biological conditions (cell growth phase, osmoticum concentration, and cell density) were optimized for biolistic transformation of escherichia coli and these conditions were then used to successfully transform agrobacterium tumefaciens, erwinia amylovora, erwinia stewartii and pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. transformation rates for e. coli were 10(4) per plate per 0.8 micrograms dna. although transformation rates for the other species were low (less than 10(2) per plate per 0.8 micrograms dna), successful transformation without optimization for each species tested suggests wide utility of biolistic transformation of prokaryotes. e. coli has proven to be a useful model system to determine the effects of relative humidity, particle size and particle coating on efficiency of biolistic transformation.

TI  == cloning of a large gene cluster involved in erwinia amylovora cfbp1430 virulence.
AB  == phage mudiipr13 insertional mutagenesis of erwinia amylovora cfbp1430 allowed us  to isolate 6900 independent cmr mutants. the frequencies of different auxotrophs  in this population indicated that mudiipr13 had inserted randomly in e. amylovora. screening of 3500 cmr mutants on (i) apple calli and (ii) pear and apple seedlings led to the isolation of 19 non-pathogenic prototrophic single mutants, four of which expressed a lacz+ hybrid protein. expression of the fusion proteins was temperature sensitive. the 19 mutants could be separated into two classes according to their behaviour on tobacco: 13 were unable to elicit the hypersensitive response on tobacco (hrp-) while six still could (dsp-). the 19 mudiipr13 insertions all mapped in the same virulence region. the mudiipr13 insertions of hrp- mutants were all clustered on the left part of this region, while the mudiipr13 insertions of dsp- mutants were located on the right part. all of the mutants except one, which proved to have a large deletion of the entire virulence region, could be complemented functionally by cosmids from an e. amylovora cfbp1430 genomic library. no hybridization was observed between the cosmid ppv130, which complemented 12 hrp::mudiipr13 mutations, and the hrp genes  from pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola (lindgren et al., 1986), p. syringae pv. tomato (n.j. panopoulos, unpublished data) or p. solanacearum (boucher et al., 1987). further analysis of the large virulence region will allow mapping of  the border of the virulence region and facilitate the study of the function and regulation of the hrp and dsp genes.

TI  == competitive exclusion of epiphytic bacteria by icepseudomonas syringae mutants.
AB  == the growth of ice nucleation-active and near-isogenic ice nucleation-deficient (ice) pseudomonas syringae strains coexisting on leaf surfaces was examined to determine whether competition was sufficient to account for antagonism of phylloplane bacteria. the ice nucleation frequency spectra of 46 icep. syringae mutants, obtained after mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate, differed both quantitatively and qualitatively, but the mutants could be grouped into four distinct phenotypic classes. the numbers of ice nucleation-active bacteria and ice nuclei active at -5 degrees c were reduced on plants colonized with icep. syringae mutant strains before challenge inoculations with an icep. syringae wild-type strain. frost injury to plants pretreated with icep. syringae strains was also reduced significantly compared with that to control plants and was correlated with the population size of the icep. syringae strain and with the numbers of ice nuclei active at -5 degrees c. an icep. syringae strain colonized  leaves, flowers, and young fruit of pears in field experiments and significantly  reduced the colonization of these tissues by icep. syringae strains and erwinia amylovora as compared with untreated trees.
