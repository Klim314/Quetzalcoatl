TI  == the microbial epidemiology of breast implant infections in a regional referral centre for plastic and reconstructive surgery in the south of france.
AB  == background: breast implant infections are usually caused by staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. gram-negative bacilli are rarely reported to be involved in breast implant infections. methods: thirty-seven cases of microbiologically confirmed breast implant infection managed from january 2008 to june 2012 in the study centre were reviewed, including 10 cases from the study centre itself and 27 cases from private clinics in the region. results: the prevalence of breast implant infection in the study centre was 0.74% of breast implantation, i.e., 3.23% in breast reconstruction for breast cancer and 0.27% in aesthetic breast augmentation (p=0.0002). of the 37 cases, 30% had undergone radiotherapy and 11% had undergone a lymph node dissection. s. aureus was identified in 18 cases, gram-negative bacilli in 10 cases, coagulase-negative staphylococci in eight cases, anaerobic bacteria in eight cases, and streptococci in three cases. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the second most commonly identified pathogen. staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequent coagulase-negative staphylococcus species. in addition to propionibacterium acnes and actinomyces neuii, other facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria have not been reported before, e.g., bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, corynebacterium simulans, dermabacter hominis, finegoldia magna, and peptoniphilus harei. seventy-percent of cases were treated by immediate implant removal. all cases treated only with antibiotics were treated with surgery at the second visit. conclusions: the microbiological epidemiology was noted by an increasing the proportion of gram-negative bacteria  and anaerobic bacteria detected with the advent of maldi-tof ms and molecular identification for diagnosis.

TI  == influence of complement on neutrophil extracellular trap release induced by bacteria.
AB  == background and objectives: neutrophil extracellular trap (net) release has generally been studied in the absence of serum, or at low concentrations of untreated or heat-inactivated serum. the influence of serum complement on net release therefore remains unclear. we examined the dna release induced by staphylococcus aureus and three oral bacteria: actinomyces viscosus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincettii. material and methods: bacteria-stimulated net release from the neutrophils of healthy donors was measured fluorometrically. various complement containing and complement blocking conditions were used, including heat inactivation of the serum and antibody blockade of complement receptors 1 (cr1, cd35) and 3 (cr3, cd11b/cd18). results: while the presence of serum markedly enhanced net release induced by s. aureus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and to a lesser extent by a. viscosus, there was no enhancement of net release induced by  f. nucleatum. the serum-mediated enhancement of net release by a. actinomycetemcomitans was neutralized by heat inactivation of serum complement, while this was not the case for s. aureus. blockade of cr1, significantly reduced net release induced by s. aureus, a. actinomycetemcomitans and a. viscosus, while blockade of cr3, had no effect. however, opsonization of s. aureus with antibodies may also have contributed to the enhancing effect of serum, independently of complement, in that purified igg promoted net release. conclusions: in conclusion, complement opsonization promotes net release induced  by a variety of bacteria, including a. actinomycetemcomitans, and cr1 plays a dominant role in the process. complement consumption or deficiency may compromise netosis induced by some bacterial species, including a. actinomycetemcomitans. within biofilms, the complement-inactivating abilities of some bacteria may protect other species against netosis, while these are more vulnerable when adopting a planktonic lifestyle.

TI  == prevalence of canaliculitis after smartplug insertion during long-term follow-up.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the long-term prevalence of canaliculitis associated with the use of smartplugs. methods: this retrospective study included 42 eyes of 25 dry eye patients at our institution who received a smartplug insertion between 2004 and 2008. irrigation of the lacrimal system was performed in all patients prior to smartplug insertion to ensure the patency of the system. the median follow-up time was 7.9 (5.6-10.5) years after plug insertion. results: six patients (seven eyes) of 25 patients (42 eyes) developed canaliculitis. the prevalence of canaliculitis per patient was 24%, and the prevalence of canaliculitis per smartplug was 16.6%. the median time from smartplug insertion to the onset of canaliculitis was 4.7 (1.4-6.0) years. the median age of the affected patients was 61.5 (36-74) years. five of these patients were women and one was man. the pathogens were identified as actinomyces in four eyes and as staphylococcus aureus in three eyes. in five patients (six eyes), the canaliculitis was resolved by the application of topical antibiotics and repeated lacrimal irrigations with antibiotics and povidone-iodine. in one patient, a canaliculotomy was necessary to cure the condition. conclusions: the late onset of complications after smartplug insertion requires long-term observation to identify the majority of complications associated with smartplugs. in our patients with a follow-up of up to 10.5 years, the use of smartplugs was associated with the highest prevalence of canaliculitis published thus far.

TI  == actinomyces odontolyticus: rare etiology for purulent pericarditis.
AB  == purulent pericarditis is one of the most common causes of cardiac tamponade and if left untreated has a mortality of 100%. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumonia have been implicated as the main etiology of purulent pericardial effusion followed by fungi and anaerobic sources. actinomyces odontolyticus pericardial involvement has been reported in the literature only once. to our knowledge, this is the first fatal case of a. odontolyticus purulent pericarditis in the absence of periodontal disease.

TI  == a commentary on the disparate perspectives of clinical microbiologists and surgeons: ad hoc antimicrobial use.
AB  == prosthetic joints and other orthopedic implants have improved quality of life for patients world-wide and the use of such devices is increasing. however, while infection rates subsequent to associated surgery are relatively low (<3%), the consequences of incidence are considerable, encompassing morbidity (including amputation) and mortality in addition to significant social and economic costs. emphasis, therefore, has been placed on mitigating microbial risk, with clinical  microbiologists and surgeons utilizing rapidly evolving molecular laboratory techniques in detection and diagnosis of infection, which still occurs despite sophisticated patient management. multidisciplinary approaches are regularly adopted to achieve this. in this commentary, we describe an unusual case of actinomyces infection in total hip arthroplasty and, in that context, describe the perspectives of the clinical microbiology and surgical teams and how they contrasted. more specifically, this case demonstrates an ad hoc approach to structured eradication of biofilms and intracellular bacteria related to biomaterials, as reflected in early usage of linezolid. this is a complex topic and, as described in this case, such accelerated treatment can be effective. this commentary focuses on the merits of such inadvisable use of potent antimicrobials amid the risk of diminishing valuable antimicrobial efficacy, albeit resulting in desirable patient outcomes.

TI  == molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old tunisian children.
AB  == the occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old tunisian children was investigated. samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). genomic dna was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. all samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic dna collected from carious lesions. other prevalent species were candida spp (63%), streptococcus salivarius (59%) and streptococcus oralis (42%). the frequency of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. pathogenic bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. frequency of porphyromonas endodontali, actinomyces radicidentis and treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. pcr analysis of genomic dna detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. in addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (s.  mutans, s. salivarius, l. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.

TI  == an assessment of the effectiveness of mechanical and chemical cleaning of essix orthodontic retainer.
AB  == objectives: to determine the effectiveness of mechanical and chemical cleaning on the removal of microorganisms from essix orthodontic retainers. design: in vitro  laboratory study. setting: department of orthodontics and microbiology, eastman dental institute, university college london, uk. methods: study 1: 120 essix retainers were divided into four cleaning groups. the effectiveness of each cleaning method to remove a single species biofilm of streptococcus mutans from the retainer was assessed. study 2: 140 essix retainers were divided into four study groups (brushing with fluoride toothpaste, chlorhexidine gel, immersion in  chlorhexidine solution only and a control) to investigate the chemical and mechanical cleaning of the multispecies biolfilm of (streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans). relevant results: in study 1, brushing with toothpaste resulted in 99% reduction of streptococcus mutans. in study 2, all three cleaning methods recorded similarly statistically significant reductions in colony forming units per millilitre compared to the control. there were no statistically significant differences between any of the cleaning groups for any of the microorganisms except mrsa-16. for mrsa-16, chlorhexidine mouthwash and gel were significantly more potent in eliminating the microorganism than the fluoride toothpaste. conclusions: all three cleaning methods effectively removed 99% of microorganisms from the essix retainers. brushing with fluoride toothpaste can therefore be confirmed as an effective method for cleaning retainers in most circumstances. the use of chlorhexidine gel or mouthwash is recommended in patients where bacterial infection has to be avoided due to immunosuppression or other reasons.

TI  == trends of sapho therapy: should we be content?
AB  == the interventional studies with bone biopsy of the sapho lesions and microbiological investigation are a significant addition to a long range of publications showing an association of sapho with propionibacterium acnes. infectious agents isolated from sapho patients have merited special attention for many years. their possible etiological role is supported by the pathogen isolation from different sites: anterior chest wall, spine, synovial fluid, bone  tissue, and skin pustules. a range of pathogens have been found, including staphylococcus aureus, hemophilusparainfluenzae, actinomyces, and even treponemapallidum. p. acnes is a much more frequent pathogen and plays a particular role. the article focus is to emphasize limited use of interventional  method to verify infection ethology of sapho in publications last two years. successful therapy may be really effective and eradicative on a basis of the pathogen identification.randomized control studies are needed to confirm the effects of antibiotic therapy.

TI  == subgingival microbial profiles of generalized aggressive and chronic periodontal  diseases.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to distinguish between generalized aggressive (gagp) and chronic periodontitis (cp) based on the subgingival microbial profiles predominant in these diseases. methods: two-hundred and sixty  subjects, 75 with gagp and 185 with cp were recruited. full-mouth clinical measurements were recorded. individual subgingival plaque samples were taken from 7 sites per subject and analyzed for the prevalence and levels of 51 species by chequerboard. differences between groups were examined by the mann-whitney test.  associations between bacterial species and gagp were examined by logistic regression analysis. results: actinomyces gerensceriae, actinomyces israelli, eubacterium nodatum and propionibacterium acnes were detected in significantly greater counts in gagp, whereas capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium periodonticum, staphylococcus aureus and veillonella parvula were more predominant in cp patients (adjusted p < 0.001). e. nodatum (at mean levels >/=4  x 10(5)) increased significantly the probability of a subject being diagnosed with gagp than cp (or 2.44 [0.96-6.20]), whereas p. gingivalis (or 0.34 [0.11-0.93]) and t. denticola (or 0.35 [0.11-0.94]) were associated with cp. conclusions: very few subgingival species differed in prevalence and/or levels between gagp and cp in this sample population. in particular, e. nodatum was strongly related to gagp, whereas p. gingivalis and t. denticola were associated  with cp.

TI  == two autonomous structural modules in the fimbrial shaft adhesin fima mediate actinomyces interactions with streptococci and host cells during oral biofilm development.
AB  == by combining x-ray crystallography and modelling, we describe here the atomic structure of distinct adhesive moieties of fima, the shaft fimbrillin of actinomyces type 2 fimbriae, which uniquely mediates the receptor-dependent intercellular interactions between actinomyces and oral streptococci as well as host cells during the development of oral biofilms. the fima adhesin is built with three igg-like domains, each of which harbours an intramolecular isopeptide  bond, previously described in several gram-positive pilins. genetic and biochemical studies demonstrate that although these isopeptide bonds are dispensable for fimbrial assembly, cell-cell interactions and biofilm formation,  they contribute significantly to the proteolytic stability of fima. remarkably, fima harbours two autonomous adhesive modules, which structurally resemble the staphylococcus aureus cna b domain. each isolated module can bind the plasma glycoprotein asialofetuin as well as the polysaccharide receptors present on the  surface of oral streptococci and epithelial cells. thus, fima should serve as an  excellent paradigm for the development of therapeutic strategies and elucidating  the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between cellular receptors and gram-positive fimbriae.

TI  == primary chest wall abscess caused by escherichia coli costochondritis.
AB  == chest wall abscess may occur as primary infection or secondary to open trauma or  thoracic wall surgery. the authors describe an unusual case of escherichia coli costochondritis occurring 2 months after a blunt chest wall trauma. primary chest wall abscess due to e coli costochondritis has been previously reported only twice occurring after urinary tract infection. all other very few reports of e coli costochondritis have been reported only after thoracic surgical procedures.  an english literature review of primary chest wall abscess showed that 4 pathogens are responsible for the majority of cases: actinomyces, staphylococcus  aureus, candida albicans and salmonella. c albicans costochondritis was most commonly reported among heroin addicts. the appearance of a growing chest wall mass should always prompt a search for an infectious cause, even with little or no systemic signs and symptoms.

AB  == the purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether adding silver-zeolite (sz) to mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) would enhance the antimicrobial activity of mta against staphylococcus aureus (atcc #25923), enterococcus faecalis (atcc #29212), escherichia coli (atcc#25922), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc #27853), candida albicans (atcc #90028), porphyromonas gingivalis (atcc #33277), actinomyces israelii (atcc #12102), and prevotella intermedia (atcc# 15032). sz was added at 0.2% and 2% mass fraction concentration to mta powder. the control group was mta powder with no sz. the antimicrobial effect test was accomplished by placing freshly mixed mta specimens on agar plates inoculated with microorganisms and comparing the zones of inhibition at 24, 48, and 72 h. the amounts of silver ion release from mta specimens were measured with atomic absorption spectrophotometry at 10-min, 24-, 48-, and 72-h periods. the ph of mta specimens was measured with a ph meter at 10-min, 24-, 48-, and 72-h periods. mta with 2% and 0.2% sz specimens showed inhibitory effects on some microorganisms at all time periods, whereas no antimicrobial activity showed for p. intermedia and  a. israelii. mta without sz inhibited c. albicans, e. coli, and p. intermedia. the highest silver release was detected in 2% sz mta at 24 h. the incorporation of sz may enhance the antimicrobial activity of mta.

TI  == microbiologic results after non-surgical erbium-doped:yttrium, aluminum, and garnet laser or air-abrasive treatment of peri-implantitis: a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study is to assess clinical and microbiologic effects of the non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis lesions using either an erbium-doped:yttrium, aluminum, and garnet (er:yag) laser or an air-abrasive subgingival polishing method. methods: in a 6-month clinical trial, 42 patients with peri-implantitis were treated at one time with an er:yag laser or an air-abrasive device. routine clinical methods were used to monitor clinical conditions. baseline and 6-month intraoral radiographs were assessed with a software program. the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method was used to assess 74 bacterial species from the site with the deepest probing depth (pd) at  the implant. non-parametric tests were applied to microbiology data. results: pd  reductions (mean +/- sd) were 0.9 +/- 0.8 mm and 0.8 +/- 0.5 mm in the laser and  air-abrasive groups, respectively (not significant). no baseline differences in bacterial counts between groups were found. in the air-abrasive group, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus anaerobius were found at lower counts at 1 month after therapy (p <0.001) and with lower counts in the laser group for fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme (p = 0.002), and fusobacterium nucleatum nucleatum (p = 0.002). both treatments failed to reduce bacterial counts at 6 months. porphyromonas gingivalis counts were higher in cases with progressive peri-implantitis (p <0.001). conclusions: at 1 month, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, and s. anaerobius were reduced in the air-abrasive group,  and fusobacterium spp. were reduced in the laser group. six-month data demonstrated that both methods failed to reduce bacterial counts. clinical improvements were limited.

TI  == structure
AB  == all bacteria, both pathogenic and saprophytic, are unicellular organisms that reproduce by binary fission. most bacteria are capable of independent metabolic existence and growth, but species of chlamydia and rickettsia are obligately intracellular organisms. bacterial cells are extremely small and are most conveniently measured in microns (10-6 m). they range in size from large cells such as bacillus anthracis (1.0 to 1.3 microm x 3 to 10 microm) to very small cells such as pasteurella tularensis (0.2 x 0.2 to 0.7 microm) mycoplasmas (atypical pneumonia group) are even smaller, measuring 0.1 to 0.2 microm in diameter. bacteria therefore have a surface-to-volume ratio that is very high: about 100,000. bacteria have characteristic shapes. the common microscopic morphologies are cocci (round or ellipsoidal cells, such as staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus, respectively); rods, such as bacillus and clostridium species;  long, filamentous branched cells, such as actinomyces species; and comma-shaped and spiral cells, such as vibrio cholerae and treponema pallidum, respectively. the arrangement of cells is also typical of various species or groups of bacteria (fig. 2-1). some rods or cocci characteristically grow in chains; some, such as staphylococcus aureus, form grapelike clusters of spherical cells; some round cocci form cubic packets. bacterial cells of other species grow separately. the microscopic appearance is therefore valuable in classification and diagnosis. the higher resolving power of the electron microscope not only magnifies the typical  shape of a bacterial cell but also clearly resolves its prokaryotic organization  (fig. 2-2).

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == cutaneous granular bacteriosis, a rarely diagnosed infection of the head and the  neck.
AB  == a young man presented with a large multilobulated and mutilating tumour of the scalp, which had been relapsing for years. histological examination of a biopsy from the lesion revealed chronic inflammation with granulation tissue and presence of granules with eosinophilic periphery, which was positive for gram, grocott and periodic-acid-schiff stains. a large excision was performed. cultures grew staphylococcus aureus. the patient was treated with penicillin g, but 4 weeks after the start of treatment, new small nodules appeared over the same area. all these new nodules disappeared within 2 weeks the addition of clindamycin and cotrimoxazole. this triple antibiotic treatment was carried on for 18 months, and the patient remained disease-free after a follow-up of 4 years. although the lesions were clinically and histologically suggestive of actinomycosis, culture revealed that they were caused by a completely different organism. we suggest grouping such lesions under a single term "granular bacteriosis" and combining surgery with broad-spectrum antibiotics covering actinomyces species and botryomycosis-causing organisms (mainly staphylococcus).

TI  == pathological and bacteriological studies of hydrosalpinx in buffaloes.
AB  == the objectives of the present study were to investigate the bacteria accompanying hydrosalpinx of the buffalo cow and investigate the correlation between bacterial infection of the uterus and hydrosalpinx. buffalo cows' reproductive tracts were  collected from mosul abattoir. a total 385 uterine samples were examined of which 25 were having hydrosalpinx. swabs for bacteriology, fluid for cytology and biopsies for histopathology were collected from the hydrosalpinx and the uterus from each samples included in this study. results of this study indicated high prevalence of hydrosalpinx (6.5%) including unilateral (n = 19; 76%) and bilateral (n = 6; 24%) hydrosalpinx. although 16 samples (64%) of the hydrosalpinx samples had no bacterial growth, the most prevalent bacteria recovered from hydrosalpinx were corynebacterium hemolyticum and actinomyces bovis, 42.8% and 28.6%, respectively. the most prevalent bacteria in the uterus were archanobacterium pyogenes (18.5%), staphylococcus aureus (14.8%), and listeria monocytogenes (11.0%). higher rates of leukocytes infiltration (p < 0.01) were observed in the uterine discharge than hydrosalpinx. a significant (p  < 0.01) increase in lymphocytes was found in uterine discharge. microscopic examination of the hydrosalpinx showed mucosal atrophy and dilatation of oviductal lumen without any signs of inflammation. it could be concluded that there is no correlation between bacteria isolated from uterus and hydrosalpinx. no association was found between bacteriological cultures and hydrosalpinx. inflammation of the uterine tissue could be extended to utero-tubal junction producing local inflammation resulting in fibrosis and tubal obstruction. the obstruction in the lumen of the oviducts resulted in accumulation of fluid.

TI  == antibacterial effects of three experimental quaternary ammonium salt (qas) monomers on bacteria associated with oral infections.
AB  == the aim of this study was to test the antibacterial effects of three experimental quaternary ammonium salt monomers in order to evaluate their potential applications as dental materials. in vitro susceptibility testing of the monomers was performed by the broth dilution method on bacteria associated with oral infections: streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, actinomyces viscosus atcc 15987, staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 and lactobacillus casei atcc 393. the time-kill  kinetics of the monomer with relatively higher antibacterial activity against s.  mutans were also investigated. it was found that all the tested bacteria strains  were susceptible to the three monomers, among which methacryloxylethyl cetyl ammonium chloride (dmae-cb) exhibited the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations, ranging from 1.2 to 4.8 microg/ml. the time-kill curve showed that dmae-cb achieved 99.44% killing at 19.2 microg/ml (4 times the minimal bactericidal concentration) against s. mutans after 1 min and 100% killing within 10 min of contact. this result indicates that the quaternary ammonium salt monomer dmae-cb may be a candidate antibacterial agent for incorporation into dental restorative materials.

TI  == effects of low-energy shock waves on oral bacteria.
AB  == we have recently demonstrated that extracorporeal shock-wave therapy (eswt) is effective in promoting the healing of dermal wounds and in regenerating alveolar  bone lost through periodontal disease. the objective of the present study was to  determine any antibacterial effect of eswt on oral bacteria. monoculture suspensions of 6 bacterial species were treated with 100 to 500 pulses of eswt at energy flux densities (efd) of 0.12 mj/mm(2), 0.22 mj/mm(2), and 0.3 mj/mm(2). following treatment, aliquots were plated for viability determination and compared with untreated controls. eswt showed a significant microbicidal effect for streptococcus mutans and an unencapsulated strain of porphyromonas gingivalis following as few as 100 pulses at 0.3 mj/mm(2) (p <or= 0.001). in addition, a significant disruption of bacterial aggregates was observed at lower efds. no significant reduction in viability was observed for all other bacteria at efds and pulses tested (p > 0.05). these findings suggest that low-energy eswt may be  bactericidal for selected oral bacteria.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  == human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals,  including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.

TI  == empyema necessitatis due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus: case report and review of the literature.
AB  == empyema necessitatis is a rare complication of empyema in which the pleural infection spreads outside of the pleural space to involve the soft tissues of the chest wall. most cases of empyema necessitatis are related to mycobacterium tuberculosis and, less commonly, to actinomyces spp. and streptococcus spp. staphylococcus aureus has rarely been reported as the causative agent of empyema  necessitatis, with the majority of s. aureus isolates being methicillin sensitive. only two cases of empyema necessitatis due to methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) have been reported in the medical literature. we report the case of a 59-year-old caucasian male who presented to our institution with complaints of  pain in and swelling of his left upper chest of 2-months duration. a computed tomography scan of the chest showed an 8.1- by 6.5-cm lesion which extended from  the left upper lobe of the lung into the extrathoracic soft tissues beneath the left upper pectoralis muscle. a wedge resection of the left upper lung lobe revealed lung tissue with an organized pneumonia-like pattern associated with marked acute pleuritis. blood and urine cultures and cultures of the left chest soft tissue mass grew mrsa. the patient was successfully treated with vancomycin  followed by a 10-day outpatient course of ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. this case represents an extremely rare manifestation of an increasingly dangerous bacterial pathogen.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == activity of an antimicrobial peptide mimetic against planktonic and biofilm cultures of oral pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides (amps) are naturally occurring, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents that have recently been examined for their utility as therapeutic antibiotics. unfortunately, they are expensive to produce and are often sensitive to protease digestion. to address this problem, we have examined  the activity of a peptide mimetic whose design was based on the structure of magainin, exhibiting its amphiphilic structure. we demonstrate that this compound, meta-phenylene ethynylene (mpe), exhibits antimicrobial activity at nanomolar concentrations against a variety of bacterial and candida species found in oral infections. since streptococcus mutans, an etiological agent of dental caries, colonizes the tooth surface and forms a biofilm, we quantified the activity of this compound against s. mutans growing under conditions that favor biofilm formation. our results indicate that mpe can prevent the formation of a biofilm at nanomolar concentrations. incubation with 5 nm mpe prevents further growth of the biofilm, and 100 nm mpe reduces viable bacteria in the biofilm by 3 logs. structure-function analyses suggest that mpe inhibits the bioactivity of lipopolysaccharide and binds dna at equimolar ratios, suggesting that it may act  both as a membrane-active molecule, similar to magainin, and as an intracellular  antibiotic, similar to other amps. we conclude that mpe and similar molecules display great potential for development as therapeutic antimicrobials.

TI  == production of antagonistic substance by eikenella corrodens isolated from the oral cavity of human beings with and without periodontal disease.
AB  == aims: antagonistic abilities may confer ecological advantages for micro-organisms in competitive ecosystems. however, reports regarding this phenomenon in eikenella corrodens are not available. methods and results: nineteen e. corrodens strains, isolated from the oral cavity of human beings without periodontal disease (n = 5) and with aggressive (n = 9) and chronic (n = 5) periodontitis, as well as a reference strain (e. corrodens atcc23834), were evaluated for antagonistic activity. the following indicators were used: porphyromonas gingivalis fdc381, prevotella intermedia atcc25611, actinomyces israelii atcc12102, eubacterium lentum atcc25559, peptostreptococcus anaerobius atcc27337, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans fdcy4, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc10953, streptococcus sanguinis atcc10557, streptococcus uberis atcc9927, streptococcus mutans im/ufrj, staphylococcus aureus atcc33591 and candida albicans atcc18804. all the strains showed antagonism against at least one of the indicator strains.  this phenomenon was more frequently observed for strains isolated from patients with chronic periodontitis (36.4%), than those from healthy subjects (20.6%) and  those with aggressive periodontitis (10.8%). conclusions: the heterogeneous antagonistic spectrum exhibited by e. corrodens isolates suggests their ability to produce more than one antagonistic substance, whose ecological relevance is yet to be demonstrated. significance and impact of the study: this is the first description of antagonistic compound production by e. corrodens and its relationships with the clinical status of the patients.

TI  == induced production of emericellamides a and b from the marine-derived fungus emericella sp. in competing co-culture.
AB  == induction of the production of emericellamides a and b (1, 2), by the marine-derived fungus emericella sp., was observed during co-culture with the marine actinomycete salinispora arenicola. the planar structures of these new cyclic depsipeptides, which incorporate 3-hydroxy-2,4-dimethyldecanoic acid and 3-hydroxy-2,4,6-trimethyldodecanoic acid, were assigned by combined chemical and  spectral methods. the absolute configurations of the amino acids, and those of the chiral centers on the side chain, were established by application of the marfey's method, by j-based configuration analysis, and by application of the modified mosher method. emericellamides a and b show modest antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus with mic values of 3.8 and 6.0 microm, respectively.

TI  == association between commensal bacteria and opportunistic pathogens in the dental  plaque of elderly individuals.
AB  == opportunistic infections in the oral cavity of the elderly may increase the incidence of systemic disease. the objective of this study was to investigate the differences in the oral bacterial flora between dependent elderly (inpatients) and independent elderly (community-dwelling residents). after multiple variables  were taken into account, inpatients had significantly lower detection rates than  community-dwelling residents for alpha-streptococci (p < 0.001) and neisseria (p  0.004), and higher detection rates for pseudomonas aeruginosa (p 0.024), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (p 0.011) and actinomyces spp. (p 0.005). among inpatients, the requirement for a high degree of care was related negatively to detection of alpha-streptococci, but was related significantly to detection of p. aeruginosa (p 0.018) or mrsa (p 0.004). tube-fed inpatients had a significantly lower detection rate for alpha-streptococci (p 0.041) and a higher detection rate for p. aeruginosa (p 0.004) than those who did not require tube feeding. inpatients with a history of antibiotic use had a significantly lower detection rate for alpha-streptococci (p 0.049) and a higher  detection rate for mrsa (p 0.007) than those without a history of antibiotic use. the detection rates for p. aeruginosa or mrsa in inpatients without alpha-streptococci were higher than in inpatients with alpha-streptococci after controlling for age and gender (p. aeruginosa, p 0.006; mrsa, p 0.001). overall,  detection of alpha-streptococci had an inverse correlation with the detection of  p. aeruginosa and mrsa in the oral cavity and is likely to be an indicator of pathogenic bacterial infection.

TI  == antibacterial activities of inorganic agents on six bacteria associated with oral infections by two susceptibility tests.
AB  == the antibacterial effects of six inorganic antibacterial agents were assessed using broth dilution and agar dilution tests on six pathogenic bacteria associated with oral infectious diseases: streptococcus mutans (atcc 25175), s. mutans (ingbritt), actinomyces viscosus (atcc 15987), lactobacillus casei (atcc 393), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213) and candida albicans (atcc 90028). the results of the broth dilution test were significantly lower than those of the agar dilution test (f=38.290; p<0.01). the six inorganic agents notably inhibited the growth of tested common oral bacteria in vitro. among them, longbei inorganic antibiotic powder was the strongest antibacterial agent, followed by zno whisker  antibacterial complex (znow) at-83, ionpure-h, basic magnesium hypochlorite, znow at-88 and antim-ams2. the broth dilution test appears to be more suitable for testing insoluble inorganic agents.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial efficacy of a new chlorhexidine slow-release device.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide slow-release devices on oral bacteria. method and materials: the agar diffusion test was used to evaluate the  antibacterial effect of the slow-release devices activ point (chlorhexidine; roeko) and calcium hydroxide plus point (roeko) on 8 anaerobic and 2 facultative  oral bacterial strains, as well as 2 bacterial cultures randomly sampled from necrotic root canals and incubated in anaerobic and aerobic broth for 48 hours. the efficiency of the medicaments against the various strains was evaluated using a nonparametric test (friedman type) and a second nonparametric test (wilcoxon's  signed rank test). results: activ point produced significantly larger inhibition  zones (p < .001) than the calcium hydroxide slow-release device around all tested bacterial strains. conclusion: the chlorhexidine slow-release device (activ point) exhibited significant antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion test and merits study as an intracanal medicament.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial and resistance-modifying activities of aqueous crude khat  extracts against oral microorganisms.
AB  == objectives: to assess antimicrobial activities of aqueous crude khat (catha edulis) extracts against a panel of oral microorganisms and to test their ability to modify bacterial resistance to tetracycline and penicillin in vitro. design: lyophilized aqueous extracts were prepared from three khat cultivars. the agar dilution method of the nccls was used to test the extracts, at concentrations of  20-1.25 mg/ml, against 33 oral strains. mic was defined as the lowest concentration at which there was no visible growth. slight growth was defined as  marked growth reduction (mgr). the e-test was used to determine the mics of tetracycline and penicillin-g for three resistant strains in absence and presence of a sub-mic of the khat extracts (5mg/ml). results: eighteen strains (55%) were  sensitive to the extracts (mics 5-20 mg/ml). most of these were periodontal pathogens with porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythensis being the most susceptible (mic 5-10mg/ml). veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii and some streptococci were not sensitive. except for lactobacillus acidophilus that showed mgr at 1mg/ml, cariogenic species were neither sensitive. the extracts were active against streptococcus pyogenes (mic 10-20 mg/ml) but not against candida albicans and staphylococcus aureus. the presence of the khat extracts at  a sub-mic resulted in a 2-4-fold potentiation of the tested antibiotics against the resistant strains. conclusions: khat has water-soluble constituents possessing selective antibacterial activity against oral bacteria. there is preliminary evidence for presence of an antibiotic resistance-modifying component. further investigation is needed to identify the active components and  assess their clinical relevance.

TI  == use of shell-vial cell culture assay for isolation of bacteria from clinical specimens: 13 years of experience.
AB  == the shell-vial culture assay is performed routinely in our laboratory. recently we revisited our experience of using the shell-vial culture assay for the isolation of microorganisms from various clinical samples. over a 13-year period, we have isolated 580 bacterial strains (5%) from 11,083 clinical samples tested.  over the same period, 285 isolates of rickettsiae, bartonellae, or coxiella burnetii were cultured from a total of 7,102 samples tested. these isolates include 55 rickettsia sp. isolates, 95 coxiella burnetii isolates, and 135 bartonella sp. isolates. based on our experience with the growth of fastidious microorganisms, we have used a centrifugation shell-vial technique called jnsp, for "je ne sais pas" ("i don't know [what i am growing]") for the isolation of other microorganisms. a total of 173 isolates were cultured from the 3,861 clinical samples tested using the jnsp method. of these, 40 isolates had not been grown before on usual axenic medium. these include 2 staphylococcus aureus isolates, 7 isolates of streptococcus sp. and related genera, 6 mycobacterium sp. isolates, 1 nocardia asteroides isolate, 1 actinomyces sp. isolate, 1 brucella melitensis isolate, 2 francisella tularensis isolates, 1 mycoplasma pneumoniae isolate, and 1 legionella pneumophila isolate. using this protocol, we have also  cultured intracellular bacteria such as chlamydia trachomatis and we have performed the first culture and establishment of trophyrema whipplei. applied in  our laboratory, the shell-vial culture generally exhibits a low rate of success.  however, in some cases, this technique allowed microbial diagnosis when classical agar procedure and pcr were negative.

TI  == microflora in oral ecosystems in subjects with hyposalivation due to medicines or of unknown origin.
AB  == purpose: to analyse the microbial flora in specific sites in 20 dentate (> or = 16 teeth) subjects with hyposalivation due to medicines or of unknown origin and  in 20 controls matched according to age, sex and number of teeth. materials and methods: the microbial samples were analysed for the following micro-organisms: mutans streptococci, lactobacillus spp. and actinomyces spp., associated with the development of caries, fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, associated with plaque accumulation and gingivitis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis, frequently found in elevated numbers in periodontitis sites and candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, enterics and enterococci, associated with mucosal infections. the total microbial count was also registered, together with the total number of streptococci, associated with good oral health. results: in the hyposalivation group, the mean age was 54 +/- 8 years and the mean number of teeth 25 +/- 3. the unstimulated secretion rate was 0.04 +/- 0.04 ml/min and the  stimulated secretion rate 0.98 +/- 0.51 ml/min. compared with the controls, the hyposalivation group tended to harbour a lower number and proportion of f. nucleatum on the tongue, and an increased number of enterococci in the vestibular region. in the supragingival plaque, the numbers of strepococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. were significantly increased and the number of c. albicans tended to be increased. conclusion: the results indicate that subjects with hyposalivation due to medicines or of unknown origin have a supragingival plaque  associated with the development of caries.

TI  == feline pyothorax: a retrospective study of 27 cases in australia.
AB  == pyothorax was diagnosed in 27 cats between 1983 and 2002. in 21 (78%) of the cases, pleural fluid culture and/or cytology was consistent with a mixed anaerobic bacterial infection of oropharyngeal origin. in six cases (22%), infection was caused by unusual pathogens or pathogens of non-oropharyngeal origin, including a mycoplasma species, cryptococcus gattii, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus. the overall mortality rate was  22%. treatment was successful in 18 of 19 cases (95%) where closed thoracostomy tubes were inserted. one case resolved only after thoracotomy. actinomyces species were isolated in three cases and in contrast to dogs where thoracotomy is recommended, they were resolved with tube thoracostomy. mechanical complications  occurred in 58% of the cats with indwelling chest tubes. probable mechanisms of pleural space infection were identified in 18 cats (67%) including haematogenous  infection (n=1), direct inoculation of bacteria into the pleural space (n=1), intrathoracic oesophageal rupture (n=1) and parapneumonic extension of infection  (n=15; 56%). of the latter, perioperative aspiration was suspected in two cats, parasitic migration in two and antecedent upper respiratory tract infection was implicated in seven. parapneumonic spread of infection after colonisation and invasion of lung tissue by oropharyngeal flora appears to be the most frequent cause of feline anaerobic polymicrobial pyothorax and contests the widespread belief that direct inoculation of pleural cavity by bite wounds is more common.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of five root canal sealers.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyze the antimicrobial properties of five  endodontic sealers: endo fill, endomethasone, endomethasone n, sealer 26 and ah-plus, against the following microorganisms: candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces naeslundii.  the sealers were tested immediately, 24 h, 48 h and 7 days after manipulation.the direct contact method through the observation of the microbial growth in liquid medium and the agar diffusion test were used to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of the sealers. the results, in both methodologies used, showed that immediately after manipulation, endo-fill and endomethasone demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity, with no statistically significant difference between them. sealer 26 demonstrated the lowest antimicrobial activity. at all other times after manipulation, there were no statistically significant differences among all the sealers tested. in conclusion, none of the sealers totally inhibited the growth of the microorganisms. furthermore, the antimicrobial activity of each sealer decreased with time and was dependent upon  the microbial susceptibility to them.

TI  == the effects of chlorhexidine gluconate (0.12%) on the antimicrobial properties of tooth-colored proroot mineral trioxide aggregate.
AB  == the purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether the substitution of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for sterile water as a mixing agent would enhance the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored proroot mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) against actinomyces odontolyticus (atcc17982), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc2586), streptococcus sanguis (atcc10556), enterococcus faecalis (er3/2s), escherichia coli (sm10lambdapir), staphylococcus aureus (atcc6538), pseudomonas aeruginosa (ume), and candida albicans (atcc10261). two wells of 5-mm diameter were made in triplicate agar plates inoculated with standardized suspensions of each microorganism. mta (33 mg) mixed with chlorhexidine (12 microl) or sterile water (12 microl) was placed to fill each well. plates were incubated at 37 degrees c as required for microbial growth. a blinded, independent observer measured zones of inhibition. all mta samples inhibited microbial growth regardless of mixing agent. mta/chlorhexidine showed significantly larger zones of inhibition (p < 0.0002, paired t test). in conclusion, substituting 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for water enhanced the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored proroot mta.

TI  == effect of porphyromonas gingivalis vesicles on coaggregation of staphylococcus aureus to oral microorganisms.
AB  == vesicles from the outer membrane of porphyromonas gingivalis have the ability to  aggregate a wide range of streptococcus spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii, and actinomyces viscosus. we found that in the presence of p. gingivalis vesicles, staphylococcus aureus coaggregated with streptococcus  spp., and the mycelium-type candida albicans, but not the yeast type. autoaggregation of s. aureus in the presence of p. gingivalis vesicles is inhibited by l-arginine, l-lysine, and l-cysteine. both the methicillin-sensitive (mssa) and -resistant (mrsa) strains of s. aureus were able to coaggregate with streptococcus spp., a. naeslundii, and a. viscosus when they were treated with p. gingivalis vesicles. p. gingivalis vesicle-treated mycelium-type c. albicans coaggregated with s. aureus, but the yeast-type did not. these results indicate that strains of s. aureus, including mrsa, could adhere to oral biofilms in dental plaque on the tooth surface or in the gingival crevice when p. gingivalis  is present.

AB  == aim: to determine whether 'mgp' gutta-percha (westport, ct, usa), a commercially  available gutta-percha containing iodoform, inhibits the growth of potential endodontic pathogens. methodology: inocula of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus sanguis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces odontolyticus were spread onto the surface of agar plates. 'mgp' gutta-percha cones presoaked in sterile water were transferred to the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees c aerobically or anaerobically as required for optimal growth. identical studies were performed using iodoform-free gutta-percha and sterile paper disks saturated with 10% povidone-iodine. following incubation, zones of inhibition around the 'mgp' gutta-percha, iodoform-free gutta-percha and disks were evaluated. results: povidone-iodine inhibited all the strains. iodoform-free gutta-percha inhibited s. sanguis and a. odontolyticus. 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited s. aureus, s. sanguis, a. odontolyticus and f. nucleatum. neither iodoform-free gutta-percha nor 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited growth of e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa. conclusions: compared to iodoform-free gutta-percha, iodoform-containing 'mgp' gutta-percha had an inhibitory effect in vitro on s. aureus and f. nucleatum, but not on e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa.

TI  == crowding and winter emergency feeding as predisposing factors for kerato-conjunctivitis in semi-domesticated reindeer in norway.
AB  == due to the hard environmental and climatic situation in late winter 1999, a herd  of about 200 free-ranging, semi-domesticated reindeer was gathered in a paddock in northern norway for emergency feeding. about the same number of reindeer was not corralled but supplementary fed on their winter pastures. the fodder was of relatively good quality but very dusty and fed in a very dry environment. six weeks later, an outbreak of eye-infection was diagnosed in one third of the corralled reindeer; mild symptoms were observed in most of them, but 11 animals showed severe signs of disease. no signs of disease were found in the non-corralled animals. ten reindeer died through emaciation, the eleventh was sacrificed. histopathological diagnosis of two severely affected eyes revealed a  severe purulent kerato-conjunctivitis with bacteria and plant particles embedded  in purulent exudates on the cornea and conjunctiva. in one eye from the two most  affected animals actinomyces pyogenes, coagulase-negative staphylococci and escherichia coli and in the other one staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli  were found. the bacteria encountered in this study are not considered the primary cause of disease. they seem rather to be opportunistic infectious agents of eyes  that have been irritated mechanically through exposure to dusty fodder in a dry environment. the stress through unfamiliar corralling of the reindeer, that followed an insufficient fodder supply, could be considered as an additional infection supporting factor. this case-report emphasises on the importance of different factors involved in favouring outbreaks of disease in reindeer, under intensified husbandry conditions. even though crowding and emergency feeding may  be, at certain circumstances, the only means of survival for reindeer, a negative impact of implied crowding diseases on their productivity, must be considered, as well.

TI  == some new aspects of the pathology, pathogenesis, and aetiology of disseminated lung lesions in slaughter pigs.
AB  == from 40 pigs rejected for human consumption at slaughter due to an apparent presence of pyemic lung lesions (defined as disseminated processes containing pus and/or necrotic material), the lungs, spleen, liver, and kidneys were subjected to an extended macroscopic examination. several lung lesions were sampled from each animal for histological and bacteriological examination. samples from the kidneys and spleens were also subjected to bacteriological examination. at gross  level, four groups of lung lesions were identified: 1) disseminated foci with contents of pus and/or necrotic material (n=26); 2) disseminated or multifocally  located ecchymoses with a central area of fibroplasia (n=9); 3) non-pneumonic lesions, i.e., disseminated areas of atelectasis (n=1) or haemorrhagic areas developing due to the process of slaughter (n=1); and 4) suppurative lesions without a disseminated distribution pattern (n=3). histologically, the disseminated suppurative/necrotic foci were identified as: a) abscesses (n=10); b) necrotic lesions (n=6); and c) ectatic or ectatic-like bronchioles with contents of pus and necrotic material (n=10). the macroscopic observation of disseminated centres of fibroplasia with peripheral ecchymoses (n=9) was confirmed histopathologically. the livers of five pigs contained multiple areas of chronic interstitial fibrosis related to migration of ascaris suum larvae ("milk spotted liver"). such hepatic lesions were significantly (p<0.01) related  to the simultaneous occurrence of disseminated pulmonary ecchymoses with a central area of fibroplasia. generally, all lung lesions of each individual animal contained identical monocultures of bacteria following this pattern: staphylococcus aureus (abscesses); actinomyces hyovaginalis (necroses); s. aureus, a. hyovaginalis, and arcanobacterium pyogenes (ectatic and ectatic-like bronchioles). areas with fibrosis were sterile or contained bacteria considered to be a result of contamination. apart from one kidney, from which s. aureus was  cultured, all other organs were sterile. it is concluded that difficulties exist  in differentiating pulmonary pyemic lesions from non-pyemic lesions at the gross  level. thus, it was not possible to distinguish between abscesses/necroses and ectatic bronchioles, the pathogenesis of the latter being uncertain. however, the chronic non-pyemic lesions related to the migration of a. suum larvae should be identified by the absence of pus/necrosis. s. aureus was predominantly isolated from abscesses, whereas, and most surprisingly, a. hyovaginalis was the dominant  bacterium isolated from the pulmonary necroses.

TI  == biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the calgary biofilm device (cbd) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (mbec) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin g, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine  for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the cbd under selected conditions. the biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. biofilms composed of arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium renale, or corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but  as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. biofilm and planktonic streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. planktonic escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and  trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against e. coli growing as a biofilm. salmonella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. planktonic and biofilm pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. the cbd provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.

AB  == background: treatment with titanium dental implants is in general successful. however, an unknown number of implants do not integrate and are removed either by exfoliation or at the time of second stage surgery. it would be of importance to  identify subjects at risk and predict early implant failure. methods: in a retrospective study serum igg antibody titers and avidity in sera from 40 subjects who had experienced titanium dental implant treatments with non-osseo-integration as the outcome (noti) and in sera from 40 age and gender matched control subjects who had received successful titanium dental implants (soti) were studied. serum igg titers to whole cell actinomyces viscosus, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus intermedius sonicated antigen preparations were studied by elisa. results: serum igg antibody titers to s. aureus were significantly higher in subjects with soti than in noti (p<0.001) suggesting that higher titers indicate  protection against implant failure as a result of s. aureus infection. statistically significant higher serum igg antibody avidity to p. gingivalis and  b. forsythus were found in subjects with soti than in subjects with noti (p<0.01  and p<0.001, respectively). statistical analysis failed to demonstrate antibody titer or avidity differences to the other pathogens studied. the likelihood that  soti was associated with a high od reading for s. aureus was 13.1:1 (p<0.001). whether subjects were edentulous or not, or if they had lost teeth because of periodontitis or caries did not seem to matter. conclusion: serum igg antibodies  relative to b. forsythus, p. gingivalis and s. aureus may be associated with the  outcome of implant procedures and explain why early implant failures occur.

TI  == epidemiology of infectious keratoconjunctivitis in cattle in south-east ethiopia.
AB  == the aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of infectious keratoconjunctivitis on cross-breed dairy farms and to evaluate factors that influence its distribution. a total of 11 dairy farms and one cattle cross-breeding farm in different parts of arsi region, south-east ethiopia were clinically and bacteriologically investigated from february 1989 to december 1990. out of 5221 local zebu and cross-breed dairy animals, 110 were found to have different degrees of infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis. of these, 94 (85.5%) were unilateral and 16 (14.5%) were bilateral. the prevalence of the disease was significantly (p < 0.001) influenced by age and breed; high exotic blood level and younger age groups were mainly affected. however, severity of the disease was not significantly associated with age (p > 0.750). moraxella bovis was isolated from 88 (80%) of the 110 bacteriologically positive cases. of these  isolates, 61 (69%) were haemolytic and 27 (31%) were non-haemolytic strains. infection with m. bovis was unilateral. concurrent infections with m. bovis included actinomyces pyogenes 23 (21%), staphylococcus aureus 17 (15%), pasteurella haemolytica nine (8%), escherichia coli eight (7%) and proteus spp. four (3.6%).

TI  == dot assay for determining adhesive interactions between yeasts and bacteria under controlled hydrodynamic conditions.
AB  == candida belongs to the normal human microflora and are found adhering to a number of human body tissues as well as to a variety of biomaterials implants. often, yeasts adhere in association with bacteria, but to date there is no definitive assay to investigate adhesive interactions between yeasts and bacteria adhering on surfaces. although we recently described the use of a parallel plate flow chamber to this purpose [millsap, k.w., bos, r., van der mei, h. c., busscher, h.j., 1998. adhesive interactions between medically important yeasts and bacteria. fems microbiol. rev. 21, 321-336], the method was slow and evaluation of a large number of strains showed major biological variation between experiments. here, we describe a new assay for the simultaneous determination of  the adhesive interactions between yeasts and different bacterial strains on a surface under controlled hydrodynamic conditions. on an acrylic surface, the presence of adhering bacteria suppressed adhesion of candida albicans atcc 10261  to various degrees, depending on the bacterial strain involved. suppression of c. albicans atcc 10261 adhesion was strongest by actinomyces naeslundii t14v-j1, while adhering streptococcus gordonii nctc 7869 caused the weakest suppression of yeast adhesion. when adhering yeasts and bacteria were challenged with the high detachment force of a passing liquid-air interface, the majority of the yeasts detached, while c. albicans adhering on the control, bare polymethylmethacrylate  surface formed aggregates. summarizing, this study presents a new method to determine suggested adhesive interactions between yeasts and adhering bacteria under controlled hydrodynamic conditions. however, the results seem to indicate that these adhesive interactions may well not exist, but that instead different bacterial strains have varying abilities to discourage yeast adhesion.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

TI  == diffuse chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis and the synovitis, acne, pustolosis, hyperostosis, osteitis (sapho) syndrome in two sisters.
AB  == two sisters with diffuse chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis of the mandible and the humerus and the synovitis, acne, pustolosis, hyperostosis and osteitis syndrome (sapho syndrome) are presented. the diagnoses of diffuse chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis at the age of 12 years and 27 years, respectively, were based on typical medical history, clinical symptoms and radiographic, histologic and scintigraphic findings. because skin lesions and scintigraphic enhancement of the sternoclavicular joints with hyperostosis were present, a sapho syndrome was diagnosed in both sisters. microbiological cultures of biopsy specimens revealed  coagulase-negative staphylococcus aureus at the humerus and haemophilus parainfluenzae, streptococcus, actinomyces and veilonella species at the mandible. repeated operative procedures, including decortications, resection and  reconstruction, and multiple histologic and microbiologic studies were performed  over a period of up to 20 years. since hla typing yielded identical gene loci, we suggest that hereditary and autoimmune factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of these cases.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of six endodontic sealers: an in vitro evaluation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial effect of six endodontic sealers after 2, 20 and 40 days. the sealers studied were apexit, endion, ah26, ah-plus. procosol and ketac endo. the microorganisms used were candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans and actinomyces israelii. petri dishes were filled with sterile agar and 0.1-ml wells were prepared and filled with the sealers. the agar plates were stored for 24 h at 37  degrees c. the samples were then removed, immersed in 4.5 ml of culture medium and divided into three groups. the samples in group 1 were stored for 2 days at 37 degrees c whereas the samples of groups 2 and 3 were stored at 4 degrees c for 20 and 40 days respectively. the samples were then removed and discarded, and 0.1 ml of the culture medium was seeded on the agar plates in order to perform colony forming unit counts. apexit, endion and ah-plus produced slight inhibition on streptococcus mutans at 20 days and on actinomyces israelii at every time interval. no effect was found on candida albicans and staphylococcus aureus. ketac endo only produced an antimicrobial effect on actinomyces israelii at 2 and 40 days. ah26 and procosol showed antimicrobial effect at 40 days on candida albicans, at 20 and 40 days on streptococcus mutans and staphylococcus aureus, and an effective inhibition on actinomyces israelii at every time interval. statistical analysis revealed both sealers and microorganisms to be significant factors affecting results in groups 2 and 3. in conclusion, the sealers evaluated in this study showed different inhibitory effects depending on time span. overall, sealers containing cugenol and formaldehyde proved to be most effective  against the microorganisms at the time intervals studied.

TI  == bacteria associated with clinical mastitis in dairy heifers.
AB  == a 1-yr field investigation of clinical mastitis in heifers was carried out in 24  veterinary districts in norway. quarter lacteal secretions from cases that occurred prepartum or within 14 d postpartum were examined bacteriologically. the study included 1040 heifers with clinical mastitis, and the total number of quarters that were clinically affected was 1361. the organisms that were most frequently isolated from samples from these quarters were staphylococcus aureus (44.3%), streptococcus dysgalactiae (18.2%), staph. aureus together with strep. dysgalactiae (1.2%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (12.8%), arcanobacterium pyogenes (3.5%), a. pyogenes together with strep. dysgalactiae (0.5%) or staph. aureus (0.4%), and escherichia coli (6.4%). of the coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus simulans (53.7%), staphylococcus hyicus (14.8%), and staphylococcus chromogenes (14.8%) were the most prevalent species. except for a higher relative percentage of a. pyogenes in cases that occurred before parturition (8.2%) than in cases that occurred after parturition (2.7%), no significant differences were observed in the distribution of the various organisms among prepartum and postpartum cases. regional variations were observed in the distribution of organisms. the proportions of staph. aureus and a. pyogenes were highest, and the proportion of coagulase-negative staphylococci was lowest, in late autumn and early winter. the proportion of e. coli was highest in summer. in heifers in which mastitis was associated with increased rectal temperature or other systemic signs, the proportion of clinically affected quarters that were infected with staph. aureus was larger than that in heifers without systemic reaction.

TI  == the microbiota of periodontal pockets with different depths in therapy-resistant  periodontitis.
AB  == this study presents the composition of the cultivable microbiota colonising periodontal pockets of different depths among 2 patient-groups classified as non-responsive (nr-group; 11 participants) or responsive (r-group; 10 participants) to periodontal treatment. microbiological samples from three types  of pocket (< 4 mm deep a-samples; 4-5 mm b-samples; > 5 mm c-samples) were analysed by cultural methods for putative periodontitis pathogens, microbial groups constituting > or = 5% of the total cultivable flora and opportunistic pathogens. actinomyces naeslundii, a. israelii, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium spp, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, anaerobic streptococci and facultative anaerobic streptococci were most prevalent. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, staphylococcus aureus, enteric rods and yeasts were less prevalent. the periodontitis pathogens bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium spp, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and peptostreptococcus micros constituted together (on average) < or = 23% of the viable counts in the a- and b-samples of  both patient groups and in the c-samples of the r-group. in the c-samples of the  nr-group their mean counts were 45%. correlations were found between smoking habits and the five pathogens in the c-samples and in pooled pocket depth samples. the results show that groups of periodontopathogens should be considered a causal factor in therapy-resistant periodontitis. further, smoking and deep pockets can enhance a shift in the balance of the subgingival microflora predisposing a site to disease and a susceptible host may be the pre-requisite to therapy-resistant periodontitis.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characteristics of smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to compare  the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. the study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (pd >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared  to non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. the samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits.  smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann-whitney u-test) showed that staphylococcus aureus, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, escherichia coli, bacteroides  forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, selenomonas sputigena, candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while streptococcus intermedius, a. naeslundii, a. israelii and eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and  in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. the isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as e. coli, c. albicans, a. fumigatus and s. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

TI  == the efficacy of antimicrobial mouth rinses in oral health care.
AB  == there is growing public recognition of the importance of oral health, as symbolized by the theme. "oral health for a healthy life" proposed for the 1994 world health day. in this report, the efficacy of antimicrobial mouth rinses, mainly listerine, was reviewed by three investigators who are working as a microbiologist, a microbiologist, a dentist, and a dental hygienist participating in oral health care. listerine, an antimicrobial mouth rinse, completely killed microorganisms in 10 to 30 seconds; the microbes includes methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, helicobacter pylori, candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. listerine was also weakly effective in inactivating human immunodeficiency viruses. bacteria in samples collected from human dental plaque and saliva were completely killed within 30 seconds when exposed to listerine. when saliva samples were collected from subjects who had rinsed their mouths with 20 ml of listerine or 1:50 diluted povidone-iodine, levels of viable anaerobic bacteria in the samples were reduced  to 1%. when listerine was used for oral surgery such as tooth extraction and periodontal surgery, the agent was effective in relieving toothache. this was probably due to a decrease in oral bacteria by the antimicrobial action of listerine, leading to lowering the inflammatory response of the host. the use of  antimicrobial mouth rinse during dental treatments such as endodontic treatment proved effective for more reliable infection control. in japan, there are an increasing number of elderly and medically compromised hosts who are potentially  at risk for developing pneumonia due to silent aspiration of microbes in the oral cavity and throat. for the aged with such potential risk, using of antimicrobial  mouth rinse may be effective in preventing dental plaque accumulation when used in addition to the mechanical control of plaque, since they tend to have difficulty in brushing teeth by themselves. indeed, the use of antimicrobial mouth rinse in these elderly people proved useful not only in preventing bacterial pneumonia, but also in improving their quality of life by preserving their oral health.

TI  == experimental induction of renal lesions in chickens.
AB  == the present work was conducted to investigate the possibility of inducing renal lesions in chickens subcutaneously or orally inoculated with e. coli [e. coli o1k67(b12)], staphylococcus aureus and actinomyces pyogenes. the strains were previously isolated from the kidneys of broilers showing different pathological lesions. the gross lesions observed in the kidneys included enlargement, congestion, haemorrhagic spots in addition to dilatation and distension of the ureters. the microscopic lesions were mainly interstitial nephritis. the lesions  were acute and changed gradually to subacute or chronic nephritis. the glomerular lesions were not common. the wall of the primary branches of the ureter and the ureters was heavily infiltrated with inflammatory cells, also granular and albuminous casts were seen in the renal tubules. the lesions were not related to  the inoculated pathogen, although they were more severe in chickens inoculated with e. coli and staph. aureus more than in actinomyces pyogenes. reisolation of  the inoculated pathogens was more successful from the birds inoculated subcutaneously than from those infected orally.

TI  == primary pulmonary botryomycosis: case report and review.
AB  == botryomycosis is an uncommon bacterial disease characterized by the microscopic formation of eosinophilic granules that resemble those of infection by actinomyces species. the diagnosis of botryomycosis can be made when microscopic  inspection and culture of the granules reveal gram-positive cocci or gram-negative bacilli. botryomycosis is caused by common bacterial pathogens including staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, yet the host and microbial factors that contribute to the pathobiology remain unknown. pulmonary botryomycosis can resemble actinomycosis, tuberculosis, or invasive carcinoma by causing a mass lesion with constitutional symptoms. radiographically, it invades bone and disrupts tissue planes. successful treatment often requires a combination of both surgical debridement and long-term antimicrobial therapy. we report a case of primary pulmonary botryomycosis and review the literature on this unusual infectious process.

AB  == cigarette smoking is a potent risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to detect the microbial profile of early onset periodontitis in smokers and compare it to that  of non-smokers. the study population consisted of 50 systemically healthy individuals aged 25 to 38 years, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. 25 patients were smokers (> 20 cigarettes/day) and 25 non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples comprised of four periodontal sites with probing depth > 5 mm each, were collected from each individual. the samples were cultured aerobically  and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the differences in bacterial counts using  the mann whitney u test were statistically significant for staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens, escherichia coli, bacteroides forsythus, bacteroides gracilis, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis,  selenomonas sputigena and candida albicans in smokers. statistically significant  differences for peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces naeslundii, eubacterium lentum and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in non-smokers. the isolation  of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora like e. coli, c. albicans and s. aureus in smokers microflora underscores the importance of the host which is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

TI  == summer mastitis experimentally induced by hydrotaea irritans exposed to bacteria.
AB  == summer mastitis is an acute suppurative bacterial infection of the udder in heifers and dry cows. to ascertain the possible role of flies in the transmission of the disease, experimental exposures of recipient heifers to hydrotaea irritans previously exposed to bacteria were carried out. flies were allowed to feed on secretions from clinical cases of summer mastitis. the pathogens present were the bacteria staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus dysgalactiae, actinomyces pyogenes, stuart-schwan cocci, peptococcus indolicus, fusobacterium necrophorum and bacterioides species. the teats of eight heifers were exposed to flies with verified pathogen content. two teats of each animal were deliberately damaged before fly exposure. one teat was cut, another pricked with insect needles to mimic insect bites. two of the heifers developed summer mastitis in the quarters  where teats had been cut. the bacterial species isolated from these quarters corresponded to those that had previously been fed to the flies. for the first time, it is now demonstrated that h.irritans is capable of transmitting summer mastitis pathogens and so causing summer mastitis in recipient heifers. lesions on the teat orifice may be a predisposing factor in the development of the disease.

TI  == community-acquired bacteremia in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children in harare, zimbabwe.
AB  == background: hiv infection is common in mothers and their children in zimbabwe, and hiv-infected children are particularly susceptible to bacterial infections. there is little information on the etiology and outcome of hiv-related bacteremia in african children. methods: blood cultures from 309 hospitalized children in zimbabwe, of whom 168 were diagnosed as having hiv, were examined for pathogens.  the association among significant bacteremia, hiv infection and mortality was assessed in these children. results: the most common isolates were coagulase-negative staphylococci (31 children, 25 clinically significant), staphylococcus aureus (22 children) and streptococcus pneumoniae (20 children). nontyphoidal salmonella (10 children), escherichia coli (4 children) and klebsiella sp. (4 children) were the most frequent gram-negative bacteria. two children had rhodococcus equi pneumonia. hiv-infected children showed increased risk of bacteremia (odds ratio (or) = 2.68), especially if younger than 18 months of age (or = 2.94), and high risk of enterobacteremia (or = 15.76). there was no  significant association of bacteremia with nutritional status. mortality was 17%  overall but was higher in hiv-infected children up to 6 months of age (or = 2.81) and in bacteremic children of any age (or = 2.03). conclusions: prompt recognition of pathogens and early administration of appropriate antimicrobials is important in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with bacteremia in hiv-infected children in africa.

TI  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans on denture surfaces.
AB  == infectious diseases caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, mrsa,  and candida albicans are often serious in compromised hosts. we enumerated mrsa and c. albicans on denture surfaces and in saliva samples from 29 adults. staphylococcus species, mrsa, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, mrse, were detected on 17, 3, and 1 of the 29 denture surfaces, respectively. c. albicans were detected on 22 denture surfaces. all saliva samples from patients whose dentures carried staphylococcus species and c. albicans were also found to contain both microorganisms. adherence of isolated 3h labeled cells of mrsa and c. albicans to resin beads and saliva-coated resin beads was examined. cells of both microorganisms adhered in significantly higher  numbers to saliva-coated resin beads than to resin beads. the hydrophobicity of the mrsa isolated from denture surfaces varied from strain to strain; that of c.  albicans strains was moderately high. the zeta potentials of mrsa isolates and of c. albicans isolates determined in kci buffer were significantly low. the potential of the resin beads decreased after treatment with saliva. two out of 5  mrsa strains were found to be inhibited in growth by oral streptococcus, actinomyces, and gram-negative bacterial strains, suggesting that some oral bacterial species play a role in inhibiting the colonization of staphylococcus species. no isolates of c. albicans were inhibited in their growth by any of the  oral bacteria tested. isolates of mrsa and c. albicans coaggregated with porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum strains. using denture cleaners every night for 2 weeks did not reduce numbers of staphylococcus species or c. albicans organisms in saliva.

TI  == salivacin 140, a novel bacteriocin from lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius t140 active against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == fifteen of 353 environmental isolates of lactic acid bacteria consistently showed activity against listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and/or propionibacterium acnes. strain t140, isolated from the surface  of japanese pampas grass leaves and identified as lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius, also had activity against several lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica. since the antagonistic factor(s) produced by t140 was sensitive to a proteolytic enzyme, it was concluded that a bacteriocin (named salivacin 140) was involved in the inhibition activity. strain t140 required a high initial ph (7.5-8.5) in agar plates for bacteriocin production.

TI  == whole mouth microbiota effects following subgingival delivery of sanguinarium.
AB  == an increased incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and yeast overgrowth has  been reported following various periodontal treatments. the objective of this study was to detect possible overgrowth of opportunistic bacteria and fungi as well as changes in normal microbiota after application of a biodegradable delivery system containing 5% sanguinarium (abds-s) to one quadrant in a split-mouth study. an oral hygiene quadrant served as a control. the abds-s treated and control periodontal sites as well as the saliva of 17 subjects were sampled prior to treatment, immediately after abds-s removal at 7 days, and again at 30 and 60 days. at day 7 sanguinarium-resistant bacteria increased in both control and abds-s periodontal sites as well as in the saliva. enteric gram-negative bacilli in both control and abds-s periodontal sites were 2.2 to 3.4 log colony forming units higher at day 7 compared to baseline. this overgrowth was transient in that levels became undetectable at days 30 and 60. no such overgrowth was observed for c. albicans or other fungi, or for s. aureus or  other staphylococci in any periodontal sites. levels of actinomyces increased at  days 30 and 60 in both control and abds-s sites as well as saliva. these changes  strongly suggest that a 7 day abds-s treatment in one quadrant of the mouth led to significant microbiota changes in the treated and control quadrants as well as in the saliva. future microbial studies involving antimicrobials delivered by local delivery systems must consider the crossover effects of treatment inherent  in the split-mouth design.

TI  == subclinical mastitis and milk production in primiparous simmental cows.

TI  == isolation of gram-positive rods that resemble but are clearly distinct from actinomyces pyogenes from mixed wound infections.
AB  == beginning in 1990, gram-positive rods resembling actinomyces pyogenes were found  with increasing frequency in mixed cultures from various infectious processes, most of them from patients with otitis, empyema, pilonidal cysts, perianal abscesses, and decubitus ulcers. ribotyping and hybridization showed that these gram-positive rods could be divided into five groups not related to known actinomyces species. biochemical markers for reliable differentiation into these  groups, however, could not be found. therefore, naming new species is not warranted unless parameters are discovered that allow identification without dna  hybridization. these gram-positive rods have been isolated only in mixed cultures with anaerobes, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus "milleri," enterococci, and  gram-negative rods. their exact role in these possibly synergistic infections needs further investigation.

AB  == an endopeptidase cleaving specifically at the carboxyl side of acidic amino acid  residues, preferentially at glutamic acid, has been isolated from a commercial extract obtained by fermentation with bacillus licheniformis. using ion-exchange  chromatography and affinity chromatography on bacitracin-sepharose, it was possible, from 100 ml commercial extract, to isolate 100 mg homogeneous enzyme in a yield of 50%. it is the first description of a large-scale isolation of a glu/asp-specific enzyme. the preparation was essentially free of contaminating activities. the isolated enzyme consists of one peptide chain of 222 amino acid residues and has a calculated molecular mass of 23,589 da. the determined amino acid sequence shows similarity to the glu/asp-specific enzymes previously isolated from staphylococcus aureus v8, actinomyces sp. and streptomyces thermovulgaris. the substrate preference of the enzyme has been investigated. although non-specific cleavages were observed after prolonged hydrolysis at high  enzyme concentrations the enzyme appears to be essentially specific for glu-xaa and asp-xaa, with strong preference for the former. the isolated enzyme exhibits  a bell-shaped ph/activity profile with an optimum at ph 7.5-8.0. the activity is  adversely affected by high ionic strength and beneficially affected by the inclusion of calcium ions in the assay medium. the enzyme is completely inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate, suggesting that it is a serine endopeptidase. it is partially inhibited by edta.

TI  == microbiology of chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  == to better understand the factors involved in chronic sinusitis in childhood, we cultured the sinuses, middle meatus, and nasopharynx in 39 children requiring surgical intervention. sixty-nine percent of these patients had other medical problems, including asthma (49%) and immunologic compromise (18%). we cultured coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 18 patients, streptococcus viridans in 14 patients, normal flora in 10 patients, staphylococcus aureus in nine patients, group d streptococcus in five patients, corynebacterium in five patients, haemophilus influenzae in three patients, neisseria in three patients, and streptococcus pneumoniae, group a streptococcus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces, and an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus in one patient each. cultures yielded no growth  in nine patients. a strong association between cultures of the middle meatus obtained ipsilaterally and cultures of the maxillary (83%) and ethmoid sinuses (80%) occurred. a poor correlation was found between cultures of the nasopharynx  and maxillary (45%) and ethmoid sinuses (49%). all seven patients who had both maxillary and ethmoid sinus cultures showed the same organisms in both sinuses. only 41% of organisms were found on both sides when procedures were performed bilaterally. cultures of the middle meatus appear to be sensitive and specific for organisms within sinuses. the presence of predominantly nonvirulent organisms in low titers suggests that additional factors other than bacterial overgrowth contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis in children.

AB  == bacterial analyses were carried out of 2069 udder secretions, isolated from 1481  heifers with mastitis in eight veterinary districts in sweden. streptococci, e.g. streptococcus dysgalactiae and str. uberis, dominated the bacterial flora, being  isolated from 34.4 and 19.5% respectively of heifers with clinical mastitis occurring from puberty up to 14 d post partum. bacterial species generally regarded as important pathogens in the summer mastitis complex, e.g. actinomyces  pyogenes, stuart-schwan coccus and strictly anaerobic bacteria such as peptostreptococcus indolicus, fusobacterium necrophorum and bacteroides melaninogenicus were isolated at low frequencies (13.2, 6.3, 9.4, 3.8 and 1.3% respectively). when the cases of mastitis studied were restricted to those appearing in heifers pre partum, may 15 to october 14 (summer mastitis), these bacterial species were isolated at higher percentages (27.1, 14.4, 21.4, 13.5 and 5.2% respectively). these figures were, nevertheless, still lower than those published in reports from other countries. whether considered up to 14 d post partum or only pre partum, there were no significant differences in the frequencies of a. pyogenes isolated at different seasons. there were geographical differences in bacterial incidence, e.g. staphylococcus aureus was isolated significantly more often in northern regions whereas str. dysgalactiae was more common in the south. this and other swedish investigations support the theory that a. pyogenes and strictly anaerobic bacteria are 'secondary invaders' that depend on str. dysgalactiae to cause a primary infection. it is stressed that the udders of all heifers should be examined daily so that cases of mastitis can be treated immediately.

TI  == a sensitive method for isolating fusobacterium necrophorum from faeces.
AB  == the isolation of fusobacterium necrophorum present in small numbers in heavily contaminated material such as faeces or soil is hampered by the lack of an efficient selective medium and by the high minimum infective dose of the organism. a sensitive method for the detection and isolation of faecal strains of f. necrophorum type a was based on the subcutaneous injection of faeces, suspended (5% w/v) in broth culture of actinomyces (corynebacterium) pyogenes or  staphylococcus aureus to increase fusobacterial infectivity, into mice pretreated with clostridial antitoxins. when necrobacillosis developed f. necrophorum was identified microscopically in tissue from the advancing edge of the lesion and isolated on a partly selective medium. the enhancement of fusobacterial infectivity produced by a. pyogenes and by s. aureus was high, but the latter was slightly the more efficient, enabling as few as 80 f. necrophorum organisms/g of  faeces to be detected. use of the method showed that 3 of 16 wallabies had f. necrophorum in their faeces at the time of examination. numerous epidemiological  applications are suggested.

TI  == further observations on enhancement of the infectivity of fusobacterium necrophorum by other bacteria.
AB  == it had already been shown with a single virulent strain (a42) of fusobacterium necrophorum that suspension of the fusobacteria in sub-lethal doses of broth cultures of other bacteria reduced the minimum infective dose (greater than 10(6) organisms) for mice by subcutaneous inoculation, sometimes to less than 10 organisms. the present study extended the known range of bacteria with strong infectivity-enhancing properties to include bacillus cereus, klebsiella oxytoca and staphylococcus aureus; and those with weaker effect to include bacillus subtilis, 'bacteroides melaninogenicus', clostridium sporogenes, pasteurella haemolytica, and proteus mirabilis. the study also showed that five further virulent strains of f. necrophorum closely resembled a42 in respect of striking susceptibility to infectivity enhancement by escherichia coli. actinomyces (corynebacterium) pyogenes and s. aureus. one further strain (a6) of f. necrophorum resembled a42 in respect of strong infectivity enhancement by a. pyogenes, s. aureus, b. cereus and k. oxytoca but differed from it and the other  five strains in being only slightly affected by e. coli. this work was a necessary prelude to the development of a method, based on infectivity enhancement, for the detection and isolation of f. necrophorum present in small numbers in heavily contaminated material such as faeces.

TI  == epizootic of external and internal abscesses in a large goat herd over a 16-year  period.
AB  == from 1973 through 1988, 518 external and internal abscesses were diagnosed in a large commercial goat herd. of the 518 abscesses, 238 were primary and 280 were secondary abscesses in the same or other anatomic locations. during this period,  the herd varied in size from 94 goats in 1973 to 431 goats in 1988. abscesses in  the jaw area were detected in 141 goats, 4 of which developed osteomyelitis of the mandible. sternal abscesses were detected in 72 goats, with 2 also having osteomyelitis of the sternum diagnosed at necropsy. most of the abscesses were in the jaw, sternal, facial, and cervical areas. lung abscesses were diagnosed at necropsy in 20 goats that most recently had 1 or more superficial abscesses. abscess incidence was 27.6% (112 of 406) in wethers and 22.9% (154 of 687) in does. actinomyces pyogenes was isolated most frequently by bacteriologic culture  of abscess specimens and about 3 times as often as was corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis or staphylococcus sp, usually coagulase-positive s aureus. bacteriologic culture of blood samples, taken during abscess episodes, yielded a  pyogenes (n = 3) or c pseudotuberculosis (n = 1) in 3 goats. results of antibiotic treatment of abscesses were disappointing, with little evidence of altering the course of the disease or sterilizing the abscess, despite the fact that the bacteria were susceptible in vitro to the antibiotics used. excision of  intact abscesses was the preferred treatment for abscesses of the jaw and facial  areas.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the aim of this study was to determine an influence of udder infection on milk chloride level and on milk productivity of cows of black and white race. bacteriological analysis was performed by bacterial isolation from milk collected in sterile conditions from single lobes of mammary gland. the study was aimed to  detect the following bacteria: streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, actinomyces pyogenes, enterobacteriaceae rods, corynebacterium bovis, and micrococcus sp. milk chloride level was determined by burette method in 1250 milk samples collected from entire udder. milk productivity was determined on the day  of bacterial isolation. statistical analysis of the results of the study on udder infection, milk chloride level, and milk productivity of mammary gland did reveal lack of a simple correlations between those parameters and in the indirect manner indicated an influence of inappropriate maintenance conditions of tested cows on  the health condition of their udder. it seems possible that alkalosis and acidosis in cows, taken into consideration in discussion section, could constitute a factor influencing the frequency of mastitis incidence.

TI  == properties of a phosphocarrier protein (hpr) extracted from intact cells of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == cells of streptococcus sanguis strain challis were incubated with sodium lauroylsarcosinate to extract surface proteins. a polypeptide of apparent molecular mass 16 kda comprising about 12% of the extract was purified using anion-exchange chromatography. the polypeptide was shown to be a phosphocarrier protein (hpr) that could also be found in the soluble (cytoplasmic) fraction from cells broken by homogenization with glass beads. in vivo labelling of s. sanguis  cells with 32pi showed that the polypeptide carried a heat- and acid-stable phosphorylation and that during sucrose starvation the hpr became dephosphorylated. antiserum raised to the s. sanguis hpr reacted on western blots with hprs from all oral streptococci tested, together with strains of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius, but not with hprs from s. faecalis or s. bovis, nor with proteins from staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, actinomyces viscosus and  various lactobacilli. the s. sanguis hpr had a high content of alanine (17.2%) and was similar in overall amino acid composition to the hprs from s. mutans an s. salivarius. the n-terminal residues (to 37) of the s. sanguis hpr showed strong sequence identity (82%) with the n-terminal sequence of s. faecalis hpr. it is suggested that hpr in s. sanguis is associated closely with the cytoplasmic membrane. non-disruptive methods of removing cell-surface proteins from streptococci effect release of hpr and possibly other cytoplasmic components.

TI  == effect of freezing on bacteriologic culturing of mastitis milk samples.
AB  == the objective was to determine the effect of freezing and length of freezing in a commercial freezer on the qualitative results of bacteriologic culturing of milk  collected from glands of cows with clinical or subclinical intramammary infections. a total of 182 milk samples from cows with clinical mastitis and 55 milk samples of cows with subclinical mastitis were taken from four problem herds. samples were split into four equal sub-samples. three of these were frozen immediately at -20 degrees c and 1 was submitted fresh for bacteriologic analysis. at 4, 8, and 16 wk after collection, samples were thawed and submitted  for bacteriologic culturing. freezing and increased length of storage resulted in 1) a decrease in the number of samples that had cultures of escherichia coli or actinomyces pyogenes; and 2) an increase in the number of samples that had cultures of coagulase-negative staphylococci. freezing had no effect on streptococci and staphylococcus aureus.

AB  == milk samples (483,413 on the whole), collected from 237,026 cows, were investigated in the state veterinary institute at pardubice in the period from 1983 to 1987. in the individual years, the proportion of cows whose milk contained the mastitis-inducing bacteria ranged from 18.0 to 24.8%, the average being 21.0%. streptococcus agalactiae was identified most frequently as the causative agent of mastitis in the examined cows (6.4%); then followed streptococcus dysgalactiae (3.7%), staphylococcus aureus (3.4%), and streptococcus uberis (1.9%). the presence of the beta-haemolytic streptococci with group antigens c, g and l was demonstrated in the milk of 720 cows (i. e. 0.3%) and the remaining species of streptococci were identified in 1.0% of the cows. coliform microorganisms were detected in 0.6% and actinomyces pyogenes in 0.1% of the cows. the remaining bacterial species were isolated from the milk of  3.6% of the cows. coaglucase-negative staphylococci dominated in this group. over the five years of study, the occurrence of streptococcus agalactiae in the examined stocks declined from 10.8 to 3.5% but the occurrence of other streptococci and staphylococci increased.

AB  == procedures for lyzing staphylococcal cells with the use of ultrasound, lysozyme and a lytic enzyme complex of actinomyces recifensis var. lyticus, 2435 were compared. the lysis level was estimated by two parameters: lower optical density  and protein yield percentage. it was found that ultrasound provided rather high levels of cell destruction reaching 60-68 per cent. the use of lysozyme enabled to destroy 16 per cent of the cells. the enzyme complex of strain 2435 showed high lytic activity with respect to the tested culture. for destroying dense staphylococcal suspensions it appeared necessary to study the effect of preliminary treatment of the cells with various chemical substances on their liability to the effect of the enzyme complex. it was demonstrated that treatment of the cells with 0.01-0.1 m cystein hcl solutions, 0.01-0.02 m sodium dodecylsulfate solutions or 0.05-0.5 m sodium hydroxide solutions increased 2.6-4.7-fold the cell liability to enzymatic hydrolysis. the studies enabled to develop conditions providing complete lysis of 10-percent staphylococcal cell suspension within 5 to 15 minutes under the effect of the lytic enzyme complex of strain 2435. a procedure for isolating cell walls was developed.

TI  == immunoregulation in severe generalized periodontitis.
AB  == severe generalized periodontitis (sgp) is an inflammatory disease which leads to  extensive alveolar bone loss in young adults. peripheral blood lymphocytes from sgp patients have been previously reported to exhibit an in vitro hyperproliferative response when exposed to b cell mitogens derived from staphylococcus aureus and actinomyces viscosus. therefore hyperresponsiveness to  b-cell mitogens could be an important pathogenic factor in the susceptibility to  and progression of sgp. we have tested whether the hyperproliferative response of lymphocytes from sgp patients was due to (i) a functional deficiency of suppressor t cells, or (ii) to numerical alterations of lymphocytes. supernatant  fluids from concanavalin a-stimulated t cells from 14 sgp patients and 14 normal  subjects were compared for their ability to suppress the igm synthesis of b-cell  mitogen-stimulated mouse splenocytes. no significant differences were noted in suppressor t-cell function between control subjects and sgp patients. however, sgp patients had significantly higher lymphocyte counts than control subjects, and there was a positive correlation between high lymphocyte counts and high mitogen-stimulated proliferation. sgp patients also had higher lymphocyte:monocyte ratios than control subjects, suggesting that a defect in macrophage-mediated suppression might be involved in the hyperproliferation phenomenon. our data do not support the hypothesis that a suppressor t-cell defect is the cause of mitogen-induced hyperproliferative responsiveness of peripheral blood lymphocytes from sgp patients. rather, hyperproliferation may be due to an expansion of the lymphocyte pool which responds to mitogens, or/and a regulatory disturbance which arises because of altered lymphocyte:macrophage ratios.

TI  == mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. it also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. there is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits  ribonucleic acid synthesis. induction of bacterial l-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. stable l-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to  vancomycin. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant  strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), str. pyogenes, str. agalactiae, str. bovis, str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species and lactobacillus species. there has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against staph. aureus, str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. the combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of staph. epidermidis. it shows indifference against enterococci. vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against staph. aureus.

AB  == peptidoglycans and cells walls from actinomyces viscosus, staphylococcus aureus,  and group a streptococcus were compared for their relative abilities to activate  the alternate complement pathway (acp). on the dry-weight basis, the peptidoglycan from a. viscosus was 3.5 times more active than group a streptococcal peptidoglycan and 15.6 times more active than staph. aureus peptidoglycan in activating the acp. consequently a. viscosus peptidoglycan is one of the most potent acp-activators reported to date. for both a. viscosus and  group a streptococcus, the peptidoglycan was a better acp activator than cell walls from the same organism (125- and 52-fold, respectively) indicating that the peptidoglycan is probably the most important subcellular acp-activator in these microorganisms. in contrast, cell walls from staph, aureus were 9 times more active than peptidoglycan from staph. aureus in activating the acp, presumably because teichoic acids are the most important subcellular acp activator in this microorganism.

AB  == bacterial-neutrophil interactions may be critical determinants of virulence in periodontal diseases. this study was undertaken to examine the ability of major bacterial species from the human oral cavity to inhibit (1) peripheral blood neutrophil chemotaxis, (2) chemotactic formylmethionyl peptide binding, and (3) phagocytosis. included were cultured supernatants and sonic extracts obtained from strains of capnocytophaga, bacteroides gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum,  bacteroides asaccharolyticus, capnocytophaga species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, neisseria, actinomyces viscosus, bacterionema matruchotii, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguis. chemotaxis  was measured using boyden chambers; phagocytosis was determined using staphylococcus aureus as the indicator organism and radioactive chemotactic peptide binding was assessed by a rapid filtration assay. none of the test organisms were cytotoxic to neutrophils or inhibited neutrophil phagocytosis. capnocytophaga species., bacteroides species., a. actinomycetemcomitans, and f. nucleatum produced factors which specifically inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis. activity was lost after dialysis. extracts of bacteroides species, a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum, which were not chemotactic by themselves, inhibited binding of chemotactic peptide suggesting that in vitro chemotaxis inhibition was mediated by nonchemotactic components that compete for the chemotactic factor receptor on the neutrophil. the exception was capnocytophaga which appeared to inhibit chemotaxis by inhibition of a post-binding event. such  chemotactic inhibitors from periodontopathic organisms that inhibit neutrophil function may be important determinants of virulence.

TI  == recovery of microorganisms from synovial and pleural fluids of animals using hyperosmolar media.
AB  == l-phase (cwd) broth and plate media were used in parallel with conventional microbiological media during a 3-year period for culturing synovial and pleural fluids of animals. two kinds of recoveries were obtained where parallel conventional methods were negative: (1) parent or normal bacteria, in very low numbers; and (2) type b cwd variants in equally low numbers. organisms in group 1 were: streptococcus zooepidemicus from horses (2x); beta-hemolytic streptococci,  lancefield gp. g (2x); staphylococcus aureus; actinobacillus, and actinomyces viscosus. group 2 consisted of bacteroides sp., propionibacterium acnes, and three "nocardia-like" sp. catalase + actinomyces was not recovered equally well on cwd plates as on conventional media with fluids obtained during ampicillin treatment. this occurred in spite of the fact that the cwd media was shown to support growth and reversion of laboratory induced l-phase variants of nocardia caviae and n. asteroides, and had facilitated recovery of a bacteroides l-phase variant from a pleural fluid. the nature of this fault in the media is under investigation in this laboratory.

TI  == the antibacterial action of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin inhibits the second stage of cell wall synthesis in susceptible bacteria. furthermore, there is evidence that vancomycin also alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. stable l-phase variants are susceptible to vancomycin, but induction of bacterial l-phase variants with vancomycin is very difficult. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive cocci and bacilli, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (including multiply resistant strains). streptococcus  pneumoniae (including multiply resistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus bovis, viridans group streptococcus, enterococcus, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species, and lactobacillus species. antimicrobial activity can be enhanced with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against s. aureus, s. bovis, enterococcus, and viridans streptococcus. the combination of vancomycin and rifampin also has enhanced activity against s. aureus.

TI  == effect of human saliva on glucose uptake by streptococcus mutans and other oral microorganisms.
AB  == we examined the effects of human whole salivary supernatant and parotid fluid on  glucose uptake by streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the following three effects of saliva were observed: (i) inhibition of glucose uptake (s. mutans, s. sanguis), (ii) promotion of a transient, rapid (0 to 30 s) burst of glucose uptake (s. mutans, s. sanguis), and (iii) enhancement of glucose uptake (s. mitis, a. viscosus, s. aureus, e. coli). we observed no differences between the effects of whole salivary supernatant and the effects of parotid fluid. heat treatment (80 degrees c, 10 min) of saliva or the addition of dithiothreitol abolished inhibition of glucose uptake. supplementation of saliva  with h(2)o(2) potentiated inhibition of glucose uptake. s. mitis and a. viscosus, which were stimulated by saliva alone, were inhibited by h(2)o(2)-supplemented saliva; 50% inhibition of glucose uptake by s. mutans and s. mitis required ca. 10 mum h(2)o(2) in 50% (vol/vol) saliva. loss of the inhibitory action of saliva  occurred at about 5% (vol/vol) saliva. supplementation of saliva dilutions with scn(-) and h(2)o(2) extended the inhibitory activity to solutions containing ca.  0.2% (vol/vol) saliva. we suggest that the salivary lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system is responsible for the inhibitory activity of saliva reported here. furthermore, we concluded that lactoperoxidase and scn(-) are present in saliva specimens in concentrations that exceed minimal inhibitory levels by factors of ca. 500 and 10 to 20, respectively. the resistance of a. viscosus, s. aureus, and e. coli to the inhibitory potential of  saliva alone was probably due to the production of catalase by these organisms. the resistance of s. mitis may have been due to special effects of saliva on h(2)o(2) accumulation by this organism compared with s. mutans and s. sanguis. the basis of saliva-dependent enhancement of glucose uptake and the basis of promotion of a transient, rapid burst of glucose uptake are unknown. the role of  the salivary lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system in the oral microbial ecosystem is discussed.

TI  == bacteriolytic activity of human gingival exudate.
AB  == we investigated the bacteriolytic activity of gingival crevicular fluid (cf) on 14c-labeled streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus,  and on whole dental plaque. cf was collected from 100 healthy donors pooled and centrifuged at 200 g. cf supernate and a frozen and thawed extract of the pellet  were interacted with the different bacterial strains, while streptococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus released 60% and 75% of the radioactive label, only 38% of it was solubilized from streptococcus mutans, following their incubation with the cf supernate. the findings agreed with results obtained by interacting bacteria with a frozen and thawed lysate of human peripheral blood leukocytes. on the other hand, extracts from frozen and thawed cf pellet were inactive. further, lipoteichoic acid and lipopolysaccharide were released by cf from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. the role of bacteriolytic factors, present in cf, as a result of the interaction between microorganisms and leukocytes at inflammatory sites is discussed.

TI  == heterotrophic nitrification by intestinal microorganisms.
AB  == from studies of nitrate balance in man and analyses of fecal and ileostomy samples, the possibility that nitrite and nitrate are formed de novo in the intestine, possibly by heterotrophic nitrification has emerged. this proposition  significantly alters our previous conceptions of man's exposure to nitrite and suggests that nitrite may play a role in the cause of intestinal cancer. heterotrophic nitrification has been demonstrated in various microorganisms. our  work has shown that intestinal heterotrophic microbial isolates from man are able to oxidize nitrogenous compounds to nitrite. these isolates include both procaryotes and eucaryotes.

TI  == skin and soft tissue polymicrobial infections from intravenous abuse of drugs.
AB  == skin and soft tissue infections were studied in 21 seriously ill narcotic addicts who had been admitted to hospital. subcutaneous abscesses were present in 14 patients; cellulitis was noted in 3, pyomyositis in 2 and necrotizing fasciitis in 2. in four patients there was septicemia. infections in 14 patients (66.6 percent) were associated with anaerobic bacteria, which were the exclusive isolates in 6 patients. in seven patients (33.3 percent) isolates were exclusively aerobic bacteria and in eight both aerobes and anaerobes were present. the anaerobic isolates were clostridia (six), peptostreptococci (five),  bacteroides (five), peptococci (three), and one of each of veillonella, propionibacterium, eubacterium, fusobacterium and actinomyces. staphylococcus aureus, generally thought to be the most common cause of subcutaneous infections  in addicts, was found only in four (19 percent) patients. the other aerobic isolates were klebsiella (five) and enterobacter (four) species. when clinical features or the gram stain of pus suggest that anaerobic bacteria may be present, antibiotic therapy should be directed against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria until culture results are available.

TI  == immunoadjuvant activities of cell walls and their water-soluble fractions prepared from various gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the cell walls from all 21 species of gram-positive bacteria examined, except lysozyme-susceptible micrococcus lysodeikticus (nctc 2665) and lysozyme-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (atcc 155), were found to be definitely adjuvant-active in both stimulation of increased serum antibody levels and induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity to ovalbumin when administered to guinea-pigs as water-in-oil emulsions. using various cell wall lytic enzymes, the immunoadjuvant principles were solubilized with full retention of the adjuvant activities from walls of staphylococcus aureus (copenhagen), streptococcus pyogens (group a, type 6; s43/100), streptococcus salivarius (ifo 3350), streptococcus faecalis (ifo 12580), streptococcus mutans (bht), lactobacillus plantarum (atcc 8014), bacillus megaterium (ifo 12068), corynebacterium diphtheriae (park-williams no. 8), mycobacterium smegmatis, and actinomyces viscous (atcc 15987). evidence was obtained that the non-peptidoglycan portion of the cell walls is not essential for manifestation of immunoadjuvancy.

TI  == toxic properties of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the biological activity of odontomyces viscosus, which has been reported to cause periodontal disease in hamsters, was examined. the microorganism was cultured anaerobically in brain heart infusion broth, and the cells were harvested. the washed cells were injected intradermally into the abdomen of rabbits. after 72 hr, a well-defined, firm, raised nodule (about 1.0 by 1.5 cm) with an erythematous border was seen at the injection site. suspensions of cell wall and  cytoplasmic material were injected intradermally, and the lesions appeared only at the site of cell wall injection. the cell walls, which were then treated with  trypsin, pepsin, and ribonuclease, again produced the characteristic lesion. these nodular dermal lesions persisted for a minimal time of 10 days. the enzymatically treated cell walls were then hydrolyzed with 1 n hcl, and such hydrolysis up to 1 hr failed to alter the toxic activity of the cell walls. similar dermal nodular lesions were obtained by injection of enzymatically treated cell walls of strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus groups b, c, e, f, k, lactobacillus casei, and actinomyces israelii. treatment with hot and cold trichloroacetic acid solutions and proteolytic enzymes, or with formamide, yielded insoluble fractions which produced the characteristic nodular lesions. the size of the lesion resulting from injection of these fractions was proportional to the amount of the injected material. the active fraction, which does not appear susceptible to hydrolysis by lysozyme, is thought to be cell wall mucopeptide. histological studies showed skin abscesses due to the toxic reaction; however, in addition to the acute inflammatory reaction, there was local eosinophilia.
