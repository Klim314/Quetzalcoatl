TI  == recently described clinically important anaerobic bacteria: medical aspects.
AB  == there is still inadequate information on the role of certain newly described or reclassified anaerobes in disease processes, on their normal sites of carriage, and on their antimicrobial susceptibilities. herein, we summarize this information (most of the literature reviewed is from the past 5 years, but a few  of the articles are approximately 10 years old). porphyromonas species had seemed to be relatively nonpathogenic, but recent work indicates that this belief is incorrect. p. gingivalis, p levii-like organisms, and p. endodontalis-like organisms have been recovered from a variety of oral and extraoral infections. p. macacae has been recovered from infected cat bite wounds. sutterella wadsworthensis, recently differentiated from campylobacter gracilis, has been found in a variety of infections. bilophila wadsworthia has also been recovered from a wide variety of infections. newly described anaerobic cocci, gram-positive nonsporeforming rods, and clostridia have also been isolated from various infections.
