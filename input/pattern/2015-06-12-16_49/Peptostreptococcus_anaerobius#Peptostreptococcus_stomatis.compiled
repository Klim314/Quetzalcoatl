TI  - Peptostreptococcus russellii sp. nov., isolated from a swine-manure storage pit.
AB  - Using a polyphasic approach, a taxonomic study was performed on seven strains of  an unknown Gram-reaction-positive, non-spore-forming, obligately anaerobic coccus-shaped bacterium, isolated from a swine-manure storage pit. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing confirmed that all seven isolates were highly related to each other and formed a hitherto unknown lineage within the clostridial rRNA XI cluster of organisms. Pairwise analysis demonstrated that the novel organism was most closely related to Peptostreptococcus anaerobius CCUG 7835(T) and Peptostreptococcus stomatis CCUG 51858(T) with 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 95.5 and 93.0 %, respectively. The peptidoglycan type of the cell wall was determined to be A4alpha l-Lys-d-Asp and glucose, xylose and traces of mannose were detected as the cell-wall sugars. Based on biochemical, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic evidence the unknown bacterium represents a new species of the genus Peptostreptococcus, for which the name Peptostreptococcus russellii sp. nov, is proposed. The type strain is RT-10B(T) ( = CCUG 58235(T) = NRRL B-59380(T) = DSM 23041(T)).
TI  - Development of 16S rRNA-based probes for the identification of Gram-positive anaerobic cocci isolated from human clinical specimens.
AB  - Fluorescent probes targeted at 16S rRNA were designed for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptostreptococcus stomatis (Pana134), Parvimonas micra (Pamic1435), Finegoldia magna (Fmag1250), Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus (Pnasa1254), Peptoniphilus ivorii (Pnivo731), Peptoniphilus harei (Pnhar1466), Anaerococcus vaginalis (Avag1280) and Anaerococcus lactolyticus (Alac1438), based on the 16S rRNA sequences of reference strains and 88 randomly chosen clinical isolates. These strains were also used for validation of the probes. Application of the probes to an additional group of 100 clinical isolates revealed that 87% of Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) could be identified with this set of probes. The 16S rRNAs of 13 clinical isolates that could not be identified were sequenced. Most of these isolates were GPAC that were not targeted by the probes. No clinical isolates of Pn. asaccharolyticus were encountered. Near full-length sequences were obtained from 71 of 101 (n = 88 + 13) sequenced clinical isolates. Of these, 25 showed <98% similarity with the homologues of the closest established species. The Fmag1250, Pamic1435, Pnhar1466, Pana134, Pnasa1254 and Pnivo731 probes allowed reliable identification and hybridised with all corresponding isolates. The Avag1280 and Alac1438 probes failed to hybridise with two isolates and one isolate, respectively, because of intra-species variation. However, overall, the set of probes yielded fast and reliable identification for the majority of clinical isolates.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and the newly described Peptostreptococcus stomatis isolated from various human sources.
AB  - Peptostreptococcus anaerobius sensu lato, currently including two closely related species, P. anaerobius and P. stomatis, is known to be more resistant than other gram-positive anaerobic cocci. We reidentified potential Peptostreptococcus isolates and tested their susceptibilities to eight antimicrobials. Notably, P. anaerobius had constantly higher values for the MIC at which 50% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC(50)) and the MIC(90) than P. stomatis.
TI  - Peptostreptococcus stomatis sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity.
AB  - Seven strains of anaerobic Gram-positive cocci isolated from human oral sites were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the strains constituted a homogeneous group that was distinct from species with validly published names, but related to Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. All oral strains tested belonged to this group, whereas all non-oral strains studied were confirmed as P. anaerobius. A novel species, Peptostreptococcus stomatis sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate these oral strains. P. stomatis is weakly saccharolytic and produces acetic, butyric, isobutyric, isovaleric and isocaproic acids as end products of fermentation. The type strain of P. stomatis is W2278T (=DSM 17678T = CCUG 51858T); the G+C content of the DNA of this strain is 36 mol%.
