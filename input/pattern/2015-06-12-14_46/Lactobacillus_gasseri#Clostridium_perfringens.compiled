TI  - The effect of a Bacillus-based direct-fed microbial supplemented to sows on the gastrointestinal microbiota of their neonatal piglets.
AB  - Direct-fed microbials (DFM) supplemented in sow diets may confer health benefits  to the host and their piglets by reducing pathogens in the sow and environment. In this study we evaluated the effect of a Bacillus-based DFM on the gastrointestinal microbiota of neonatal piglets. A total of 208 sows were divided into 2 treatments: a control diet and the control diet supplemented with a Bacillus subtilis-based DFM (3.75 x 10(5) cfu/g feed). Twenty-one piglets sampled from each sow treatment group were euthanized on d 3 of lactation followed by an additional 15 piglets per treatment on d 10 of lactation. Litters from DFM-supplemented sows had greater (P = 0.02) weaning weights and a tendency (P = 0.09) for improvement in litter ADG. Sows supplemented with the DFM weaned more pigs (P = 0.06) than control sows which was reflected in numerically lower but not statistically different (P = 0.12) decrease in piglet mortality in DFM litters. Terminal RFLP was used to characterize gastrointestinal (GI) microbial populations in the ileum and colon of the piglets. Terminal restriction fragments (T-RF) were compared between control and DFM treatments. There was a greater incidence and quantity of T-RF B423 and H330 (binary P = 0.01, 0.08; quantitative P = 0.01, 0.05, respectively), putatively identified as Lactobacillus gasseri/johnsonii, in the ileum of pigs nursing sows supplemented with DFM at d 3. Terminal restriction fragment peaks B423 and H330 were also greater (binary P = 0.01, 0.08; quantitative P = 0.01, 0.01, respectively) in the colon of pigs nursing sows supplemented with DFM at d 3. Peaks M495 and B394, putatively identified as E. coli, were greater (binary P = 0.01, 0.04; quantitative P = 0.01, 0.01, respectively) in the colon of the control pigs at d 3. At d 10, both the presence and quantity of Lactobacillus species were greater (P < 0.05) in the colon of pigs with the DFM treatment. Additionally, there was a tendency for T-RF B227 and H257 (binary P = 0.07, 0.07, respectively), putatively identified as Clostridium perfringens, to be present in the ileum of the control pigs at d 10 compared with treated pigs. Results of this study reveal that the developing gastrointestinal microbiota of a neonatal piglet can be affected by DFM supplementation to the sow.
TI  - Possibility of preventing colorectal carcinogenesis with probiotics.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: There have been no reports on the relationship between the analyses of the intestinal flora of colorectal cancer patients and colorectal carcinogenesis. In this study we investigated the differences between the intestinal flora of colorectal cancer patients and healthy subjects and assessed the possibility of using probiotics to prevent colorectal carcinogenesis. METHODOLOGY: The subjects were 10 colorectal cancer patients and 20 healthy persons. A stool specimen and peripheral blood specimen were collected from the patients and 10 of the healthy subjects to analyze their intestinal flora and measure natural killer (NK) cell activity and IL-1 beta in their blood. Probiotics (Lactobacillus gasseri OLL2716: LG21) was then administered once daily to 10 of the healthy subjects for 12 weeks. Samples were collected after 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks of administration, and the same examinations were performed. RESULTS: The Lactobacillus detection rate was significantly higher in the healthy group than in the colorectal cancer group, and the total Clostridium perfringens was higher in the colorectal cancer group. The stool pH of the colorectal cancer group indicated alkalosis, and the total amount of short-chain fatty acids in the stools tended to be lower than in the healthy group. After ingestion of the probiotic, the Lactobacillus detection rate increased, a decrease in the total amount of Clostridium perfringens was seen, fecal pH indicated acidosis, synthesis of fecal putrefaction products was inhibited, and an increase in the short-chain fatty acid isobutyric acid was observed. The blood IL-1 beta and NK cell activity values were significantly higher from the 4th week onward than the values before ingestion of probiotics. CONCLUSIONS: A deterioration of the intestinal environment was observed in the colorectal cancer patients in comparison to the healthy controls, and the intestinal environment improved when probiotics was taken. These findings suggest the possibility of preventing colorectal carcinoma with probiotics.
TI  - Genetic characterization of the beta-glucuronidase enzyme from a human intestinal bacterium, Ruminococcus gnavus.
AB  - beta-Glucuronidase activity (encoded by the gus gene) has been characterized for  the first time from Ruminococcus gnavus E1, an anaerobic bacterium belonging to the dominant human gut microbiota. beta-Glucuronidase activity plays a major role in the generation of toxic and carcinogenic metabolites in the large intestine, as well as in the absorption and enterohepatic circulation of many aglycone residues with protective effects, such as lignans, flavonoids, ceramide and glycyrrhetinic acid, that are liberated by the hydrolysis of the corresponding glucuronides. The complete nucleotide sequence of a 4537 bp DNA fragment containing the beta-glucuronidase locus from R. gnavus E1 was determined. Five ORFs were detected on this fragment: three complete ORFs (ORF2, gus and ORF3) and two partial ORFs (ORF4 and ORF5). The products of ORF2 and ORF3 show strong similarities with many beta-glucoside permeases of the phosphoenolpyruvate : beta-glucoside phosphotransferase systems (PTSs), such as Escherichia coli BglC, Bacillus subtilis BglP and Bacillus halodurans PTS Enzyme II. The product of ORF5 presents strong similarities with the amino-terminal domain of Clostridium acetobutylicum beta-glucosidase (bglA). The gus gene product presents similarities with several known beta-glucuronidase enzymes, including those of Lactobacillus gasseri (69%), E. coli (61%), Clostridium perfringens (59%) and Staphylococcus aureus (58%). By complementing an E. coli strain in which the uidA gene encoding the enzyme was deleted, it was confirmed that the R. gnavus gus gene encodes the beta-glucuronidase enzyme. Moreover, it was found that the gus gene was transcribed as part of an operon that includes ORF2, ORF3 and ORF5.
