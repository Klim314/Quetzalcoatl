TI  == mercuric resistance genes in gram-positive oral bacteria.
AB  == mercury-resistant bacteria isolated from the oral cavities of children carried one of two types of mera gene that appear to have evolved from a common ancestor. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis and a few other species had mera genes  that were very similar to mera of bacillus cereus strain rc607. unlike the b. cereus rc607 mera gene, however, the streptococcal mera genes were not carried on tn5084-like transposons. instead, comparisons with microbial genomic sequences suggest the mera gene is located on a novel type ii transposon. coagulase-negative staphylococci and streptococcus parasanguis had identical mera genes that represent a new mera variant.

TI  == rpob gene sequence-based identification of aerobic gram-positive cocci of the genera streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, abiotrophia, and granulicatella.
AB  == we developed a new molecular tool based on rpob gene (encoding the beta subunit of rna polymerase) sequencing to identify streptococci. we first sequenced the complete rpob gene for streptococcus anginosus, s. equinus, and abiotrophia defectiva. sequences were aligned with these of s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. pneumoniae available in genbank. using an in-house analysis program (svarap),  we identified a 740-bp variable region surrounded by conserved, 20-bp zones and,  by using these conserved zones as pcr primer targets, we amplified and sequenced  this variable region in an additional 30 streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, granulicatella, and abiotrophia species. this region exhibited 71.2 to 99.3% interspecies homology. we therefore applied our identification system by pcr amplification and sequencing to a collection of 102 streptococci and 60 bacterial isolates belonging to other genera. amplicons were obtained in streptococci and bacillus cereus, and sequencing allowed us to make a correct identification of streptococci. molecular signatures were determined for the discrimination of closely related species within the s. pneumoniae-s. oralis-s. mitis group and the s. agalactiae-s. difficile group. these signatures allowed us to design a s. pneumoniae-specific pcr and sequencing primer pair.
