TI  == murdochiella asaccharolytica gen. nov., sp. nov., a gram-stain-positive, anaerobic coccus isolated from human wound specimens.
AB  == two strains of previously unknown gram-stain-positive, anaerobic, coccus-shaped bacteria from human wound specimens were characterized using phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing studies and distinguishable biochemical characteristics demonstrated that these two unknown strains, wal 1855c(t) and wal 2038e, are genotypically homogeneous and constitute a novel lineage within clostridium cluster xiii. there was 13-14 % 16s rrna gene  sequence divergence between the novel strains and the most closely related species, parvimonas micra, finegoldia magna and species of helcococcus. based on  the phenotypic and phylogenetic findings, a novel genus and species, murdochiella asaccharolytica gen. nov., sp. nov., are proposed. strain wal 1855c(t) (=atcc baa-1631(t) =ccug 55976(t)) is the type strain of murdochiella asaccharolytica.
