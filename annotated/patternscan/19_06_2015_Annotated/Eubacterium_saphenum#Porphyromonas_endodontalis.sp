TI  == new bacterial species associated with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == recent investigations of the human subgingival oral flora based on ribosomal 16s  cloning and sequencing have shown many of the bacterial species present to be novel species or phylotypes. the purpose of the present investigation was to identify potential periodontal pathogens among these newly identified species and phylotypes. species-specific ribosomal 16s primers for pcr amplification were developed for detection of new species. associations with chronic periodontitis were observed for several new species or phylotypes, including uncultivated clones d084 and bh017 from the deferribacteres phylum, au126 from the bacteroidetes phylum, megasphaera clone bb166, clone x112 from the op11 phylum, and clone i025 from the tm7 phylum, and the named species eubacterium saphenum, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola, and cryptobacterium curtum. species or phylotypes more prevalent in periodontal health included two uncultivated phylotypes, clone w090 from the deferribacteres phylum and clone bu063 from the bacteroidetes, and named species atopobium rimae and atopobium parvulum.

TI  == recently described clinically important anaerobic bacteria: taxonomic aspects and update.
AB  == a new method of identifying bacteria, phylogenetic 16s rrna sequencing, has led to major reorganizations among most genera of anaerobic bacteria. the pigmented prevotella species now comprise seven species including p. nigrescens and p. tannerae; p. intermedia/p. nigrescens-like organisms await inclusion. the former  mitsuokella dentalis and hallella seregens were transferred to prevotella as one  species, p. dentalis. p. enoeca is a new nonpigmenting prevotella. the genus porphyromonas currently includes 11 pigmented species and one nonpigmented species, p. catoniae; p. levii-like and p. endodontalis-like organisms are candidates for the genus. fusobacterium nucleatum currently has five subspecies,  and f. varium includes the former f. pseudonecrophorum. former wolinella recta and wolinella curva now are campylobacter rectus and campylobacter curvus; campylobacter showae is a new species. isolates included in the bile-sensitive former bacteroides gracilis now are campylobacter gracilis; the bile-resistant b. gracilis isolates were transferred to a new genus, sutterella, as s. wadsworthensis. the new actinomyces species include two subspecies of the a. neuii and the a. radingae-a. turicensis complex. the genus eubacterium sensu stricto is represented by e. limosum, and the former e. alactolyticum was reclassified in a new genus, pseudoramibacter, as p. alactolyticus. recent entries include e. saphenum, e. minutum, e. exiguum, e. infirmum, and e. tardum.  a new genus, atopobium houses some former lactobacilli and streptococci. the genus peptostreptococcus also have four new species; p. hydrogenalis, p. lacrimalis, p. lactolyticus, and p. vaginalis.
