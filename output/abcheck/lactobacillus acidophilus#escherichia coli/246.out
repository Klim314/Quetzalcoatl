purification and characterization of a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus ibb 801.
lactobacillus acidophilus ibb 801 produces a small bacteriocin, designated acidophilin 801, with an estimated molecular mass of less than 6.5 kda.
it displays a narrow inhibitory spectrum (only related lactobacilli but including the gram-negative pathogenic bacteria escherichia coli row and salmonella panama 1467) with a bactericidal activity.
the antimicrobial activity of cell-free culture supernatant fluid was insensitive to catalase but sensitive to proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin, proteinase k and pronase, heat-stable (30 min at 121 degrees c), and maintained in a wide ph range.
the proteinaceous compound was isolated from cell-free culture supernatant fluid and purified.
crude bacteriocin was isolated as a floating pellicle after ammonium sulphate precipitation (40% saturation) and partially purified by extraction/precipitation with chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v).
further purification to homogeneity was performed by reversed phase fast performance liquid chromatography.
the amino acid composition was determined.
amino acid sequencing revealed that the n-terminal end was blocked.
