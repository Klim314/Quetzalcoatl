TI  == culture-dependent and -independent methods to investigate the microbial ecology of italian fermented sausages.
AB  == in this study, the microbial ecology of three naturally fermented sausages produced in northeast italy was studied by culture-dependent and -independent methods. by plating analysis, the predominance of lactic acid bacteria populations was pointed out, as well as the importance of coagulase-negative cocci. also in the case of one fermentation, the fecal enterocci reached significant counts, highlighting their contribution to the particular transformation process. yeast counts were higher than the detection limit (> 100  cfu/g) in only one fermented sausage. analysis of the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) patterns and sequencing of the bands allowed profiling of  the microbial populations present in the sausages during fermentation. the bacterial ecology was mainly characterized by the stable presence of lactobacillus curvatus and lactobacillus sakei, but lactobacillus paracasei was also repeatedly detected. an important piece of evidence was the presence of lactococcus garvieae, which clearly contributed in two fermentations. several species of staphylococcus were also detected. regarding other bacterial groups, bacillus sp., ruminococcus sp., and macrococcus caseolyticus were also identified at the beginning of the transformations. in addition, yeast species belonging to  debaryomyces hansenii, several candida species, and willopsis saturnus were observed in the dgge gels. finally, cluster analysis of the bacterial and yeast dgge profiles highlighted the uniqueness of the fermentation processes studied.
