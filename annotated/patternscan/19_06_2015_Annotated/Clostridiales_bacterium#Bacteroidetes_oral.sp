TI  == stool microbiota and vaccine responses of infants.
AB  == objective: oral vaccine efficacy is low in less-developed countries, perhaps due  to intestinal dysbiosis. this study determined if stool microbiota composition predicted infant oral and parenteral vaccine responses. methods: the stool microbiota of 48 bangladeshi infants was characterized at 6, 11, and 15 weeks of  age by amplification and sequencing of the 16s ribosomal rna gene v4 region and by bifidobacterium-specific, quantitative polymerase chain reaction. responses to oral polio virus (opv), bacille calmette-guerin (bcg), tetanus toxoid (tt), and hepatitis b virus vaccines were measured at 15 weeks by using vaccine-specific t-cell proliferation for all vaccines, the delayed-type hypersensitivity skin-test response for bcg, and immunoglobulin g responses using the antibody in  lymphocyte supernatant method for opv, tt, and hepatitis b virus. thymic index (ti) was measured by ultrasound. results: actinobacteria (predominantly bifidobacterium longum subspecies infantis) dominated the stool microbiota, with  proteobacteria and bacteroidetes increasing by 15 weeks. actinobacteria abundance was positively associated with t-cell responses to bcg, opv, and tt; with the delayed-type hypersensitivity response; with immunoglobulin g responses; and with ti. b longum subspecies infantis correlated positively with ti and several vaccine responses. bacterial diversity and abundance of enterobacteriales, pseudomonadales, and clostridiales were associated with neutrophilia and lower vaccine responses. conclusions: bifidobacterium predominance may enhance thymic development and responses to both oral and parenteral vaccines early in infancy,  whereas deviation from this pattern, resulting in greater bacterial diversity, may cause systemic inflammation (neutrophilia) and lower vaccine responses. vaccine responsiveness may be improved by promoting intestinal bifidobacteria and minimizing dysbiosis early in infancy.

TI  == study of inter- and intra-individual variations in the salivary microbiota.
AB  == background: oral bacterial communities contain species that promote health and others that have been implicated in oral and/or systemic diseases. culture-independent approaches provide the best means to assess the diversity of  oral bacteria because most of them remain uncultivable. results: the salivary microbiota from five adults was analyzed at three time-points by means of the 454 pyrosequencing technology. the v1-v3 region of the bacterial 16s rrna genes was amplified by pcr using saliva lysates and broad-range primers. the bar-coded pcr  products were pooled and sequenced unidirectionally to cover the v3 hypervariable region. of 50,708 obtained sequences, 31,860 passed the quality control. non-bacterial sequences (2.2%) were removed leaving 31,170 reads. samples were dominated by seven major phyla: members of firmicutes, proteobacteria, actinobacteria, bacteroidetes and candidate division tm7 were identified in all samples; fusobacteria and spirochaetes were identified in all individuals, but not at all time-points. the dataset was represented by 3,011 distinct sequences (100%-id phylotypes) of ~215 nucleotides and 583 phylotypes defined at >/=97% identity (97%-id phylotypes). we compared saliva samples from different individuals in terms of the phylogeny of their microbial communities. based on the presence and absence of phylotypes defined at 100% or 97% identity thresholds, samples from each subject formed separate clusters. among individual  taxa, phylum bacteroidetes and order clostridiales (firmicutes) were the best indicators of intraindividual similarity of the salivary flora over time. fifteen out of 81 genera constituted 73 to 94% of the total sequences present in different samples. of these, 8 were shared by all time points of all individuals, while 15-25 genera were present in all three time-points of different individuals. representatives of the class sphingobacteria, order sphingobacteriales and family clostridiaceae were found only in one subject. conclusions: the salivary microbial community appeared to be stable over at least 5 days, allowing for subject-specific grouping using unifrac. inclusion of all available samples from more distant time points (up to 29 days) confirmed this observation. samples taken at closer time intervals were not necessarily more similar than samples obtained across longer sampling times. these results point to the persistence of subject-specific taxa whose frequency fluctuates between the time points. genus gemella, identified in all time-points of all individuals, was not defined as a core-microbiome genus in previous studies of salivary bacterial communities. human oral microbiome studies are still in their infancy and larger-scale projects are required to better define individual and universal  oral microbiome core.

TI  == identification of bacteria in endodontic infections by sequence analysis of 16s rdna clone libraries.
AB  == a significant proportion of oral bacteria are unable to undergo cultivation by existing techniques. in this regard, the microbiota from root canals still requires complementary characterization. the present study aimed at the identification of bacteria by sequence analysis of 16s rdna clone libraries from  seven endodontically infected teeth. samples were collected from the root canals, subjected to the pcr with universal 16s rdna primers, cloned and partially sequenced. clones were clustered into groups of closely related sequences (phylotypes) and identification to the species level was performed by comparative analysis with the genbank, embl and ddbj databases, according to a 98% minimum identity. all samples were positive for bacteria and the number of phylotypes detected per subject varied from two to 14. the majority of taxa (65.2%) belonged to the phylum firmicutes of the gram-positive bacteria, followed by proteobacteria (10.9%), spirochaetes (4.3%), bacteroidetes (6.5%), actinobacteria (2.2%) and deferribacteres (2.2%). a total of 46 distinct taxonomic units was identified. four clones with low similarity to sequences previously deposited in  the databases were sequenced to nearly full extent and were classified taxonomically as novel representatives of the order clostridiales, including a putative novel species of mogibacterium. the identification of novel phylotypes associated with endodontic infections suggests that the endodontium may still harbour a relevant proportion of uncharacterized taxa.
