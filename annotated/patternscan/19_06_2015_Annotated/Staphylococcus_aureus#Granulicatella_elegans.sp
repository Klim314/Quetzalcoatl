TI  == helcococcus ovis, an emerging pathogen in bovine valvular endocarditis.
AB  == the initial isolation of helcococcus ovis from a valvular thrombus prompted us to investigate the prevalence of this bacterium in bovine valvular endocarditis. specimens from 55 affected hearts were examined by culture using columbia blood agar and cross streaking the inoculated plate with a staphylococcus aureus strain. as confirmed by 16s rrna gene sequencing, h. ovis was isolated with an unexpectedly high frequency of 33%, predominantly as heavy growth and pure culture. the majority of h. ovis isolates showed distinct satellitism around s. aureus and pyridoxal dependency, resembling "nutritionally variant streptococci"  (now assigned to the genera abiotrophia and granulicatella). using the api rapid  id 32 strep, api zym, and rosco diatabs systems, incongruent results were obtained for alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, beta-glucuronidase, and leucine aminopeptidase activities. based on the satellitism/pyridoxal dependency; hemolysis on blood agar; the api rapid id 32 strep results for arginine dihydrolase, alpha-galactosidase, beta-galactosidase, beta-glucuronidase, and pyroglutamic acid arylamidase activities; hippurate hydrolysis; and acidification of sucrose, a scheme for the identification of h. ovis and its differentiation from other members of the helcococcus genus and the pyridoxal-dependent species abiotrophia defectiva, granulicatella adiacens, and granulicatella elegans is proposed. by establishing specific fluorescence in situ hybridization, large h. ovis aggregates were specifically detected within the fibrinous exudate of the valvular thrombi. our results demonstrate for the first time that h. ovis represents an emerging pathogen in bovine valvular endocarditis that is frequently isolated if appropriate culture conditions are used.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial flora associated with chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses.
AB  == chronic maxillary sinusitis is a chronic inflammatory condition in which the role of microbial infection remains undefined. bacteria have been isolated from chronically inflamed sinuses; however, their role in the chronicity of inflammation is unknown. the objective of this study was to determine whether bacteria are present in clinical samples from chronic maxillary sinusitis and to  assess the diversity of the flora present. washes and/or tissue samples from endoscopic sinus surgery on 11 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis were subjected to pcr amplification of bacterial 16s rdna using three universal primer pairs, followed by cloning and sequencing. the samples were also assessed for the presence of bacteria and fungi by conventional culture methods. viable bacteria and/or bacterial 16s rdna were detected from maxillary sinus samples of five of the 11 patients examined (45 %). three sinus samples were positive by both pcr and culture methods, one was positive only by pcr, and one only by culture. thirteen bacterial species were identified: abiotrophia defectiva, enterococcus avium, eubacterium sp., granulicatella elegans, neisseria sp., prevotella sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sp. fungi were not detected. in one  patient streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis, and in another patient pseudomonas aeruginosa, were detected from both the sinus and the oral cavity using species-specific pcr primers. these results suggest that both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can be detected in nearly half of chronic maxillary sinusitis  cases.
