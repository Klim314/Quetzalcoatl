TI  == kibdelomycin is a bactericidal broad-spectrum aerobic antibacterial agent.
AB  == bacterial resistance to antibiotics continues to grow and pose serious challenges, while the discovery rate for new antibiotics declines. kibdelomycin is a recently discovered natural-product antibiotic that inhibits bacterial growth by inhibiting the bacterial dna replication enzymes dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv. it was reported to be a broad-spectrum aerobic gram-positive agent with selective inhibition of the anaerobic bacterium clostridium difficile. we have extended the profiling of kibdelomycin by using over 196 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic pathogens recovered from worldwide patient populations. we report the mic50s, mic90s, and bactericidal activities of kibdelomycin. we confirm the gram-positive spectrum and report for the first time that kibdelomycin shows strong activity (mic90, 0.125 mug/ml) against clinical strains of the gram-negative nonfermenter acinetobacter baumannii but only weak activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. we confirm that well-characterized resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae show no cross-resistance to kibdelomycin and quinolones and coumarin antibiotics. we also show that kibdelomycin is not subject to efflux in pseudomonas, though it is in escherichia coli, and it is generally affected by the outer membrane permeability entry barrier in the nonfermenters p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii, which may be addressable by structure-based chemical modification.

TI  == in vitro selection of a single-stranded dna molecular recognition element against clostridium difficile toxin b and sensitive detection in human fecal matter.
AB  == toxin b is one of the major virulence factors of clostridium difficile, a bacterium that is responsible for a significant number of diarrhea cases in acute care settings. due to the prevalence of c. difficile induced diarrhea, rapid and  correct diagnosis is crucial in the disease management. in this study, we have employed a stringent in vitro selection method to identify single-stranded dna molecular recognition elements (mre) specific for toxin b. at the end of the 12-round selection, one mre with high affinity (k d = 47.3 nm) for toxin b was identified. the selected mre demonstrated low cross binding activities on negative targets: bovine serum albumin, staphylococcus aureus alpha toxin, pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin a, and cholera toxin of vibrio cholera. a modified sandwich elisa assay was developed utilizing the selected ssdna mre as the antigen capturing element and achieved a sensitive detection of 50 nm of toxin b in human fecal preparations.

TI  == protease-sensitive inhibitory activity of cell-free supernatant of lactobacillus  crispatus 156 synergizes with ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and streptomycin against pseudomonas aeruginosa: an in vitro study.
AB  == ciprofloxacin and streptomycin are frequently prescribed for the treatment of medical conditions originating due to infection by pseudomonas aeruginosa. however, fluoroquinolone administration has been linked to the outgrowth of clostridium difficile pathogen, especially in immunocompromised patients. secondly, frequent administration of antibiotics may lead to development of resistance in the pathogens. thus, there is a need to explore innovative adjunct  therapies to lower the therapeutic doses of the antibiotics. herein, we evaluated the synergism, if any, between conventional antibiotics and the cell-free supernatant (cfs) of vaginal lactobacillus crispatus 156 against p. aeruginosa mtcc 741. l. crispatus 156 was isolated from the human vaginal tract, and its cfs had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against various gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, including p. aeruginosa. the inhibitory substance present in the cfs completely lost its activity after treatment with proteinases  and was resistant to temperatures up to 80 degrees c and ph ranging from 2 to 6.  the cumulative production of the inhibitory substance in cfs was studied, and it  showed that the secretion of the inhibitory substance was initiated in middle log phase of growth and peaked in late log phase. further, cfs synergized the activities of ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and streptomycin as evaluated in terms of checkerboard titrations. it lowered the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of ciprofloxacin by almost 30 times and mic of both moxifloxacin and streptomycin by 8 times. interestingly, pepsin treatment of cfs caused the complete abrogation of its synergistic effect with all the three antibiotics. thus, from the study, it can be concluded that probiotic-based alternative therapeutic regimen can be designed for the treatment of p. aeruginosa infections.

TI  == bloodstream infections among carriers of carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae: etiology, incidence and predictors.
AB  == carriers of carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (crkp) are increasingly recognised through active surveillance in much of the world. we studied incidence, aetiology and predictors of bloodstream infections (bsi) among such carriers. via a retrospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary care teaching  hospital, we examined occurrence of bsi within 45 days of crkp carrier detection. three nested case-control studies were conducted to analyse parameters associated with all-cause (all), gram-negative rod (gnr) and crkp bsi. cases and controls were compared with respect to demographics, clinical parameters and recent receipt of antibiotics. a total of 431 patients were identified as crkp carriers  (28% by clinical culture, 72% by rectal surveillance), mean age was 75.2 years. twenty percent of the patients (n = 85) developed bsi, of them 80% (n = 68) with  gnr. of 83 gnr isolates, 58 (70%) were enterobacteriaceae, of which 19 were crkp  and 20 were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers (23% and 24% of total gnr, respectively); 29% of the gnr isolates were nonfermenters (14.5% pseudomonas aeruginosa, 14.5% acinetobacter baumannii). mechanical ventilation predicted all bsi (p = 0.04), whereas clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea  predicted gnr bsi (p = 0.04). receipt of broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin, imipenem) was significantly associated with all bsi or gnr bsi. no exposure independently predicted crkp bsi. we conclude that patients detected as crkp carriers are at high risk for bsi within 45 days of detection, primarily with multidrug-resistant gnr. lack of predictive factors  differentiating between pathogens and associated high mortality raises once more  the dilemma regarding the appropriate empiric therapy for crkp carriers who develop severe sepsis.

TI  == non-inferiority of pulsed xenon ultraviolet light versus bleach versus for reducing environmental clostridium difficile contamination on high-touch surfaces in clostridium difficile isolation rooms.
AB  == in patients with malignancy, the major barrier to achieving complete response is  emergence of resistance to current chemotherapeutic agents. one of the major mechanisms by which tumor cells become resistant to therapies is by altering cellular drug targets through mutations and/or deletions. resistance by this mechanism is achieved more easily if the drug has limited cellular targets and/or processes. we hypothesized that since pseudomonas aeruginosa exot targets six proteins that are required for cancer cell survival and proliferation, it is highly unlikely for cancer cells to develop resistance to this toxin. we assessed exot's cytotoxicity against multiple invasive and highly resistant tumor cell lines in order to evaluate its potential as a chemotherapeutic agent. our data demonstrate that exot induces potent cytotoxicity in all tumor cell lines that we examined. collectively, our data highlights the potential of exot as a possible chemotherapeutic candidate for the treatment of cancer.

TI  == long-term effects of an antimicrobial stewardship programme at a tertiary-care teaching hospital.
AB  == antimicrobial stewardship has been shown to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, but there are few data on the long-term benefits of such a programme. antimicrobial use over a 13-year period since implementing an antimicrobial stewardship programme (asp) at our institution was examined. nosocomial rates of  clostridium difficile infection (cdi) and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of common nosocomial micro-organisms over the same period were also reviewed. total antimicrobial use decreased by 62.8% (p<0.0001). there were decreases in use of aminoglycosides (-91.3%; p<0.0001), cephalosporins (-68.3%; p<0.0001), extended-spectrum penicillins (-77.7%; p<0.0001), macrolides (-27.2%; p=0.002), clindamycin (-95.9%; p<0.0001) and quinolones (-78.7%; p<0.0001). antifungal use  decreased by 71.0% (p<0.0001). there were increases in the use of carbapenems (+736%, p<0.0001) and anti-mrsa drugs (+73.3%; p<0.0001). there was a 56.7% (p=0.007) reduction in nosocomial mrsa infections. nosocomial cdi rates decreased by 42.6% (p=0.005) between 2003 and 2010 and then increased to near baseline levels following implementation of more sensitive testing for detection of cdi in 2011. there were decreases in the rate (-71.9%; p=0.001) and percentage (-51.4%;  p<0.0001) of quinolone-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa. there were decreases in  the rate (p<0.0001) and percentage (p=0.02) of carbapenem-resistant p. aeruginosa following implementation of a policy restricting ciprofloxacin use. we have demonstrated sustained reductions in both antimicrobial use and drug-resistant organisms following implementation of an asp.

TI  == influence of sequence mismatches on the specificity of recombinase polymerase amplification technology.
AB  == recombinase polymerase amplification (rpa) technology relies on three major proteins, recombinase proteins, single-strand binding proteins, and polymerases,  to specifically amplify nucleic acid sequences in an isothermal format. the performance of rpa with respect to sequence mismatches of closely-related non-target molecules is not well documented and the influence of the number and distribution of mismatches in dna sequences on rpa amplification reaction is not  well understood. we investigated the specificity of rpa by testing closely-related species bearing naturally occurring mismatches for the tuf gene sequence of pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or mycobacterium tuberculosis and for the  cfb gene sequence of streptococcus agalactiae. in addition, the impact of the number and distribution of mismatches on rpa efficiency was assessed by synthetically generating 14 types of mismatched forward primers for detecting five bacterial species of high diagnostic relevance such as clostridium difficile, staphylococcus aureus, s. agalactiae, p. aeruginosa, and m. tuberculosis as well as bacillus atropheus subsp. globigii for which we use the spores as internal control in diagnostic assays. a total of 87 mismatched primers were tested in this study. we observed that target specific rpa primers with mismatches (n > 1) at their 3'extrimity hampered rpa reaction. in addition, 3 mismatches covering both extremities and the center of the primer sequence negatively affected rpa yield. we demonstrated that the specificity of rpa was multifactorial. therefore its application in clinical settings must be selected and validated a priori. we recommend that the selection of a target gene must consider the presence of closely-related non-target genes. it is advisable to choose target regions with a high number of mismatches (>/=36%, relative to the size of amplicon) with respect to closely-related species and the best case scenario would be by choosing a unique target gene.

TI  == restrictive reporting of selected antimicrobial susceptibilities influences clinical prescribing.
AB  == background: cascade and restrictive reporting are useful strategies to enhance antibiotic stewardship programs. methods: we combined both strategies to improve  the prescribing of antibiotics aimed at gram-negative infections. results: for enterobacter aerogenes, the susceptibility rates to amikacin increased from 10% to 100%; for third generation cephalosporins, these rates increased from 55% to 89%. the susceptibility rates of e. aerogenes to cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam changed little, and the ampicillin susceptibility decreased from 30% in 2009 to 11% in 2010. for proteus mirabilis, the susceptibility rates increased for third-generation cephalosporins (48% vs. 92%)  and piperacillin-tazobactam (10% vs. 98%), with minimal changes for cefepime (96% vs. 93%), ampicillin (69% vs. 73%) and amikacin (96% vs. 84%). for pseudomonas aeruginosa, the susceptibility rates improved slightly for third-generation cephalosporins (81% vs. 91%) but reduced for piperacillin-tazobactam (99% vs. 59%). hospital-acquired clostridium difficile infections decreased from 0.11 to 0.07 per 1000 patient days. conclusions: selective reporting helps physicians choose the most appropriate antibiotics for their patients within a stewardship program, with reduced c. difficile infection.

TI  == the human volatilome: volatile organic compounds (vocs) in exhaled breath, skin emanations, urine, feces and saliva.
AB  == breath analysis is a young field of research with its roots in antiquity. antoine lavoisier discovered carbon dioxide in exhaled breath during the period 1777-1783, wilhelm (vilem) petters discovered acetone in breath in 1857 and johannes muller reported the first quantitative measurements of acetone in 1898.  a recent review reported 1765 volatile compounds appearing in exhaled breath, skin emanations, urine, saliva, human breast milk, blood and feces. for a large number of compounds, real-time analysis of exhaled breath or skin emanations has  been performed, e.g., during exertion of effort on a stationary bicycle or during sleep. volatile compounds in exhaled breath, which record historical exposure, are called the 'exposome'. changes in biogenic volatile organic compound concentrations can be used to mirror metabolic or (patho)physiological processes  in the whole body or blood concentrations of drugs (e.g. propofol) in clinical settings-even during artificial ventilation or during surgery. also compounds released by bacterial strains like pseudomonas aeruginosa or streptococcus pneumonia could be very interesting. methyl methacrylate (cas 80-62-6), for example, was observed in the headspace of streptococcus pneumonia in concentrations up to 1420 ppb. fecal volatiles have been implicated in differentiating certain infectious bowel diseases such as clostridium difficile,  campylobacter, salmonella and cholera. they have also been used to differentiate  other non-infectious conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. in addition, alterations in urine volatiles have been used to detect urinary tract infections, bladder, prostate and other cancers. peroxidation of lipids and other biomolecules by reactive oxygen species produce  volatile compounds like ethane and 1-pentane. noninvasive detection and therapeutic monitoring of oxidative stress would be highly desirable in autoimmunological, neurological, inflammatory diseases and cancer, but also during surgery and in intensive care units. the investigation of cell cultures opens up new possibilities for elucidation of the biochemical background of volatile compounds. in future studies, combined investigations of a particular compound with regard to human matrices such as breath, urine, saliva and cell culture investigations will lead to novel scientific progress in the field.

TI  == epidemiological surveillance of bacterial nosocomial infections in the surgical intensive care unit.
AB  == introduction: intensive care units (icus) are associated with a greater risk of developing nosocomial infections (nis) than other departments. aim: the aim of this study was to determine the rate, the site and causative organisms of nis in  the surgical icu at university clinical center tuzla. methods: all patients admitted to the surgical icu were followed prospectively, for the development of  nis (january-december 2010). determination of nis was performed using standardized the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) criteria. results: 94 out of 834 patients (11.27%) developed nis. respiratory tract infections were seen in 56 (60%), urinary tract infections in 15 (16%) and gastrointestinal tract infections in 8 (9%) patients. other infections identified were surgical site, bloodstream and skin infections. gram-negative organisms were reported in approximately 75% of cases (78.7% extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producers). klebsiella pneumoniae was the commonest (51.0%), followed by proteus mirabilis (21.3%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.6%). methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (16%), and clostridium difficile (9.6%) were the commonest among gram-positive bacteria. conclusion: respiratory and urinary tract infections made up the great majority of nis. icu patients are more susceptible to nis, emphasizing the importance of continuous surveillance and enforcement of specific infection control measures.

TI  == a case of an acquired factor viii inhibitor complicated by multiple treatment-related opportunistic infections and review of the literature.
AB  == this case report describes a patient with an idiopathic acquired factor viii inhibitor and severe bleeding. she was treated with rituximab after failing first-line treatment with steroids and cyclophosphamide. two months following rituximab treatment, our patient developed a succession of severe opportunistic infections requiring intensive care unit admission. over a period of 12 weeks she required treatment for pseudomonas aeruginosa septicaemia, herpes simplex gingivostomatitis and pharyngotonsillitis, clostridium difficile-related diarrhoea, systemic cytomegalovirus infection, pneumocystis jiroveci, and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis lung infections. after significant rehabilitation, the patient was finally discharged following a 5-month admission. this case highlights the complexity of balancing a life-threatening condition with the side effects of treatment. it also raises the issue of routine prophylaxis for immunosuppression in nonmalignant conditions, which will become a common dilemma with the expanding indications for rituximab use.

TI  == inhaled colistin for treatment of pneumonia due to colistin-only-susceptible acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == purpose: colistin is used for the treatment of pneumonia associated with multidrug- resistant acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. however, the best route of administration and dosage is not known. we report our experience with aerosolized colistin in twelve patients with pneumonia caused by  colistin-only-susceptible (cos) a. baumannii. materials and methods: we retrospectively reviewed patients' medical records who were treated with aerosolized colistin for the treatment of pneumonia. results: ten patients were treated only with aerosolized colistin inhalation and two patients received a 3-day course intravenous colistin, and then switched to colistin inhalation therapy. the median duration of aerosolized colistin therapy was 17 days (5-31 days). four patients were treated only with aerosolized colistin, whereas 4 patients received concomitant glycopeptides, and 4 received concomitant levofloxacin or cefoperazone/sulbactam. at the end of the therapy, the clinical response rate and bacteriological clearance rate was 83% and 50%, respectively. colistin-resistant strains were isolated from 3 patients after aerosolized colistin therapy; however, all of them showed favorable clinical response. the median interval between inhalation therapy and resistance was 7 days (range 5-19  days). acute kidney injury developed in 3 patients. two patients experienced clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. one patient developed fever and skin rash after aerosolized colistin therapy. no patient developed neurotoxicity or bronchospasm. conclusion: colistin inhalation therapy is deemed tolerable and safe, and could be beneficial as an adjuctive therapy for the management of pneumonia due to cos a. baumannii. however, the potential development of colistin resistance cannot be overlooked.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == caspase activation as a versatile assay platform for detection of cytotoxic bacterial toxins.
AB  == pathogenic bacteria produce several virulence factors that help them establish infection in permissive hosts. bacterial toxins are a major class of virulence factors and hence are attractive therapeutic targets for vaccine development. here, we describe the development of a rapid, sensitive, and high-throughput assay that can be used as a versatile platform to measure the activities of bacterial toxins. we have exploited the ability of these toxins to cause cell death via apoptosis of sensitive cultured cell lines as a readout for measuring toxin activity. caspases (cysteine-aspartic proteases) are induced early in the apoptotic pathway, and so we used their induction to measure the activities of clostridium difficile toxins a (tcda) and b (tcdb) and binary toxin (cdta-cdtb),  corynebacterium diphtheriae toxin (dt), and pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin a (pea). caspase induction in the cell lines, upon exposure to toxins, was optimized by toxin concentration and intoxication time, and the specificity of caspase activity was established using a genetically mutated toxin and a pan-caspase inhibitor. in addition, we demonstrate the utility of the caspase assay for measuring toxin potency, as well as neutralizing antibody (nab) activity against c. difficile toxins. furthermore, the caspase assay showed excellent correlation with the filamentous actin (f-actin) polymerization assay for measuring tcda and tcdb neutralization titers upon vaccination of hamsters. these results demonstrate that the detection of caspase induction due to toxin exposure using a chemiluminescence readout can support potency and clinical immunogenicity testing for bacterial toxin vaccine candidates in development.

TI  == ceftaroline fosamil: a review of its use in the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil (zinforo, teflaro), is an advanced-generation, parenteral cephalosporin with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro against gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and multidrug resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and gram-negative bacteria, including haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, but not pseudomonas aeruginosa. ceftaroline has demonstrated a low potential for the selection of resistance in vitro for drug-resistant gram-positive organisms, including mrsa, as well as for gram-negative respiratory pathogens. in pivotal phase iii studies, intravenous ceftaroline fosamil demonstrated noninferiority to intravenous vancomycin plus aztreonam in patients hospitalized with complicated skin and soft tissue infections (csstis) and intravenous ceftriaxone in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) [pneumonia outcomes research team (port) risk  class iii or iv]; however, patients with cap admitted to the intensive care unit  were not evaluated. ceftaroline fosamil was generally well tolerated in these trials, with an adverse event profile similar to that of other cephalosporins. diarrhoea was the most commonly reported adverse event; however, the risk of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea with ceftaroline fosamil appeared to be low. potential limitations of the drug include the lack of an oral formulation and the requirement for twice-daily administration. nonetheless, ceftaroline fosamil represents an attractive option (either alone or in combination with other agents) for the initial empirical treatment of patients hospitalized with csstis (including those with suspected mrsa infection) or cap (port risk class iii or iv) who require intravenous antimicrobial therapy. as with all antibacterial agents, ceftaroline fosamil should be used in accordance with good  antimicrobial stewardship.

TI  == impact of intensive infection control team activities on the acquisition of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, drug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and the incidence of clostridium difficile-associated disease.
AB  == the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (mdros) is an emerging problem  in acute healthcare facilities. to reduce this transmission, we introduced intensive infection control team (ict) activities and investigated the impact of  their introduction. this study was conducted at a single teaching hospital from 1 april 2010 to 31 march 2012. during the intervention period, all carbapenem use was monitored by the ict, and doctors using carbapenems inappropriately were individually instructed. information related to patients with newly identified mdros was provided daily to the ict and instructions on the appropriate infection control measures for mdros were given immediately with continuous monitoring. the medical records of newly hospitalized patients were reviewed daily to check previous microbiological results and infection control intervention by the ict was also performed for patients with a previous history of mdros. compared with the pre-intervention period, the antimicrobial usage density of carbapenems decreased significantly (28.5 vs. 17.8 defined daily doses/1000 inpatient days; p < 0.001) and the frequency of use of sanitary items, especially the use of aprons, increased significantly (710 vs 1854 pieces/1000 inpatient days; p < 0.001). the number of cases with hospital-acquired mrsa (0.66 vs. 0.29 cases/1000 inpatient days; p < 0.001), hospital-acquired drug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.23 vs. 0.06 cases/1000 inpatient days; p = 0.006) and nosocomial clostridium difficile-associated disease (0.47 vs. 0.11 cases/1000 inpatient days; p < 0.001) decreased significantly during the intervention period. our study showed that proactive and continuous ict interventions were effective for reduction of mdro transmission.

TI  == using rapid diagnostic tests to optimize antimicrobial selection in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
AB  == new advances in rapid diagnostic tests provide several collaborative opportunities for stewardship teams, particularly in processes where delay in the initiation of appropriate therapy has significant consequences for patient outcomes. rapid molecular tests enhance one of the key functions of microbiology  laboratories, which is to produce accurate organism identification and timely antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. these data are used to guide the choice of antimicrobial agents for treating infections in individual patients, and the aggregate data (i.e., hospital's antibiogram) are used to guide empiric therapy for infections before the availability of the patient's culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. in addition, accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing data are critical for the overall success of a health care institution's antimicrobial stewardship program. tests that provide accurate organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility not only benefit the individual patient but also increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs. this review focuses on the use of molecular diagnostic methods to rapidly identify staphylococcus species, enterococcus faecalis,enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli,klebsiella pneumoniae,pseudomonas aeruginosa,clostridium difficile, and candida species from clinical samples and summarizes studies that describe the application of rapid diagnostic tests in antimicrobial stewardship programs.

TI  == the c-di-gmp recognition mechanism of the pilz domain of bacterial cellulose synthase subunit a.
AB  == in some proteobacteria and firmicutes such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio cholerae, xanthomonas campestris, and clostridium difficile, cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-gmp) is known to regulate cellular processes, including motility, biofilm formation, and virulence, as a second messenger. cellulose production in acetobacter xylinum, a model organism of cellulose biosynthesis, also depends on by cellular c-di-gmp level. in cellulose-synthesizing bacteria, a terminal complex localized in the cell membrane synthesizes cellulose and regulates the production of cellulose sensed by c-di-gmp. although previous studies indicated that the pilz domain conserved in cellulose synthase subunit a (cesa) was part of a receptor for c-di-gmp, the recognition mechanism by pilz domain of cesa remains unclear. in the present study, we studied the interaction between c-di-gmp and the pilz domain of cesa from a structural viewpoint. first, we solved the crystal structure of the pilz domain of cesa from a. xylinum (axcesa-pilz) at 2.1a resolution. then, comparison of the sequence and structure of axcesa-pilz to those of known structures of pilz, such as vca0042, pp4397, and pa4608, indicated the involvement of lys573 and arg643 of axcesa-pilz in the recognition of c-di-gmp besides the rxxxr motif. finally, the binding characteristics of c-di-gmp to axcesa-pilz and mutants were  determined with isothermal titration calorimetry, indicating that the residues corresponding to lys573 and arg643 in axcesa-pilz generally contribute to the binding of c-di-gmp to pilz.

TI  == the role of the bacterial flagellum in adhesion and virulence.
AB  == the bacterial flagellum is a complex apparatus assembled of more than 20 different proteins. the flagellar basal body traverses the cell wall, whereas the curved hook connects the basal body to the whip-like flagellar filament that protrudes several microm from the bacterial cell. the flagellum has traditionally been regarded only as a motility organelle, but more recently it has become evident that flagella have a number of other biological functions. the major subunit, flagellin or flic, of the flagellum plays a well-documented role in innate immunity and as a dominant antigen of the adaptive immune response. importantly, flagella have also been reported to function as adhesins. whole flagella have been indicated as significant in bacterial adhesion to and invasion into host cells. in various pathogens, e.g., escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium difficile, flagellin and/or the distally located flagellar cap protein have been reported to function as adhesins. recently, flic  of shiga-toxigenic e. coli was shown to be involved in cellular invasion via lipid rafts. here, we examine the latest or most important findings regarding flagellar adhesive and invasive properties, especially focusing on the flagellum  as a potential virulence factor.

AB  == due to a combination of efforts from individual laboratories and structural genomics centers, there has been a surge in the number of members of the gcn5-related acetyltransferasesuperfamily that have been structurally determined  within the past decade. although the number of three-dimensional structures is increasing steadily, we know little about the individual functions of these enzymes. part of the difficulty in assigning functions for members of this superfamily is the lack of information regarding how substrates bind to the active site of the protein. the majority of the structures do not show ligand bound in the active site, and since the substrate-binding domain is not strictly  conserved, it is difficult to predict the function based on structure alone. additionally, the enzymes are capable of acetylating a wide variety of metabolites and many may exhibit promiscuity regarding their ability to acetylate multiple classes of substrates, possibly having multiple functions for the same enzyme. herein, we present an approach to identify potential substrates for previously uncharacterized members of the gcn5-related acetyltransferase superfamily using a variety of metabolites including polyamines, amino acids, antibiotics, peptides, vitamins, catecholamines, and other metabolites. we have identified potential substrates for eight bacterial enzymes of this superfamily.  this information will be used to further structurally and functionally characterize them.

TI  == biocidal activity of metalloacid-coated surfaces against multidrug-resistant microorganisms.
AB  == background: the antimicrobial effects of a coating of molybdenum trioxide (moo3)  has been recently described. the metalloacid material produces oxonium ions (h3o+), which creates an acidic ph that is an effective, non specific antimicrobial. we determined the in vitro antimicrobial activity of molybdenum trioxide metalloacid-coated surfaces. methods: metalloacid-coated and non-coated  (control) surfaces were contaminated by exposing them for 15 minutes to microbial suspensions containing 105 cfu/ml. eleven microorganisms responsible for nosocomial infections were tested: two staphylococcus aureus strains (the hetero-vancomycin intermediate mrsa mu50 strain and a st80-pvl-producing mrsa strain); a vancomycin-resistant vana enterococcus faecium strain; three extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae strains; a mbl-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa strain; a multidrug-resistant acinetobacter  baumannii strain; a toxin-producing clostridium difficile strain; and two fungi (candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus). the assay tested the ability of the coated surfaces to kill microorganisms. results: against all non-sporulating microorganisms tested, metalloacid-coated surfaces exhibited significant antimicrobial activity relative to that of the control surfaces within two to six hours after contact with the microorganisms (p < 0.001). microorganism survival on the coated surfaces was greatly impaired, whereas microorganism survival on control surfaces remained substantial. conclusions: we suggest that, facing the continuing shedding of microorganisms in the vicinity of colonized or infected patients, the continuous biocidal effect of hydroxonium oxides against multidrug-resistant microorganisms may help limit environmental contamination between consecutive cleaning procedures.

TI  == novel high-molecular-weight, r-type bacteriocins of clostridium difficile.
AB  == clostridium difficile causes one of the leading nosocomial infections in developed countries, and therapeutic choices are limited. some strains of c. difficile produce phage tail-like particles upon induction of the sos response. these particles have bactericidal activity against other c. difficile strains and can therefore be classified as bacteriocins, similar to the r-type pyocins of pseudomonas aeruginosa. these r-type bacteriocin particles, which have been purified from different strains, each have a different c. difficile-killing spectrum, with no one bacteriocin killing all c. difficile isolates tested. we have identified the genetic locus of these "diffocins" (open reading frames 1359  to 1376) and have found them to be common among the species. the entire diffocin  genetic locus of more than 20 kb was cloned and expressed in bacillus subtilis, and this resulted in production of bactericidal particles. one of the interesting features of these particles is a very large structural protein of ~200 kda, the product of gene 1374. this large protein determines the killing spectrum of the particles and is likely the receptor-binding protein. diffocins may provide an alternate bactericidal agent to prevent or treat infections and to decolonize individuals who are asymptomatic carriers.

TI  == national institute of allergy and infectious disease (niaid) funding for studies  of hospital-associated bacterial pathogens: are funds proportionate to burden of  disease?
AB  == background: hospital-associated infections (hais) are associated with a considerable burden of disease and direct costs greater than $17 billion. the pathogens that cause the majority of serious hais are enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium difficile, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species, referred as esckape. we aimed to determine the amount of funding the national institute of health (nih) national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) allocates to research on antimicrobial resistant pathogens, particularly  esckape pathogens. methods: the nih research portfolio online reporting tools (report) database was used to identify niaid antimicrobial resistance research grants funded in 2007-2009 using the terms "antibiotic resistance," "antimicrobial resistance," and "hospital-associated infection." results: funding for antimicrobial resistance grants has increased from 2007-2009. antimicrobial resistance funding for bacterial pathogens has seen a smaller increase than non-bacterial pathogens. the total funding for all eskcape pathogens was $ 22,005,943 in 2007, $ 30,810,153 in 2008 and $ 49,801,227 in 2009. s. aureus grants received $ 29,193,264 in fy2009, the highest funding amount of all the esckape pathogens. based on 2009 funding data, approximately $1,565 of research money was spent per s. aureus related death and $750 of was spent per c. difficile related death. conclusions: although the funding for esckape pathogens  has increased from 2007 to 2009, funding levels for antimicrobial resistant bacteria-related grants is still lower than funding for antimicrobial resistant non-bacterial pathogens. efforts may be needed to improve research funding for resistant-bacterial pathogens, particularly as their clinical burden increases.

TI  == evaluation of doripenem utilization and susceptibilities at a large urban hospital.
AB  == background: bacterial resistance presents a constant challenge in the treatment of hospitalized patients, particularly with gram-negative infections. carbapenems have an important role in the treatment of resistant nosocomial organisms. doripenem, a recently approved carbapenem, has shown efficacy in clinical trials, but there is little published data on utilization in a general patient population. objective: the clinical utilization of doripenem in a general adult inpatient population was evaluated during a carbapenem formulary conversion. setting: a 706-bed acute care tertiary hospital serving an urban community. methods: after formulary conversion to doripenem, the first 100 patients to receive doripenem were included in the analysis. baseline characteristics were recorded for each patient, along with indication for treatment, prescribing physician, dose and frequency of doripenem and duration of treatment. patients were monitored for adverse reactions to doripenem. bacterial culture results were recorded. for positive cultures, doripenem susceptibility was determined by etest. patients were followed until discontinuation of antibiotic therapy, discharge or death to determine treatment outcomes. successful treatment was defined as clinical or microbiological cure, while patients with infection-related mortality or requiring subsequent antibiotics for the index infection were considered treatment failure. main outcome measures: clinical utilization of doripenem, including indications and doses used. results: doripenem treatment was recorded in 102 patients. the most common indications for treatment were pneumonia and sepsis. the majority of doripenem orders were written by infectious disease or pulmonology services. forty-nine patients were treated successfully with doripenem and six patients experienced treatment failure. the remainder of patients were not evaluable by predefined outcomes criteria. adverse events were reported in eight patients and included acute renal failure, clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea and seizures. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common organisms in culture results. doripenem demonstrated in vitro activity against 81% of all organisms and susceptibility results had >90% correlation with meropenem and imipenem susceptibilities. conclusion: in our limited sample size,  doripenem was safe and effective against various types of infections in a general inpatient population with similar bacterial susceptibilities to other cabapenems. doripenem was utilized for appropriate indications, but doses were frequently outside the manufacturers labeling. adverse events were uncommon, and no serious  adverse events were directly associated with doripenem treatment.

AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga fucus evanescens in cell culture. accessions were collected on the arctic coast of ungava bay, nunavik, quebec. the crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against hemophilus influenzae , legionella pneumophila , propionibacterium acnes (atcc and clinical isolate), and streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/ml. this algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , whereas bacillus cereus , escherichia coli , klebsiella pneumoniae , and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against propionibacterium acnes showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/ml. the main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl o-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/ml. therefore, the semipurified f. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.

TI  == the role played by contaminated surfaces in the transmission of nosocomial pathogens.
AB  == studies in the 1970s and 1980s suggested that environmental surface contamination played a negligible role in the endemic transmission of healthcare-associated infections. however, recent studies have demonstrated that several major nosocomial pathogens are shed by patients and contaminate hospital surfaces at concentrations sufficient for transmission, survive for extended periods, persist despite attempts to disinfect or remove them, and can be transferred to the hands of healthcare workers. evidence is accumulating that contaminated surfaces make an important contribution to the epidemic and endemic transmission of clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and norovirus and that improved environmental decontamination contributes to the control of outbreaks. efforts to improve environmental hygiene should include enhancing the efficacy of cleaning and disinfection and reducing the shedding of pathogens. further high-quality studies are needed to clarify the role played by surfaces in nosocomial transmission and to determine the effectiveness of different interventions in reducing associated infection rates.

TI  == infectious diseases in the critically ill patients.
AB  == infection is common in the critically ill and often results due to the severity of the patient's illness. recent data suggest 51% of intensive care unit (icu) patients are infected, and 71% receive antimicrobial therapy. bacterial infection is the primary concern, although some fungal infections are opportunistic. infection more than doubles the icu mortality rate, and the costs associated with infection may be as high as 40% of total icu expenditures. there are many contemporary antimicrobial resistance concerns that the critical care clinician must consider in managing the pharmacotherapy of infection. methicillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin resistance in enterococci, beta-lactamase resistance in enterobacteriaceae, multidrug resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter species, fluoroquinolone resistance in escherichia coli, and fungal resistance are among the most common issues icu clinician's must face in managing infection. critical illness causes changes in pharmacokinetics that influence drug and dosing considerations. absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion may all be affected by the various disease states that define critical illness. several specific diseases are discussed, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, various fungal infections,  gastrointestinal infections due to clostridium difficile, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections. within each disease section, discussion includes causes and prevention strategies, microbiology, evidence-based guidelines, and important caveats.

TI  == c-di-gmp turn-over in clostridium difficile is controlled by a plethora of diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases.
AB  == clostridium difficile infections have become a major healthcare concern in the last decade during which the emergence of new strains has underscored this bacterium's capacity to cause persistent epidemics. c-di-gmp is a bacterial second messenger regulating diverse bacterial phenotypes, notably motility and biofilm formation, in proteobacteria such as vibrio cholerae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella. c-di-gmp is synthesized by diguanylate cyclases (dgcs) that contain a conserved ggdef domain. it is degraded by phosphodiesterases (pdes) that contain either an eal or an hd-gyp conserved domain. very little is known about the role of c-di-gmp in the regulation of phenotypes of gram-positive or fastidious bacteria. herein, we exposed the main components of c-di-gmp signalling in 20 genomes of c. difficile, revealed their prevalence, and predicted their enzymatic activity. ectopic expression of 31 of these conserved genes was carried out in v. cholerae to evaluate their effect on  motility and biofilm formation, two well-characterized phenotype alterations associated with intracellular c-di-gmp variation in this bacterium. most of the predicted dgcs and pdes were found to be active in the v. cholerae model. expression of truncated versions of cd0522, a protein with two ggdef domains and  one eal domain, suggests that it can act alternatively as a dgc or a pde. the activity of one purified dgc (cd1420) and one purified pde (cd0757) was confirmed by in vitro enzymatic assays. gtp was shown to be important for the pde activity  of cd0757. our results indicate that, in contrast to most gram-positive bacteria  including its closest relatives, c. difficile encodes a large assortment of functional dgcs and pdes, revealing that c-di-gmp signalling is an important and  well-conserved signal transduction system in this human pathogen.

TI  == beyond the target pathogen: ecological effects of the hospital formulary.
AB  == purpose of review: antibiotic therapy has the potential for intended as well as unintended consequences due to ecological effects that extend beyond the target pathogen. this review examines some of the collateral damage and collateral benefit that may occur when using antibiotic therapy. recent findings: antibiotics excreted in the gastrointestinal tract cause alterations of the indigenous flora. such disruptions may increase the risk of colonization and overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, including resistant species, with the potential for serious infection for an individual patient as well as possible hospital-wide dissemination resulting in local outbreaks of infection. for example, clostridium difficile infection (cdi), and particularly associated diarrhea and colitis, is a potentially serious and growing problem in hospitals worldwide, and is associated with disruption of gut flora through use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially those with antianaerobic activity. infection control measures and improved antibiotic stewardship are key measures for cdi prevention. another example is the risk of intestinal colonization and overgrowth with resistant bacteria, which is heightened in surgical patients requiring antimicrobial therapy for intraabdominal infections. results from two optimizing intra-abdominal surgery with invanz studies (oasis-i and oasis-ii) suggested emergence of resistant enterobacteriaceae was less likely in these patients treated with ertapenem than in those treated with ceftriaxone/metronidazole or piperacillin/tazobactam. finally, recent studies have reported that increased use of a nonpseudomonal carbapenem such as ertapenem does not reduce the susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa to pseudomonal carbapenems, for example, imipenem or meropenem. in fact, data from one study showed increased ertapenem/decreased imipenem use was associated with improved susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to imipenem, probably due to decreased selective  pressure for resistant species. summary: improper antibiotic use can be associated with detrimental effects related to the ecological impacts of these drugs. improved antibiotic stewardship and appropriate infection control measures are key to minimization of the collateral damage associated with antibiotic therapy and may even have collateral benefits.

AB  == background: several beta-lactams are recommended as single agents for the treatment of febrile neutropenia. objectives: to compare the effectiveness of different anti-pseudomonal beta-lactams as single agents in the treatment of febrile neutropenia. to compare the development of bacterial resistance, bacterial and fungal superinfections during or following treatment with the different beta-lactams. search strategy: we searched the cochane register of controlled trials (central), issue 3, 2010. medline, embase, lilacs, fda drug applications, conference proceedings and ongoing clinical trial databases up to august 2010. references of included studies were scanned. selection criteria: randomised controlled trials (rcts) comparing an antipseudomonal beta-lactam to another antipseudomonal beta-lactam antibiotic, both given alone or with the addition of the same glycopeptide to both study arms, for the initial treatment of fever and neutropenia among cancer patients. data collection and analysis: two review authors applied inclusion criteria and extracted the data independently. missing data were sought. risk ratios (rr) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (ci), and pooled using the fixed effect model. the primary outcome was  all-cause mortality. risk of bias was assessed using a domain-based evaluation and its effect of results was assessed through sensitivity analyses. main results: forty-four trials were included. the antibiotics assessed were cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem and meropenem. adequate allocation concealment and generation were reported in about half of the trials and only two trials were double-blinded. the risk for all-cause mortality was significantly higher with cefepime compared to other beta-lactams (rr 1.39, 95% ci 1.04 to 1.86, 21 trials, 3471 participants), without heterogeneity and with higher rrs in trials at low risk for bias. there were no differences in secondary outcomes but  for a non-significantly higher rate of bacterial superinfections with cefepime. mortality was significantly lower with piperacillin-tazobactam compared to other  antibiotics (rr 0.56, 95% ci 0.34 to 0.92, 8 trials, 1314 participants), without  heterogeneity. carbapenems resulted in similar all-cause mortality and a lower rate of clinical failure and antibiotic modifications as compared to other antibiotics, but a higher rate of diarrhea caused by clostridium difficile. authors' conclusions: current evidence supports the use of piperacillin-tazobactam in locations where antibiotic resistance profiles do not  mandate empirical use of carbapenems. carbapenems result in a higher rate of antibiotic-associated and clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. there is a high level of evidence that all-cause mortality is higher with cefepime compared  to other beta-lactams and it should not be used as monotherapy for patients with  febrile neutropenia.

AB  == the discovery of penicillin in 1928 was followed by the discovery and synthesis of various kinds of antimicrobial agents such as quinolone, aminogycoside, macrolide, tetracyclone, and oxazolidinone. these discoveries dramatically decreased the mortality rate due to infectious diseases. however, bacteria have also acquired antimicrobial-resistance genes or changed their own genes to oppose these antimicrobial agents, and now drug-resistant bacteria are becoming a serious clinical concern. today, contagious diseases must be treated with the limited number of effective antimicrobial agents available. infection control measures are required to prevent the spread of resistant bacteria in the clinical environment, and we must also increase our understanding of the drug-resistant mechanisms of bacteria. in this issue we wish to introduce the recent worldwide trend in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, especially multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, along with recently-discovered antimicrobial-resistant systems.

TI  == evaluation of the efficacy of electrochemically activated solutions against nosocomial pathogens and bacterial endospores.
AB  == aims: electrochemically activated solutions (ecas) are generated from halide salt solutions via specially designed electrolytic cells. the active solutions are known to possess high biocidal activity against a wide range of target microbial  species, however, literature revealing the kill-kinetics of these solutions is limited. the aim of the study was to identify the kill-rate and extent of population kill for a range of target species (including endospores) using ecas generated at the anode (anolyte). methods and results: standard suspensions of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus atrophaeus spores and clostridium difficile spores were treated with anolyte in a quantitative suspension assay. for vegetative cells, all concentrations of anolyte tested reduced the viable population to below the detection limit within  10 s. at a concentration of 99%, anolyte produced a log(10) reduction factor of greater than five in viable b. atrophaeus endospores within 90 s and reduced numbers of c. difficile endospores to below the experimental detection limit within 20 s at concentrations of 5% or greater. conclusions: anolyte was highly effective in killing test-bacteria and spores. the bactericidal efficacy was retained against vegetative cells at dilutions as low as 1% and against c. difficile spores as low as 5%. significance and impact of study: the results of this study demonstrate that ecas are effective at lower concentrations and act more rapidly than previously reported. potent bactericidal and sporicidal activity coupled with point-of-use generation, low production-costs and environmental compatibility suggest that acidic ecas has the potential to be a useful addition to the current armoury of disinfectants.

TI  == anti-clostridium difficile potential of tetramic acid derivatives from pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum-sensing autoinducers.
AB  == we have examined the potential bactericidal activities of several tetramic acids  derived from pseudomonas autoinducers against clostridium difficile, a cause of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis. clinical isolates of c. difficile (n=4) were incubated in broth with a chemically synthesized pseudomonas autoinducer and its tetramic acid derivatives. the structure-activity relationship and the mechanisms of action were examined by a time-killing assay and by determination of the morphological/staining characteristics. the use of some tetramic acids derived from n-3-oxododecanoyl l-homoserine lactone resulted  in more than 3-log reductions in the viability of c. difficile within 30 min at 30 microm. the outer membrane was suggested to be one of the targets for the bactericidal activity of tetramic acid, because disturbance of the bacterial outer surface was demonstrated by alteration of the gram-staining characteristic  and electron microscopy. the data for the tetramic acid derivatives demonstrate that the keto-enol structure and the length of the acyl side chain of tetramic acid may be essential for the antibacterial activity of this molecule. these results suggest the potential for tetramic acid derivatives to be novel agents with activity against c. difficile.

AB  == nitric oxide (no) is important for the regulation of a number of diverse biological processes, including vascular tone, neurotransmission, inflammatory cell responsiveness, defence against invading pathogens and wound healing. transition metal exchanged zeolites are nanoporous materials with high-capacity storage properties for gases such as no. the no stores are liberated upon contact with aqueous environments, thereby making them ideal candidates for use in biological and clinical settings. here, we demonstrate the no release capacity and powerful bactericidal properties of a novel no-storing zn(2+)-exchanged zeolite material at a 50 wt.% composition in a polytetrafluoroethylene polymer. further to our published data showing the anti-thrombotic effects of a similar no-loaded zeolite, this study demonstrates the anti-bacterial properties of no-releasing zeolites against clinically relevant strains of bacteria, namely gram-negative pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram-positive methicillin-sensitive and  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and clostridium difficile. thus our study highlights the potential of no-loaded zeolites as biocompatible medical device coatings with anti-infective properties.

TI  == human alpha-defensins inhibit hemolysis mediated by cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  == many pathogenic gram-positive bacteria release exotoxins that belong to the family of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins. here, we report that human alpha-defensins hnp-1 to hnp-3 acted in a concentration-dependent manner to protect human red blood cells from the lytic effects of three of these exotoxins: anthrolysin o (alo), listeriolysin o, and pneumolysin. hd-5 was very effective against listeriolysin o but less effective against the other toxins. human alpha-defensins hnp-4 and hd-6 and human beta-defensin-1, -2, and -3 lacked protective ability. hnp-1 required intact disulfide bonds to prevent toxin-mediated hemolysis. a fully linearized analog, in which all six cysteines were replaced by aminobutyric acid (abu) residues, showed greatly reduced binding and protection. a partially unfolded hnp-1 analog, in which only cysteines 9 and  29 were replaced by abu residues, showed intact alo binding but was 10-fold less  potent in preventing hemolysis. surface plasmon resonance assays revealed that hnp-1 to hnp-3 bound all three toxins at multiple sites and also that solution-phase hnp molecules could bind immobilized hnp molecules. defensin concentrations that inhibited hemolysis by alo and listeriolysin did not prevent  these toxins from binding either to red blood cells or to cholesterol. others have shown that hnp-1 to hnp-3 inhibit lethal toxin of bacillus anthracis, toxin  b of clostridium difficile, diphtheria toxin, and exotoxin a of pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, this is the first time these defensins have been shown to inhibit pore-forming toxins. an "abcde mechanism" that can account for the ability of hnp-1 to hnp-3 to inhibit so many different exotoxins is proposed.

AB  == background: the occurrence of multidrug-resistant microorganisms is associated with an extended and long-term use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. indeed, this may lead to a colonization and even to an infection of the patient, which is called collateral damage. moreover, the risk for collateral damage can be assessed for different antibiotic classes. occurrence of multidrug-resistant microorganisms: the use of cephalosporins may induce a subsequent infection with  vancomycin-resistant enterococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, beta-lactam-resistant acinetobacter species, and clostridium difficile. quinolones are associated with a subsequent infection with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and with increasing resistance in gram-negative bacilli, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. conclusion: to avoid the occurrence of multidrug-resistant microorganisms, a strict indication and time-limited use (e.g., 1 week) of antibiotics are required, as already established in the guidelines for infection.

AB  == samples of the marine sponge haliclona simulans were collected from irish coastal waters, and bacteria were isolated from these samples. phylogenetic analyses of the cultured isolates showed that four different bacterial phyla were represented; bacteriodetes, actinobacteria, proteobacteria, and firmicutes. the sponge bacterial isolates were assayed for the production of antimicrobial substances, and biological activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and fungi were demonstrated, with 50% of isolates showing antimicrobial  activity against at least one of the test strains. further testing showed that the antimicrobial activities extended to the important pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium difficile, multi-drug-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and pathogenic yeast strains. the actinomycetes were numerically the most abundant producers of antimicrobial activities, although activities were also noted from bacilli and pseudovibrio isolates. surveys for the presence of potential antibiotic encoding polyketide synthase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase genes also revealed that genes for the biosynthesis of these secondary metabolites were present in most bacterial phyla but were particularly prevalent  among the actinobacteria and proteobacteria. this study demonstrates that the culturable fraction of bacteria from the sponge h. simulans is diverse and appears to possess much potential as a source for the discovery of new medically  relevant biological active agents.

TI  == the maxwell finland lecture: for the duration-rational antibiotic administration  in an era of antimicrobial resistance and clostridium difficile.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance is frequently associated with clinical use of antibiotics. this close association suggests that efforts to manage our use of these potent agents can have an impact on the prevalence of resistance. unfortunately, one size does not fit all when considering the response of bacterial pathogens to antimicrobial exposure. measures that may prevent resistance in some species (such as using multiple antibiotics to treat tuberculosis) may exacerbate the problem of resistance in others (such as pseudomonas aeruginosa or acinetobacter baumannii). the simplest approach is to use fewer antibiotics and thereby apply less selective pressure to the prevalent  flora. among available strategies to reduce use, reductions in length of antimicrobial regimens are the safest and are likely to be the most palatable to  practicing clinicians. studies are urgently needed to define minimal lengths of therapy to ensure that efforts at reduced use are safe and effective.

TI  == [molecular fingerprint of bacterial communities and 16s rdna intra-species heterogeneity: a pitfall that should be considered].
AB  == molecular fingerprinting methods are currently used to study microbial communities by culture independent approaches. they are proposed as identification tool owing to the availability of rapid automated methods. the 16s rrna gene (16s rdna) is an efficient marker for bacterial identification and microbial communities analysis. however, the 16s rdna polymorphism among strains  of the same species is an underestimated pitfall of the fingerprinting approaches. aim of the study: we studied the 16s rdna variability among strains of three bacterial species of medical interest. material and methods: total dna was extracted from clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=20), clostridium difficile (n=20) and enterobacter cloacae (n=14). the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) products obtained with consensus primers flanking the 16s rdna variable regions v3 and v6-v7-v8 were separated by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge). dna extracted from ttge bands were sequenced and analysed. results: all the isolates of p. aeruginosa and of c. difficile displayed one single ttge band with constant migration distances suggesting that  there was no 16s rdna polymorphism among strains in these two species. oppositely, the isolates of e. cloacae gave complex ttge patterns formed by multiple bands with variable migration distances. these patterns corresponded to  16s rrna genes variable in a single genome as well as among strains of the species. conclusion: intra-species and/or intragenomic variability of 16s rdna should be taken into account for pertinent interpretation of molecular fingerprint. for this purpose, a comprehensive description of the polymorphism of this marker is necessary.

TI  == prediction of specific pathogens in patients with sepsis: evaluation of treat, a  computerized decision support system.
AB  == background: prediction of bacterial infections and their pathogens allows for early, directed investigation and treatment. we assessed the ability of treat, a  computerized decision support system, to predict specific pathogens. methods: treat uses data available within the first few hours of infection presentation in a causal probabilistic network to predict sites of infection and specific pathogens. we included 3529 patients (920 with microbiologically documented infections) participating in the observational and interventional trials of the treat system in israel, germany and italy. discriminatory performance of treat to predict individual pathogens was expressed by the auc with 95% confidence intervals. calibration was assessed using the hosmer-lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic. results: the aucs for gram-negative bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli, ranged between 0.70 and 0.80 (all significant). adequate calibration was demonstrated for any gram-negative infection and individual bacteria, except for e. coli. discrimination and calibration were acceptable for enterococcus spp. (auc 0.71, 0.65-0.78), but not for staphylococcus aureus (auc 0.63, 0.55-0.71). the few infections caused by candida spp. and clostridium difficile were well predicted (aucs 0.74, 0.54-0.95; and 0.94, 0.88-1.00, respectively). the coverage with treat's recommendation exceeded that observed with physicians' treatment for all  pathogens, except candida spp. conclusions: treat predicted individual pathogens  causing infection well. prediction of s. aureus was inferior to that observed with other pathogens. treat can be used to triage patients by the risk for specific pathogens. the system's predictions enable it to prescribe appropriate antibiotic treatment prior to pathogen identification.

TI  == direct e-test (ab biodisk) of respiratory samples improves antimicrobial use in ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  == background: ventilator-associated pneumonia is the most frequently observed nosocomial infection in intensive care units, and it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. early microbiological diagnosis and the initial administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy are associated with decreased mortality and potentially reduced costs. our study evaluates the clinical and financial impact of performing rapid antimicrobial susceptibility tests directly  on samples obtained from the lower respiratory tract. methods: a prospective, randomized study was performed over a 2-year period. patients who had a lower respiratory tract infection that was acquired during mechanical ventilation and for whom samples obtained from the respiratory tract were sent for culture were randomized to 1 of 2 groups. samples were cultured for the control group, and results were reported using standard procedures. samples were also cultured for the test subject group using standard procedures, but in addition, a rapid antibiogram was immediately performed by placing e-test antibiotic strips (ab biodisk) directly on respiratory tract samples. patients in the e-test group received a preliminary laboratory report when it became available. the 2 patient  groups were compared according to the following variables: type and severity of underlying conditions, total days of antimicrobial use, number of defined daily doses, cost of acquisition of the antimicrobial agent per episode, days of fever, days receiving mechanical ventilation, days in the intensive care unit, incidence of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, and mortality. results: reporting a rapid e-test was associated with fewer days of fever, fewer days of antibiotic administration until resolution of the episode of ventilator-associated pneumonia, decreased antibiotic consumption, less c. difficile-associated diarrhea, lower costs of antimicrobial agents, and fewer days receiving mechanical ventilation. conclusions: a rapid e-test of respiratory tract samples  improves antimicrobial use in cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

TI  == how long do nosocomial pathogens persist on inanimate surfaces? a systematic review.
AB  == background: inanimate surfaces have often been described as the source for outbreaks of nosocomial infections. the aim of this review is to summarize data on the persistence of different nosocomial pathogens on inanimate surfaces. methods: the literature was systematically reviewed in medline without language restrictions. in addition, cited articles in a report were assessed and standard  textbooks on the topic were reviewed. all reports with experimental evidence on the duration of persistence of a nosocomial pathogen on any type of surface were  included. results: most gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus spp. (including vre), staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), or streptococcus pyogenes, survive for months on dry surfaces. many gram-negative species, such as acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, or shigella spp., can also survive for months. a few others, such as bordetella pertussis, haemophilus influenzae, proteus vulgaris, or vibrio cholerae, however, persist only for days. mycobacteria, including mycobacterium tuberculosis, and spore-forming bacteria, including clostridium difficile, can also survive for months on surfaces. candida albicans as the most important nosocomial fungal pathogen can survive up to 4 months on surfaces. persistence of other yeasts, such as torulopsis glabrata, was described to be similar (5 months) or shorter (candida parapsilosis, 14 days). most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as corona, coxsackie, influenza, sars or rhino virus, can persist on  surfaces for a few days. viruses from the gastrointestinal tract, such as astrovirus, hav, polio- or rota virus, persist for approximately 2 months. blood-borne viruses, such as hbv or hiv, can persist for more than one week. herpes viruses, such as cmv or hsv type 1 and 2, have been shown to persist from  only a few hours up to 7 days. conclusion: the most common nosocomial pathogens may well survive or persist on surfaces for months and can thereby be a continuous source of transmission if no regular preventive surface disinfection is performed.

TI  == prevalence of zoonotic agents in dogs visiting hospitalized people in ontario: implications for infection control.
AB  == visitation of hospitalized people by dogs is becoming commonplace, but little is  known about the potential health risks of introducing dogs to healthcare settings. this cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence of zoonotic agents  in a group of 102 visitation dogs from a variety of sources across ontario. between may and july 2004, owners were interviewed by a standardized questionnaire while dogs underwent a standardized physical examination. one specimen of faeces, hair-coat brushings and one rectal, aural, nasal, oral and pharyngeal swab were collected from each dog and tested for 18 specific pathogens. all dogs were judged to be in good health. zoonotic agents were isolated from 80 out of 102 (80%) dogs. the primary pathogen was clostridium difficile, which was isolated from 58 (58%) faecal specimens. seventy-one percent (41/58) of these isolates were toxigenic. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase escherichia coli was isolated from one (1%) dog, extended-spectrum cephalosporinase e. coli was isolated from three (3%) dogs, and organisms of the  genus salmonella were isolated from three (3%) dogs. pasteurella multocida or pasteurella canis was isolated from 29 (29%) oral swabs, and malassezia pachydermatis was isolated from eight (8%) aural swabs. giardia antigen was present in the faeces of seven (7%) dogs, while toxocara canis and ancylostoma caninum were detected in two (2%) dogs and one (1%) dog, respectively. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, campylobacter spp., microsporum canis, group a streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa and cryptosporidium spp. were not detected. further information is needed before the full implications of these findings for infection control can be assessed properly.

TI  == trends in antimicrobial resistance in health care-associated pathogens and effect on treatment.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance in health care-associated pathogens is a growing concern for health care and for public health. a recent shift in the epidemiological profile of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus has resulted not only in health care-associated infections but now, also, in community-associated infections. reports have described s. aureus exhibiting decreased susceptibility  and, even, resistance to vancomycin. the rate of vancomycin resistance among enterococci may be leveling; however, vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium has already achieved high levels. multidrug resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa is increasing, and carbapenem-resistant klebsiella strains are emerging. acinetobacter species cause a minority of health care-associated pneumonias due to gram-negative organisms, but a growing proportion is resistant  to carbapenems and third-generation cephalosporins. recent increases in the frequency and severity of clostridium difficile-associated illness are associated with the emergence of a hypervirulent c. difficile strain with increased resistance to the fluoroquinolones. the presence of these and other resistant organisms in health care facilities limits the number of effective antimicrobials available for treatment.

TI  == epidemiology, risk factors and outcome of nosocomial infections in a respiratory  intensive care unit in north india.
AB  == objective: to determine the epidemiology, risk factors and outcome of infections  in a respiratory intensive care unit (ricu) of a tertiary care institute in northern india. methodology: prospective, observational clinical study. results:  the study included 201 patients (1285 patient days) admitted to ricu over a period of one-and-a-half years. a total of 77 infections were identified in 67 patients (33.5%). the infections included pneumonia (23%), sepsis of unknown origin (10.5%), bacteremia (7.5%), urinary tract infections (1.5%), catheter related blood stream infections (1%) and clostridium difficile colitis (1%). the  most commonly identified organisms were the acinetobacter species (34.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.9%) and escherichia coli (15.2%). the median length of stay in patients with and without infection was 13 days (interquartile range, iqr, 28) and 4 days (interquartile range, iqr, 3), respectively (p<0.0001). multivariate analysis showed the following risk factors for icu-acquired infection: the admitting diagnosis of infection (odds ratio [or] 3.3; 95% confidence intervals [ci] 1.06-10.1), length of stay in the ricu (or, 1.2; 95% confidence intervals [ci] 1.1-1.33); renal failure (or, 4.7; 95% ci, 1.52-14.41)  and institution of parenteral nutrition (or, 16.9; 95% ci, 1.07-269.03). multivariate analysis showed the following risk factors for death in icu: apache  ii scores (or, 1.06; 95% ci, 1.01-1.11), and endotracheal intubation (or, 5.07; 95% ci, 1.24-20.65). conclusions: this study clearly documents a high prevalence  rate of infections in the icu, and the data suggest that occurrence of infections was associated with a prolonged icu stay but had no significant effect on the final outcome.

TI  == increase of faecal bifidobacteria due to dietary oligosaccharides induces a reduction of clinically relevant pathogen germs in the faeces of formula-fed preterm infants.
AB  == in a previous study on formula-fed preterm infants, we were able to demonstrate that dietary oligosaccharides (a mixture of 90% galacto-oligosaccharides and 10%  fructo-oligosaccharides in a concentration of 1 g/dl) stimulate the growth of faecal bifidobacteria. in the present explorative analysis of this study, we focus on the effect of the dominance of bifidobacteria on the presence of clinically relevant pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter, klebsiella, proteus, streptococcus group b, clostridium difficile, bacillus subtilis and acinetobacter). conclusion: the data demonstrate that stimulation of bifidobacteria by prebiotic oligosaccharides reduces the presence of clinically relevant pathogens in the faecal flora, indicating that prebiotic substances might have the capacity to protect against enteral infections.

TI  == epithelial cell polarity alters rho-gtpase responses to pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen that preferentially infects damaged epithelial tissues. previous studies have failed to distinguish whether the increased susceptibility of injured epithelium results from the loss  of cell polarity or increased access to the basolateral surface. we have used confluent monolayers of madin-darby canine kidney (mdck) cells cultured on porous filter supports for 1-3 d as a model system to investigate whether the differentiation state of a polarized model epithelium affected the response of epithelial cells to this pathogen. confluent incompletely polarized mdck cell monolayers (day 1) efficiently internalized apically applied p. aeruginosa via a  pathway that required actin polymerization and activation of rho-family gtpases and was accompanied by an increase in the amount of activated rhoa. in contrast,  p. aeruginosa entry into highly polarized mdck monolayers (day 3) was 10- to 100-fold less efficient and was insensitive to inhibitors of actin polymerization or of rho-family gtpase activation. there was no activation of rhoa; instead, cdc42-gtp levels increased significantly. basolateral infection of highly polarized mdck monolayers was less efficient and insensitive to clostridium difficile toxin b, whereas basolateral infection of incompletely polarized mdck monolayers was more efficient and required activation of rho-family gtpases. together, our findings suggest that as epithelial barrier differentiates and becomes highly polarized, it becomes resistant to p. aeruginosa infection. nevertheless, polarized epithelial cells still sense the presence of apically infecting p. aeruginosa, but they may do so through a different group of surface  proteins and/or downstream signaling pathways than do incompletely polarized cells.

AB  == ertapenem (mk-0826, l-749,345) is a 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long serum half-life. its in vitro activity was determined by broth microdilution against 3,478 bacteria from 12 centers in europe and australia, with imipenem, cefepime,  ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam used as comparators. ertapenem was the most active agent tested against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)s) of < or =1 microg/ml for all species. ertapenem also was more active than imipenem against fastidious gram-negative bacteria and moraxella spp.; on the other hand, ertapenem was slightly less active than imipenem against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci, and anaerobes, but its mic(90)s for these groups remained < or =0.5 microg/ml. acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also much less susceptible to ertapenem than imipenem, and most enterococcus faecalis strains were resistant. ertapenem resistance, based on a provisional nccls mic breakpoint of > or =16 microg/ml, was seen in only 3 of 1,611 strains of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, all of them enterobacter aerogenes. resistance was also seen in 2 of 135 anaerobes, comprising 1 bacteroides fragilis strain and 1 clostridium difficile strain. ertapenem breakpoints for streptococci have not been established, but an unofficial susceptibility breakpoint of < or =2 microg/ml was adopted for clinical trials to generate corresponding clinical response data for isolates for which mics were as high as 2 microg/ml. of 234 streptococcus pneumoniae strains tested, 2 required ertapenem mics of 2 microg/ml and one required an mic of 4 microg/ml, among 67 non-streptococcus pyogenes, non-streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci, single isolates required ertapenem mics of 2 and 16 microg/ml. these streptococci also had diminished susceptibilities to other beta-lactams, including imipenem as well as ertapenem.  the etest and disk diffusion gave susceptibility test results in good agreement with those of the broth microdilution method for ertapenem.

AB  == the interest of probiotics as remedies for a broad number of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases has gained wide interest over the last few years, but little is known about their underlying mechanism of action. in this study, the probiotic activities of a human isolate of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus strain (lcr35) were investigated. using intestinal caco-2 cell line in an in vitro model, we demonstrated that this strain exhibited adhesive properties. the  inhibitory effects of lcr35 organisms on the adherence of three pathogens, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) and klebsiella pneumoniae, were determined. a decrease in the number of adhering pathogens was observed, using either preincubation, postincubation or coincubation of the pathogens with lcr35. moreover, the antibacterial activities  of cell-free lcr35 supernatant was examined against nine human pathogenic bacteria, etec, epec, k. pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile. the growth of all strains was inhibited, as measured by determining the number of viable bacteria over time, but no bactericidal activity was detected in this in vitro assay. together, these findings suggest that this probiotic strain could be used to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by a large variety of pathogens.

TI  == bifidobacterium strains from resident infant human gastrointestinal microflora exert antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background and aims: the gastrointestinal microflora exerts a barrier effect against enteropathogens. the aim of this study was to examine if bifidobacteria,  a major species of the human colonic microflora, participates in the barrier effect by developing antimicrobial activity against enterovirulent bacteria. methods: antibacterial activity was examined in vitro against a wide range of gram negative and gram positive pathogens. inhibition of salmonella typhimurium sl1334 cell association and cell invasion was investigated in vitro using caco-2  cells. colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract in vivo by bifidobacteria was examined in axenic c3/he/oujco mice. antimicrobial activity was examined in vivo  in axenic c3/he/oujco mice infected by the lethal s typhimurium c5 strain. results: fourteen human bifidobacterium strains isolated from infant stools were  examined for antimicrobial activity. two strains (ca1 and f9) expressed antagonistic activity against pathogens in vitro, inhibited cell entry, and killed intracellular s typhimurium sl1344 in caco-2 cells. an antibacterial component(s) produced by ca1 and f9 was found to be a lipophilic molecule(s) with a molecular weight of less than 3500. in the axenic c3/he/oujco mice, ca1 and f9  strains colonised the intestinal tract and protected mice against s typhimurium c5 lethal infection. conclusion: several bifidobacterium strains from resident infant human gastrointestinal microflora exert antimicrobial activity, suggesting that they could participate in the "barrier effect" produced by the indigenous microflora.

TI  == rho gtpases as targets of bacterial protein toxins.
AB  == several bacterial toxins target rho gtpases, which constitute molecular switches  in several signaling processes and master regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. the biological activities of rho gtpases are blocked by c3-like transferases, which adp-ribosylate rho at asn41, but not rac or cdc42. large clostridial cytotoxins (e. g., clostridium difficile toxin a and b) glucosylate rho gtpases at thr37 (rho) or thr35 (rac/cdc42), thereby inhibiting rho functions by preventing effector coupling. the 'injected' toxins exos, yope and sptp from pseudomonas aeruginosa, yersinia and salmonella ssp., respectively, which are transferred into the eukaryotic target cells by the type-iii secretion system, inhibit rho functions by acting as rho gap proteins. rho gtpases are activated by the cytotoxic necrotizing factors cnf1 and cnf2 from escherichia coli and by the  dermonecrotizing toxin dnt from b. bronchiseptica. these toxins deamidate/transglutaminate gln63 of rho to block the intrinsic and gap-stimulated gtp hydrolysis, thereby constitutively activating the gtpases. rho gtpases are also activated by sope, a type-iii system injected protein from salmonella ssp.,  that acts as a gef protein.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial spectrum of a new broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, gatifloxacin.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial spectrum of gatifloxacin was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent than  comparator quinolones against staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci (gatifloxacin mic90s, < or =1 mg/l, except 4 mg/l against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium). gatifloxacin was two-fold less potent than ciprofloxacin, and the same as or two-fold more potent than ofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae (mic90s, 0.06-0.5  mg/l against most members of the enterobacteriaceae and < or =1 mg/l against proteus/morganella spp.). relative to the comparator quinolones, gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent against providencia spp., and had good potency against acinetobacter spp. (mic90s, 0.25-1 mg/l). gatifloxacin and ofloxacin had  similar anti-pseudomonal potency, with corresponding mic90s of 4, 8 and 0.25 mg/l for pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens and pseudomonas stutzeri, while ciprofloxacin had two- to eight-fold more potency. the three quinolones were equipotent against burkholderia cepacia (mic90s, 8 mg/l), but gatifloxacin was two-fold more potent against stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, 4 mg/l). gatifloxacin was highly potent (mic90s, 0.03-0.06 mg/l) against haemophilus influenzae, legionella spp., helicobacter pylori and had at least eight-fold better anti-chlamydial and anti-mycoplasma potency (gatifloxacin mic90s, 0.13 mg/l). the higher quinolone mics for ureaplasma (mic90s, 4-8 mg/l) may be due to  the acidic ph of the ureaplasma test medium, which antagonizes quinolones. like other quinolones, gatifloxacin had poor potency against mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, though it was eight- to 16-fold more potent against mycobacterium tuberculosis (mic90, 0.25 mg/l). of the three quinolones, only gatifloxacin had activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium difficile. in summary, gatifloxacin is a broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that is more potent than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria, chlamydia, mycoplasma, mycobacteria and anaerobes.

TI  == epidemiology of nosocomial infection and resistant organisms in patients admitted for the first time to an acute rehabilitation unit.
AB  == the objectives of this study were to define the epidemiology of nosocomial bacterial colonization and infection and to define predictors of nosocomial infection among a cohort (n=423) of admissions to an acute rehabilitation unit. overall, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococci were  the most commonly identified colonizing organisms. escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most commonly identified colonizing gram-negative bacilli. during 70 (16.5%) of the 423 hospitalizations in the unit, 94 nosocomial infections occurred. the most common infections were those of the urinary tract (30% of 94 infections) or a surgical site (17%), clostridium difficile diarrhea (15%), and bloodstream infection (12.8%). antibiotic-resistant bacteria most commonly caused bloodstream infection (41.7%) and surgical site infection (56.3%). independent predictors of nosocomial infection at the time of admission  were functional status (measured with the functional independence measure), apache iii score, and spinal cord injury. in conclusion, gram-positive organisms  were the predominant strains causing nosocomial colonization and infection. the logistic model, if verified, may be useful in defining patients who should be targeted for measures to prevent nosocomial infection.

TI  == detection of the adp-ribosyltransferase toxin gene (cdta) and its activity in clostridium difficile isolates from equidae.
AB  == clostridium difficile is an antibiotic-associated emerging pathogen of humans and animals. thus far three toxins of c. difficile have been described: an enterotoxin (toxa), a cytotoxin (toxb) and an adp-ribosyltransferase (cdt). in the present work we describe the first isolation of cdt producing c. difficile from equidae with gastro-intestinal disease. out of 17 c. difficile strains isolated from equidae, 11 were positive for the genes tcda and tcdb encoding toxa and toxb. in addition four of these 11 isolates were positive for the cdta gene encoding the catalytic subunit of the adp-ribosyltransferase cdt. interestingly none of the isolates derived from canines (41 isolates) and felines (4 isolates)  harboured the cdta gene. in c. difficile field isolates which contained the cdta  gene, adp-ribosyltransferase activity could also be detected in culture supernatants indicating expression and secretion of cdt. all strains were associated with intestinal disorders, but no association was found for the occurrence of toxins with a specific clinical diagnosis.

TI  == in vitro activities of novel trans-3,5-disubstituted pyrrolidinylthio-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == the in vitro activities of the novel 1beta-methylcarbapenems j-111, 225, j-114,870, and j-114,871, which have a structurally unique side chain that consists of a trans-3,5-disubstituted 5-arylpyrrolidin-3-ylthio moiety at the c-2 position, were compared with those of reference antibiotics. among isolates of both methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mrcons), 90% were inhibited by j-111,347 (prototype), j-111,225, j-114,870, and j-114,871 at concentrations of 2, 4, 4, and 4 microgram/ml (mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [mic(90)s]), respectively, indicating that these agents were 32- to 64-fold more potent than imipenem, which has an mic(90) of 128 microgram/ml. although these drugs were less active in vitro than vancomycin, which had mic(90)s of 1 and 2 microgram/ml  for mrsa and mrcons, respectively, the new carbapenems displayed better killing kinetics than vancomycin. the potent anti-mrsa activity was ascribed to the excellent affinities of the new carbapenems for penicillin-binding protein 2a of  mrsa. since the new carbapenems also exhibited good activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria including clinically important pathogens such as penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and clostridium difficile, as well as mrsa, the novel carbapenems are worthy of further evaluation.

TI  == bacterial toxins inhibiting or activating small gtp-binding proteins.
AB  == amino acids located on the switch 1 or switch 2 domains of small gtpases of the ras and rho family are targets of several bacterial toxins. exoenzyme c3 from clostridium botulinum adp-ribosylates specifically rho at r43 and prevents the recruitment of rho on the cell membrane. this blocks the downstream effects of the rho gtpase. however, exoenzyme c3 is not a toxin, and chimeric proteins fusing c3 with the b moiety of either diphtheria toxin or pseudomonas aeruginosa  exotoxin a have been produced to intoxicate cells with low concentration of c3. c. difficile toxin b modifies by glucosylation rho on t37 and rac and cdc42 on t35. glucosylation of rho, rac, and cdc42 blocks the binding of these gtpases on  their downstream effectors. c. sordellii lethal toxin modifies ras, rap, and rac  on t35 by glucosylation. cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (cnf1), from uropathogenic escherichia coli strains, deamidates q63 of rho into e63, thereby blocking the intrinsic or gap-mediated gtpase of rho. this allows permanent activation of rho. thus, rho gtpases are targets for three different toxin activities. molecular mechanisms of these toxins are discussed.

TI  == bacterial resistance to disinfectants: present knowledge and future problems.
AB  == bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a long-established, widely-studied problem. increasingly, attention is being directed to the responses of various types of microbes to biocides (antiseptics, disinfectants and preservatives). different groups of bacteria vary in their susceptibility to biocides, with bacterial spores being the most resistant, followed by mycobacteria, then gram-negative organisms, with cocci generally being the most sensitive. there are wide divergencies within this general classification. thus, (i) spores of bacillus subtilis are less susceptible to biocides than those of clostridium difficile: (ii) mycobacterium chelonae strains may show high resistance to glutaraldehyde and m. avium intracellulare is generally less sensitive than m. tuberculosis; (iii) gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, providencia spp and proteus spp may be difficult to inactivate; (iv) enterococci  are less sensitive than staphylococci to biocides and antibiotic-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus might show low-level biocide resistance. the mechanisms involved in biocide resistance to biocides are becoming better understood. intrinsic resistance (intrinsic insusceptibility) is found with bacterial spores, mycobacteria and gram-negative bacteria. this resistance might, in some instances, be associated with constitutive degradative enzymes but in reality is more closely linked to cellular impermeability. the coats(s) and, to some extent, the cortex in spores, the arabinogalactan and possibly other components of the mycobacterial cell wall and the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria limit the concentration of active biocide that can reach the target site(s) in these bacterial cells. a special situation is found with bacteria present in biofilms, which can be considered as being an intrinsic resistance mechanism resulting from physiological (phenotypic) adaptation of cells. acquired resistance to biocides may arise by cellular mutation or by the acquisition of genetic elements. plasmid/transposon-mediated resistance to inorganic and organic mercury compounds by hydrolases and reductases has been extensively studied. plasmid-mediated resistance to some other biocides in gram-negative bacteria and  in staphylococci has been described, but its significance remains uncertain. as to the future, there is a need to establish conclusively whether there is a clear-cut linkage between antibiotic and biocide resistance in non-sporulating bacteria and whether biocides can select for antibiotic resistance. additionally, the responses to biocides of new and emerging pathogens must be assessed. at the  same time, continuing research is necessary to establish further the underlying mechanisms of resistance and to provide more efficient means of bacterial inactivation.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of synthetic bismuth compounds against clostridium difficile.
AB  == clostridium difficile is a major nosocomial pathogen responsible for pseudomembranous colitis and many cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. because of potential relapse of disease with current antimicrobial therapy protocols, there is a need for additional and/or alternative antimicrobial agents for the treatment of disease caused by c. difficile. we have synthesized a systematic series of 14 structurally simple bismuth compounds and assessed their  biological activities against c. difficile and four other gastrointestinal species, including helicobacter pylori. here, we report on the activities of six  compounds that exhibit antibacterial activities against c. difficile, and some of the compounds have mics of less than 1 microgram/ml. also tested, for comparison, were the activities of bismuth subcitrate and ranitidine bismuth citrate obtained from commercial sources. c. difficile and h. pylori were more sensitive both to the synthetic bismuth compounds and to the commercial products than were escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis, and the last three species were markedly resistant to the commercial bismuth salts. testing with human foreskin fibroblast cells revealed that some of the synthetic compounds were more cytotoxic than others. killing curves for c. difficile treated with the more active compounds revealed rapid death, and electron microscopy showed that the bismuth of these compounds was rapidly incorporated by c. difficile. energy dispersive spectroscopy x-ray microanalysis of c. difficile  cells containing electron-dense material confirmed the presence of internalized bismuth. internalized bismuth was not observed in c. difficile treated with synthetic bismuth compounds that lacked antimicrobial activity, which suggests that the uptake of the metal is required for killing activity. the nature of the  carrier would seem to determine whether bismuth is transported into susceptible bacteria like c. difficile.

TI  == saccharomyces boulardii protease inhibits the effects of clostridium difficile toxins a and b in human colonic mucosa.
AB  == saccharomyces boulardii is a nonpathogenic yeast used in the treatment of clostridium difficile diarrhea and colitis. we have reported that s. boulardii inhibits c. difficile toxin a enteritis in rats by releasing a 54-kda protease which digests the toxin a molecule and its brush border membrane (bbm) receptor (i. castagliuolo, j. t. lamont, s. t. nikulasson, and c. pothoulakis, infect. immun. 64:5225-5232, 1996). the aim of this study was to further evaluate the role of s. boulardii protease in preventing c. difficile toxin a enteritis in rat ileum and determine whether it protects human colonic mucosa from c. difficile toxins. a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against purified s. boulardii serine protease inhibited by 73% the proteolytic activity present in s. boulardii conditioned medium in vitro. the anti-protease immunoglobulin g (igg) prevented the action of s. boulardii on toxin a-induced intestinal secretion and mucosal permeability to [3h]mannitol in rat ileal loops, while control rabbit igg had no  effect. the anti-protease igg also prevented the effects of s. boulardii protease on digestion of toxins a and b and on binding of [3h]toxin a and [3h]toxin b to purified human colonic bbm. purified s. boulardii protease reversed toxin a- and  toxin b-induced inhibition of protein synthesis in human colonic (ht-29) cells. furthermore, toxin a- and b-induced drops in transepithelial resistance in human  colonic mucosa mounted in ussing chambers were reversed by 60 and 68%, respectively, by preexposing the toxins to s. boulardii protease. we conclude that the protective effects of s. boulardii on c. difficile-induced inflammatory  diarrhea in humans are due, at least in part, to proteolytic digestion of toxin a and b molecules by a secreted protease.

TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem compared to nine other antimicrobial agents: importance of its stability when used in agar dilution systems.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of meropenem was tested against 426 clinical isolates  representing a wide range of aerobic and anaerobic species. the in vitro activity of meropenem was compared with that of iminpenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin and tobramycin against aerobic isolates, and also compared with that of imipenem, metronidazole, cefoxitin, clindamycin and piperacillin against the anaerobic isolates. meropenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) against gram negative aerobes, anaerobes, gram positive anaerobes and most of the gram positive aerobes. the mic90 of meropenem against the enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.03 mg/l to 0.125 mg/l. meropenem was very active against extended spectrum beta lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae, most acinetobacter species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium difficile (mic90 of 1.0 mg/l), clostridium perfringens and other clostridium species. even though imipenem exhibited better  activity against the coagulase negative staphylococci, meropenem still had mic's  which were less than the break point (8.0 mg/l). the stability of meropenem in agar was determined indirectly by plotting the geometric mean mic of control strains over a period of two weeks. mean mic of six control strains for meropenem was 0.05 mg/l and remained constant over 10 days, whereas the mean mic of imipenem rose to 0.24 mg/l after two days and to 3.4 mg/l after 10 days. meropenem was therefore far more stable in agar than imipenem. this has implications for laboratories using agar dilution as it requires less frequent plate preparation and decreased labour costs.

TI  == pseudomonas aeruginosa as a cause of infectious diarrhea successfully treated with oral ciprofloxacin.
AB  == objective: to describe an immunocompromised patient (without aids) with nosocomial infectious diarrhea caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa. oral ciprofloxacin therapy proved to be effective. case summary: an 80-year-old woman  with type ii diabetes mellitus and hypertension developed progressive renal insufficiency, was hospitalized because of uremia, and underwent hemodialysis. when the patient developed hematochezia, duke's c sigmoid colon cancer was detected and successfully resected. she received broad-spectrum antibiotics in the perioperative period. the patient then developed profuse diarrhea associated  with abdominal cramping, a low-grade fever, prostration, and headache. the patient then started to received vancomycin 500 mg po qid empirically. four days  later, the diarrhea continued unabated, the clostridium difficile titer was negative, and the vancomycin therapy was stopped. however, the stool culture was  positive for heavy growth of p. aeruginosa sensitive to ciprofloxacin. the patient then began to receive ciprofloxacin 500 mg po bid. within 3 days the diarrhea stopped. oral ciprofloxacin therapy was continued for 10 days and the patient remained free of symptoms with formed stools thereafter. discussion: diarrhea following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics implicates pseudomembranous colitis as the cause. the patient did not respond to oral vancomycin therapy and had a negative stool assay for c. difficile toxin. this patient was believed to have pseudomonas enteritis, which was confirmed by 2 positive stool cultures. the administration of oral ciprofloxacin therapy stopped her diarrhea with a rapid resolution of symptoms. conclusions: p. aeruginosa as a cause of infectious diarrhea is unusual. when it occurs, it usually represents a  nosocomial infection in an immunocompromised host. this report illustrates that oral ciprofloxacin therapy is effective for pseudomonas enteritis, with rapid resolution of symptoms.

AB  == the in vitro activities of the carbapenem bms-181139 were determined in comparison with those of imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. bms-181139 was the most active against species of pseudomonas and related genera alteromonas and burkholderia, with mics for 147 of 149 isolates of < 4 micrograms/ml. of 22 imipenem-resistant (mic > 8 micrograms/ml) p. aeruginosa strains, only 1 required an mic of bms-181139 of > 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 14 requiring the same meropenem mic. bms-181139 was the most active carbapenem against the majority of other gram-negative species except members of the tribe proteeae, against which meropenem was more active. although imipenem was more active against gram-positive species, bms-18139 mics at which 90% of strain tested were inhibited were < 1 microgram/ml for these species. bms-181139 was generally active against isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin or broad-spectrum cephalosporins, including those containing plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases or high levels of chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases, as well as anaerobes except clostridium difficile. inoculum effects were noted for all three carbapenems against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens but  not escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or staphylococcus aureus. bms-181139's inoculum effect tended to be more marked. bms-181139 exhibited bactericidal activity at the mic for some strains and up to four to eight times the mic for others. the postantibiotic effect of bms-181139 was equal to or less  than that of imipenem and, like meropenem, exhibited intraspecies variability. bms-181139 was 30-fold more stable than imipenem and 7-fold more stable than meropenem to hydrolysis by hog kidney dehydropeptidase.

TI  == cefepime: a new fourth-generation cephalosporin.
AB  == the chemistry, pharmacology, antimicrobial spectrum, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and dosage of cefepime are reviewed. fourth-generation cephalosporins, such as cefepime, have a quaternary nitrogen that is positively charged at the 3-position, providing the properties of a zwitterion. a 2-aminothiazolyl-acetamido group in the side chain at the 7-position with an alpha-oxyimino substitution may enhance stability against beta-lactamases by preventing the enzymes' approach to the main nucleus. cefepime may exert its antimicrobial effect by attaching to specific penicillin-binding proteins, disrupting cell-wall synthesis. cefepime has good activity against gram-positive  organisms, such as staphylococcus aureus, and gram-negative organisms, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefepime is not active in vitro against enterococcus faecalis, clostridium difficile, and methicillin- and cefazolin-resistant staph.  aureus. cefepime's activity against gram-negative organisms is similar to that of most third-generation cephalosporins. the agent has poor activity against bacteroides species. the most common mechanism of resistance to cefepime is the excess production of beta-lactamases. maximum peak plasma concentrations are two  to three times higher after i.v. administration than after intramuscular administration. in healthy adults, the volume of distribution is 13-22 l and the  elimination half-life is 2-2.3 hours. clinical studies show that cefepime is as effective as cefotaxime or ceftazidime in patients with infections of the lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structures, urinary tract, or female reproductive system. cefepime reduces fever as effectively as ceftazidime or piperacillin plus gentamicin in neutropenic patients. the most common adverse effects of cefepime are headache (2.4%), nausea (1.8%), rash (1.8%), and diarrhea (1.7%). depending on creatinine clearance, the dosage of cefepime is 1000-2000 mg i.v. every 8-24 hours for life-threatening infections and 500-2000 mg i.v. every  12-24 hours for severe infections. cefepime's clinical efficacy is comparable to  that of ceftazidime and cefotaxime.

AB  == little is known about the mucosal microflora of the colon and rectum at the time  of elective surgery. our objective was to determine the concentrations of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria associated with the mucosa of the mechanically prepared large bowel. ten patients were studied after a standard polyethylene glycol-electrolyte lavage preparation. no patient had taken antibiotics in the preceding four weeks. sterile wire brushes passed through the colonoscope during  advancement were used to culture the rectal, transverse colon, and cecal mucosa.  total anaerobic, aerobic, gram-positive, and enteric bacterial counts were determined along with specific cultures for bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus, and staphylococcus species. the results showed that there was a significant increase  (p < 0.01) in aerobes, anaerobes, enterics, gram positives, b. fragilis, and e. coli mucosal counts with proximal progression. aerobes showed a steady gradient,  while anaerobes demonstrated an increase from the rectum to the transverse colon  but no change between the transverse colon and cecum. we conclude that, in the prepared bowel, there is an increase in the mucosal bacterial counts in the more  proximal portions of the bowel. the results may serve as a baseline for future studies on the mucosal-associated bacteria of the large intestine.

TI  == shedding of clostridium difficile, fecal beta-lactamase activity, and gastrointestinal symptoms in 51 volunteers treated with oral cefixime.
AB  == microbial changes including the shedding of clostridium difficile, fecal beta-lactamase activity, and gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed in 51 healthy volunteers given 200 mg of cefixime twice daily for 8 days. the number of organisms of the family enterobacteriaceae (means +/- standard deviations) dropped from 6.9 +/- 1.1 to 3.9 +/- 1.8 log cfu/g of feces (p < 0.01), whereas counts of enterococci rose from 7.0 +/- 1.5 to 9.0 +/- 1.0 log cfu/g of feces (p  < 0.01). both counts returned to their initial levels 50 days after the cessation of treatment. cefixime did not significantly modify the frequency of fecal excretion of pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus spp., yeasts, or members of the enterobacteriaceae resistant to ceftazidime or ampicillin. the proportion of  subjects shedding c. difficile rose from 6% before treatment to 57% (p < 0.01) at the end of treatment but returned to 8% 50 days thereafter. no case of pseudomembranous colitis was observed. stool changes occurred in 13 volunteers during treatment (25%) and in 2 others more than 10 days after the end of treatment (4%). these changes were not significantly associated with the shedding of toxigenic strains of c. difficile or with the presence of toxin a in feces. by contrast, during treatment, stool changes occurred in 8 of the 18 volunteers (44%) who had antibiotic activity in their feces but in only 5 of the 33 (15%) for whom no such activity was found (p < 0.05). the absence of antibiotic activity in the feces was itself linked with the presence of beta-lactamase activity in the feces. since we had found earlier that fecal beta-lactamase activity afforded protection against alteration in stool consistency during treatments with oral cephalosporins, the present study confirmed our previous preliminary results in this respect.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of t-3761, a new quinolone derivative.
AB  == t-3761, a new quinolone derivative, showed broad and potent antibacterial activity. its mics for 90% of the strains tested were 0.20 to 100 micrograms/ml against gram-positive bacteria, including members of the genera staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus; 0.025 to 3.13 micrograms/ml against gram-negative bacteria, including members of the family enterobacteriaceae and the genus haemophilus; 0.05 to 50 micrograms/ml against glucose nonfermenters, including members of the genera pseudomonas, xanthomonas, acinetobacter, alcaligenes, and moraxella; 0.025 micrograms/ml against legionella spp.; and 6.25 to 25 micrograms/ml against anaerobes, including bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and peptostreptococcus spp. the in vitro activity of t-3761 against these clinical isolates was comparable to or 2- to 32-fold greater than those of ofloxacin and norfloxacin and 2- to 16-fold less and 1- to 8-fold greater than those of ciprofloxacin and tosulfoxacin, respectively. when administered orally, t-3761 showed good efficacy in mice against systemic, pulmonary, and urinary tract infections with gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including quinolone-resistant serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the in vivo activity of t-3761 was comparable to or greater than those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and tosufloxacin against most infection models in mice. the activities of t-3761 were lower than those of tosufloxacin against gram-positive bacterial systemic and pulmonary infections in mice but not against infections with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. the activities of t-3761 against systemic quinolone-resistant serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in mice were 2- to 14-fold greater than those of the reference agents.

TI  == newly documented antimicrobial activity of quinolones.
AB  == the improved antimicrobial activity of newer fluoroquinolones and novel applications recently found for the drugs already marketed are reviewed. several  new compounds are more active against gram-positive bacteria than the presently marketed fluoroquinolones. win 57273, the most potent compound in vitro on a weight basis, is 16 to 128 times more active than ciprofloxacin against various staphylococci, streptococci, enterococcus spp., corynebacterium spp., listeria monocytogenes and bacillus spp. bmy 40062, pd 117558, pd 127391, sparfloxacin, temafloxacin and tosufloxacin also show enhanced in vitro efficacy against these  species. these drugs also possess increased activity against various anaerobes, notably clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile and the bacteroides fragilis group. mycobacterium tuberculosis, rapidly growing mycobacteria other than mycobacterium chelonae, and mycobacterium leprae are often susceptible to quinolones displaying bactericidal activity which is potentially useful for curing difficult-to-treat mycobacteriosis. in addition, a number of new products, notably those containing a cyclopropyl group, are more active than reference fluoroquinolones against mycobacterium leprae. sparfloxacin, bmy 40062 and win 57273 compare favorably with older fluoroquinolones in the killing of intracellular legionella spp., and several of the newer compounds have greater antichlamydial potency. improved antibacterial activity has also been found against mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas maltophilia. by contrast, the newer quinolones have similar or less activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae. recently, pefloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were found to be active against protozoa, including plasmodium spp., trypanosoma cruzi and leishmania donovani, but not against toxoplasma gondii. in the near future, more specific research testing unusual pathogens may lead to the identification of quinolones with more selective activity.

TI  == cytotoxic effects of children's faeces: relation to diarrhoea due to clostridium  difficile and other enteric pathogens.
AB  == cytotoxicity of faecal extracts was demonstrated in 47 of 88 children (54%) referred for microbiological investigation of stools. cytotoxic clostridium difficile and vertotoxigenic escherichia coli (vtec) were the pathogens identified most commonly but cytotoxicity was also found in association with campylobacter jejuni, salmonella spp, shigella sonnei, giardia lamblia, rotavirus, adenovirus and poliovirus type 1 which had been acquired by oral immunization. in two patients, one of whom had cystic fibrosis, cytotoxicity of faecal extracts was associated with isolation of pseudomonas aeruginosa. in five  of 13 patients with diarrhoea and cytotoxic c. difficile, other pathogens were also present, in agreement with the view that c. difficile are more readily recovered when the intestinal flora have been altered by colonization with other  micro-organisms. there was no correlation between previous treatment with antibiotics and isolation of c. difficile. cytotoxicity neutralized by antitoxin, usually to c. sordellii, is used to detect cytotoxic c. difficile. we suggest that cytotoxicity not neutralized in this way should be an indication for further investigation of stools for the presence of other pathogens such as vtec or viruses.

TI  == effect of ceftazidime and gentamicin on the oropharyngeal and faecal flora of patients with haematological malignancies.
AB  == thirty-four patients with haematological malignancies were studied to investigate the effect of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (ceftazidime and gentamicin) on the gastro-intestinal flora. twenty-five patients with acute myeloid leukaemia or post-autologous bone-marrow transplantation were given framycetin, nystatin and colistin (fracon), and two patients with non-hodgkin's lymphoma were on co-trimoxazole, as long-term gut prophylaxis. semi-quantitative  microbiology was carried out on oropharyngeal swabs and quantitative microbiology on faecal specimens. the oropharyngeal flora consisted mainly of streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci and coryneforms, and was little affected by ceftazidime/gentamicin. a strain of enterobacter cloacae resistant to ceftazidime and gentamicin colonized one patient, who later developed septicaemia. the faecal flora of patients on fracon was dominated by enterococci; the few enterobacteria  present were eliminated by ceftazidime/gentamicin. the anaerobic flora was absent in 15% of patients; in the remainder, it consisted mainly of bacteroides spp., and was little affected by ceftazidime/gentamicin. the faecal flora of patients not on fracon always contained anaerobes, and some strains of enterobacteria persisted throughout antibiotic treatment. none of the patients was colonized by  clostridium difficile or pseudomonas aeruginosa. broad-spectrum therapy with ceftazidime and gentamicin appeared to have little effect on the gastro-intestinal flora, except to encourage the overgrowth of enterococci and reduce the numbers of enterobacteria.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpirome and cefepime, two new cephalosporins.
AB  == in in vitro tests the broad-spectrum cephalosporins cefpirome and cefepime were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, although often less so against strains  resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and ticarcillin-clavulanate, and against most strains of acinetobacter spp. and aeromonas hydrophila. they were also active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, although strains with non-plasmid mediated beta-lactam resistance were sometimes less sensitive. other pseudomonas spp. varied in their sensitivity. both agents were highly active against haemophilus influenzae, but beta-lactamase-producing branhamella catarrhalis were somewhat less sensitive. neisseria gonorrhoeae were susceptible, although non-beta-lactamase producing penicillin-resistant strains had higher mics. gardnerella vaginalis was also susceptible and campylobacter coli/jejuni usually  susceptible. both antibiotics had good activity against staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci except for methicillin-resistant strains and staphylococcus haemolyticus which were of borderline sensitivity. all streptococci were sensitive, with the exception of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci and enterococci against which cefpirome had greater activity than cefepime. both antibiotics had little useful activity against the bacteroides fragilis group or bacteroides oralis group but were active against most other anaerobes. clostridium difficile and some other clostridium species were resistant.

TI  == faecal excretion of ciprofloxacin after a single oral dose and its effect on faecal bacteria in healthy volunteers.
AB  == high concentrations of ciprofloxacin have been shown to persist in the faeces of  volunteers for several days after a week of oral treatment with this drug, which  was also found to have a prolonged effect on aerobic gram-negative intestinal bacteria. to determine whether a shorter course of ciprofloxacin would have the same prolonged effect, we treated ten healthy adult volunteers with a single oral dose of 750 mg ciprofloxacin and found that this was not followed by any significant changes in the counts of anaerobes or streptococci, but that there was a mean decrease of 2.5 log10 cfu/ml in the counts of faecal enterobacteriaceae, which lasted for a full week. we attributed this to the persistence of high faecal ciprofloxacin concentrations for several days in all the volunteers. we did not observe any significant increase in the mics of ciprofloxacin for faecal enterobacteriaceae, or any faecal overgrowth of staphylococci, fungi, pseudomonas aeruginosa or clostridium difficile.

TI  == [in vitro activity of imipenem against hospital bacteria].
AB  == imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae: the different bacterial groups exhibited similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25 micrograms/ml), except for serratia (0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml), proteus mirabilis (0.5 micrograms/ml), indole-positive proteus (2 micrograms/ml) and providencia (1 mu/ml). the mics of  cefotaxime-resistant strains (cephalosporinase hyperproducing or very broad spectrum betalactamase producing) were within the susceptibility range. imipenem  also exhibited satisfactory activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2 micrograms/ml), although resistant strains by decrease of permeability were observed, and against acinetobacter (mode mic 0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml). the mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 micrograms/ml (mode mic 0.5) for haemophilus and from 0.25  to 1 micrograms/ml for neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of the betalactamase producing status. the mics for n. meningitidis were less than 0.06 micrograms/ml. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 micrograms/ml (mode mic 0.016). the mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely from 0.016 to 64 micrograms/ml and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008 to 0.03 micrograms/ml). the mics for enterococci varied from 0.12 to 32 micrograms/ml (mode mic 1-2). with the exception of clostridium difficile, anaerobic bacteria were inhibited by concentrations lower than 1 (mode mic 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for bacteroides fragilis).

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity and susceptibility testing of ofloxacin. current  status.
AB  == the fluoroquinolone, ofloxacin, exhibits a broad antibacterial spectrum. based on our data and a review of the literature, ofloxacin inhibited essentially 100 percent of staphylococci, including oxacillin-resistant strains, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria spp. and branhamella catarrhalis. ninety-five percent of enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to ofloxacin. pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococci were less susceptible: 79 and 63 percent, respectively, were susceptible (minimal inhibitory concentration [mic], less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml); 15 and 25 percent, respectively, were intermediate (mic, 4 micrograms/ml); 3 and 6 percent, respectively, were resistant (mic, more than or  equal to 4 micrograms/ml). clostridium spp., including clostridium difficile, were resistant to ofloxacin, but other anaerobic species, including the bacteroides fragilis group (over 90 percent) were either susceptible or intermediate to ofloxacin. ofloxacin is bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations of ofloxacin rarely exceed the mics by one doubling concentration. a modest inoculum effect has been observed with ofloxacin: mics with inocula of 10(7) colony-forming units/ml are often two- to fourfold higher than those with inocula of 5 x 10(5) colony-forming units/ml. susceptible organisms exposed serially to increasing concentrations of nalidixic acid developed increasing resistance to not only nalidixic acid, but also to all other quinolones, including ofloxacin. correlations of disk diffusion inhibitory zone diameters using the 5-micrograms ofloxacin disk with ofloxacin mics have been performed, and the disk diffusion zone diameter breakpoints recommended are: susceptible, greater than or equal to 16 mm; intermediate, 13 to 15 mm; resistant, less than or equal to 12 mm. quality control parameters also are summarized.

TI  == intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime in the treatment of serious infections.
AB  == seventy-one adult patients with 72 infections were treated, by random selection,  with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin or intravenously administered ceftazidime. twenty-seven additional patients with 29 infections who were not appropriate for  random assignment were treated in an open study with intravenously administered ciprofloxacin only; the latter infections were generally more serious or were caused by ceftazidime-resistant organisms. the most common doses were ciprofloxacin, 200 mg intravenously and 500 mg orally every 12 hours and ceftazidime, 1 to 2 g intravenously every eight to 12 hours. forty-seven ciprofloxacin-treated infections and 31 ceftazidime-treated infections were evaluable for determination of efficacy. infections included lower respiratory tract (21 infections), urinary (37 infections), skin/soft tissue (14 infections), bacteremia/endocarditis (four infections), colitis (one infection), and mastoiditis (one infection). median minimal inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were, respectively: for enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, and branhamella catarrhalis, no more than 0.06 and no more than 0.25 micrograms/ml; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml; for enterococcus faecalis, 1 and more than 32 micrograms/ml; and for staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 and 8 micrograms/ml. ciprofloxacin, 200 mg intravenously, yielded mean serum concentrations 0.5 and eight hours post-intravenous infusion of 2.3 and 0.7 micrograms/ml, respectively. satisfactory clinical responses were achieved in 17 (81 percent) of 21 patients with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin, 22 (71 percent) of 31 patients with ceftazidime, and 20 (77 percent) of 26 patients with intravenous ciprofloxacin. the most common treatment failures occurred in complicated skin/soft-tissue infections treated with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin, complicated urinary tract infections treated with ceftazidime, and necrotizing p. aeruginosa pneumonia treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin; the pneumonia patients all had respiratory failure and had been previously unresponsive to treatment with other  appropriate drugs. serious adverse reactions were observed in three patients, seizures with intravenous ciprofloxacin in two patients, and clostridium difficile diarrhea with ceftazidime in one patient. we conclude that sequential intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were comparable in efficacy and safety; the ability to change from intravenous to oral therapy is a major convenience. intravenous ciprofloxacin was useful for more serious infections, often caused by ceftazidime-resistant organisms.

AB  == lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. in this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated  antimicrobials. lomefloxacin was very active against enterobacteriaceae (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). in common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of neisseria spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), haemophilus spp. (mic90, less  than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), legionella spp. (mic90, less than or equal  to 0.06 micrograms/ml), vibrio spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of bacteroides spp. (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) or clostridium difficile mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of clostridium perfringens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), chlamydia trachomatis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), mycoplasma hominis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), and urea-plasma urealyticum (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the mic with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the mic. these results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections  caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by s. aureus.

AB  == mics of pd127,391 a new 4-quinolone, and of ci934 and ciprofloxacin, two previously reported 4-quinolones, were determined for common clinical bacterial isolates by an agar-dilution method. pd127,391 was the most active drug against enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter spp (mics less than 0.12 mg/l) and as active as ciprofloxacin against aeromonas spp. (mics less than 0.008 mg/l) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mics less than 1 mg/l). it was more active than ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas spp. including ps. maltophilia (mics less than  0.25 mg/l). all three drugs had high activity, with pd129,391 again the best, against haemophilus influenzae brahmamella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. pd127,391 was much more active than the other drugs against campylobacter coli/jejuni (pd127,391 mics less than 0.03 mg/l) and gardnerella vaginalis (pd127,391 mics less than 0.25 mg/l). pd127,391 inhibited all staphylococci at less than 0.06 mg/l and streptococci at less than 0.5 mg/l, thus being more active than ci934 or ciprofloxacin. pd127,391 was much more active against anaerobic cocci, bacteroides spp. and clostridia (including clostridium difficile) (mics less than 1 mg/l) than was ci934 (mics less than 16 mg/l) or ciprofloxacin (mics less than 64 mg/l). no bacterium that we examined required more than 1 mg/l of pd127,391 for inhibition, and there was no cross resistance with unrelated antibiotics.

TI  == ciprofloxacin in combination with metronidazole.
AB  == ciprofloxacin has a reduced activity against anaerobic pathogens. therefore, a combination of ciprofloxacin with an antimicrobial agent active against anaerobes, such as metronidazole, seems to be interesting for the treatment of mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections. high metronidazole concentrations (10 mg/l or 40 mg/l) neither affected the bactericidal efficacy of ciprofloxacin on aerobic pathogens, such as escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, nor on the anaerobic pathogens clostridium  perfringens and clostridium difficile, as demonstrated by kill-kinetic curves. the same high concentrations, as well as lower therapeutically achievable concentration (2 mg/l or 5 mg/l) of metronidazole in combination with ciprofloxacin were slightly more potent for the tested clostridia than ciprofloxacin or metronidazole alone.

TI  == in vitro activities of two oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, dup 721 and dup 105.
AB  == the antibacterial activities of dup 105 and dup 721, new oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, were compared with those of beta-lactams and glycopeptides. ninety percent of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis isolates,  including methicillin-resistant isolates, were inhibited by 4 micrograms of dup 105 and 1 microgram of dup 721 per ml. dup 721 inhibited hemolytic streptococcus  groups a, b, c, f, and g at a concentration of less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, and it inhibited viridans group streptococci at a concentration of  2 micrograms/ml. both agents inhibited listeria monocytogenes, corynebacterium group jk species, anaerobic cocci, and clostridium spp. including clostridium difficile. they did not inhibit members of the family enterobacteriaceae or pseudomonas aeruginosa, but the mic for 90% of bacteroides fragilis isolates was  8 micrograms of dup 721 per ml.

TI  == infectious complications in four long-term recipients of the jarvik-7 artificial  heart.
AB  == this article describes the infectious complications that occurred among four of the longest-term recipients of the jarvik-7 artificial heart. infection arising from the drive lines, with spread to the mediastinal periprosthetic space, was the major limiting factor in long-term use of the device in these patients. periprosthetic infections were due to coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other pseudomonas species. other infectious complications incurred by some of the patients included pneumonia, empyema, urinary tract infection, and intravascular line sepsis with candida. intensive antimicrobial therapy for prolonged periods seemed to suppress but not to eradicate infection and was accompanied by the appearance of multiresistant bacterial strains. complications of antimicrobial therapy included diarrhea secondary to overgrowth with clostridium difficile in two patients. use  of the current device for more than 30 days should be considered extraordinary and should be reserved for patients for whom no other form of life support is available.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefotaxime against clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == the present in vitro antibacterial activities of cefotaxime and 8 other cephalosporins (cefoperazone, cefmenoxime, cefpiramide, latamoxef, cefamandole, cefmetazole, cefotiam and cephazolin) were evaluated simultaneously in 384 strains of gram-positive cocci, 595 strains of enterobacteriaceae, 240 strains of non-fermenters and 143 strains of anaerobes and miscellaneous organisms. the results were expressed as minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) range, mic50 and mic90. of the beta-lactams, cefotaxime and latamoxef exhibited the highest activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. mic90 of cefotaxime, however, for species of pseudomonas aeruginosa, xanthomonas  maltophilia, enterococci, bacteroides sp. and clostridium difficile were more than 100 mg/l. cefpiramide and cefoperazone were generally less active than these 2 agents. all strains were tested for beta-lactamase production by the cefinase disc method and the relationship of susceptibility to beta-lactams was evaluated  in each species. the need was demonstrated for periodic susceptibility testing to be performed to better guide empirical antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == surveillance cultures and benefit of laminar airflow units in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation.
AB  == the effectiveness of gastrointestinal and topical decontamination, as well as isolation in laminar airflow (laf) units were investigated in 20 patients. on a weekly basis, surveillance cultures were taken. environmental controls were taken on the medical ward outside the two laf units and from the laf unit itself when being used by a patient. the use of laf units seems to be of benefit in preventing exogenous infections, but there are two weak points in the isolation techniques: the opening of the tent (with a free entry into the tent itself) and  the water delivery system. by using appropriate decontamination measures, it was  possible to greatly reduce the number of bacteria and species of the normal flora in all regions with the exception of the oropharynx. individual patients with oxacillin resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci and/or candida albicans continued to show the presence of these organisms during this time. the detection of clostridium difficile and/or its toxin b in eight patients at the beginning of the individual observation period was significant. four out of 15 fever episodes  were attributable to endogenous bacterial infections. each of the causative organisms had been previously isolated in the surveillance cultures, thus the clinician was able to initiate a calculated antimicrobial therapy. as evident from the low incidence of infectious complications, gastrointestinal and topical  decontamination of the skin as well as reverse isolation in laf units are efficient protective measures for bone marrow transplant patients.

TI  == pathogenicity of clostridium species with other bacteria in mixed infections.
AB  == the relationship of clostridial isolates with other bacteria in mixed infections  was studied by means of a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. we used 26 isolates of seven clostridial species, two bacteroides spp., eight gram-positive facultative or anaerobic cocci and three enteric gram-negative aerobic rods. abscesses were induced by all seven clostridium perfringens and three c. butyricum isolates and by some of the others. selective antimicrobial therapy experiments showed that enteric gram-negative rods were of equal or greater significance in the formation of abscesses than were clostridial strains in mixed infections. enhancement or suppression of each component of the mixed infection was studied by comparing the number of each bacterium to its number when injected alone. enhancement was observed mainly with c. perfringens in mixed infections. by contrast, other clostridium spp. were less able to induce enhancement. clostridium difficile and c. sporogenes often inhibited other bacterial species.  this study demonstrated the synergistic and antagonistic relationship between clostridial species and other bacteria.

TI  == discovery and development of the monobactams.
AB  == a novel procedure designed to detect naturally occurring beta-lactam-containing molecules led to isolation of the monobactams - structurally unique, bacterially  produced, monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotics. although none of these monobactams  exhibited impressive antimicrobial activity, side-chain variation - as with the penicillins and cephalosporins - resulted in potently active compounds. aztreonam was chosen from hundreds of compounds for extended laboratory studies. in addition to a unique chemical structure, aztreonam has biologic properties that are unique in comparison with those of the classical penicillins and cephalosporins. aztreonam is relatively inactive against gram-positive bacteria and anaerobes but is extremely effective against aerobic gram-negative bacteria,  including pseudomonas aeruginosa. the drug is highly resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis by beta-lactamases, particularly those known to be mediated by r plasmids, and is a poor inducer of chromosomal beta-lactamases. in the majority of drug combinations tested, aztreonam exhibits additive or synergistic activity. in a series of animal-model infections, the drug showed a high degree of efficacy that was consistent with findings in studies in vitro. in a hamster model for clostridium difficile-induced pseudomembranous colitis, aztreonam did not induce  any significant changes.

TI  == review of the in vitro spectrum of activity of imipenem.
AB  == imipenem (n-formimidoyl thienamycin, mk0787), a new carbapenem was found to have  the widest antimicrobial activity of currently available beta-lactam drugs. enterobacteriaceae had minimal inhibitory concentrations of imipenem of 8.0 micrograms/ml or less for 99.8 percent of clinical isolates. only rare strains of enterobacter species and proteus mirabilis have higher imipenem minimal inhibitory concentration results. hemophilus and neisseria species were inhibited, but minimal inhibitory concentrations of imipenem were higher than those reported for third-generation cephalosporins. only pseudomonas maltophilia  and pseudomonas cepacia strains were imipenem resistant (mic50 greater than 32 micrograms/ml) among the commonly isolated non-enteric gram-negative bacilli. all anaerobes were found susceptible to imipenem with the exception of some strains of clostridium difficile. staphylococcus species and non-enterococcal streptococci were very susceptible to imipenem. streptococcus faecalis had higher minimal inhibitory concentrations of imipenem (mic90 3.1 micrograms/ml) and s. faecium strains were frankly resistant. methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates  had a mic90 of 27.2 micrograms imipenem/ml. imipenem was generally bactericidal except for marked minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentration differences with enterococci, listeria, methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and  some p. aeruginosa strains. the minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentrations of imipenem were not significantly influenced by organism inoculum size, probably because of its beta-lactamase stability to nearly all commonly encountered bacterial enzymes. imipenem was found to be an excellent inhibitor of beta-lactamases and a potent enzyme inducer. the induction characteristic seems responsible for the antagonistic interactions of imipenem with some enzyme-labile beta-lactams in combination. imipenem had limited stability in some in vitro susceptibility test systems. the 10 micrograms disk test or dry-form broth micro-dilution systems were preferred, applying the interpretive criteria from the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (m2-a3). imipenem-resistant strains were rarely found in clinical practice and bacteria resistant to newer beta-lactams and aminoglycosides were generally very susceptible to this new carbapenem.

TI  == role for newer beta-lactam antibiotics in treatment of osteomyelitis.
AB  == monotherapy of osteomyelitis with the newer broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics has become attractive because of the efficacy, safety, and cost of these antibiotics when compared with conventional combination therapy. imipenem/cilastatin is a recent and promising addition to this antibiotic family. experience with imipenem/cilastatin and that reported for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftizoxime in the treatment of biopsy-proved osteomyelitis was  compared, using data from published reports from five centers. two hundred forty-three patients were evaluable: 34 were treated with imipenem/cilastatin, 84 with cefotaxime, 122 with ceftazidime, and 33 with ceftizoxime. staphylococcus aureus was isolated by 80 bone cultures and was the most common single species encountered. there were 75 isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 113 mixed enterobacteriaceae species, 115 mixed gram-positive and -negative isolates of miscellaneous species, and 30 anerobic isolates. polymicrobial infection was present in 101 cases (41.6 percent). failure rates were similarly low in all groups (10 to 30 percent). however, resistance developed during therapy in all groups with p. aeruginosa. side effects were predictably few, but reversible neutropenia, pseudomembranous colitis due to clostridium difficile, and nausea required therapy to be discontinued in seven patients. imipenem/cilastatin should prove to be a very effective and relatively safe single agent for treatment of osteomyelitis.

TI  == [multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (n-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae, with an mic less than or equal to 0.25  for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. the different groups of enterobacteriaceae exhibited  similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of serratia (0.25-0.5), p. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive proteus (2), and providencia (1). mics of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. imipenem also  exhibited satisfactory activity against p. aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2) and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

TI  == safety and efficacy of high-dose treatment with imipenem-cilastatin in seriously  ill patients.
AB  == imipenem-cilastatin was given in doses of 1 g intravenously every 6 h to 31 patients. twenty-five patients, with 27 infections, were clinically evaluable and received 20 to 210 g of imipenem for a duration of 5 to 56 days (average 16.3 days). infections included seven cases of osteomyelitis, seven of bacteremia, five of cellulitis, two of pneumonia, three of pelvic cellulitis, two of intraabdominal abscess, and one each of empyema, mediastinitis, and endometritis. fifty-five percent of the infections were caused by gram-negative bacilli, 33% were due to gram-positive organisms, and 10% were caused by anaerobes. twenty-two patients (81%) were cured, three improved, one relapsed, and one became superinfected with a resistant organism. in 5 of 11 cases with pseudomonas aeruginosa, the imipenem mic for organisms isolated by the end of treatment was higher than it was initially, raising concern that imipenem should not be used alone to treat pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. twenty-one patients had no adverse reaction; of the remaining 10 patients, 4 had nausea, 1 had urticaria, and 6 had mild abnormalities in hepatic function; three episodes of diarrhea included two with clostridium difficile toxin in stool and one with pseudomembranous colitis, as determined by sigmoidoscopy. levels of creatinine, hemoglobin, leukocytes, platelets, prothrombin, and urine components were unchanged. imipenem-cilastatin is a clinically effective antibiotic with freedom  from nephrotoxicity and hematological abnormalities in the large doses used in this study.

TI  == superinfections during antimicrobial treatment with betalactam-aminoglycoside combinations in neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies.
AB  == the frequency, etiology and risk factors of superinfections during and/or within  one week after antibiotic therapy with betalactam-aminoglycoside combinations were evaluated in 631 patients with hematologic malignancies admitted to the institute of hematology of rome from january 1982 to december 1984. 356 patients  (56%) developed 402 episodes of proven or presumed infection. of these patients,  78 developed 102 superinfections. overall, superinfections responded less satisfactorily to antibiotic therapy than the primary febrile episodes (63% vs. 85%). the distribution of etiologic agents of superinfections differed from those responsible for primary infections, since fungi and anaerobes (especially clostridium difficile) were mostly isolated after antibiotic therapy had begun. moreover, among aerobic bacteria, frequently antibiotic-resistant species, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis  were the leading etiologic agents of superinfection. the risk of superinfection appeared to increase with the depth and persistence of granulocytopenia. on the other hand, the length of hospitalization, length of previous antibiotic therapy, previous chemoprophylaxis and presence of indwelling venous catheter did not affect the risk of superinfection.

TI  == [effect of the ingestion of wheat bran on the fecal microbial flora of human donors and of recipient gnotoxenic mice, and on the barrier effects exerted by these flora against various potentially pathogenic microorganisms].
AB  == the effect of bran ingestion on the flora of the human digestive tract was studied using two methods: quantitative enumeration of various microbial populations of the faecal flora, and a demonstration of the antagonistic effect exerted by the faecal flora against various potentially pathogenic bacteria of the environment. since this latter study cannot be effected in human subjects, we used a model constituted by axenic mice inoculated with patients' flora. faecal samples from 3 human donors receiving bran-containing diets were obtained prior to treatment and 30 days thereafter. these faecal samples were inoculated into axenic mice fed a diet with or without bran. the dominant floras of the human donors, before and after bran ingestion, were highly similar. the faecal floras of the gnotoxenic mice resembled those of the donors and no change resulting from the presence of bran in the diet could be observed. the drastic or permissive barrier effects exerted in the gnotoxenic mice by the human donors against clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans and pseudomonas  aeruginosa were not modified by the presence of bran in the diet. the large variability between animals in the barrier effect against clostridium difficile masked any possible role of the bran. study of the transit of bacillus spores in  the digestive tract of various mouse groups showed the existence of differences according to the origin of the inoculated floras, but not according to the presence or absence of bran in the diet.

AB  == a prospective randomized trial has compared a broad spectrum ureidopenicillin with a broad spectrum cephalosporin for prophylaxis against the aerobic organisms encountered during elective colonic surgery. even though only two doses of antibiotics were administered the incidence of severe sepsis was low. severe wound infection occurred in three of the patients receiving mezlocillin and metronidazole (6 per cent) compared with six in the group receiving cefuroxime and metronidazole (13 per cent). minor wound sepsis was recorded in 24 per cent of patients receiving mezlocillin and metronidazole compared with only 11 per cent after cefuroxime and metronidazole. there were two episodes of septicaemia,  one in each group, and three abscesses, all of which occurred in patients receiving metronidazole and mezlocillin. the total number of surgically related infections was, however, significantly less with cefuroxime and metronidazole (n  = 13) compared with mezlocillin and metronidazole (n = 23; p less than 0.03). escherichia coli was the principal organism responsible for surgically-related postoperative sepsis: (22 isolates: 14 mezlocillin and eight cefuroxime) all of which sensitive to the agents used. pseudomonas aeruginosa was recovered from 10  patients (three mezlocillin and seven cefuroxime), all of the isolates were resistant to both antibiotics and were associated with severe morbidity. there were 11 isolates of staphylococcus spp. (nine mezlocillin and two cefuroxime: p less than 0.03). postoperative diarrhoea occurred in six patients, all were in the group receiving cefuroxime and metronidazole.
