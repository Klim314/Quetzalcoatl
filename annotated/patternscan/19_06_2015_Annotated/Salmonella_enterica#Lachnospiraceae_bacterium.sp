TI  == a novel microbial source tracking microarray for pathogen detection and fecal source identification in environmental systems.
AB  == pathogen detection and the identification of fecal contamination sources are challenging in environmental waters. factors including pathogen diversity and ubiquity of fecal indicator bacteria hamper risk assessment and remediation of contamination sources. a custom microarray targeting pathogens (viruses, bacteria, protozoa), microbial source tracking (mst) markers, and antibiotic resistance genes was tested against dna obtained from whole genome amplification  (wga) of rna and dna from sewage and animal (avian, cattle, poultry, and swine) feces. perfect and mismatch probes established the specificity of the microarray  in sewage, and fluorescence decrease of positive probes over a 1:10 dilution series demonstrated semiquantitative measurement. pathogens, including norovirus, campylobacter fetus, helicobacter pylori, salmonella enterica, and giardia lamblia were detected in sewage, as well as mst markers and resistance genes to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, and tetracycline. sensitivity (percentage true positives) of mst results in sewage and animal waste samples (21-33%) was lower than specificity (83-90%, percentage of true negatives). next generation dna sequencing revealed two dominant bacterial families that were common to all sample types: ruminococcaceae and lachnospiraceae. five dominant phyla and 15 dominant families comprised 97% and 74%, respectively, of sequences from all fecal sources. phyla and families not represented on the microarray are possible  candidates for inclusion in subsequent array designs.

TI  == influence of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis infection on the composition of chicken cecal microbiota.
AB  == background: infection of newly hatched chicks with salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis (s. enteritidis) results in an inflammatory response in the intestinal tract which may influence the composition of gut microbiota. in this study we were therefore interested whether s. enteritidis induced inflammation results in changes in the cecal microbiota. to reach this aim, we compared the cecal microbiota of non-infected chickens and those infected by s. enteritidis by pyrosequencing the v3/v4 variable regions of genes coding for 16s rrna. results:  cecal microbiota of chickens up to 19 days of life was dominated by representatives of enterobacteriaceae, lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae, followed by lactobacillaceae. the presence of lachnospiraceae did not change after s. enteritidis infection. enterobacteriaceae increased and ruminococcaceae  decreased after s. enteritidis infection in two independent experiments although  these results were not significant. a significant increase in both experiments was observed only for the representatives of lactobacillaceae which may correlate with their microaerophilic growth characteristic compared to the obligate anaerobes from the families lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae. conclusions: we  conclude that s. enteritidis infection influences the composition of the cecal microbiota in chickens but these changes are minor in nature and should be understood more as an indirect consequence of infection and inflammation rather than a positively selected evolutionary trait.

TI  == evaluation of the bacterial diversity in the feces of cattle using 16s rdna bacterial tag-encoded flx amplicon pyrosequencing (btefap).
AB  == background: the microbiota of an animal's intestinal tract plays important roles  in the animal's overall health, productivity and well-being. there is still a scarcity of information on the microbial diversity in the gut of livestock species such as cattle. the primary reason for this lack of data relates to the expense of methods needed to generate such data. here we have utilized a bacterial tag-encoded flx 16s rdna amplicon pyrosequencing (btefap) approach that is able to perform diversity analyses of gastrointestinal populations. btefap is  relatively inexpensive in terms of both time and labor due to the implementation  of a novel tag priming method and an efficient bioinformatics pipeline. we have evaluated the microbiome from the feces of 20 commercial, lactating dairy cows. results: ubiquitous bacteria detected from the cattle feces included clostridium, bacteroides, porpyhyromonas, ruminococcus, alistipes, lachnospiraceae, prevotella, lachnospira, enterococcus, oscillospira, cytophage, anaerotruncus, and acidaminococcus spp. foodborne pathogenic bacteria were detected in several of the cattle, a total of 4 cows were found to be positive for salmonella spp (tentative enterica) and 6 cows were positive for campylobacter spp. (tentative lanienae). conclusion: using btefap we have examined the microbiota in the feces  of cattle. as these methods continue to mature we will better understand the ecology of the major populations of bacteria the lower intestinal tract. this in  turn will allow for a better understanding of ways in which the intestinal microbiome contributes to animal health, productivity and wellbeing.
