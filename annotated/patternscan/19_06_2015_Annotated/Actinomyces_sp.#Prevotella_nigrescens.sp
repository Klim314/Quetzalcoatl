TI  == the effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

TI  == the association between detectable plasmatic human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load and different subgingival microorganisms in brazilian adults with hiv: a multilevel analysis.
AB  == background: this study investigates the association between detectable plasmatic  human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load (hvl) and high levels of periodontal- and non-periodontal-related microorganisms in the subgingival microbiota of individuals with hiv. methods: thirty-seven individuals with hiv were divided into two groups: 1) detectable hvl (n = 15); and 2) undetectable hvl (n = 22). subgingival biofilm samples were obtained, and the levels of 35 microbial species were determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. periodontal clinical measures and laboratory and sociodemographic data were also registered. chi(2) test, fisher exact test, and mann-whitney u test were used to compare groups. multilevel ordinal regression models were used to test the association between hvl and the levels of 35 microbial species in subgingival biofilm, adjusted for confounders. results: of the 35 species studied, 11 (31.4%) showed higher mean levels in the detectable hvl group than undetectable hvl group (p <0.001). these species included actinomyces naeslundii  ii, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, veillonella parvula, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter concisus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and candida  albicans. significant associations between detectable hvl and high levels of microorganisms, adjusted for confounders, were observed for a. naeslundii i, actinomyces gerencseriae, c. gingivalis, e. corrodens, c. concisus, prevotella nigrescens, t. forsythia, and dialister pneumosintes. conclusion: detectable plasmatic hvl in individuals with hiv was associated with elevated levels of known periodontal pathogens, such as p. nigrescens, t. forsythia, and e. corrodens, as well as c. concisus, c. gingivalis, and d. pneumosintes in the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: suppuration (sup) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. the aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with sup in patients with chronic (cp) and aggressive (agp) periodontitis. methods: a total of 156 patients with cp and 66 with agp were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). the counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the mann-whitney and wilcoxon tests, respectively. associations between frequency of sup and bacterial species were analyzed by the spearman correlation coefficient. results: the prevalence of sup in patients with cp was 24.4%, and in patients with agp it was 30.3%, and the percentage of sup sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (p >0.05). sup sites from patients with cp had significantly higher counts of veillonella parvula, dialister pneumosintes, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella nigrescens than sup  sites from patients with agp (p <0.005). significant positive correlations between high frequency of sup and high levels of actinomyces spp, streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with cp (p <0.05). in patients with agp, actinomyces oris, propionibacterium acnes, p. aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with sup, whereas prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with sup (p <0.05). conclusions: sup sites from patients with cp harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than sup sites from patients with agp. actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, t. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with sup.

TI  == biofilms of black tooth stains: pcr analysis reveals presence of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == this study investigated the presence of the black-pigmented bacteria prevotella nigrescens and prevotella intermedia, the non-black-pigmented bacteria actinomyces spp and particularly the cariogenic pathogen streptococcus mutans in  the dental biofilms of patients with or without black extrinsic tooth stains, using the multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique. analysis of the dental biofilms of patients with (n=26) or without (n=26) black tooth stains was  performed using duplex pcr for the 16s ribosomal rna gene (p. nigrescens, p. intermedia, actinomyces spp) and glucosyltransferase-i gene for s. mutans. p. nigrescens and s. mutans were the most frequent bacteria detected in both groups. the least frequently detected were p. intermedia and actinomyces spp. the similar bacterial composition of dental biofilms of black tooth stains and healthy tooth  surfaces indicates that black tooth stains are not free of cariogenic bacteria.

TI  == microbiologic profile of endodontic infections from hiv- and hiv+ patients using  multiple-displacement amplification and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == objective: to compare the microbiota of endodontic infections in necrotic pulp from hiv-negative and hiv-positive subjects. materials and methods: root canal samples from necrotic pulp were collected from 40 hiv- and 20 hiv+ subjects. pulps were amplified using multiple displacement amplification (mda). then, checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was employed to assess the levels of 107 microbial taxa. the percentage of dna probe count and the percentage of teeth colonized by each test species were investigated. significant differences between groups regarding proportions of taxa and prevalence of the test species were sought using the mann-whitney test and the chi-square analysis, respectively. results: the most prevalent taxa detected were dialister pneumosintes, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sobrinus, corynebacterium diphteriae, and helicobacter pylori among hiv- subjects and d. pneumosintes, prevotella tannerae, porphyromonas gingivalis, parvimonas micra, prevotella nigrescens, and  corynebacterium diphtheriae among hiv+ individuals. d. pneumosintes, c. diphtheria, and c. albicans were the most abundant species in the hiv- group, whereas the predominant taxa in hiv+ samples were p. tannerae, d. pneumosintes and olsenella uli. p. tannerae, o. uli, veilonella dispar, bacteroides fragilis,  and actinomyces meyeri were significantly more abundant in hiv+ samples. conclusions: there were significant differences in the prevalence and proportions of specific microbial taxa between hiv- and hiv+ individuals. the root canal microbiota may represent a reservoir of important oral and medical pathogens, mainly in hiv+ individuals.

TI  == subgingival microbiota in adult down syndrome periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: the subgingival microbiota in down syndrome and non-down syndrome adults receiving periodic dental care was examined for 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization and the results were related to clinical periodontal attachment loss. material and methods: a total of 44 down syndrome, 66 non-down syndrome mentally retarded and 83 mentally normal adults were clinically evaluated. this involved, for each subject, the removal of subgingival specimens from three interproximal sites on different teeth; all subgingival samples per subject were then pooled and assessed for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial species using species-specific whole-genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significant group differences in species proportions averaged across subjects were evaluated using the kruskal-wallis test, and associations between subgingival species and mean subject attachment loss within down syndrome and non-down syndrome subject groups were quantified using pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. results: down syndrome subjects exhibited greater attachment loss than  non-down syndrome subjects (p=0.05). most microbial species were present in down  syndrome subjects at levels similar to non-down syndrome subjects, except for higher proportions of selenomonas noxia, propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis in down syndrome subjects  compared with non-down syndrome study subjects, higher proportions of treponema socranskii in down syndrome subjects compared with non-down syndrome mentally retarded subjects, and higher proportions of streptococcus constellatus in down syndrome subjects compared with mentally normal subjects. down syndrome adults classified with periodontitis revealed higher subgingival levels of t. socranskii than down syndrome subjects with no periodontitis (p=0.02). higher subgingival proportions of s. constellatus, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, s. noxia  and prevotella nigrescens showed significant positive correlations (r=0.35-0.42)  and higher proportions of actinomyces naeslundii ii and actinomyces odontolyticus showed negative correlations (r=-0.36 to -0.40), with increasing mean subject attachment loss in down syndrome adults. conclusion: individuals with down syndrome show higher levels of some subgingival bacterial species and specific associations between certain subgingival bacterial species and loss of periodontal attachment. these findings are consistent with the notion that certain subgingival bacteria may contribute to the increased level of periodontal disease seen in down syndrome individuals and raise the question as to the reason for increased colonization in down syndrome.

TI  == gingival tissue transcriptomes in experimental gingivitis.
AB  == aims: we investigated the sequential gene expression in the gingiva during the induction and resolution of experimental gingivitis. material and methods: twenty periodontally and systemically healthy non-smoking volunteers participated in a 3-week experimental gingivitis protocol, followed by debridement and 2-week regular plaque control. we recorded clinical indices and harvested gingival tissue samples from four interproximal palatal sites in half of the participants  at baseline, day 7, day 14 and day 21 (the "induction phase"), and at day 21, day 25, day 30 and day 35 in the other half (the "resolution phase"). rna was extracted, amplified, reversed transcribed, amplified, labelled and hybridized using affymetrix human genome u133plus2.0 microarrays. paired t-tests compared gene expression changes between consecutive time points. gene ontology analyses summarized the expression patterns into biologically relevant categories. results: the median gingival index was 0 at baseline, 2 at day 21 and 1 at day 35. differential gene regulation peaked during the third week of induction and the first 4 days of resolution. leucocyte transmigration, cell adhesion and antigen processing/presentation were the top differentially regulated pathways. conclusions: transcriptomic studies enhance our understanding of the pathobiology of the reversible inflammatory gingival lesion and provide a detailed account of  the dynamic tissue responses during the induction and resolution of experimental  gingivitis.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  == six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying mic values ranging from 1 to 10 mug ml-1. the results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.

TI  == bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide as an endodontic irrigant in a polymicrobial biofilm tooth model system.
AB  == introduction: the purpose of this study was to determine bactericidal efficacy of 0.04% stabilized chlorine dioxide, 3% sodium hypochlorite, 2% chlorhexidine gluconate, and sterile distilled water in a polymicrobial biofilm model. methods: roots of 35 permanent bovine incisors had pulps extirpated, and their apical size and root length were standardized. teeth were coated with mucin, inoculated with  standardized suspensions of streptococcus sanguinis, actinomyces viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and prevotella nigrescens and incubated anaerobically. teeth were randomly divided into four groups and rinsed  for 3 minutes with 15 ml of irrigant. biofilms were harvested and spiral-plated on selective media. numbers of bacteria in the harvested biofilms was determined  via the standard spiral-plating methodology. treatment groups were evaluated using the nonparametric kruskal-wallis procedure. pair-wise comparisons among the four groups and five organisms were made using the wilcoxon-mann-whitney procedure. adjustments for multiple comparisons were made using the holm method with p < 0.05. results: results provide strong evidence of a significant difference in levels of bactericidal activity associated with the type of irrigant for all five bacterial species tested. levels of bactericidal activity were significantly higher for the naocl group than for the stabilized chlorine dioxide (clo(2)) group for s. sanguinis, a. viscosus, and p. nigrescens. results  for f. nucleatum and p. micros were not significant after the adjustment for multiple comparisons. conclusions: the triple-inoculation bovine tooth model system is a robust, consistent, and reproducible model system to study polymicrobial biofilms. it should be used with the knowledge expansion of biofilm structure and function as well as the development of antimicrobial protocols.

TI  == microbial profile of ligature-induced periodontitis in rats.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the biofilm accumulated around ligatures in rats by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization using  probes made from human oral bacterial species. methods: 12 wistar rats were selected for this study. one of the mandibular first molars of each animal received a ligature, while the contralateral tooth was left unligated to be used  as a control. forty-two days later, the ligatures and one sample of biofilm from  each unligated teeth were analyzed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization for 40 human periodontal species. the area of bone loss in the furcation area was determined histometrically. results: the unligated teeth did not present any of the bacterial species tested. twenty five species were detected in the ligatures. streptococcus- and actinomyces-like species were found in high mean counts, followed by fusobacterium-, prevotella nigrescens- and parvimonas micra-like species and porphyromonas gingivalis- and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-like species. greater bone loss was observed in the furcation area of the ligated than of the unligated group (p<0.0001). conclusion: at 42 days, the ligature biofilm in rats presents various bacterial species that  hybridize to probes of periodontal bacterial species commonly observed in human.

TI  == similarities in the subgingival microbiota assessed by a curet sampling method at sites with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: the goal of this study was to determine whether site-specific differences in the subgingival microbiota could be detected by the checkerboard method in subjects with periodontitis. methods: subjects with at least six periodontal pockets with a probing depth (pd) between 5 and 7 mm were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque samples were collected with sterile curets by a single-stroke procedure at six selected periodontal sites from 161 subjects (966  subgingival sites). subgingival bacterial samples were assayed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method identifying 37 species. results: probing depths of 5, 6, and 7 mm were found at 50% (n = 483), 34% (n = 328), and  16% (n = 155) of sites, respectively. statistical analysis failed to demonstrate  differences in the sum of bacterial counts by tooth type (p = 0.18) or specific location of the sample (p = 0.78). with the exceptions of campylobacter gracilis  (p <0.001) and actinomyces naeslundii (p <0.001), analysis by general linear model multivariate regression failed to identify subject or sample location factors as explanatory to microbiologic results. a trend of difference in bacterial load by tooth type was found for prevotella nigrescens (p <0.01). at a  cutoff level of > or = 1.0 x 10(5), porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) were present at 48.0% to 56.3% and 46.0% to 51.2% of sampled sites, respectively. conclusions: given the similarities in the clinical evidence of periodontitis, the presence and levels of 37 species commonly studied in periodontitis are similar, with no differences between molar, premolar, and incisor/cuspid subgingival sites. this may facilitate microbiologic sampling strategies in subjects during periodontal therapy.

TI  == rapid identification of oral anaerobic bacteria cultivated from subgingival biofilm by maldi-tof-ms.
AB  == introduction: to facilitate the identification of anaerobes cultivated from periodontal disease, whole cell bacterial identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) was evaluated. methods: a total of 84 strains (nine reference strains and 75 recent clinical isolates from 33 patients with aggressive periodontitis) previously identified with phenotypic methods were used. all the references and 10 clinical  isolates belonging to the same species as the reference strains were genotypically identified by sequence analysis of the 16s ribosomal rna gene. all  the strains were then analyzed using maldi-tof-ms. results: the reference strains of anaerobic bacteria used showed characteristic maldi-tof-ms spectra with peaks  between m/z 2000 and up to about m/z 13,000. on visual inspection, the similarity of spectra produced by strains of a single genus could be recognized. obvious differences between spectra produced by strains of different species were also easily noticed. the reproducibility of the method was proved by the similarity of spectra belonging to the same species. the spectra of the prevotella intermedia strains identified with maldi clustered together and clustered separately from the spectra of prevotella nigrescens, proving that maldi-tof-ms is an accurate method that is capable of separating these two species. the quality of clustering was characterized by calculating an inconsistency coefficient (mathworks:/matlab  reference manual v2007a/, statistical toolbox). conclusion: our results suggest that maldi-tof-ms might become a useful method for the identification of anaerobic bacteria, especially for those that cannot be readily identified by biochemical analysis. it may become an attractive system even for the routine identification of clinical isolates.

TI  == effects of er:yag laser irradiation on biofilm-forming bacteria associated with endodontic pathogens in vitro.
AB  == with the development of dental laser delivery systems that can enter into the root canals, it is possible to use er:yag lasers to remove the residual biofilm associated with infected root canals. we examined their effects against biofilms  made of actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, propionibacterium acnes, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, or prevotella nigrescens in vitro. after er:yag laser irradiation with energy densities ranging between 0.38-0.98 j/cm(2), the biofilm samples on hydroxyapatite disks were quantitatively and morphologically evaluated. the er:yag laser was effective against biofilms of 6 of the bacterial species examined, with the exception of those formed by l. casei. after irradiation, the  numbers of viable cells in the biofilms were significantly decreased, whereas atrophic changes in bacterial cells and reductions in biofilm cell density were seen morphologically. er: yag lasers might be suitable for clinical application as a suppressive and removal device of biofilms in endodontic treatments.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of eight aerobic and anaerobic oral commensal bacterial species on in vitro candida albicans biofilm development. a single isolate of c. albicans 2560 g, and eight different species  of oral bacteria comprising, actinomyces israelii, lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus intermedius were studied using an in vitro biofilm assay. biofilm formation was quantified in terms of the ability of candida to grow on polystyrene plastic surfaces co-cultured with the foregoing bacteria. a viable cell count was used to quantify the sessile yeast growth and scanning electron microscopy was employed to confirm and visualize biofilm formation. co-culture with differing concentrations of bacteria had variable effects on candida biofilm formation. co-culture with the highest concentrations of each of the foregoing bacteria resulted in a consistent reduction in the yeast counts in the candidal biofilm (p<0.05), except for l. acidophilus, s. mutans, and, s. intermedius co-cultures. further, on regression analysis a significant negative correlation between the co-culture concentration  of either p. gingivalis or e. coli and viable yeast counts in the biofilm was noted (p<0.05) although this was not evident for the other bacterial species. taken together, our data indicate that, quantitative and qualitative nature of the bacteria modulate c. albicans biofilm formation in mixed species environments such as the oral cavity.

TI  == effect of calcium glycerophosphate on demineralization in an in vitro biofilm model.
AB  == the aim was to investigate the anti-caries properties of calcium glycerophosphate (cagp) using an in vitro bacterial flow cell model. four flow cells, inoculated from a chemostat containing a seven-organism bacterial consortium, were pulsed with sucrose twice daily, to provide an acidic challenge and ph-cycling conditions. blocks of enamel and dentine were mounted in each flow cell. in a study on the effect of cagp concentration, cagp was pulsed into three of the flow cells, at the same time as the sucrose, to give concentrations of 0.10, 0.25 and  0.50%. water was pulsed into the fourth flow cell with the sucrose. microradiography revealed a significant dose response of decreasing demineralization as cagp concentration increased. reductions at 0.25 and 0.5% were significant when compared to the control. a second study investigated the effect of timing of cagp pulsing, relative to sucrose, on enamel and dentine demineralization. cagp (flow cell concentration 0.2%), was pulsed 1 h before, during or 1 h after the sucrose pulse; a water control was employed. in enamel, pulsing cagp before the sucrose reduced demineralization significantly compared to concurrent pulsing, which in turn gave a significant reduction compared to pulsing after sucrose, which did not reduce demineralization significantly compared to the water control. in dentine, cagp reduced demineralization significantly only when pulsed before the sucrose. the findings suggest that in vivo, the anti-caries potential of cagp may be greater if it is applied before a  cariogenic challenge.

TI  == [bacterial spectra and antibiotics in odontogenic infections. renaissance of the  penicillins?].
AB  == background: the role played by odontogenic infection in dental, oral, and maxillofacial surgery is not to be underestimated even at the present time. an extensive, standardized, prospective study was performed with the intention of verifying the bacterial spectrum of odontogenic infections to evaluate antibiotic sensitivity. material and methods: bacterial spectra and resistograms of 65 patients with an odontogenic infection were analyzed in a prospective study under standardized conditions for specimen collection and transport. results: a total of 226 bacterial strains were analyzed. the ratio between anaerobes and aerobes was approximately 2:1. the most frequent aerobes were members of the genera streptococcus (46 isolates), staphylococcus (10 isolates), and neisseria (9 isolates), respectively. the anaerobic gram-positive spectrum was dominated by members of the genera eubacterium (19 isolates), peptostreptococcus (16 isolates), and actinomyces (12 isolates). the most frequently isolated gram-negative anaerobes were prevotella (46 isolates), and fusobacterium (21 isolates). the overall resistance to antibiotics was very low: only 7.3% of all bacteria were resistant to penicillin g/v, and 8.8% showed resistance to ampicillin. the resistance rates to other beta-lactam antibiotics were 4.4% to piperacillin and 0.6% to imipenem, respectively. penicillin g presented the highest antimicrobial activity among aerobes: only 4.5% of anaerobic strains were resistant of penicillin g. the other resistance rates of anaerobic bacteria to antibiotics were as follows: ampicillin 24%, doxycycline 34%, erythromycin 18%, and clindamycin 9.3%. penicillin g was also highly antimicrobially active to anaerobes. the resistance rates were: penicillin g 8.1%, ampicillin 2.6%, doxycycline 9.2%, erythromycin 10.2%, and clindamycin 1.4%, respectively.

TI  == microflora in oral ecosystems in subjects with hyposalivation due to medicines or of unknown origin.
AB  == purpose: to analyse the microbial flora in specific sites in 20 dentate (> or = 16 teeth) subjects with hyposalivation due to medicines or of unknown origin and  in 20 controls matched according to age, sex and number of teeth. materials and methods: the microbial samples were analysed for the following micro-organisms: mutans streptococci, lactobacillus spp. and actinomyces spp., associated with the development of caries, fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, associated with plaque accumulation and gingivitis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis, frequently found in elevated numbers in periodontitis sites and candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, enterics and enterococci, associated with mucosal infections. the total microbial count was also registered, together with the total number of streptococci, associated with good oral health. results: in the hyposalivation group, the mean age was 54 +/- 8 years and the mean number of teeth 25 +/- 3. the unstimulated secretion rate was 0.04 +/- 0.04 ml/min and the  stimulated secretion rate 0.98 +/- 0.51 ml/min. compared with the controls, the hyposalivation group tended to harbour a lower number and proportion of f. nucleatum on the tongue, and an increased number of enterococci in the vestibular region. in the supragingival plaque, the numbers of strepococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. were significantly increased and the number of c. albicans tended to be increased. conclusion: the results indicate that subjects with hyposalivation due to medicines or of unknown origin have a supragingival plaque  associated with the development of caries.

TI  == differences in the subgingival microbiota of swedish and usa subjects who were periodontally healthy or exhibited minimal periodontal disease.
AB  == background: previous studies have shown differences in the mean proportions of subgingival species in samples from periodontitis subjects in different countries, which may relate to differences in diet, genetics, disease susceptibility and manifestation. the purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether there were differences in the subgingival microbiotas of swedish and american subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal periodontal disease. method: one hundred and fifty eight periodontally healthy or minimally diseased subjects (n sweden=79; usa=79) were recruited. subjects were measured at baseline for plaque, gingivitis, bop, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth. subgingival plaque samples taken from the  mesial aspect of each tooth at baseline were individually analyzed, in one laboratory, for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna  hybridization (total samples=4345). % dna probe counts comprised by each species  was determined for each site and averaged across sites in each subject. significance of differences in proportions of each species between countries was  determined using ancova adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking  status. p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed to group subjects based on their subgingival microbial profiles using a chord coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. results: on average, all species were detected in samples from subjects in both countries. after adjusting for multiple comparisons, 5 species were in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in swedish than american subjects: actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 (9.7, 3.3); streptococcus sanguis (2.5, 1.2); eikenella  corrodens (1.7, 1.0); tannerella forsythensis (3.5, 2.3) and prevotella melaninogenica (6.3, 1.8). leptotrichia buccalis was in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in american (5.5) than swedish subjects (3.0). cluster  analysis grouped 121 subjects into 8 microbial profiles. twenty four of the 40 test species examined differed significantly among cluster groups. five clusters  were dominated by american subjects and 2 clusters by swedish subjects. fifty eight of 79 (73%) of the swedish subjects fell into 1 cluster group dominated by  high proportions of a. naeslundii genospecies 1, prevotella nigrescens, t. forsythensis and p. melaninogenica. other clusters were characterized by high proportions of actinomyces gerencseriae, veillonella parvula, capnocytophaga gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eubacterium saburreum, l. buccalis and neisseria mucosa. conclusions: the microbial profiles of subgingival plaque samples from swedish and american subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal disease differed. the heterogeneity in subgingival microbial profiles was more pronounced in the american subjects, possibly because of greater genetic and microbiologic diversity in the american subjects sampled.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin produced by prevotella nigrescens atcc 25261.
AB  == aims: to characterize the antimicrobial activity produced by prevotella nigrescens atcc 25261, and to evaluate its safety on cultured gingival fibroblasts. methods and results: an antimicrobial activity was obtained from purifying the culture supernatant of pr. nigrescens atcc 25261. purification of the active compound was achieved with ammonium sulphate precipitation followed by anion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. as revealed by sds-page, the active fraction was relatively homogeneous, showing a protein with an approximate molecular weight of 41 kda. the antimicrobial compound, named nigrescin, exhibited a bactericidal mode of action against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and actinomyces spp. nigrescin was stable in a ph range between 6.5 and 9.5, at 100 degrees c for 10 min, and resistant to lyophilization. but its activity was lost after proteinase k treatment. despite at very high concentrations beyond the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), nigrescin was not toxic to the gingival fibroblasts. conclusion: nigrescin is a novel bacteriocin produced by pr. nigrescens atcc 25261. it exhibits antimicrobial activity against species that are implicated in  periodontal diseases. the absence of toxicity on the gingival fibroblasts suggests the possibility in using of nigrescin for an application in periodontal  treatment. significance and impact of the study: novel evidence on nigrescin would make pr. nigrescens atcc 25261 attractive in biotechnological applications  as an antimicrobial agent in clinical dentistry.

TI  == microbiological profile of early onset/aggressive periodontitis patients.
AB  == objectives: the objectives of this study were to characterize the bacterial profile and to seek possible bacterial associations in the subgingival microbiota of early onset periodontitis/aggressive periodontitis patients by using two different techniques, culture and immunofluorescence. material and methods: the study group consisted of 66 systemically healthy individuals with evidence of early onset periodontitis - 41 females and 25 males aged 23-35 years (mean 31.1 +/- 3.1 years). bacterial samples were collected from the deepest site in each quadrant, resulting in a total of 264 sites with a mean probing pocket depth of 6.6 +/- 1.5 mm. samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% co(2) using selective and nonselective media, and isolates were characterized to species level. indirect immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies was applied to detect actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (bacteroides forsythus, tannerella forsythensis), prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, peptostreptococcus micros and actinomyces israelii. results: 93.6% of sampled sites showed bleeding on probing and 23.5% were positive for suppuration. p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p.  gingivalis, and c. rectus were detected in 77.3-85.9% of samples using culture methods and in 85.6-91.3% using immunofluorescence. p. micros and a. actinomycetemcomitans were found, respectively, in 63.3% and 25.0% of all sites using culturing and in 58.7% and 27.7% sites using immunofluorescence. significantly strong positive associations were observed between t. forsythia and c. rectus (odds ratio 109.46), and t. forsythia and p. gingivalis (odd ratio 90.26), whereas a negative association was seen between p. intermedia/p. nigrescens and a. actinomycetemcomitans (odds ratio 0.42). coinfection by p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens and c. rectus was observed  in 62.1% of the test sites, and in 89.4% of the studied subjects. the sensitivity of immunofluorescence for t. forsythia, c. rectus, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens and p. gingivalis was found to be very high (0.99-0.94) using culture as the reference detection method. the agreement between culture and immunofluorescence  in detecting the presence or absence of the investigated species was 85.2-88.1% for p. gingivalis, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, c. rectus, and t. forsythia, 75.9% for a. actinomycetemcomitans and 70.4% for p. micros. conclusions: the microbial profile of the early onset/aggressive periodontitis population was complex. the agreement between the two detection methods was very high.

TI  == selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. methods: a gradient plate technique was used to expose fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, neisseria subflava, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii,  prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations  of triclosan. escherichia coli atcc 8739 was included as an organism showing the  triclosan resistance development trait. mic values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. results: n. subflava, pr. nigrescens po. gingivalis and e. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (mic range 0.1-3.9 mg/l), whereas the lactobacillus and  s. mutans were less susceptible (mic range 15.6-20.8 mg/l). triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (p < 0.01) for the positive control e. coli, although its mics towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (mic) occurred for pr. nigrescens and in s. sanguis and s. oralis (mbc). mean changes in susceptibilities (mic and mbc) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine mbcs for s. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. conclusions: these data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for e. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than fabi that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.

TI  == gingival crevice microbiota from chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing  ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  == the objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the bacterial population structure in plaque from the gingival margin of two groups of 21 chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (nug). subjects were recruited in four dental clinics in eastern china. samples were quantitatively assessed by immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization for taxa known to be associated with periodontal diseases. the analyses showed that the fusiform taxa (fusobacterium nucleatum/fusobacterium periodonticum, leptotrichia buccalis, tannerella forsythensis, and capnocytophaga sp.), campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, selenomonas sputigena, and treponemes were present in both groups with high prevalence. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces gerencseriae were much more  prevalent in the nug group. quantitatively, most taxa, including p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and the treponemes, accounted, on average, for < 3% of the total bacterial cell number. only p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p. gingivalis, s. sputigena, a. gerencseriae, and the sum of all monitored suspected periodontal pathogens were significantly increased in the nug group. the present study demonstrates for both groups a highly diverse plaque composition and suggests that, etiologically, the overall concentration and the concerted effects of the entire group of opportunistic pathogens thriving in nug-associated plaque are of  prime importance.

AB  == objectives: microbial flora and gingival conditions were compared between a group of patients with phenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia as a test group, a control group of patients who were administered phenytoin without gingival hyperplasia and a blank group who took no phenytoin and no gingival hyperplasia in mentally retarded patients. materials and methods: subgingival plaque samples  were collected from a pht-induced overgrown gingival pocket and microbiological experiments were performed by culture and pcr methods. results: the predominant genera in total cultivable bacteria from subgingival plaque samples were streptococcus and actinomyces with recovery ranges of 37.6-42.1% and 23.4-25.5% of total bacteria, respectively, in all groups. the test group showed a significantly higher level of obligate gram-negative rods than the control and blank groups. black-pigmented obligate anaerobic gram-negative rods were detected in 10.3% of total cultivable bacteria in the test group. the black-pigmented rods were predominantly prevotella intermedia in the test group and prevotella nigrescens in the control and blank groups. porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas endodontalis were also detected in the test group with small values. conclusions: these results suggested that black-pigmented rods, particularly p. intermedia, could be habitable in the environment of gingival hyperplasia.

TI  == effects of a chlorhexidine gluconate-containing mouthwash on the vitality and antimicrobial susceptibility of in vitro oral bacterial ecosystems.
AB  == oral bacterial microcosms, established using saliva inocula from three individuals, were maintained under a feast-famine regime within constant-depth film fermenters. steady-state communities were exposed four times daily, postfeeding, to a chlorhexidine (chx) gluconate-containing mouthwash (chxm) diluted to 0.06% (wt/vol) antimicrobial content. the microcosms were characterized by heterotrophic plate counts and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). chxm caused significant decreases in both total anaerobe  and total aerobe/facultative anaerobe counts (p < 0.05), together with lesser decreases in gram-negative anaerobes. the degree of streptococcal and actinomycete inhibition varied considerably among individuals. dgge showed that chxm exposure caused considerable decreases in microbial diversity, including marked reductions in prevotella sp. and selenomonas infelix. pure-culture studies of 10 oral bacteria (eight genera) showed that actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella dispar, prevotella nigrescens, and the streptococci were highly susceptible to chx, while lactobacillus rhamnosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and neisseria subflava were the least susceptible. determination of the mics of triclosan, chx, erythromycin, penicillin v, vancomycin, and metronidazole for microcosm isolates, before and after 5 days of chxm exposure, showed that chxm exposure altered the distribution of isolates toward those that were less susceptible to chx (p < 0.05). changes in susceptibility distributions for the other test agents were not statistically significant. in conclusion, population changes in plaque microcosms following repeated exposure to chxm represented an inhibition of the most susceptible flora with a clonal expansion of less susceptible species.

TI  == the use of tetracycline fibres in the treatment of generalised aggressive periodontitis: clinical and microbiological findings.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of tetracycline fibres (tcf) as an adjunct to scaling in the treatment of generalised aggressive  periodontitis and to compare the effects with mechanical treatment only. ten patients, 24-39 years old referred for treatment to the department of preventive  dentistry, periodontology and implant biology, aristotle university of thessaloniki took part in the study. a split-mouth experimental design was used.  measurements referring to bleeding on probing (bop), pocket depth (pd) and clinical attachment level (cal) were performed at 12 sites randomly selected. clinical recordings were made at baseline, 2 and 6 months, after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken for microbiological analysis using the 'checkerboard' dna-dna hybridisation technique at baseline, immediately after treatment and at 2 and 6 months. full-mouth scaling and root planing were performed, with the exception of 2 pre-selected sites, which served as controls.  tetracycline fibres were applied in 5 pockets located in the same half mouth. analysis of clinical findings showed that mechanical instrumentation in combination with tcf application led to a greater improvement in clinical parameters than scaling and root planing only. microbial analysis showed a statistically significant greater reduction in the percentages of detection for b. forsythus, p. nigrescens and a. naeslundii genospecies ii in pockets where tetracycline fibres were applied. in conclusion, the clinical and microbiological data of the present study suggest that the adjunctive use of tcf improves the clinical response of scaling and root planing in aggressive periodontitis patients.

TI  == microorganisms from canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions.
AB  == aim: the objective of the present study was to identify the microbial flora within root canals of teeth with failed root-canal treatment and to determine the association of the various species with clinical features. methodology: sixty root-filled teeth with persisting periapical lesions were selected for this study. during nonsurgical endodontic re-treatment, the root-filling material was  removed and the canals were sampled. microbial sampling, isolation and species determination were performed using advanced microbiological techniques for anaerobic species. the association of microbiological findings with clinical features was investigated. results: microorganisms were recovered from 51 teeth.  in most cases, one or two strains per canal were found. of the microbial species  isolated, 57.4% were facultative anaerobic species and 83.3% gram-positive microorganisms. enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently recovered bacterial species. obligate anaerobes accounted for 42.6% of the species and the most frequently isolated genera was peptostreptococcus. which was associated with clinical symptoms (p < 0.01). significant associations were also observed between: (a) pain or history of pain and polymicrobial infections or anaerobes (p < 0.05): (b) tenderness to percussion and prevotella intermedia/p. nigrescens (p  < 0.05); (c) sinus and streptococcus spp. (p < 0.001) or actinomyces spp. (p < 0.01); (d) coronally unsealed teeth and streptococcus spp. or candida spp. (both  with p < 0.01). conclusion: the microbial flora in canals after failure of root-canal treatment were limited to a small number of predominantly gram-positive microbial species. facultative anaerobes, especially e. faecalis, were the most commonly isolated microorganisms, however, polymicrobial infections and obligate anaerobes were frequently found in canals of symptomatic root-filled teeth.

TI  == parotid salivary s-iga antibodies during experimental gingivitis in smokers and non-smokers.
AB  == persons who smoke display a less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the  experimental gingivitis model as compared with non-smokers. the aim of the present study was to investigate whether this could partly be explained by differences in levels of parotid total secretory iga (s-iga) or parotid s-iga reactive with selected oral microorganisms. parotid saliva samples were obtained  from 11 smoking and 14 non-smoking volunteers, at baseline, after 5 and 14 days of full mouth experimental gingivitis. output levels of total s-iga and of specific s-iga reactive with cell extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces naeslundii, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans were determined in the samples by means of elisa. smokers and non-smokers were found to have similar output levels (microg/min) of total s-iga, and the values did not significantly change during the experimental gingivitis trial. parotid salivary outputs (units/min) of the bacteria-specific s-iga at baseline and at days 5 and 14, were not different between smokers and non-smokers; no changes were observed during the experimental gingivitis trial. the present observations indicate that total s-iga and bacteria-specific s-iga in saliva are not main factors that can explain the less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the experimental gingivitis model in smokers as compared with non-smokers.

AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == change in subgingival microbial profiles in adult periodontitis subjects receiving either systemically-administered amoxicillin or metronidazole.
AB  == aim: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions of 40  bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples during, immediately after and up  to 1 year after metronidazole or amoxicillin therapy combined with srp. method: after baseline clinical and microbiological monitoring, 17 adult periodontitis subjects received full mouth srp and 14 days systemic administration of either metronidazole (250 mg, tid, n=8) or amoxicillin (500 mg, tid, n=9). clinical measurements including % of sites with plaque, gingival redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration, pocket depth (pd) and attachment level (al) were made at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth in each subject at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days and from 2 randomly selected posterior teeth at 3, 7, and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. counts of 40 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the quade test and between groups using ancova. results: mean pd was reduced from 3.22+/-0.12 at baseline to 2.81+/-0.16 (p<0.01) at 360 days and  from 3.38+/-0.23 mm to 2.80+/-0.14 mm (p<0.01) in the amoxicillin and metronidazole treated subjects respectively. corresponding values for mean al were 3.21+/-0.30 to 2.76+/-0.32 (p<0.05) and 3.23+/-0.28 mm to 2.94+/-0.23 mm (p<0.01). levels and proportions of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were markedly reduced during antibiotic administration and were lower than baseline levels at 360 days. counts (x10(5), +/-sem) of b. forsythus fell from baseline levels of 0.66+/-0.16 to 0.04+/-0.02,  0.13+/-0.04, 0.10+/-0.03 and 0.42+/-0.19 in the amoxicillin group at 14, 90, 180  and 360 days respectively (p<0.001). corresponding values for metronidazole treated subjects were: 1.69+/-0.28 to 0.02+/-0.01, 0.20+/-0.08, 0.22+/-0.06 and 0.22+/-0.08 (p<0.001). counts of campylobacter species, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum and prevotella nigrescens were also detected at lower mean levels during and immediately after therapy, but gradually increased after withdrawal of the antibiotics. members of the genera actinomyces, streptococcus and capnocytophaga were minimally affected by metronidazole. however, amoxicillin decreased the counts and proportions of actinomyces species during and after therapy. conclusions: the data suggest that  metronidazole and amoxicillin are useful in rapidly lowering counts of putative periodontal pathogens, but must be accompanied by other procedures to bring about periodontal stability.

TI  == the formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  == a chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). eleven bacterial species (streptococcus gordonii, strep. mitis i, strep. mutans,  strep. oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, neisseria subflava, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. a flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. the biofilm produced from state-1 showed  a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 pa). the biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while gram-negative species were predominant  in state-2.

TI  == automated immunofluorescence for enumeration of selected taxa in supragingival dental plaque.
AB  == the present study investigated a recently developed automated image analysis technique for its applicability to the enumeration of selected bacteria in supragingival dental plaque. following initial calibration, the system is capable to count fluorescence-labeled target cells in up to 48 samples without user interference. test samples contained a characteristic mixture of planktonic bacteria, small almost planar bacterial aggregates, and large, virtually indisruptable clumps with cells from multiple species. due to their complex composition, these samples provided a challenging validation step for the image analysis system. automated enumeration of target bacteria was compared with visual counting of the fluorescence-labeled bacteria. results are shown for six taxa (actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia/prev. nigrescens, streptococcus gordonii/strep. oralis/strep. sanguis, strep. sobrinus, and veillonella dispar/ v. parvula) with characteristic differences in abundance, cell morphology and aggregation behavior. results revealed good correspondence between the two enumeration techniques (correlation  coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.92) provided that the portion of target bacteria exceeded 0.05% of the total bacterial cell number. this work demonstrates the applicability and usefulness of fully automated immunofluorescence to analyze such complex ecosystems as supragingival dental plaque.

TI  == microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). methods: a total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level,  were made at 6 sites per tooth. the counts (levels), % dna probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. significance of  differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: all 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of  supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 actinomyces species. supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts  of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, neisseria mucosa, streptococcus gordonii, capnocytophaga ochracea  and capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. subgingival plaque samples presented  significantly higher counts of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and porphykromonas gingivalis. subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as actinomyces species. suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival  samples were negative for the same species. conclusions: the data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.

TI  == coptidis rhizoma inhibits growth and proteases of oral bacteria.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effect of coptidis rhizoma (cr), a traditional medicinal plant, on oral bacteria. materials and methods: cr extract was prepared by boiling cr in water for 2 h. alkaloids contained in cr extract were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). antibacterial activity of cr extract was estimated from the lowest concentration that did not permit bacterial growth (minimum inhibitory concentration, mic) and the concentrations that inhibited 50% of bacterial proteolytic activity (ic50). results: cr extract inhibited the growth of actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans at mic of 0.031-0.25 mg ml(-1), whereas it had less inhibitory effect (mic: 0.5-2 mg ml(-1)) on the growth of streptococcus and lactobacillus. the major active component of cr extract was berberine (ber), an alkaloid, and its inhibiting specificity to bacterial growth was similar to that of cr extract. cr extract and ber were bacteriostatic at the mics against most of the bacteria, and bacteriocidal at the concentrations higher than the mics. ber inhibited the activities of collagenase from p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: cr extract and ber had an inhibitory effect on periodontopathogenic bacteria. these results suggest the possibility of their clinical application for the treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == identification of periodontal disease-associated bacteria in the "plaque-free zone".
AB  == background: subgingival plaque bacteria live within a biofilm covered with glycocalyx, and little is known of the bacterial species associated with biofilm  formation at the bottom of human periodontal pockets, the so-called "plaque-free  zone"(pfz). methods: seventy-seven extracted teeth from 56 patients with severe advanced adult periodontitis were examined. porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella nigrescens, and actinomyces viscosus were examined by scanning immunoelectron microscopic techniques, using both secondary and back-scattered imaging, with rabbit antibodies specific for each bacteria. results: secondary electron images showed  that rods, filaments, and spirochete-shaped bacteria formed small aggregates in the pfz. some of the bacteria were covered with an amorphous film-like structure. by back-scattered electron imaging, positive reactions with anti-p. gingivalis were found in 8 of 13 samples examined, and film-like structures coated several cells of 6 positive samples examined. labeled cells with anti-c. rectus, anti-t.  denticola and anti-p. nigrescens were detected in 3 of 11, 5 of 10, and 1 of 8 samples examined. a. viscosus were found in 6 of 11 of the samples. a. viscosus tended to overlay the amorphous capsula and aggregate. f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not detected in any samples examined. conclusions: these findings indicated that p. gingivalis, c. rectus, t. denticola, p. nigrescens, and a. viscosus were present in the pfz, and that some specified bacteria were possibly related to plaque-biofilm formation of subgingival plaque.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == the short-term effect of apically repositioned flap surgery on the composition of the subgingival microbiota.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to examine the short-term effect of apically repositioned flap surgery on clinical and microbiologic parameters in patients with adult periodontitis. a total of 11 patients with moderate to advanced periodontitis received apically repositioned flap surgery. subjects were monitored during a 3-month pretreatment phase, the baseline surgical phase, and for 3 months post-surgery. clinical assessments including plaque accumulation, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth, and attachment  level were made at 6 sites per tooth. subgingival plaque samples were taken from  the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 29 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and percentage of sites colonized by each species  (prevalence) were computed for each subject at each visit. after surgery, there was a significant decrease in mean pocket depth and percentage of sites exhibiting gingival redness. significant decreases were seen in the percentage of sites that had attachment levels < 4 mm, with a significant increase in the percentage of sites with attachment levels of 4 to 6 mm after therapy. the mean total dna probe count for all bacterial species was significantly decreased by both scaling and root planing and surgical therapy. p gingivalis and b forsythus, 2 bacteria previously shown to be susceptible to mechanical therapy, exhibited statistically significant decreases in mean total dna probe count. because surgical therapy decreased levels of the suspected periodontal pathogens c rectus, p nigrescens, and c gracilis, it may be speculated that there was a potential added beneficial effect of surgery on the periodontal microbiota.

TI  == role of fusobacterium nucleatum and coaggregation in anaerobe survival in planktonic and biofilm oral microbial communities during aeration.
AB  == coaggregation is a well-characterized phenomenon by which specific pairs of oral  bacteria interact physically. the aim of this study was to examine the patterns of coaggregation between obligately anaerobic and oxygen-tolerant species that coexist in a model oral microbial community. obligate anaerobes other than fusobacterium nucleatum coaggregated only poorly with oxygen-tolerant species. in contrast, f. nucleatum was able to coaggregate not only with both oxygen-tolerant and other obligately anaerobic species but also with otherwise-noncoaggregating obligate anaerobe-oxygen-tolerant species pairs. the effects of the presence or absence of f. nucleatum on anaerobe survival in both the biofilm and planktonic phases of a complex community of oral bacteria grown in an aerated (gas phase, 200 ml of 5% co2 in air x min-1) chemostat system were then investigated. in the  presence of f. nucleatum, anaerobes persisted in high numbers (>10(7) x ml-1 in the planktonic phase and >10(7) x cm-2 in 4-day biofilms). in an equivalent culture in the absence of f. nucleatum, the numbers of black-pigmented anaerobes  (porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella nigrescens) were significantly reduced (p </= 0.001) in both the planktonic phase and in 4-day biofilms, while the numbers of facultatively anaerobic bacteria increased in these communities. coaggregation-mediated interactions between f. nucleatum and other species facilitated the survival of obligate anaerobes in aerated environments.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == clinical and microbiological features of refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the clinical parameters and the  site prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival species in successfully treated and  refractory periodontitis subjects. 94 subjects received scaling and root planing  and if needed, periodontal surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. 28 refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or > 3 sites showing attachment loss > 2.5 mm within 1 year post-therapy. 66 successfully treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss > 2.5 mm. baseline subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject and differences between groups sought using the mann-whitney test. most of the 40 species tested, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus, were equally or less prevalent in the refractory group. prevotella nigrescens was significantly more prevalent in successfully treated subjects, while refractory subjects harbored a larger proportion of streptococcus species, particularly streptococcus constellatus. the odds of a subject being refractory was 8.6 (p < 0.001) if s. constellatus constituted > or = 3.5% of the  total dna probe count. since few microbiological differences existed between treatment outcome groups using dna probes to known species, the predominant cultivable microbiota of 33 subgingival samples from 14 refractory subjects was examined. 85% of the 1649 isolates were identified using probes to 69 recognized  subgingival species. the remaining unidentified strains were classified by analyzing 16s rrna gene sequences. many sequenced isolates were of taxa not considered a common part of the oral microbiota such as acinetobacter baumanni, gemella haemolysans, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus warneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and novel species in the genera bartonella, ralstonia, neisseria, eubacterium, rothia, gordona, gemella, corynebacterium, leptotrichia, and actinomyces. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their subgingival microbiota. as a group, they did not harbor more of the "classic" periodontopathogens, although elevated proportions of s. constellatus were found.

AB  == this study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16s rrna-based pcr identification methods. streptococcal and actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. in decreasing order of prevalence, fusobacterium, enteric rods, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga, propionibacterium, yeasts, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. the cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. pcr detection showed c. rectus and eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. in decreasing order of prevalence, pcr identified treponema denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia, b. forsythus,  and p. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. it appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.

TI  == recently described clinically important anaerobic bacteria: taxonomic aspects and update.
AB  == a new method of identifying bacteria, phylogenetic 16s rrna sequencing, has led to major reorganizations among most genera of anaerobic bacteria. the pigmented prevotella species now comprise seven species including p. nigrescens and p. tannerae; p. intermedia/p. nigrescens-like organisms await inclusion. the former  mitsuokella dentalis and hallella seregens were transferred to prevotella as one  species, p. dentalis. p. enoeca is a new nonpigmenting prevotella. the genus porphyromonas currently includes 11 pigmented species and one nonpigmented species, p. catoniae; p. levii-like and p. endodontalis-like organisms are candidates for the genus. fusobacterium nucleatum currently has five subspecies,  and f. varium includes the former f. pseudonecrophorum. former wolinella recta and wolinella curva now are campylobacter rectus and campylobacter curvus; campylobacter showae is a new species. isolates included in the bile-sensitive former bacteroides gracilis now are campylobacter gracilis; the bile-resistant b. gracilis isolates were transferred to a new genus, sutterella, as s. wadsworthensis. the new actinomyces species include two subspecies of the a. neuii and the a. radingae-a. turicensis complex. the genus eubacterium sensu stricto is represented by e. limosum, and the former e. alactolyticum was reclassified in a new genus, pseudoramibacter, as p. alactolyticus. recent entries include e. saphenum, e. minutum, e. exiguum, e. infirmum, and e. tardum.  a new genus, atopobium houses some former lactobacilli and streptococci. the genus peptostreptococcus also have four new species; p. hydrogenalis, p. lacrimalis, p. lactolyticus, and p. vaginalis.

TI  == protein degradation by prevotella intermedia and actinomyces meyeri supports the  growth of non-protein-cleaving oral bacteria in serum.
AB  == the proteolytic activities of oral bacteria are thought to play an important role in the aetiology of dental abscesses. bacteria-derived proteases may contribute to tissue destruction, and are likely to impair host defence by degrading immunoglobulins and complement. degraded periodontal tissue and tissue fluid are  likely to constitute essential sources of nutrients in the abscess. tissue fluid, which is derived from serum, is rich in protein and poor in carbohydrate, suggesting that breakdown of protein and fermentation of amino acids is a crucial step to generate energy for growth of the microflora. the number of oral bacterial species that perform hydrolytic cleavage of protein into polypeptides,  the first step in protein degradation, is relatively small compared to the large  majority of peptidase-producing species. in this study, we therefore investigated the growth-promoting effect of proteinase-producing species like prevotella intermedia and actinomyces meyeri on the growth of some non-proteinase producing  bacteria in mixed cultures. we used serum as a substitute for the supposed natural substrate of the abscess microflora. the breakdown of serum proteins was  investigated using capillary electrophoresis. poor growth was found in mono- and  mixed cultures of non-proteinase producing species eubacterium lentum, fusobacterium nucleatum. peptostreptococcus micros, and streptococcus intermedius. the presence of p. intermedia in mixed cultures strongly enhanced growth of these 4 species, according to the hypothesis that the growth of the mixed cultures was peptide-limited. the enhanced growth of p. intermedia in pronase-digested serum indicated peptide-limited growth of this organism in serum, despite its production of proteinase. we found that growth of monocultures of actinomyces meyeri was poor. in contrast, a. meyeri grew well in mixed cultures and its presence stimulated growth of f. nucleatum and p. micros, suggesting a synergistic relationship. the growth of mono- and mixed cultures was investigated using one representative strain of each species. thus, there is a small risk of having selected unique strains. proteinase inhibitors reduced the growth of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, and p. intermedia in trypticase peptone-yeast extract medium with, and without, igg. our study indicated that proteinase-producing organisms play a key role in mixed cultures of oral bacteria in human serum by providing polypeptides for growth. this may explain their association with dental abscesses.

TI  == electrophoresis of whole-cell soluble proteins of microorganisms isolated from bacteremias in endodontic therapy.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that anaerobic bacteria are the microorganisms most frequently isolated from blood following endodontic therapy of teeth with apical periodontitis. phenotypic characterisation of the isolates suggested that  the bacteria in the blood originated from the root canal. the present experiment  using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) was carried out in an effort to verify these findings, and to further study the microorganisms involved in endodontic bacteremias. soluble cellular proteins were extracted from 11 reference strains and 26 bacterial isolates recovered from the  root canal and blood. these included propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus  prevotii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia. actinomyces israelii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus sanguis. the electrophoretic patterns mostly confirmed the identity of the isolates as determined by the biochemical and antimicrobial resistance tests. furthermore, with this typing method the species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens could be differentiated.  these species had been recovered from both root canal and blood. also, differences between subspecies of fusobacterium nucleatum became evident with sds-page, and the results indicated that the organism recovered from the root canal and blood was fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii. the electrophoretic patterns of the different organisms isolated from the root canal and the blood were similar, providing further evidence that the bacteria found in the blood originated from the root canal.

TI  == clinical, microbiological and immunological profile of healthy, gingivitis and putative active periodontal subjects.
AB  == thirteen periodontally healthy subjects were monitored clinically for 6-12 months. clinical measurements at 6-weekly intervals included duplicate pd measurements, presence of plaque, redness, and bleeding on probing. baseline measurements consisted of 2 visits 1 wk apart. microbial samples were taken from  11 of the subjects who had completed at least 8 months of monitoring. levels of serum antibodies to 12 periodontal species were determined from 10 subjects. standard deviations of replicate pd measurements, computed for each subject, ranged from 0.2-0.3 mm over the monitoring period. plaque and redness increased during monitoring, and showed a weak association with pd change. baseline and follow-up distributions of pd changes indicated that changes of > 1.5 mm could reasonably be considered to represent active sites. five subjects demonstrated at least 1 site deepening by 1.5 mm over the period monitored, and these were considered putative active subjects. sites from 2 subjects showed pd increases in the 6 wk just before sampling, and these were considered to represent active sites. species associated with putative active subjects included actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, selenomonas noxia and prevotella nigrescens. streptococcus sanguis, s. gordonii and peptostreptococcus micros were associated  with inactive subjects. s. gordonii and s. oralis were associated with health, whereas p. nigrescens was associated with gingivitis. elevated serum antibodies were detected to a. actinomycetemcomitans in 4 subjects. the predominant microbiota of putative active subjects included some species previously associated with gingivitis, and some species previously associated with progressing periodontitis.

AB  == subgingival plaque samples were collected from 68 patients with adult periodontitis, enumerated on trypticase-soy blood agar plates, with and without tetracycline at 4 micrograms/ml, and incubated anaerobically for 5 days. each different colony morphotype was enumerated, and a representative colony was subcultured for identification and examined for the tetracycline resistance gene  tet(m). both pcr amplification and dna hybridization, using a fragment of tet(m)  from tn1545, were used to detect tet(m). the pcr primers (5'-gacacgccaggacatatgg-3' and 5'-tgctttcctcttgttcgag-3') were chosen to amplify  a 397 bp region of tet(m). tetracycline-resistant bacteria represented approximately 12% of the total viable count. the percentage of tet(m)-positive bacteria in the tetracycline resistant microflora varied from < or = 0.05 to 83%  (mean of 10%). tet(m) was detected in 60% of 204 tetracycline-resistant strains subcultured and identified. the tet(m) containing strains consisted of streptococci (55%, mainly s. intermedius, s. oralis, s. sanguis, and streptococcus sm4), actinomyces d01 (14%), bifidobacterium d05 (11%), and veillonella spp. (10%). tetracycline-resistant strains in which tet(m) was not detected included the prevotella and bacteroides species (41%, mainly bacteroides d28, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and p. oris). these results suggest that tet(m) is widely spread in the adult periodontal microflora, but it appears, with the exception of s. intermedius, to be mainly associated with microorganisms not  considered to be periodontopathogens. assessment of other tetracycline-resistant  genes in oral organisms is needed to fully evaluate the nature of resistance to this antibiotic in the oral flora.
