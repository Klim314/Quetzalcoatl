TI  == reactive oxygen species and the bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects of isoconazole nitrate.
AB  == bacterial superinfections often occur in dermatomycoses, resulting in greatly inflamed or eczematous skin. the objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of isoconazole nitrate (isn), a broad-spectrum antimicrobial imidazole, commonly used to treat dermatomycoses. several gram-positive bacteria minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for isn (isn solution or isn-containing creams: travogen or corticosteroid-containing travocort) and ampicillin were obtained using the broth-dilution method. speed of onset of the bactericidal effect was determined with bacterial killing curves. reactive oxygen species (ros) were visualised by staining cells with singlet oxygen detector stain. compared with ampicillin mics, isn mics for bacillus cereus, staphylococcus haemolyticus and staphylococcus hominis were lower and isn mics for corynebacterium tuberculostearicum and streptococcus salivarius were similar. incubation with isn led to a 50% kill rate for staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant strains (mrsa). post-isn incubation, 36% (30 min) and 90% (60 min) of s. aureus cells were positive for ros. isoconazole nitrate has a broad bacteriostatic and bactericidal action, also against a mrsa strain that was not reduced by the corticosteroid in the travocort cream. data suggest that the antibacterial effect of isn may be ros dependent. an antifungal agent with robust antibacterial activity can provide a therapeutic advantage in treating dermatomycoses with suspected bacterial superinfections.

TI  == microbial contamination associated with consumption and the growth in plastic bottled beverage.
AB  == plastic bottles enable the storage of unfinished beverages, and most of microbial contamination has occurred in the unfinished beverage that was left. therefore, we investigated microorganisms in various beverages contaminated by pouring and drinking directly by mouth from the bottle, and analyzed the growth of microorganisms in the beverages at room temperature. in the pouring test, microbial growth was detected in 60 of 320 samples, and 13 bacterial strains, 49  mold strains, and 8 yeast strains were isolated. molds including cladosporium spp., tramets spp., bjerkandera spp., and penicillium spp. accounted for the majority of isolated microorganisms. in the drinking test, microbial growth was detected in 181 of 352 samples, and 225 bacterial strains, 27 mold strains and 77 yeast strains were isolated. bacteria including streptococcus spp. such as s. salivarius and staphylococcus spp. such as s. aureus accounted for the majority of isolated microorganisms. enterotoxin-producing s. aureus and bacillus cereus were also isolated. the ph of the beverage influenced the growth of bacteria. the brix values of the beverage did not correlate with the growth of microorganisms.  these results revealed that various microorganisms including foodborne pathogens  were able to grow in numerous types of beverages and that the storage of unfinished beverage in inappropriate condition, such as the storage at room temperature led microorganism to grow easily in beverage. therefore, it is necessary to consume beverages as soon as possible after opening the bottle.

TI  == rhodomyrtone: a new candidate as natural antibacterial drug from rhodomyrtus tomentosa.
AB  == rhodomyrtone [6,8-dihydroxy-2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-7-(3-methyl-1-oxobutyl)-9-(2-methylpropyl)-4,9 -dihydro-1h-xanthene-1,3(2h)-di-one] from rhodomyrtus tomentosa (aiton) hassk. displayed significant antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria including bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus salivarius. especially noteworthy was the activity against mrsa with a minimum inhibitory concentration  (mic) and a minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) ranging from 0.39 to 0.78 microg/ml. as shown for s. pyogenes, no surviving cells were detected within 5 and 6h after treatment with the compound at 8mbc and 4mbc concentrations, respectively. rhodomyrtone displays no bacteriolytic activity, as determined by measurement of the optical density at 620 nm. a rhodomyrtone killing test with s. mutans using phase contrast microscopy showed that this compound caused a few morphological changes as the treated cells were slightly changed in color and bigger than the control when they were killed. taken together, the results support the view that rhodomyrtone has a strong bactericidal activity on gram-positive bacteria, including major pathogens.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria from healthy oral cavity of thai volunteers: inhibition of oral pathogens.
AB  == the aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. among 3790 isolates  (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against sarcina lutea atcc 9341, bacillus cereus atcc 11778, escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, streptococcus mutans dtmu 1, strep. salivarius dtmu 1, strep. sanguis dtmu 1, candida albicans  atcc 13803 and c. albicans dtmu 2, as well as the oral pathogens. these antimicrobial isolates included l17 and n14 which showed the antibacterial activity, d14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and d6 and n8 which showed  both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. the isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. they could utilize casein but  could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by ph, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. the activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at ph > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees c. however, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. when the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they  were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. the final identification revealed that d6, d14 and n14 were lactobacillus paracasei subsp.  paracasei, and l17 and n8 were lact. rhamnosus.

TI  == a preliminary survey of aerobic bacteria in breast milk of mothers from the low-income group in nigeria.
AB  == the aerobic bacteria colonizing breast milk of the low-income group in nigeria were quantified to assess its suitability for use in milk banks. in parallel, the nutritional and health status of donating mothers and their infants were assessed by physicians. the aerobic bacteria contained in the specimens included streptococcus salivarius, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermides. in general, the microbial load found in these milk samples is lower than levels considered dangerous. an analysis of the results showed that 50% of the mother's milk is contaminated, 17% of which was infected with primary pathogens. there was no correlation between demographic data, nutritional or health status of either mother or infant and microbial load  in mother's milk. milk obtained from this socio-economic group, is therefore, considered safe for use in milk banks.
