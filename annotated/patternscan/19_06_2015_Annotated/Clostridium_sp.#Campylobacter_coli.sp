TI  == characteristics of metroxylon sagu resistant starch type iii as prebiotic substance.
AB  == resistant starch type iii (rs3 ) was produced from sago (metroxylon sagu) and evaluated for its characteristics as a prebiotic. two rs3 samples designated sago rs and hcl-sago rs contained 35.71% and 68.30% rs, respectively, were subjected to hydrolyses by gastric juice and digestive enzymes and to absorption. both sago rs and hcl-sago rs were resistant to 180 min hydrolysis by gastric acidity at ph  1 to 4 with less than 0.85% hydrolyzed. both samples were also resistant toward hydrolysis by gastrointestinal tract enzymes and intestinal absorption with 96.75% and 98.69% of rs3 were recovered respectively after 3.5 h digestion and overnight dialysis at 37 degrees c. sago rs3 supported the growth of both beneficial (lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) and pathogenic microbes (escherichia coli, campylobacter coli, and clostridium perfringens) in the range of 2.60 to 3.91 log10 cfu/ml. hence, prebiotic activity score was applied to describe the extent to which sago rs3 supports selective growth of the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria strains over pathogenic bacteria. the highest scores were obtained from bifidobacterium sp. ftdc8943 grown on sago rs (+0.26) and hcl-sago rs (+0.24) followed by l. bulgaricus ftdc1511 grown on sago rs (+0.21). the findings had suggested that sago rs3 has the prebiotic partial characteristics and it is suggested to further assess the suitability of sago rs3 as a prebiotic material.

TI  == added value of multiplex luminex gastrointestinal pathogen panel (xtag(r) gpp) testing in the diagnosis of infectious gastroenteritis.
AB  == the luminex gastrointestinal pathogen panel (xtag((r)) gpp) detects in one assay  the most common gastroenteritis-causing pathogens and toxins, namely adenovirus 40/41, norovirus genogroup (ng) i/ii, rotavirus a, clostridium difficile toxin a/b, campylobacter sp., escherichia coli o157, enterotoxigenic e. coli heat-labile enterotoxin/heat-stable enterotoxin, salmonella sp., shiga-toxin producing e. coli, shiga-like toxin (stx)1/2, shigella sp., vibrio cholerae, yersinia enterocolitica, cryptosporidium sp., entamoeba histolytica and giardia sp. in this study, we compared the results that were obtained by testing 393 faecal samples, collected during november and december 2011 at our laboratory, using the xtag((r)) gpp assay with the results of the routine diagnostic procedure. this procedure includes culture for bacteria and real-time pcr for viruses and parasites, but only if the test was requested by the clinician. if the clinician did not request the test for an xtag((r)) gpp-positive target, real-time pcr assays were used to confirm xtag((r)) gpp positivity. discrepant results were also tested with real-time pcr assays. a total of 83 targets were detected in 76 samples using xtag((r)) gpp. the xtag((r)) gpp assay detected 43 additional positives compared with the routine diagnostic procedure, of which 11  targets could not be confirmed by real-time pcr. the non-confirmed targets were campylobacter (one sample), salmonella (four samples), shigella (one sample) and  e. histolytica (five samples). the xtag((r)) gpp was shown to be a convenient and sensitive assay for detection of 15 major gastrointestinal pathogens in a single  molecular test, but for detection of e. histolytica and salmonella, a confirmatory assay is indicated.

TI  == physical, chemical and microbiological quality of ice used to cool drinks and foods in greece and its public health implications.
AB  == ice used for direct human consumption or to preserve foods and cool down drinks can be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms and may potentially become a vehicle for consumer's infection. to evaluate physical, chemical and microbiological quality of commercial ice and ice used for fish and seafood, 100  ice samples collected at 10 different retail points in the region of epirus were  studied. the following microbiological parameters were determined: total coliforms, fecal coliforms, salmonella spp., shigella spp., yersinia spp., escherichia coli, campylobacter sp., vibrio cholerae, aeromonas spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium perfringens. e. coli was detected in 22% and coliforms were detected in 31% of samples. samples in which coliforms were detected fail to meet the microbiological criteria specified by the drinking water legislation. aeromonas spp., shigella spp., campylobacter sp. and v. cholerae were not detected. spore forms of c. perfringens were prevalent at 35% and the psychotropic bacterium's p. aeruginosa and yersinia spp. were found only at three samples each. the presence of large numbers of coliforms as well as of other pathogenic strains suggested that commercial ice and ice used to make cool drinks or in preservation of fish and seafood may represent a potential hazard to the consumer. in view of the results reported herein, it is highly recommended that national regulatory guidelines should be established for the production of ice as long as regular inspections.

TI  == hygienic quality and antibiotic resistance profile of sliced butchery.
AB  == in order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). in all cold meat preparations clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and other clostridium sp lec(-), as well as lactobacillus, bacillus sp. and salmonella sp. were recovered. for instance bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. l. monocytogenes,  campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter lari were absent. differences in the occurrence of s. aureus, salmonella sp., e. coli and spore forms of c. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the  processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. a multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and  pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol  and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. antibiotics commonly used for  therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of the immersion chilling procedure during poultry processing.
AB  == the development of treatments to reduce bacterial numbers on poultry carcasses is important for the overall hygienic quality of birds. the important washing effect of the immersion chilling procedure is discussed. systematic monitoring of fecal  bacterial indicators as well as some classic pathogens was performed at selected  critical points in a water chiller ecosystem. clostridium perfringens, fecal coliforms, enterococcus sp., and streptococcus sp. were found in all water chiller samples. the temperature of the chiller ecosystem varied according to location: escherichia coli and salmonella sp. were found at 16 degrees c, compared with the 4 degrees c location, where these species were found in lower numbers. moreover, the psychrotrophic bacterium pseudomonas was found only at this last location. the temperature of the water during the immersion chilling procedure was unfavorable for the growth of campylobacter sp., whose presence was always strictly associated with a ph close to 6. spore forms of c. perfringens were persistent in all locations and seemed to be a reliable indicator of contamination of the water chiller ecosystem.

TI  == [a study to assess the microbial contamination of mya arenaria clams from the north shore of the st lawrence river estuary, (quebec, canada)].
AB  == the aims of the present study were to assess the microbial quality of mya arenaria clams from the north shore of the st. lawrence river estuary and to validate various microbial indicator microorganisms of bivalve mollusks contamination. clams were collected from nine sites, including four harvesting sites closed by virtue of the canadian shellfish sanitation program (cssp). six contamination indicators (fecal coliforms, somatic coliphages, f-specific coliphages, fecal streptococci, clostridium perfringens, and escherichia coli) and four pathogens (campylobacter sp., cryptosporidium parvum, giardia sp., and salmonella sp.) were identified in the clams. indicators sensibility, specificity and predictive values with respect to the presence of pathogens were calculated.  pathogenic microorganisms detection frequency in clams was important (92%). globally, pathogens tend to be less frequently detected in opened harvesting sites (p = 0.086). although the assessed indicators were not perfect, when f-specific coliphages are associated with e. coli or fecal coliforms, a good sensibility (62%-64%) and good positive predictive value (88%) with respect to the investigated pathogens are obtained.

TI  == survey of peafowl (pavo cristatus) for potential pathogens at three michigan zoos.
AB  == blood samples collected from 31 free-roaming peafowl from three zoos in michigan  were tested serologically. antibody titers were present against avian adenovirus  and bordetella avium in 19.3% and 61.3% of the samples, respectively. serum plate agglutination tests were positive for mycoplasma meleagridis and mycoplasma synoviae in 3.2% and 38.7% of the samples, respectively. all birds were seronegative for avian influenza, newcastle disease virus, west nile virus, mycoplasma gallisepticum, salmonella pullorum, salmonella typhimurium, and giardia sp. no parasites were seen in blood smears. cloacal swabs were cultured for anaerobic, aerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria. clostridium perfringens type a and escherichia coli were cultured most frequently from 64.5% and 29% of the samples, respectively, whereas salmonella sp. and campylobacter sp. were not  isolated. fecal samples contained moderate numbers of ascarid and capillaria sp.  ova and coccidian oocysts. female biting lice (goniodes gigas) were identified on three birds.

TI  == evaluation of broiler litter with reference to the microbial composition as assessed by using 16s rrna and functional gene markers.
AB  == very little is known about the microbial composition of animal bedding wastes, including poultry litter, and what is known has been deduced from standard culture methods, by which some fastidious organisms that exist in the environment may not be detected. we evaluated the bacterial composition of poultry litter by  using a combination of culture and molecular detection. total aerobic bacteria in poultry litter were detected by culture at 10(9) cfu/g of material. enteric bacteria such as enterococcus spp. and coliforms composed 0.1 and 0.01%, respectively, of the total aerobic cultivatable bacteria in poultry litter; no salmonella strains were detected by culture. in order to characterize the most abundant bacterial groups, we sequenced 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) genes amplified  by pcr with microbial community dna isolated from poultry litter as the template. from the 16s rdna library, 31 genera were identified. twelve families or groups were identified with lactobacilli and salinococcus spp. forming the most abundant groups. in fact, 82% of the total sequences were identified as gram-positive bacteria with 62% of total belonging to low g+c gram-positive groups. in addition to detection of 16s rdna sequences associated with the expected fecal bacteria present in manure, we detected many bacterial sequences for organisms, such as globicatella sulfidofaciens, corynebacterium ammoniagenes, corynebacterium urealyticum, clostridium aminovalericum, arthrobacter sp., and denitrobacter permanens, that may be involved in the degradation of wood and cycling of nitrogen and sulfur. several sequences were identified in the library for bacteria associated with disease in humans and poultry such as clostridia, staphylococci, and bordetella spp. however, specific pcr targeting other human and veterinary pathogens did not detect the presence of salmonella, pathogenic escherichia coli, campylobacter spp., yersinia spp., listeria spp., or toxigenic  staphylococci. pcr and dna hybridization revealed the presence of class 1 integrons with gene cassettes that specify resistance to aminoglycosides and chloramphenicol. only from understanding the microbial community of animal wastes such as poultry litter can we manage animal disease and limit the impact of animal waste on the environment and human and animal health.

TI  == spread of antibiotic resistance with food-borne pathogens.
AB  == this short review summarizes data on antibiotic resistance profiles of common food-borne pathogens like salmonella sp., escherichia coli, campylobacter sp., listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. as a flashlight on the literature of the last few years, it provides ample evidence that antibiotic resistance traits have entered the microflora of farm animals and the food produced from them. molecular analysis of the resistance genes, where available, shows that the food microflora is not separated from its human counterpart and conjugative transfer of resistance genes has been demonstrated in vitro and in a few cases in vivo. for example, for salmonella typhimurium, resistance towards tetracyclines has increased from zero in 1948 to a 98% level in certain epidemic populations of s.  typhimurium dt104 in 1998. the high incidence of food-borne pathogens in raw meat and milk together with a high level of therapeutic, prophylactic and nutritional  application of antibiotics in agriculture reveals an antibiotic resistance problem of global dimensions. the resistance problem in human medicine will not be solved if there is a constant influx of resistance genes into the human microflora via the food chain.

TI  == risk factors for outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease linked to domestic catering.
AB  == the epidemiology of general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering for large numbers is described and compared with foodborne outbreaks in other settings. from 1 january 1992 to 31 december 1994, the phls communicable disease surveillance centre identified 101 foodborne general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering in england and wales (16% of all foodborne outbreaks). salmonella species were associated with 77 of the 101 outbreaks and s. enteriditis phage type 4 accounted for 57. small round structured viruses were implicated in five outbreaks, clostridium perfringens in four, bacillus cereus in two, and campylobacter sp and escherichia coli in one each. no pathogen was identified in 11 outbreaks. outbreaks occurred most commonly in summer. the commonest vehicles implicated were poultry/eggs in 44 outbreaks, desserts in 13, and meat/meat products in nine. salad/vegetables, sauces, and fish/shellfish were each implicated in eight  outbreaks. raw shell eggs were implicated in a fifth of outbreaks. inappropriate  storage was the commonest fault, reported in association with 50 outbreaks (ambient temperature for long periods before serving in 29), inadequate heat treatment was reported in 35, cross contamination in 28, an infected food handler in 11, and other faults in 14. outbreaks associated with catering on domestic premises were independently more likely than outbreaks in other settings to be associated with salmonellas, inappropriate storage of food, and consumption of poultry, eggs, or sauces. public health services need to direct messages about the use, preparation, and storage of food to those who cater on domestic premises.

TI  == production of a unique cytotoxin by campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is an important diarrheal pathogen worldwide; the mechanisms by which it causes disease remain unclear. because of its association with inflammatory diarrhea, we postulated that c. jejuni might produce a cytotoxin similar to that produced by shigella sp., enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157, or clostridium difficile. filtrates of 12 polymyxin-treated isolates of c.  jejuni were placed on hela cells (sensitive to shiga toxin cytotoxicity) and chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells. of 12 isolates of c. jejuni tested, 5 killed 50% of the cells at greater than or equal to 1:4 dilutions of filtered suspensions of 10(9) bacteria per ml; killing was similar in hela and cho cells (the cho cells being insensitive to shiga cytotoxin). one isolate produced a titer of 1:32 to 1:128. the relative potency in hela cells was comparable to that of e. coli strains that produce intermediate amounts of shiga-like toxin. the other seven strains showed no cytotoxic effect, nor did the control diluents, polymyxin b, or supernatants of c. jejuni not treated with polymyxin b. sonication also released active cytotoxin, but slightly less well than did polymyxin. the cytotoxic effect was dose dependent. concentration of the c. jejuni in suspension by 10-fold before treatment with polymyxin b resulted in a 10-fold increase in the 50% cytotoxic dose. the cytotoxin effect was not neutralized by shiga toxin immune serum against either shiga-like toxin i or ii or by anti-clostridium difficile antiserum. the c jejuni cytotoxin was partially  labile to trypsin (0.25%) and to heating to greater than or equal to 60 degrees c. cytotoxicity was retained in scientific products dialysis tubing d1615-1 (mr cutoff, 12,000 to 14,000). some isolates of c. jejuni release a substance lethal  to hela or cho cells in vitro that is distinct from shiga-like or clostridium difficile toxin. this cytotoxin may contribute to the colonic mucosal invasive process that characterizes c. jejuni enteritis.

TI  == raw beef, pork and chicken in japan contaminated with salmonella sp., campylobacter sp., yersinia enterocolitica, and clostridium perfringens--a comparative study.
AB  == one hundred and twenty samples each of raw ground beef, pork and chicken from ten local grocery stores in shimane prefecture, japan, were examined for the presence of salmonella sp. (sal), campylobacter jejuni (cj), campylobacter coli (cc), yersinia enterocolitica (ye), and clostridium perfringens (cp) from april 1984 to march 1985. a total of 205 isolates of sal (112 strains), cj (64 strains), cc (one strain), ye (7 strains) and cp (21 strains) were recovered from 17 beef (14.2%), 31 pork (25.8%) and 94 chicken (78.3%) of 120 samples each. sal biogroup 1 was found in 8.3% of beef, 13.3% of pork and 35.0% of chicken, sal biogroup 2 in 0.8% of beef, 4.2% of pork and 14.2% of chicken, cj in 1.7% of beef and pork and 50.0% of chicken, cc in 0.8% of pork, ye serotype 03 was found in 5.0% of pork, and cp in 1.7% of beef and pork and 10.8% of chicken. these enteropathogens were recovered concomitantly from two pork and 31 chicken samples, especially sal and cj. sal was counted at less than or equal to 10(2)/100 g of beef and pork and at less than or equal to 10(3)/100 g of chicken, cj was counted at less than or equal to 10(1)/g of beef and pork and at less than or equal to 10(2)/g of chicken, ye serotype 03 was counted at less than or equal to 10(3)/g of pork, cp  was counted at less than or equal to 10(2)/g of pork and at less than or equal to 10(2)g of chicken, and cc from pork and cp from beef were recovered by using enrichment culture. this investigation showed that a second-contamination of sal  and cj from chicken to beef and pork frequently occurred during the warm months of the year. it was suggested that chicken may become a source of infection with  plural organisms of enteric pathogens, especially sal and cj, at the same time all the year round, and that pork may be an important source of infection with ye during the cold months.

TI  == etiology of acute infectious diarrhea in a highly industrialized area of switzerland.
AB  == during an 18-mo period between 1981 and 1982, a prospective study was conducted in 119 adult patients with acute diarrhea. a diarrhea-inducing microorganism or toxin could be identified in 38.7% of the patients. salmonella sp and campylobacter jejuni were the leading agents that caused diarrheal illness in 25% of the investigated population. clostridium difficile was found in 6%, mainly after previous antibiotic therapy. rotavirus was rarely isolated and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli were not found. clinical features in patients in whom an invasive agent was isolated did not differ from those in patients in whom no enteropathogens were found, although the occurrence of fecal leukocytes and positive hemoccult tests in the former group was significantly more frequent. more than 30% of the patients with negative stool cultures, however, showed fecal leukocytes and positive occult blood, which is suggestive of the existence of one or more invasive agent(s) so far unknown or not recognized.
