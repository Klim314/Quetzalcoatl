TI  == full-length structure of the major autolysin lyta.
AB  == lyta is responsible for the autolysis of many streptococcus species, including pathogens such as s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae and s. mitis. however, how this major autolysin achieves full activity remains unknown. here, the full-length structure of the s. pneumoniae lyta dimer is reported at 2.1 a resolution. each subunit has an n-terminal amidase domain and a c-terminal choline-binding domain consisting of six choline-binding repeats, which form five canonical and one single-layered choline-binding sites. site-directed mutageneses combined with enzymatic activity assays indicate that dimerization and binding to choline are two independent requirements for the autolytic activity of lyta in vivo. altogether, it is suggested that dimerization and full occupancy of all choline-binding sites through binding to choline-containing ta chains enable lyta to adopt a fully active conformation which allows the amidase domain to cleave two lactyl-amide bonds located about 103 a apart on the peptidoglycan.

TI  == antibacterial effects of traditional chinese medicine monomers against streptococcus pneumoniae via inhibiting pneumococcal histidine kinase (vick).
AB  == two-component systems (tcss) have the potential to be an effective target of the  antimicrobials, and thus received much attention in recent years. vick/vicr is one of tcss in streptococcus pneumoniae (s. pneumoniae), which is essential for pneumococcal survival. we have previously obtained several traditional chinese medicine monomers using a computer-based screening. in this study, either alone or in combination with penicillin, their antimicrobial activities were evaluated  based on in vivo and in vitro assays. the results showed that the mics of 5'-(methylthio)-5'-deoxyadenosine, octanal 2, 4-dinitrophenylhydrazone, deoxyshikonin, kavahin, and dodecyl gallate against s. pneumoniae were 37.1, 38.5, 17, 68.5, and 21 mug/ml, respectively. time-killing assays showed that these compounds elicited bactericidal effects against s. pneumoniae d39 strain, which led to a 6-log reduction in cfu after exposure to compounds at four times of the mic for 24 h. the five compounds inhibited the growth of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans or streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, meanwhile, deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate displayed strong inhibitory activities against staphylococcus aureus. these compounds showed no obvious cytotoxicity effects on vero cells. survival time of the mice infected by s. pneumoniae strains was prolonged by the treatment with the compounds. importantly, all of the five compounds exerted antimicrobial effects against multidrug-resistant clinical strains of s. pneumoniae. moreover, even at sub-mic  concentration, they inhibited cell division and biofilm formation. the five compounds all have enhancement effect on penicillin. deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate showed significantly synergic antimicrobial activity with penicillin in vivo and in vitro, and effectively reduced nasopharyngeal and lung colonization caused by different penicillin-resistant pneumococcal serotypes. in addition, the two compounds also showed synergic antimicrobial activity with erythromycin and tetracycline. taken together, our results suggest that these novel vick inhibitors may be promising compounds against the pneumococcus, including penicillin-resistant strains.

TI  == the novel species streptococcus tigurinus and its association with oral infection.
AB  == streptococcus tigurinus is a novel species of viridans streptococci, shown to cause severe invasive infections such as infective endocarditis, spondylodiscitis and meningitis. s. tigurinus belongs to the streptococcus mitis group and is most closely related to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and streptococcus infantis. the presence of s. tigurinus in the human oral cavity has been documented, including  in patients with periodontal disease. this review addresses the available scientific knowledge on s. tigurinus and its association with closely related streptococci, and discusses its putative involvement in common oral infections. while there is as yet no strong evidence on the involvement of s. tigurinus with  oral infections, its presence in the oral cavity and its association with endocarditis warrants special attention for a link between oral and systemic infection.

TI  == identification of proteins in streptococcus pneumoniae by reverse vaccinology and genetic diversity of these proteins in clinical isolates.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. virulence-associated proteins common and conserved among all capsular types now represent the best strategy to combat pneumococcal infections. our aim was to identify conserved targets in pneumococci that showed positive prediction for lipoprotein and extracellular subcellular location using bioinformatics programs  and verify the distribution and the degree of conservation of these targets in pneumococci. these targets can be considered potential vaccine candidate to be evaluated in the future. a set of 13 targets were analyzed and confirmed the presence in all pneumococci tested. these 13 genes were highly conserved showing  around >96 % of amino acid and nucleotide identity, but they were also present and show high identity in the closely related species streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. s. oralis clusters away from s. pneumoniae, while s. pseudopneumoniae and s. mitis cluster closer. the divergence between the selected targets was too small to be observed consistently in phylogenetic groups between the analyzed genomes of s. pneumoniae. the proteins analyzed fulfill two of the initial criteria of a vaccine candidate: targets are present in a variety of different pneumococci strains including different serotypes and are conserved among the samples evaluated.

TI  == isolation of streptococcus tigurinus - a novel member of streptococcus mitis group from a case of periodontitis.
AB  == streptococcus tigurinus is a new member of the streptococcus viridians group and  is closely related to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus infantis. the type strain az_3a(t) of s. tigurinus was originally isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis. accurate identification of s. tigurinus is facilitated only by newer molecular methods like 16s rrna gene analysis. during the course of study on bacteraemia and infective endocarditis with reference to periodontitis and viridians group of streptococci, a strain of s. tigurinus isolated from subgingival plaque of a patient with periodontitis identified by 16s rrna gene analysis, which was originally identified as streptococcus pluranimalium by vitek 2. confirmation by 16s rrna gene analysis showed 99.39% similarity (1476/1485 bp) with s. tigurinus az_3a(t) (aoru01000002). to the best  of our knowledge, this is the first report of isolation of s. tigurinus from the  oral cavity of a periodontitis patient.

TI  == comparative genomic analyses of provide insight into virulence and commensalism dynamics.
AB  == streptococcus pseudopneumoniae (sppn) is a recently described species of the viridans group streptococci (vgs). although the pathogenic potential of s. pseudopneumoniae remains uncertain, it is most commonly isolated from patients with underlying medical conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. s. pseudopneumoniae can be distinguished from the closely related species, s. pneumoniae and s. mitis, by phenotypic characteristics, including optochin resistance in the presence of 5% co2, bile insolubility, and the lack of the pneumococcal capsule. previously, we reported the draft genome sequence of s. pseudopneumoniae is7493, a clinical isolate obtained from an immunocompromised patient with documented pneumonia. here, we use comparative genomics approaches to identify similarities and key differences between s. pseudopneumoniae is7493,  s. pneumoniae and s. mitis. the genome structure of s. pseudopneumoniae is7493 is most closely related to that of s. pneumoniae r6, but several recombination events are evident. analysis of gene content reveals numerous unique features that distinguish s. pseudopneumoniae from other streptococci. the presence of loci for competence, iron transport, pneumolysin production and antimicrobial resistance reinforce the phylogenetic position of s. pseudopneumoniae as an intermediate species between s. pneumoniae and s. mitis. additionally, the presence of several virulence factors and antibiotic resistance mechanisms suggest the potential of this commensal species to become pathogenic or to contribute to increasing antibiotic resistance levels seen among the vgs.

TI  == identification of clinical streptococcus pneumoniae isolates among other alpha and nonhemolytic streptococci by use of the vitek ms matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry system.
AB  == discrimination between streptococcus pneumoniae and its close relatives of the viridans group is a common difficulty in matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry-based identification. in  the present study, the performances of the vitek ms maldi-tof mass spectrometry system were assessed using 334 pneumococci, 166 other s. mitis group streptococci, 184 non-s. mitis group streptococci, and 19 related alpha- and nonhemolytic aerobic gram-positive catalase-negative coccal isolates. pneumococci had been identified by means of optochin susceptibility and bile solubility or serotyping, and other isolates mainly by use of rapidid32 strep strips. in case of discordant or low-discrimination results, genotypic methods were used. the sensitivity of the vitek ms for the identification of s. pneumoniae was 99.1%, since only three bile-insoluble isolates were misidentified as streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis. conversely, two optochin-resistant pneumococci were correctly identified (specificity, 100%). three streptococcus pseudopneumoniae isolates were also correctly identified. among nonpneumococcal isolates, 90.8% (n = 335) were correctly identified to the species or subspecies level and 2.4% (n = 9) at the group level. for the remaining 25 isolates, the vitek ms proposed a bacterial species included in the list of possible species suggested by genotypic methods, except for 4 isolates which were not identified due to the absence of the species in the database. according to our study, the vitek ms displays performance similar to that of the optochin susceptibility test for routine identification of pneumococcal isolates. moreover, the vitek ms is efficient for  the identification of other viridans group streptococci and related isolates, provided that the species are included in the database.

TI  == disease isolates of streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and non-typeable s. pneumoniae presumptively identified as atypical s. pneumoniae in spain.
AB  == we aimed to obtain insights on the nature of a collection of isolates presumptively identified as atypical streptococcus pneumoniae recovered from invasive and non-invasive infections in spain. one-hundred and thirty-two isolates were characterized by: optochin susceptibility in ambient and co(2)-enriched atmosphere; bile solubility; pcr-based assays targeting pneumococcal genes lyta, ply, pspa, cpsa, spn9802, alib-like orf2, and a specific 16s rrna region; multilocus sequence analysis; and antimicrobial susceptibility.  by multilocus sequence analysis, 61 isolates were s. pseudopneumoniae, 34 were pneumococci, 13 were s. mitis, and 24 remained unclassified as non-pneumococci. among s. pseudopneumoniae isolates, 51 (83.6%) were collected from respiratory tract samples; eight isolates were obtained from sterile sources. high frequency  of non-susceptibility to penicillin (60.7%) and erythromycin (42.6%) was found. only 50.8% of the s. pseudopneumoniae isolates displayed the typical optochin phenotype originally described for this species. none harbored the cpsa gene or the pneumococcal typical lyta restriction fragment length polymorphism. the spn9802 and the specific 16s rrna regions were detected among the majority of the s. pseudopneumoniae isolates (n = 59 and n = 49, respectively). the ply and pspa  genes were rarely found. a high genetic diversity was found and 59 profiles were  identified. among the s. pneumoniae, 23 were capsulated and 11 were non-typeable. three non-typeable isolates, associated to international non-capsulated lineages, were recovered from invasive disease sources. in conclusion, half of the atypical pneumococcal clinical isolates were, in fact, s. pseudopneumoniae and one-fourth  were other streptococci. we identified s. pseudopneumoniae and non-typeable pneumococci as cause of disease in spain including invasive disease.

TI  == discrimination between streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis based on  sorting of their maldi mass spectra.
AB  == accurate species-level identification of alpha-hemolytic (viridans) streptococci  (vgs) is very important for understanding their pathogenicity and virulence. however, an extremely high level of similarity between vgs within the mitis group (s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, s. oralis and s. pseudopneumoniae) often results in misidentification of these organisms. earlier, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) has been suggested as  a tool for the rapid identification of s. pneumoniae. however, by using biotyper  3.0 (bruker) or vitek ms (biomerieux) databases, streptococcus mitis/oralis species can be erroneously identified as s. pneumoniae. clinprotools 2.1 software was used for the discrimination of maldi-tof mass spectra of 25 s. pneumoniae isolates, 34 s. mitis and three s. oralis. phenotypical tests and multilocus gene typing schemes for the s. pneumoniae (http://spneumoniae.mlst.net/) and viridans  streptococci (http://viridans.emlsa.net/) were used for the identification of isolates included in the study. the classifying model was generated based on different algorithms (genetic algorithm, supervised neural network and quickclassifier). in all cases, values of sensitivity and specificity were found  to be equal or close to 100%, allowing discrimination of mass spectra of different species. three peaks (6949, 9876 and 9975 m/z) were determined conferring the maximal statistical weight onto each model built. we find this approach to be promising for viridans streptococci discrimination.

TI  == characterization of recombinant fluoroquinolone-resistant pneumococcus-like isolates.
AB  == fourteen fluoroquinolone-resistant streptococcal isolates with recombinant dna topoisomerase genes, preliminarily identified as pneumococci, were further characterized using phenotypic and genotypic approaches. phenotypic tests classified them as atypical pneumococci. phylogenetic relationships were analyzed by using the sequences of seven housekeeping alleles from these isolates and from isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis,  and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. four isolates grouped with s. pneumoniae, seven grouped with s. pseudopneumoniae, and three grouped with s. mitis. these results generally agreed with those obtained with an optochin susceptibility test and with the organization of the atp operon chromosomal region, encoding the f(o)f(1) h(+)-atpase (the target of optochin). all seven isolates grouping with s. pseudopneumoniae share the same spr1368-atpc-atpa gene order; all four grouping with s. pneumoniae share the spr1368-is1239-atpc-atpa order, and two out of the three grouping with s. mitis share the spr1284-atpc-atpa order. in addition, evidence for recombination within the seven housekeeping alleles of the s. pseudopneumoniae population was provided by several methods: the index of association (0.4598, p < 0.001), the pairwise homoplasy index, and the split-decomposition method. this study confirms the existence of pneumococci among the alpha-hemolytic streptococci with dna topoisomerase genes showing a mosaic structure and reveals a close relationship between atypical pneumococci and s. pseudopneumoniae.

TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

TI  == streptococcus tigurinus, a novel member of the streptococcus mitis group, causes  invasive infections.
AB  == we recently described the novel species streptococcus tigurinus sp. nov. belonging to the streptococcus mitis group. the type strain az_3a(t) of s. tigurinus was originally isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis. according to its phenotypic and molecular characteristics, s. tigurinus is most closely related to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus infantis. accurate identification of s. tigurinus is facilitated by 16s rrna gene analysis. we retrospectively analyzed our 16s rrna gene molecular database, which contains sequences of all clinical samples obtained in our institute since 2003. we detected 17 16s rrna gene sequences which were assigned to s. tigurinus, including sequences from the 3 s. tigurinus strains described previously. s. tigurinus originated from normally sterile body sites, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or heart valves, of 14 patients and was initially detected by culture or broad-range 16s rrna gene pcr, followed by sequencing. the 14 patients had serious invasive infections, i.e., infective endocarditis (n = 6), spondylodiscitis (n = 3), bacteremia (n = 2), meningitis (n = 1), prosthetic joint infection (n = 1), and thoracic empyema (n = 1). to evaluate the presence of streptococcus tigurinus in the endogenous oral microbial flora, we screened saliva specimens of 31 volunteers. after selective growth, alpha-hemolytic growing colonies were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) and subsequent molecular methods. s. tigurinus was not identified among 608 strains analyzed. these data indicate that s. tigurinus is not widely distributed in the oral cavity. in conclusion, s. tigurinus is a novel agent of invasive infections, particularly infective endocarditis.

TI  == comparative transcriptomic analysis of streptococcus pseudopneumoniae with viridans group streptococci.
AB  == background: streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, is a novel member of the genus streptococcus, falling close to related members like s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, and s. oralis. its recent appearance has shed light on streptococcal infections, which has been unclear till recently. in this study, the transcriptome of s. pseudopneumoniae ccug 49455t was analyzed using the s. pneumoniae r6 microarray platform and compared with those of s. pneumoniae kctc 5080t, s. mitis kctc 3556t, and s. oralis kctc 13048t strains. results: comparative transcriptome analysis revealed the extent of genetic relatedness among the species, and implies that s. pseudopneumoniae is the most closely related to s. pneumoniae. a  total of 489, 444 and 470 genes were upregulated while 347, 484 and 443 were downregulated relative to s. pneumoniae in s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis and s.  mitis respectively. important findings were the up-regulation of tcs (two component systems) and transposase which were found to be specific to s. pseudopneumoniae. conclusions: this study provides insight to the current understanding of the genomic content of s. pseudopneumoniae. the comparative transcriptome analysis showed hierarchical clustering of expression data of s. pseudopneumoniae with s. pneumoniae and s. mitis with s. oralis. this proves that transcriptional profiling can facilitate in elucidating the genetic distance between closely related strains.

TI  == sequetyping: serotyping streptococcus pneumoniae by a single pcr sequencing strategy.
AB  == the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines necessitates continued monitoring of circulating strains to assess vaccine efficacy and replacement serotypes. conventional serological methods are costly, labor-intensive, and prone to misidentification, while current dna-based methods have limited serotype coverage requiring multiple pcr primers. in this study, a computer algorithm was  developed to interrogate the capsulation locus (cps) of vaccine serotypes to locate primer pairs in conserved regions that border variable regions and could differentiate between serotypes. in silico analysis of cps from 92 serotypes indicated that a primer pair spanning the regulatory gene cpsb could putatively amplify 84 serotypes and differentiate 46. this primer set was specific to streptococcus pneumoniae, with no amplification observed for other species, including s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. pseudopneumoniae. one hundred thirty-eight  pneumococcal strains covering 48 serotypes were tested. of 23 vaccine serotypes included in the study, most (19/22, 86%) were identified correctly at least to the serogroup level, including all of the 13-valent conjugate vaccine and other replacement serotypes. reproducibility was demonstrated by the correct sequetyping of different strains of a serotype. this novel sequence-based method  employing a single pcr primer pair is cost-effective and simple. furthermore, it  has the potential to identify new serotypes that may evolve in the future.

TI  == novel molecular method for identification of streptococcus pneumoniae applicable  to clinical microbiology and 16s rrna sequence-based microbiome studies.
AB  == the close phylogenetic relationship of the important pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae and several species of commensal streptococci, particularly streptococcus mitis and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and the recently demonstrated sharing of genes and phenotypic traits previously considered specific for s. pneumoniae hamper the exact identification of s. pneumoniae. based on sequence analysis of 16s rrna genes of a collection of 634 streptococcal strains, identified by multilocus sequence analysis, we detected a cytosine at position 203 present in all 440 strains of s. pneumoniae but replaced by an adenosine residue in all strains representing other species of mitis group streptococci. the s. pneumoniae-specific sequence signature could be demonstrated by sequence analysis or indirectly by restriction endonuclease digestion of a pcr amplicon covering the site. the s. pneumoniae-specific signature offers an inexpensive means for validation of the identity of clinical isolates and should  be used as an integrated marker in the annotation procedure employed in 16s rrna-based molecular studies of complex human microbiotas. this may avoid frequent misidentifications such as those we demonstrate to have occurred in previous reports and in reference sequence databases.

TI  == streptococcus pseudopneumoniae identification by pherotype: a method to assist understanding of a potentially emerging or overlooked pathogen.
AB  == the recent identification of streptococcus pseudopneumoniae (pseudopneumococcus)  has complicated classification schemes within members of the "mitis" streptococcal group. accurate differentiation of this species is necessary for understanding its disease potential and identification in clinical settings. this work described the use of the competence-stimulatory peptide comc sequence for identification of s. pseudopneumoniae. comc sequences from clinical sources were  determined for 17 strains of s. pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus oralis. an additional 58 comc sequences from a range of sources were included to understand the diversity and suitability of this protein as a diagnostic marker for species identification. we identified three pherotypes for  this species, delineated csp6.1 (10/14, 79%), csp6.3 (3/14, 21%), and sk674 (1/14, 7%). pseudopneumococcal comc sequences formed a discrete cluster within those of other oral streptococci. this suggests that the comc sequence could be used to identify s. pseudopneumoniae, thus simplifying the study of the pathogenic potential of this organism. to avoid confusion between pneumococcal and pseudopneumococcal pherotypes, we have renamed the competence pherotype csp6.1, formerly reported as an "atypical" pneumococcus, cspps1 to reflect its occurrence in s. pseudopneumoniae.

TI  == evaluation of several biochemical and molecular techniques for identification of  streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and their detection in respiratory samples.
AB  == the identification and detection of mitis group streptococci, which contain streptococcus pneumoniae, have been hampered by the lack of sensitive and specific assays. in this study, we evaluated several biochemical and molecular assays for the identification of s. pneumoniae and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and their distinction from other mitis group streptococci using a collection of 54 isolates obtained by the routine culturing of 53 respiratory specimens from patients with community-acquired pneumonia. the combined results of the biochemical and molecular assays indicated the presence of 23 s. pneumoniae, 2 s. pseudopneumoniae, and 29 other mitis group streptococcal isolates. the tube bile  solubility test that is considered gold standard for the identification of s. pneumoniae showed concordant results with optochin susceptibility testing (co(2)  atmosphere) and a real-time multiplex pcr assay targeting the spn9802 fragment and the autolysin gene. optochin susceptibility testing upon incubation in an o(2) atmosphere, bile solubility testing by oxgall disk, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, and sequence analysis of  the tuf and rpob genes resulted in several false-positive, false-negative, or inconclusive results. the s. pseudopneumoniae isolates could be identified only by molecular assays, and the multiplex real-time pcr assay was concluded to be most convenient for the identification of s. pneumoniae and s. pseudopneumoniae isolates. using this method, s. pneumoniae and s. pseudopneumoniae dna could be detected in the respiratory samples from which they were isolated and in an additional 11 samples from which only other streptococci were isolated.

TI  == accuracy of using the lyta gene to distinguish streptococcus pneumoniae from related species.
AB  == the need for a microbial identification of streptococcus pneumoniae independent of culture methods has resulted in the introduction of other laboratory principles. the verification of a proper and exclusive gene for the detection of  the pneumococcus by nucleic acid-based tests is, however, still unresolved. a previously published lyta-gene-specific real-time pcr method was applied to a panel of bacterial strains to clarify the analytical sensitivity and specificity  of a pcr assay targeting this gene. furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis of published lyta gene sequences was performed to look at gene sequence differences  and the theoretical match with the primers and probes. the lyta-gene-specific pcr detected 46/46 s. pneumoniae isolates. all 49 of the non-pneumococcal isolates tested negative, including 22 isolates from the mitis group streptococci. phylogenetic analysis of 94 sequences of the lyta gene from different strains of  s. pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae showed that 70/87 s. pneumoniae sequences constituted one cluster and a further six sequences were outside but adjacent to this cluster, all with a complete match with primers and probes. the remaining 11 s. pneumoniae strains could be placed in a different cluster, which also contained the five s. mitis and two s. pseudopneumoniae strains. all strains had no match with primers and probes. the s. pneumoniae strains in the second cluster were all characterized by being bile-insoluble, an  infrequent pneumococcal phenotype. routine laboratories can utilize the additional observation that pneumococci that were negative by the specific pcr also carried the phenotype of bile insolubility, thereby observing the incidence  of false-negative results produced by the pcr assay. the real-time pcr targeting  the lyta gene thus constitutes a sensitive and specific assay that distinguishes  s. pneumoniae from its close relatives in the mitis group.

TI  == rapid identification of noncapsulated streptococcus pneumoniae in nasopharyngeal  samples allowing detection of co-colonization and reevaluation of prevalence.
AB  == noncapsulated pneumococci are atypical streptococcus pneumoniae that lack a capsule and therefore do not react with any available antisera. these isolates, which are often referred as nontypeable pneumococci (ntpn), are difficult to identify as their differentiation from closely related species such as streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and other streptococcus of the mitis group is not  always straightforward. we developed a low-cost and easy assay to detect and quantify ntpn in primary samples (which may contain multiple species) obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs. the strategy is based on a multiplex polymerase chain  reaction targeting lyta, cpsa, alib-like orf2, and 16s rdna genes, plus a restriction fragment length polymorphism assay to differentiate typical from atypical lyta. the application of the proposed methodology to over 500 nasopharyngeal samples found that the prevalence of ntpn in colonization was 3-fold higher than that estimated by routine methods (from 2.9% to 8.6% in the study collection). the international clone norway(nt)st344 was the major clone identified.

AB  == accurate species-level identification of viridans group streptococci (vgs) is very important for understanding of their pathogenicity and virulence. however, an extremely high level of the similarity between vgs, especially streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, often results in misidentification of these organisms, so there is an urgent need of novel approaches to species identification. a set of 50 randomly selected clinical isolates of alpha-hemolytic streptococci from upper respiratory tract were characterized by the routine phenotypic methods (alpha-hemolysis, colony morphology, gram stain and optochin susceptibility). modern proteomic and genetic approaches - the direct bacterial profiling (dbp) by means of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) technique and multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) scheme (http://viridans.emlsa.net/) - were applied for the accurate species identification. after that all isolates were stored at -70 degrees c. later they  were re-inoculated, and a number of additional tests (bile solubility, latex agglutination by commercial "slidex(r) pneumo-kit" and repeated optochin test) were performed. a considerable discrepancy was discovered in the results of the different approaches. looking in the future, one could say that mlsa-like schemes based on the analysis of the nucleotide sequences of seven or more loci of the bacterial genome, appeared to be the most useful instrument in the vgs discrimination, in contrast to the numerous one-target identification schemes, which have been introduced into practice by now.

TI  == development of amperometric magnetogenosensors coupled to asymmetric pcr for the  specific detection of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a disposable magnetogenosensor for the rapid, specific and sensitive detection of streptococcus pneumoniae is reported. the developed procedure involves the use of streptavidin-modified magnetic beads, a specific biotinylated capture probe that  hybridizes with a specific region of lyta, the gene encoding the pneumococcal major autolysin, and appropriate primers for asymmetric polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification. capture probes and amplicons specific for s. pneumoniae were selected by a careful analysis of all lyta alleles available. the selected primers amplify a 235-bp fragment of pneumococcal lyta. a detection limit (lod) of 5.1 nm was obtained for a 20-mer synthetic target dna without any amplification protocol, while the lod for the asymmetric pcr amplicon was 1.1 nm. a rsd value of 6.9% was obtained for measurements carried out with seven different genosensors for 1.1-nm apcr product. the strict specificity of the designed primers was demonstrated by apcr amplification of genomic dna prepared from different bacteria, including some closely related streptococci. direct asymmetric pcr (dapcr), using cells directly from broth cultures of s. pneumoniae, showed that dapcr products could be prepared with as few as 2 colony-forming units (cfu). furthermore, this methodology did not show any cross-reaction with closely related streptococci such as streptococcus mitis (or  streptococcus pseudopneumoniae) even when present in the culture at concentrations up to 10(5) times higher than that of s. pneumoniae. preliminary data for rapid detection of pneumococcus directly in clinical samples has shown that it is possible to discriminate between non-inoculated blood and urine samples and samples inoculated with only 10(3) cfu ml(-1) s. pneumoniae.

TI  == reca-based pcr assay for accurate differentiation of streptococcus pneumoniae from other viridans streptococci.
AB  == proper identification of streptococcus pneumoniae by conventional methods remains problematic. the discriminatory power of the 16s rrna gene, which can be considered the "gold standard" for molecular identification, is too low to differentiate s. pneumoniae from closely related species such as streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis in the routine clinical laboratory. a 313-bp part of reca was selected on the basis of variability within the s. mitis group, showing <95.8% interspecies homology. in addition, 6 signature nucleotides specific for s. pneumoniae were identified within the 313-bp reca fragment. we show that reca analysis is a useful tool for  proper identification to species level within the s. mitis group, in particular,  for pneumococci.

TI  == real-time pcr assays for the detection and quantification of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is the main etiologic agent of pneumonia worldwide. because the members of the viridans group streptococci share a high degree of dna sequence homologies, phenotypic and genotypic discriminations of s. pneumoniae from the viridans group are difficult. a quantitative real-time pcr assay targeting the capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis gene (cpsa) was developed as a species-specific detection tool for s. pneumoniae. the specificity was evaluated  using genomic dnas extracted from 135 oral cocci strains. twenty-seven s. pneumoniae strains tested positive, whereas 108 other strains including streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis did not show a specific signal. the linear regression of standard curves indicated high correlations between the log numbers of s. pneumoniae cells and the c(t) values (r(2)=0.99). the minimal limit of detection was 32 fg of purified genomic  dna, equivalent to 14 genomes of s. pneumoniae. this new real-time pcr method may be very useful as a rapid and specific tool for detecting and quantifying s. pneumoniae.

TI  == detection of large numbers of pneumococcal virulence genes in streptococci of the mitis group.
AB  == seven streptococcal isolates from the mitis group were analyzed for the presence  of pneumococcal gene homologues by comparative genomic hybridization studies with microarrays based on open reading frames from the genomes of streptococcus pneumoniae tigr4 and r6. the diversity of pneumolysin (ply) and neuraminidase a (nana) gene sequences was explored in more detail in a collection of 14 s. pseudopneumoniae and 29 mitis group isolates, respectively. the mitis group isolates used in the microarray experiments included a type strain (nctc 12261),  two s. mitis isolates from the nasopharynxes of children, one s. mitis isolate from a case of infective endocarditis, one s. mitis isolate from a dental abscess, and one s. oralis isolate and one s. pseudopneumoniae isolate from the nasopharynxes of children. the results of the microarray study showed that the 5  s. mitis isolates had homologues to between 67 and 82% of pneumococcal virulence  genes, s. oralis hybridized to 83% of pneumococcal virulence genes, and s. pseudopneumoniae hybridized to 92% of identified pneumococcal virulence genes. comparison of the pneumolysin, mitilysin (mly), and newly identified pseudopneumolysin (pply) gene sequences revealed that mly and pply genes are more closely related to each other than either is to ply. in contrast, the nana gene sequences in the pneumococcus and streptococci from the mitis group are closely clustered together, sharing 99.4 to 99.7% sequence identity with pneumococcal nana alleles.

TI  == phenotypic and genomic characterization of pneumococcus-like streptococci isolated from hiv-seropositive patients.
AB  == accurate differentiation between pneumococci and other viridans streptococci is essential given their differences in clinical significance. however, classical phenotypic tests are often inconclusive, and many examples of atypical reactions  have been reported. in this study, we applied various phenotypic and genotypic methods to discriminate between a collection of 12 streptococci isolated from the upper respiratory tract of hiv-seropositive individuals in 1998 and 1999. conventional phenotypic characterization initially classified these streptococci  as streptococcus pneumoniae, as they were all sensitive to optochin and were all  bile soluble. however, they did not agglutinate with anti-pneumococcal capsular antibodies and were also far more resistant to antimicrobial agents than typeable pneumococci isolated in the same period. genotypic characterization of these isolates and control isolates by both multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) and comparative genomic hybridization (cgh) showed that only a single isolate was genetically considered to be a true s. pneumoniae isolate, and that the remaining 11 non-typable isolates were indeed distinct from true pneumococci. of these, 10  most closely resembled a subgroup of streptococcus mitis isolates genetically, while one strain was identified as a streptococcus pseudopneumoniae isolate. cgh  also showed that a considerable part of the proposed pneumococcal core genome, including many of the known pneumococcal virulence factors, was conserved in the  non-typable isolates. sequencing of part of the 16s rrna gene and investigation for the presence of ply by pcr corroborated these results. in conclusion, our findings confirm the close relationship between streptococci of the mitis group,  and show that both mlsa and cgh enable pneumococci to be distinguished from other mitis group streptococci.

TI  == highly penicillin-resistant multidrug-resistant pneumococcus-like strains colonizing children in oeiras, portugal: genomic characteristics and implications for surveillance.
AB  == while performing surveillance studies in oeiras, portugal, designed to describe the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on colonization, we observed an increase from 0.7% in 2003 to 5% in 2006 in the prevalence of penicillin resistance (mic of 2 to 6 mg/liter) among presumptively identified pneumococcal isolates. although 15 of the 22 penicillin-resistant isolates obtained in 2006 were optochin resistant, they were bile soluble and thus considered to be bona fide pneumococci. this study aimed to clarify the nature of these isolates by using a combination of phenotypic and genotypic approaches that included routine  strategies for pneumococcal identification, multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa),  and comparative genomic hybridization (cgh). by mlsa, all isolates were classified as "streptococci of the mitis group" that, however, were distinct from typical streptococcus pneumoniae or streptococcus mitis. a single isolate was identified as streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. cgh confirmed these findings and further indicated that a considerable part of the proposed pneumococcal core genome is conserved in these isolates, including several pneumococcal virulence genes (e.g., pava, spxb, cbpe, and cbpd). these results suggest that among pneumococci and closely related streptococci, universal unique phenotypic and genetic properties that could aid species identification are virtually impossible to define. in pneumococcal colonization studies, when atypical strains are found, mlsa and cgh are informative tools that can be used to complement routine tests.  in our study, after correct identification of the penicillin-resistant true pneumococci, we found that penicillin resistance levels among pneumococci remained stable from 2003 to 2006.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == population structure of streptococcus oralis.
AB  == streptococcus oralis is a member of the normal human oral microbiota, capable of  opportunistic pathogenicity; like related oral streptococci, it exhibits appreciable phenotypic and genetic variation. a multilocus sequence typing (mlst) scheme for s. oralis was developed and the resultant data analysed to examine the population structure of the species. analysis of 113 isolates, confirmed as belonging to the s. oralis/mitis group by 16s rrna gene sequencing, characterized the population as highly diverse and undergoing inter- and intra-species recombination with a probable clonal complex structure. clonalframe analysis of these s. oralis isolates along with examples of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae grouped the named species  into distinct, coherent populations and did not support the clustering of s. pseudopneumoniae with s. mitis as reported previously using distance-based methods. analysis of the individual loci suggested that this discrepancy was due  to the possible hybrid nature of s. pseudopneumoniae. the data are available on the public mlst website (http://pubmlst.org/soralis/).

TI  == differentiation of streptococcus pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus [pnc]) is a causative agent of many infectious diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis. there have been documented conjunctivitis outbreaks in which nontypeable (nt), nonencapsulated pnc has been identified as the etiological agent. the use of mass spectrometry to comparatively and differentially analyze protein and peptide profiles of whole-cell microorganisms remains somewhat uncharted. in this report, we discuss a comparative proteomic analysis between nt s. pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak strains (cpnc) and other known typeable or  nt pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates (including pnc tigr4 and r6, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes) and nonstreptococcal isolates (including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus) as controls. cpnc cells and controls were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and subsequently treated with a 10% trifluoroacetic acid-sinapinic acid matrix mixture. protein and peptide fragments of the whole-cell bacterial isolate-matrix combinations ranging in size from 2 to 14 kda were evaluated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. additionally random forest analytical tools and dendrogramic representations (genesis) suggested similarities and clustered the isolates into distinct clonal groups, respectively. also, a peak list of protein and peptide masses was obtained and compared to a known pnc protein mass library, in which a peptide common and unique to cpnc isolates was tentatively identified. information gained from this  study will lead to the identification and validation of proteins that are commonly and exclusively expressed in cpnc strains which could potentially be used as a biomarker in the rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal conjunctivitis.

TI  == evolution of streptococcus pneumoniae and its close commensal relatives.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the mitis group of streptococci which, according to 16s rrna-sequence based phylogenetic reconstruction, includes 12 species. while other species of this group are considered prototypes of commensal bacteria, s. pneumoniae is among the most frequent microbial killers worldwide. population genetic analysis of 118 strains, supported by demonstration of a distinct cell wall carbohydrate structure and competence pheromone sequence signature, shows that s. pneumoniae is one of several hundred evolutionary lineages forming a cluster separate from streptococcus oralis and streptococcus infantis. the remaining lineages of this distinct cluster are commensals previously collectively referred to as streptococcus mitis and each represent separate species by traditional taxonomic standard. virulence genes including the operon for capsule polysaccharide synthesis and genes encoding iga1 protease, pneumolysin, and autolysin were randomly distributed among s. mitis lineages. estimates of the evolutionary age of the lineages, the identical location of remnants of virulence genes in the genomes of commensal strains, the pattern of genome reductions, and the proportion of unique genes and their origin support the model that the entire cluster of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, and s. mitis lineages evolved from pneumococcus-like bacteria presumably pathogenic to the common immediate ancestor of hominoids. during their adaptation to a commensal life style, most of the lineages gradually lost the majority of genes determining virulence and became genetically distinct due to sexual isolation in  their respective hosts.

TI  == characterization of a streptococcal cholesterol-dependent cytolysin with a lewis  y and b specific lectin domain.
AB  == the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) are a large family of pore-forming toxins that often exhibit distinct structural changes that modify their pore-forming activity. a soluble platelet aggregation factor from streptococcus mitis (sm-hpaf) was characterized and shown to be a functional cdc with an amino-terminal fucose-binding lectin domain. sm-hpaf, or lectinolysin (lly) as renamed herein, is most closely related to cdcs from streptococcus intermedius (ily) and streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumolysin or ply). the lly gene was identified in strains of s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. lly induces pore-dependent changes in the light scattering properties of the platelets that mimic those induced by platelet aggregation but  does not induce platelet aggregation. lly monomers form the typical large homooligomeric membrane pore complex observed for the cdcs. the pore-forming activity of lly on platelets is modulated by the amino-terminal lectin domain, a  structure that is not present in other cdcs. glycan microarray analysis showed the lectin domain is specific for difucosylated glycans within lewis b (le (b)) and lewis y (le (y)) antigens. the glycan-binding site is occluded in the soluble monomer of lly but is apparently exposed after cell binding, since it significantly increases lly pore-forming activity in a glycan-dependent manner. hence, lly represents a new class of cdc whose pore-forming mechanism is modulated by a glycan-binding domain.

TI  == molecular characterization of disease-associated streptococci of the mitis group  that are optochin susceptible.
AB  == eight optochin-susceptible (opt(s)) alpha-hemolytic (viridans) streptococcus isolates were characterized at the molecular level. these isolates showed phenotypic characteristics typical of both viridans streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae. comparison of the sequence of housekeeping genes from these isolates with those of s. pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae suggested that the opt(s) isolates corresponded to streptococci of the mitis group. besides, the opt(s) streptococci were negative by a gen-probe accuprobe pneumococcus test and hybridized with specific pneumococcal probes (lyta and ply) but also with ant, a gene not present in most s. pneumoniae strains. moreover, the isolates were insoluble in 1% sodium deoxycholate but completely dissolved in 0.1% deoxycholate. sequence analysis of  the lyta gene revealed that the opt(s) streptococci carried lyta alleles characteristic of those present in nonpneumococcal streptococci of the mitis group. the determination of the partial nucleotide sequence embracing the atp operon encoding the f(o)f(1) h(+)-atpase indicated that the optochin susceptibility of the isolates was due to the acquisition of atpc, atpa, and part of atpb from s. pneumoniae by horizontal gene transfer.

TI  == characteristic signatures of the lyta gene provide a basis for rapid and reliable diagnosis of streptococcus pneumoniae infections.
AB  == the nucleotide sequences of the lyta gene from 29 pneumococcal isolates of various serotypes and 22 additional streptococci of the mitis group (including two streptococcus pseudopneumoniae strains) have been compared and found to correspond to 19 typical (927-bp-long) and 20 atypical (921-bp-long) alleles. all the streptococcus pneumoniae strains harbored typical lyta alleles, whereas nonpneumococcal isolates belonging to the mitis group always carried atypical alleles. a sequence alignment showed that the main difference between typical and atypical lyta alleles resided in 102 nucleotide positions (including the 6 bp absent from atypical alleles). these nucleotides were perfectly conserved in all  the typical alleles studied, and the corresponding nucleotides of the atypical alleles were also perfectly conserved. the presence in these signatures of distinctive restriction sites (namely, snabi, xmni, and bsaai) allowed the development of a simple, reliable, and fast method that combines pcr amplification of the lyta gene, digestion with bsaai, and separation of the products by agarose gel electrophoresis. this assay allows the rapid and consistent identification of true s. pneumoniae strains and represents an improved diagnostic tool for the study of pneumococcal carriage.

TI  == accuracy of phenotypic and genotypic testing for identification of streptococcus  pneumoniae and description of streptococcus pseudopneumoniae sp. nov.
AB  == we have identified an unusual group of viridans group streptococci that resemble  streptococcus pneumoniae. dna-dna homology studies suggested that a subset of these isolates represent a novel species that may be included in the s. oralis-s. mitis group of viridans group streptococci. we suggest that this novel species be termed streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. a combination of phenotypic and genetic reactions allows its identification. s. pseudopneumoniae strains do not have pneumococcal capsules, are resistant to optochin (inhibition zones, less than 14  mm) when they are incubated under an atmosphere of increased co2 but are susceptible to optochin (inhibition zones, >14 mm) when they are incubated in ambient atmospheres, are not soluble in bile, and are positive by the genprobe accuprobe pneumococcus test. the bile solubility test is more specific than the optochin test for identification of s. pneumoniae. genetic tests for pneumolysin  (ply) and manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (soda) and identification tests with a commercial probe, accuprobe pneumococcus, do not discriminate between the new species and s. pneumoniae.
