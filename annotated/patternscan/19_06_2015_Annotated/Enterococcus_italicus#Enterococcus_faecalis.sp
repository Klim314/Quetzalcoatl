TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (lab) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in  the vlasic mountain region of central bosnia and herzegovina near the town of travnik over a four season period. these three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-pcr with a (gtg)5 primer and 16s rdna sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 lab isolates obtained from all the examined samples. fifteen species were identified  as follows: lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus garviae, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus helveticus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus italicus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus mitis. a wide genotypic and  phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the lc. lactis strains. in all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the  total lab isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from sour congee in inner mongolia of china.
AB  == sour congee is a popular food in the western regions of inner mongolia in china.  it has a complex microbial population, which contributes to its unique flavor and functional properties. in this study, we chose 28 sour congee samples that were collected from different areas in inner mongolia for analysis of the microbial community of lactic acid bacteria (lab) by classical biochemical tests, 16s rrna  gene sequencing, multiplex pcr assay of reca gene and restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis of the tuf gene (encoding elongation factor tu). the results revealed that all the isolates were identified as lactobacillus (l.) paracasei (38 strains), l. fermentum (28 strains), l. plantarum (7 strains), l. brevis (4 strains), l. reuteri (2 strains), l. amylolyticus (1 strain), enterococcus (e.) faecalis (3 strains), e. italicus (2 strains) or lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (1 strain). the predominant lab were l. casei and l. fermentum in sour congee samples. the diversity of lab derived from sour congee could offer useful information for further research on sour congee, and the results demonstrated that the combination of tuf gene and rflp patterns can be considered as a useful tool for differentiation of the l. casei group.

TI  == potential application of the nisin z preparation of lactococcus lactis w8 in preservation of milk.
AB  == aims: the aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the preparation of nisin z from lactococcus lactis w8-fermented milk in controlling the growth of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized milk. methods and results: spoilage bacteria isolated from pasteurized milk at 8 and 15 degrees c were identified as enterococcus italicus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus thuringiensis, bacillus cereus, lactobacillus paracasei, acinetobacter sp., pseudomonas fluorescens and enterobacter aerogenes. these bacteria were found to  have the ability to survive pasteurization temperature. except enterobacter aerogenes, the spoilage bacteria were sensitive to the nisin z preparation of the l. lactis w8. addition of the nisin z preparation to either the skim milk or fat  milk inoculated with each of the spoilage bacteria reduced the initial counts (about 5 log cfu ml(-)(1)) to an undetectable level within 8-20 h. the nisin z preparation extended the shelf life of milk to 2 months under refrigeration. conclusions: the nisin z preparation from l. lactis w8-fermented milk was found to be effective as a backup preservative to counteract postpasteurization contamination in milk. significance and impact of the study: a rapid inhibition of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized skim and fat milk with the nisin z preparation of l. lactis w8 is more significant in comparison with the commercially available nisin (nisin a). the nisin z preparation can be used instead of commercial nisin, which is not effective in fat milk.

TI  == molecular basis and transferability of tetracycline resistance in enterococcus italicus lmg 22195 from fermented milk.
AB  == a tetracycline-resistant enterococcus italicus strain from fermented milk, lmg 22195, was found to contain a tet(s) gene located on a plasmid of approximately 20kb. filter mating demonstrated that the tet(s) gene was transferable from lmg 22195 to the recipient enterococcus faecalis jh2-2. pcr-based detection and southern blot experiments revealed that the confirmed transconjugants acquired the tet(s)-carrying plasmid. similar to the donor strain, transconjugants displayed a tetracycline mic of 64 microg/ml. results of this study suggest that  e. italicus, like other enterococcal species, is able to disseminate antibiotic-resistance genes, although a more definitive proof on this statement will be provided when a higher number of strains will be tested. because of the recent isolation of e. italicus from human clinical specimens and its concomitant presence in various dairy products, the ability of this organism to horizontally  transfer tet(s) or other resistance genes may potentially pose safety concerns, especially for its possible use in food fermentations.

TI  == evaluation of plasmid content and tetracycline resistance conjugative transfer in enterococcus italicus strains of dairy origin.
AB  == five enterococcus italicus strains harbouring tet genes responsible for the tetracycline resistance were subjected to plasmid profile determination studies.  for four strains tested the profiles showed between three and six plasmid bands,  the size of which ranged between 1.6 and 18.5 kb. southern hybridization experiments associated tets and tetk genes with chromosomal dna in all strains and tetm gene with plasmids of around the same size (18.5 kb) in two of the tested strains. the ability of the new species to transfer tetm gene was studied  by transfer experiments with the tetracycline-susceptible recipient strains e. faecalis jh2-2 and og1rf; mobilization experiments were performed with e. faecalis jh 2-2 harbouring the conjugative plasmid pip501as helper plasmid. the results obtained show that the new enterococcal species was able to acquire antibiotic resistance by conjugation, but not to transfer its plasmids to other bacteria. further pcr and hybridization experiments carried out to assess the presence of mobilization sequences also suggest that the tetm plasmid from e. italicus is a non-mobilizable plasmid.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococcus species isolated from slovak bryndza cheese.
AB  == three hundred and ten enterococcal isolates (178 enterococcus faecium, 68 e. durans, 49 e. faecalis, 8 e. italicus, 3 e. gallinarum, 3 e. casseliflavus, and 1 e. hirae) from slovak bryndza cheese were evaluated for susceptibility to nine antimicrobial agents (vancomycin, teicoplanin, ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, erythromycin, rifampicin, nitrofurantoin, and ciprofloxacin). all enterococcal isolates from bryndza cheese were susceptible to ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin as determined by the disk diffusion method. vancomycin resistance genes vana and vanb were not detected. resistance rates of enterococcal isolates to rifampicin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin were 24, 26, 2, and 1 %, respectively. thirty-six % of e. faecium isolates and 22 % of the e. faecalis isolates were resistant to erythromycin. resistance to rifampicin was similar in e. faecium (31 %) and e. faecalis (29 %). both e. faecium and e. faecalis strains showed the same resistance to ciprofloxacin (2 %). e. durans isolates showed low levels of resistance to rifampicin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin (1-4 %). forty-eight (30 %) of the e. faecium isolates, two (3 %) of the e. durans isolates, and six (12 %) of the e. faecalis isolates exhibited multidrug resistance. the highest frequency of resistant enterococci was observed in bryndza produced in winter season.

TI  == molecular identification and diversity of enterococci isolated from slovak bryndza cheese.
AB  == three hundred and eight presumed enterococcal isolates were recovered from bryndza, a soft sheep milk cheese. the cheese samples were obtained from five different commercial distributors in slovakia and were taken at three different seasonal intervals. all isolates were identified to the species level using genotypic tools. species-specific pcr using ddl genes highlighted the predominance of enterococcus faecium (176 isolates) and assigned 50 isolates to the species enterococcus faecalis. the remaining 82 isolates were classified using repetitive element sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with primer (gtg)(5)-(gtg)(5)-pcr, in combination with phenylalanyl-trna synthase gene (phes) sequence analysis and by whole-cell protein analysis (sds-page). these strains were identified as enterococcus durans (59 strains), enterococcus italicus (8 strains), enterococcus casseliflavus (3 strains), enterococcus gallinarum (3 strains), enterococcus hirae (1 strain), and 8 strains were members of the species lactococcus lactis. of the seven enterococcal species isolated, three of them, e. durans, e. faecalis and e. faecium were present in all samples  studied, with e. faecium as the predominant one. the precise identification of enterococci in bryndza cheese is an essential step in the process of evaluation of their functional properties which will be further studied and assessed.
