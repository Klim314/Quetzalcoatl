TI  == utilization of a continuous streptococcal surface to measure interbacterial adherence in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == cell-to-cell interactions are essential for the formation of dental plaque. a continuous layer of streptococcus sanguis sa-1 cells fixed to a solid surface has been used to evaluate interactions among this bacterium, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and streptococcus sobrinus. s. sanguis cells were attached to a falcon 3001 tissue culture plates or bovine enamel chips, coated with a biological adhesive. scanning electron microscopy of the chips showed the streptococci as a contiguous surface. radiolabeled bacteria were used to measure  a second-species interbacterial adherence to the streptococcal-coated culture plates. strains of h. parainfluenzae known to coaggregate (strain hp-28) and not  to coaggregate (strains hp-42 and hp-80), in suspension with s. sanguis strain sa-1, were studied for adherence. ten-fold-higher numbers of coaggregating strain hp-28 adhered in vitro to the streptococcal layer than did the non-coaggregating  strains. s. sobrinus strain 6715 did not show appreciable adherence to the s. sanguis surface. saliva did not affect the adherence of coaggregating or non-coaggregating h. parainfluenzae strains to s. sanguis strain sa-1. bovine enamel chips, coated with streptococci, mounted on modified orthodontic appliances and placed in the mouths of three volunteers, facilitated the measurement of interbacterial adherence in vivo of streptomycin-resistant strains of h. parainfluenzae (hp-28r or hp-42r). suspensions of bacteria were placed into the mouth, distributed throughout, and expectorated. after 15 or 120 minutes, the appliance with the chips was removed, the chips sonified, and colony-forming units (cfu) of streptomycin-resistant haemophili determined per chip.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
