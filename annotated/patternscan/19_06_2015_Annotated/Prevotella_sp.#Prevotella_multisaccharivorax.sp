TI  == extensive description and comparison of human supra-gingival microbiome in root caries and health.
AB  == knowledge of the polymicrobial etiology of root caries is limited. to conduct a comprehensive research study on root caries, we utilized 454-pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene libraries and quantitative pcr to compare supra-gingival bacterial  communities from healthy sites and carious sites of 21 patients with root caries  (patient-controls and patient-cases) and the sites of 21 healthy individuals (healthy-controls) from two nursing homes. healthy-controls and patient-cases showed no significant differences in terms of biomass, species richness, and species diversity. however, as for beta diversity based on either community membership metric (unweighted unifrac) or community structure metric (weighted unifrac), healthy-controls and patient-cases were clearly distinguished from each other, appearing more variable in the community membership and structure in root  caries microbiome but relatively conserved in the health microbiome. the patient-controls group was at an intermediate stage between healthy-controls and  patient-cases, but was more inclined to the former. demonstrated in both relative abundance and prevalence of species in health and root caries, propionibacterium  acidifaciens, streptococcus mutans, olsenella profusa, prevotella multisaccharivorax, and lactobacillus crispatus were found to be most associated  with root caries, whereas delftia acidovorans, bacteroidetes[g-2] sp., lachnospiraceae[g-3] sp., and prevotella intermedia are most associated with health. our study provides a basis for further elucidating the microbial etiology of root caries in the elderly.

TI  == bacterial profiles of root caries in elderly patients.
AB  == culture-based studies have shown that streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli are associated with root caries (rc). the purpose of the present study was to assess  the bacterial diversity of rc in elderly patients by use of culture-independent molecular techniques and to determine the associations of specific bacterial species or bacterial communities with healthy and carious roots. plaque was collected from root surfaces of 10 control subjects with no rc and from 11 subjects with rc. the bacterial 16s rrna genes from extracted dna were pcr amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identity. from a total of 3,544 clones, 245 predominant species or phylotypes were observed, representing eight bacterial phyla. the majority (54%) of the species detected have not yet been cultivated. species of selenomonas and veillonella were common in all samples. the healthy microbiota included fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, leptotrichia spp., selenomonas noxia, streptococcus cristatus, and kingella oralis. lactobacilli were absent, s. mutans was present in one, and actinomyces spp. were present in 50% of the controls. in contrast, the microbiota of the rc subjects was dominated by actinomyces spp., lactobacilli, s. mutans, enterococcus faecalis, selenomonas sp. clone cs002, atopobium and olsenella spp., prevotella multisaccharivorax, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and propionibacterium sp. strain fma5. the bacterial profiles of rc showed considerable subject-to-subject variation, indicating that the microbial communities are more complex than previously presumed. the data suggest that putative etiological agents of rc include not only s. mutans, lactobacilli, and actinomyces but also species of atopobium, olsenella, pseudoramibacter, propionibacterium, and selenomonas.

TI  == prevotella multisaccharivorax sp. nov., isolated from human subgingival plaque.
AB  == six bacterial strains isolated from the human oral cavity, pppa16, pppa20(t), pppa24, pppa31, eppa6 and eppa7, were characterized by determining phenotypic and biochemical features, cellular fatty acid profiles, menaquinone profiles and phylogenetic position based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that the isolates represented the same species of the genus prevotella. the strains were related to prevotella dentalis with about 89%  similarity. in addition, the isolates were related to prevotella sp. oral clone idr-cec-0032, which is a representative of the numerically dominant cluster vi in carious dentine lesions [nadkarni et al. (2004). j clin microbiol 42, 5238-5244], with about 99% similarity. the strains were obligately anaerobic, non-pigmenting, non-spore-forming, non-motile, gram-negative rods. the isolates could be differentiated from other prevotella species by d-mannitol, d-melezitose, d-sorbitol and d-trehalose fermentation in api 20a tests. the cellular fatty acid composition of strains pppa16, pppa20(t), pppa24, pppa31, eppa6 and eppa7 was significantly different from that of other prevotella species. compared with other prevotella species, only these six strains contained dimethyl acetals. the  major menaquinones of the clinical isolates were mk-12 and mk-13, whereas the major menaquinones of other prevotella species were mk-10 and mk-11. on the basis of these data, a novel prevotella species, prevotella multisaccharivorax sp. nov., is proposed, with pppa20(t) (=jcm 12954(t)=dsm 17128(t)) as the type strain.
