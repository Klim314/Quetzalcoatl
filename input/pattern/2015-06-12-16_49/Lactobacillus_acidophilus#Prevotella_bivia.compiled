TI  - Novel vaginal microflora colonization model providing new insight into microbicide mechanism of action.
AB  - Several broad-spectrum microbicides, including cellulose sulfate (CS), have passed conventional preclinical and phase I clinical safety evaluation and yet have failed to protect women from acquiring HIV-1 in phase II/III trials. Concerns have been raised that current preclinical algorithms are deficient in addressing the complexity of the microflora-regulated vaginal mucosal barrier. We applied a novel microflora-colonized model to evaluate CS and hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC), which is used as a "universal placebo" in microbicide trials. Cervicovaginal epithelial cultures were colonized with normal vaginal microflora isolates representing common Lactobacillus species used as probiotics (L. acidophilus and L. crispatus) or Prevotella bivia and Atopobium vaginae, most prevalent in the disturbed microflora of bacterial vaginosis (BV). At baseline, all strains maintained constant epithelium-associated CFUs without inducing cytotoxicity and apoptosis. CS selectively reduced epithelium-associated CFUs and (to a lesser extent) planktonic CFUs, most significantly affecting L. crispatus. Inducing only minor changes in sterile epithelial cultures, CS induced expression of innate immunity mediators (RANTES, interleukin-8 [IL-8], and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor [SLPI]) in microflora-colonized epithelia, most significantly potentiating effects of bacteria causing BV. In the absence of CS, all bacterial strains except L. acidophilus activated NF-kappaB, although IL-8 and RANTES levels were increased by the presence of BV-causing bacteria only. CS enhanced NF-kappaB activation in a dose-dependent manner under all conditions, including L. acidophilus colonization. HEC remained inert. These results offer insights into possible mechanisms of CS clinical failure. The bacterially colonized cervicovaginal model reveals unique aspects of microflora-epithelium-drug interactions and innate immunity in the female genital tract and should become an integral part of preclinical safety evaluation of anti-HIV microbicides and other vaginal formulations. IMPORTANCE: This report provides experimental evidence supporting the concept that the vaginal microflora regulates the epithelial innate immunity in a species- and strain-specific manner and that topically applied microbicides may alter both the bacterial and epithelial components of this homeostatic interaction. Our data also highlight the importance of differentiating the effects of biomedical interventions on epithelium-associated versus conventional planktonic bacterial growth when assessing vaginal mucosal health and immunity.
TI  - Suppression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication in macrophages by  commensal bacteria preferentially stimulating Toll-like receptor 4.
AB  - Protection from primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection has not yet been accomplished by vaccines inducing HIV-1-specific acquired immunity. Nevertheless, it has been reported that a small subgroup of women remain resistant to HIV-1 infection under natural conditions. If similar conditions can be induced in uninfected individuals, it will contribute the first line of protection against HIV-1 infection, and also improve the effects of anti-HIV-1 vaccines. We reasoned that innate immunity may be involved in the resistance to HIV-1 infection, and investigated the effects of various Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and commensal bacteria on HIV-1 replication in macrophages, one of the initial targets of HIV-1 infection and also the main mediators of innate immunity. We established the HIV-1 reporter monocytic cell line, THP-1/NL4-3luc, which could be differentiated into macrophage-like cells in vitro. In these cells, stimulation of TLR3 and TLR4 by their ligands suppressed HIV-1 expression partly through type I interferon (IFN). Among the commensal bacteria tested, Escherichia coli, Veillonella parvula and Neisseria mucosa suppressed HIV-1 expression, whereas Lactobacillus acidophilus, Prevotella melaninogenica, P. bivia and Mycobacterium smegmatis enhanced it. The bacteria with suppressive effects preferentially stimulated TLR4, whereas the ones with enhancing effects stimulated TLR2. Neutralizing antibodies against TLR4 and IFN-alpha/beta receptor abrogated bacterially mediated HIV-1 suppression. Suppressive effects of E. coli, V. parvula and N. mucosa on HIV-1 replication were reproducible in primary monocyte-derived macrophages following acute HIV-1 infection. These findings suggest that certain commensal bacteria preferentially stimulating TLR4 potentially produce local environments resistant to HIV-1 infection.
TI  - Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginal microbiota of healthy women inhibit Prevotella bivia and Gardnerella vaginalis in coculture and cell culture.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate how human vaginal isolates of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus crispatus inhibit the vaginosis-associated pathogens Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella bivia. Results show that all the strains in coculture condition reduced the viability of G. vaginalis and P. bivia, but with differing degrees of efficacy. The treatment of G. vaginalis- and P. bivia-infected cultured human cervix epithelial HeLa cells with L. gasseri strain KS120.1 culture or cell-free culture supernatant (CFCS) results in the killing of the pathogens that are adhering to the cells. The mechanism of the killing activity is not attributable to low pH and the presence of lactic acid alone, but rather to the presence of hydrogen peroxide and proteolytic enzyme-resistant compound(s) present in the CFCSs. In addition, coculture of G. vaginalis or P. bivia with L. gasseri KS120.1 culture or KS120.1 bacteria results in inhibition of the adhesion of the pathogens onto HeLa cells.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of fifth-generation dentin bonding systems.
AB  - Past concepts that the pulp does not become infected until an actual carious exposure takes place have been challenged. The antibacterial effects of the dentin bonding systems Single Bond, Prime&Bond NT, and Excite were evaluated using the bacteria Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus intermedius, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Prevotella oris, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Clostridium ramosum with a disk diffusion method. Chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. After incubation zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. Prime&Bond NT showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus mutans were remarkably resistant to Single Bond, whereas EX produced no inhibitory effect on Porphyromonas endodontalis, although the adhesive produced the maximum halo inhibition to Streptococcus mutans (15+/-1 mm), showing an antibacterial effect closest to chlorhexidine. The variety of results obtained in this study suggest that antibacterial properties of current dentin adhesives may depend on components that are originally incorporated to promote adhesion.
TI  - [The range of antagonistic effects of Lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, Bacteroides spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. On the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus, most frequently L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the same environment. The diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. Thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this ecosystem. The aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. It was found that nearly all of the tested Lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against Gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit Gram-positive aerobic cocci as Enterococcus faecalis or Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Induction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 expression by anaerobes associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common disorder characterized by increased levels of anaerobic bacteria in the genital tract. BV has been associated with an increased rate of sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The effects of BV-associated anaerobic bacteria on HIV expression in monocytoid cells and T cells were examined. Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus and Prevotella bivia stimulated HIV expression in monocytoid cells, whereas Bacteroides ureolyticus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Lactobacillus acidophilus did not enhance HIV expression. P. asaccharolyticus also enhanced HIV expression in T cells and activated HIV long-terminal-repeat transcription in U38 cells. This report suggests a mechanism by which disturbances in vaginal flora could lead to a higher rate of sexual transmission of HIV. Furthermore, this study supports the idea that treatment of BV might serve as a preventive measure to reduce the risk of HIV transmission.
TI  - Effect of Candida albicans infection and clotrimazole treatment on vaginal microflora in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of Candida albicans infection and clotrimazole treatment on vaginal microflora. METHODS: Studies were conducted using a model simulating the healthy vaginal ecosystem. The model consisted of a mixed culture of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Prevotella bivia, and group D Streptococcus sp grown in continuous culture in a chemically defined medium. The status of the model was assessed using a mathematical equation that determines the probability a microflora is normal or abnormal. RESULTS: Challenge of the model with C albicans was followed within 24 hours by the development of microbial populations representing an abnormal microflora. Treatment of the system with clotrimazole (100 micrograms/mL) resulted in a decrease in C albicans counts to 0 within 48 hours. However, treatment also altered other components of the vaginal microflora, which did not return to normal. Addition of clotrimazole (100 micrograms/mL) to the system in the absence of C albicans also resulted in an abnormal model by 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Candida albicans infection of the vaginal ecosystem, as represented by this in vitro model, has a deleterious effect on members of the normal microflora. Clotrimazole, although effective against C albicans infection, also has a deleterious effect on components of the normal vaginal microflora. One of the implications for women using clotrimazole for microbiologically undocumented vaginal yeast infections is an increased risk of infection or disease through the disruption of the protective microflora barrier.
