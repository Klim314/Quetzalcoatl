intraoral dissemination of treponemes after periodontal therapy.
oral treponemes are related to chronic periodontitis, but the effect of periodontal therapy on the majority of treponemal species is unknown. the aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the dynamics in prevalence profiles of treponemes in different habitats of the oral cavity. thirty-five patients with chronic periodontitis were randomly assigned to mechanical debridement alone (control group) or systemic amoxicillin/metronidazole plus chlorhexidine (test group). subgingival and mucous membrane plaque samples were taken at baseline, after 10 days, and during supportive periodontal therapy at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months. t. denticola, t. lecithinolyticum, t. maltophilum, t. socranskii, t. vincentii, and treponemal phylotypes i-vii were detected using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and dot blot analysis. for the majority of the assessed treponemes, a significant intragroup increase in prevalence in the different habitats ( p<0.05) occurred over the study course but, compared to debridement alone, adjunctive antimicrobial therapy resulted in a nonsignificant trend toward lower prevalence in the subgingival habitat. in no case were treponemes eradicated from the oral cavity. after both therapies, possibly new infection with and/or dissemination of treponema ssp. occurred, which led to treponemes recovering in different habitats and to increased intraoral prevalence. the prescribed adjunctive antimicrobial therapy may limit this increase in the subgingival region.
identification of a treponema denticola oppa homologue that binds host proteins present in the subgingival environment.
proteins secreted or exported by treponema denticola have been implicated as mediators of specific interactions between the spirochete and subgingival tissues in periodontal diseases. however, limited information is available on the ability of this peptidolytic organism to bind or transport soluble peptides present in the subgingival environment. a prominent 70-kda protein was isolated from surface extracts of t. denticola atcc 35405. a clone expressing a portion of the protein was identified in an escherichia coli expression library of t. denticola dna. dna sequence analysis showed that the cloned gene encoded a peptide homologous to oppa, the solute binding protein of an atp-binding cassette-type peptide transporter involved in peptide uptake and environmental signaling in a wide range of bacteria. genes encoding oppb, -c, -d, and -f were identified directly downstream of oppa in t. denticola. oppa was present in representative strains of t. denticola and in treponema vincentii but was not detected in treponema pectinovorum or treponema socranskii. immunogold electron microscopy suggested that oppa was accessible to proteins at the surface of the spirochete. native oppa bound soluble plasminogen and fibronectin but did not bind to immobilized substrates or epithelial cells. a t. denticola oppa mutant bound reduced amounts of soluble plasminogen, and plasminogen binding to the parent strain was inhibited by the lysine analog epsilon-aminocaproic acid. binding of soluble host proteins by oppa may be important both for spirochete-host interactions in the subgingival environment and for uptake of peptide nutrients.
intergeneric coaggregation of oral treponema spp. with fusobacterium spp. and intrageneric coaggregation among fusobacterium spp.
a total of 22 strains of treponema spp. including members of all four named human oral species were tested for coaggregation with 7 strains of oral fusobacteria, 2 strains of nonoral fusobacteria, and 45 strains of other oral bacteria, which included actinobacilli, actinomyces, capnocytophagae, eubacteria, porphyromonads, prevotellae, selenomonads, streptococci, and veillonellae. none of the treponemes coaggregated with any of the latter 45 oral strains or with the two nonoral fusobacteria. all treponemes, eight treponema denticola strains, eight t. socranskii strains, four oral pectinolytic treponemes, one t. pectinovorum strain, and one t. vincentii strain coaggregated with at least one strain of the fusobacteria tested as partners. the partners consisted of one strain of fusobacterium periodonticum, five f. nucleatum strains including all four subspecies of f. nucleatum, and a strain of f. simiae obtained from the dental plaque of a monkey. in the more than 100 coaggregations observed, the fusobacterial partner was heat inactivated (85 degrees c for 30 min), while the treponemes were unaffected by the heat treatment. furthermore, the fusobacteria were usually inactivated by proteinase k treatment, and the treponemes were not affected. only the t. denticola coaggregations were inhibited by lactose and d-galactosamine. none were inhibited by any of 23 other different sugars or l-arginine. intragenic coaggregations were seen among the subspecies of f. nucleatum and with f. periodonticum, and none were inhibited by any of the sugars tested or by l-arginine. no intrageneric coaggregations were observed among the treponemes. these data indicate that the human oral treponemes show a specificity for oral fusobacteria as coaggregation partners. such cell-to cell contact may facilitate efficient metabolic communication and enhance the proliferation of each cell in the progressively more severe stages of periodontal disease.
coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola.
to elucidate an ecological profile of several periodontopathogens, the authors examined the coaggregation between cells of porphyromonas gingivalis and oral bacterial strains including treponema denticola in vitro. coaggregation between cells of plaque bacteria was examined by visual assay and phase-contrast microscope. p. gingivalis cells coaggregated with strains of t. denticola and treponema socranskii subspecies socranskii, but did not coaggregate with t. socranskii subspecies buccale, t. socranskii subspecies paredis, treponema vincentii, or treponema pectinovorum. the extracted hemagglutinin from p. gingivalis was active agglutinating t. denticola cells. addition of serum and saliva somewhat affected the coaggregation, but no effects of tested sugars or amino acids were found. heat treatment of t. denticola cells did not reduce the coagregation: heat treatment of p. gingivalis cells eliminated it. growth inhibitory activity among these bacterial species was examined by the stab culture method. strains of t. denticola atcc 35404 and 35405 and t. vincentii inhibited the growth of some p. gingivalis strains, but not others. no strain of treponema was inhibited by black-pigmented anaerobic rods. the coaggregation observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola indicates the potential importance of their simultaneous existence in human periodontal pockets and development of the disease.
[chemical composition and biological activities of lipopolysaccharides extracted  from treponema denticola and treponema vincentii].
lipopolysaccharides (lpss) were isolated from treponema denticola (t. denticola)  and treponema vincentii (t. vincentii) by the phenol/water (pw) and the phenol/chloroform/petroleum-ether (pcp) procedures. 1) t. denticola pw-lps (lps isolated by the pw procedure), pcp-sup-lps (lps isolated by the pcp procedure in the supernates of ultracentrifugation), pcp-ppt-lps (precipitated lps isolated by the pcp procedure, obtained after ultracentrifugation), and t. vincentii pcp-ppt-lps were composed of carbohydrate, hexosamine, protein, fatty acid, and phosphorus. t. vincentii pw-lps was contained major amount of carbohydrates and small amount of fatty acids. 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonic acid (kdd) was not detected in these lpss. 2) the major fatty acids of t. denticola pw-lps and pcp-sup-lps were palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acids. the major fatty acids of t. vincentii pcp-ppt-lps were palmitic, stearic, myristic, oleic, and linoleic acids. hydroxy fatty acids were not detected. 3) glucose, galactose, and mannose were comprised in t. denticola pw-lps. glucose, galactose, and arabinose were comprised in t. denticola pcp-sup-lps. glucose and galactose were comprised in t. vincentii pcp-ppt-lps. 4) the limulus amoebocyte lysate (lal) clotting activity of t. denticola pw-lps was 1/10, as compared with that of escherichia coli (e. coli) ukt-b lps standard. the lal clotting activities of t. denticola pcp-sup-lps, t. vincentii pw-lps, and t. vincentii pcp-ppt-lps were 1/100, as compared with that of e. coli lps standard. 5) five hundred micrograms/kg of t. denticola pcp-sup-lps was pyrogenic in rabbits. two thousand micrograms/kg of t. vincentii pcp-ppt-lps was pyrogenic in rabbits. 6) t. denticola pcp-sup-lps and t. vincentii pcp-ppt-lps were capable of increasing or decreasing the release of lysosomal enzymes from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
adherence of oral treponemes and their effect on morphological damage and detachment of epithelial cells in vitro.
the present study shows adherence of treponema denticola l12d and treponema vincentii ritza to guinea pig ear epithelial cells in vitro. the number of adhering organisms was positively related with the treponemal concentration and contact time. incubation of washed t. denticola l12d and t. vincentii ritza organisms or their culture supernatants with the epithelial cells induced morphological damage and detachment of these cells. in addition, indications for inhibition of epithelial cell proliferation were found. the activity of the supernatants was dose dependent, heat sensitive, and sensitive to sulfhydryl-containing components, suggesting the presence of enzymatic activity that might be of importance in the pathogenicity of these oral treponemes.
suppression of fibroblast proliferation by oral spirochetes.
soluble sonic extracts of several strains of treponema denticola and treponema vincentii were examined for their abilities to alter proliferation of both murine and human fibroblasts. we found that sonic extracts of all tested strains of t. denticola caused a dose-dependent inhibition of murine and human fibroblast proliferation when assessed by both dna synthesis ([3h]thymidine incorporation) and direct cell counts. t. vincentii had only a minimal inhibitory effect at comparable doses. no inhibition was observed when sonic extracts were added simultaneously with [3h]thymidine, indicating that suppression was not due to the presence of excessive amounts of cold thymidine in the extract, nonspecific effects on thymidine utilization by the cells (transport and incorporation), or degradation of label. rna ([3h]uridine incorporation) and protein ([3h]leucine incorporation) synthesis were similarly altered after exposure to the t. denticola sonic extracts. there was no effect on cell viability as measured by trypan blue exclusion. inhibition could be reversed by extensive washing of the cells within the first few hours of exposure to sonic extracts. preliminary characterization and purification indicated that the inhibitory factor(s) is not endotoxin since it is heat labile, and elutes in a single, well-defined peak on a sephadex g-150 chromatography column corresponding to a molecular weight of approximately 50,000. since oral spirochetes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontal disorders, it is possible that they contribute to the disease process by inhibition of fibroblast growth and therefore may, at least in part, account for the loss of collagen seen in diseased tissue.
suppression of human lymphocyte responses by oral spirochetes: a monocyte-dependent phenomenon.
spirochetes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several human infections  including syphilis, yaws, lyme disease, and periodontal diseases. we examined soluble sonic extracts of oral spirochetes (treponema denticola and t. vincentii) for their ability to alter human lymphocyte function. these organisms were isolated from subgingival plaque of patients with periodontitis. we found that sonicates of several but not all strains of t. denticola caused a dose-dependent inhibition of human lymphocyte responsiveness to con a, pha, pwm, and the recall antigen sksd. suppression involved alterations in dna, rna, and protein synthesis; there was no effect on cell viability. in contrast, sonicates of t. vincentii (medium-sized spirochetes) had no demonstrable effects on lymphocyte activation. the suppressive factor derived from t. denticola is heat-labile with a m.w. of approximately 100,000. to achieve maximal suppression, sonicates had to be added during the first 24 hr of incubation; there was no inhibition observed when added at 48 or 72 hr (along with 3h-tdr). suppression was dependent on the presence of adherent monocytes; removal of these cells prevented spirochete-induced suppression of lymphocyte proliferation. furthermore, the combination of indomethacin and catalase were able to reverse (or prevent) the inhibitory effects of the spirochete extracts, demonstrating a requirement for both prostaglandins and hydrogen peroxide. the potential role of such suppressive factors in periodontal disease is discussed.
further evidence for hyaluronidase activity of treponema pallidum.
the presence of hyaluronidase in preparations of treponema pallidum was previously shown using acidified bovine serum albumin reactions and ouchterlony immunodiffusion. to expand on these preliminary findings more sensitive techniques of viscometry, additional immunologic reactions, and altered capillary permeability were used to characterize treponemal-associated hyaluronidase. the pathogens t. pallidum and t. pertenue degraded hyaluronic acid, whereas the nonpathogens t. denticola and t. vincentii did not. as syphilitic infection progressed, hyaluronidase activity decreased; organisms harvested from 14-day testicular infections degraded hyaluronic acid less rapidly than organisms from 4-day infections. uninfected rabbit testicular extract also exhibited significant enzyme activity. the neutralizing activity of immune sera was decreased by prior adsorption with bovine hyaluronidase, suggesting that some of the neutralizing factors are associated with this enzyme. radioimmunoassay was used to quantitate antibodies to hyaluronidase in immune sera. antihyaluronidase sera were isolated from rabbits immunized with bovine hyaluronidase. treponema pallidum, as well as uninfected rabbit testicular extract, cross-reacted with these antisera. immunofluorescence indicated that the hyaluronidase was uniformly distributed along the treponemal surface. as a final indicator of hyaluronidase activity, alterations in capillary permeability were detected 1 h after intradermal injection of t. pallidum.
