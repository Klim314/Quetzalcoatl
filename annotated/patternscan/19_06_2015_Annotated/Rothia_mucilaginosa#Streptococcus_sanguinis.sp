TI  == salivary microbiota and metabolome associated with celiac disease.
AB  == this study aimed to investigate the salivary microbiota and metabolome of 13 children with celiac disease (cd) under a gluten-free diet (treated celiac disease [t-cd]). the same number of healthy children (hc) was used as controls. the salivary microbiota was analyzed by an integrated approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods. metabolome analysis was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction. compared to  hc, the number of some cultivable bacterial groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (p < 0.05) differed in the saliva samples of the t-cd children. as  shown by community-level catabolic profiles, the highest shannon's diversity and  substrate richness were found in hc. pyrosequencing data showed the highest richness estimator and diversity index values for hc. levels of lachnospiraceae,  gemellaceae, and streptococcus sanguinis were highest for the t-cd children. streptococcus thermophilus levels were markedly decreased in t-cd children. the saliva of t-cd children showed the largest amount of bacteroidetes (e.g., porphyromonas sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, and prevotella nanceiensis), together with the smallest amount of actinobacteria. t-cd children were also characterized by decreased levels of some actinomyces species, atopobium species, and corynebacterium durum. rothia mucilaginosa was the only actinobacteria species found at the highest level in t-cd children. as shown by multivariate statistical analyses, the levels of organic volatile compounds markedly differentiated t-cd children. some compounds (e.g., ethyl-acetate, nonanal, and 2-hexanone) were found to be associated with t-cd children. correlations (false discovery rate [fdr], <0.05) were found between the relative abundances of bacteria and some volatile organic compounds (vocs). the findings of this study indicated that cd is associated with oral dysbiosis that could affect the oral metabolome.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.
