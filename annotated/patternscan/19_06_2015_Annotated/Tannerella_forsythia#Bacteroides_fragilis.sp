TI  == structural and functional characterization of nanu, a novel high-affinity sialic  acid-inducible binding protein of oral and gut-dwelling bacteroidetes species.
AB  == many human-dwelling bacteria acquire sialic acid for growth or surface display. we identified previously a sialic acid utilization operon in tannerella forsythia that includes a novel outer membrane sialic acid-transport system (nanou), where  nano (neuraminate outer membrane permease) is a putative tonb-dependent receptor  and nanu (extracellular neuraminate uptake protein) is a predicted susd family protein. using heterologous complementation of nanou genes into an escherichia coli strain devoid of outer membrane sialic acid permeases, we show that the nanou system from the gut bacterium bacteroides fragilis is functional and demonstrate its dependence on tonb for function. we also show that nanu is required for maximal function of the transport system and that it is expressed in a sialic acid-responsive manner. we also show its cellular localization to the outer membrane using fractionation and immunofluorescence experiments. ligand-binding studies revealed high-affinity binding of sialic acid to nanu (kd  ~400 nm) from two bacteroidetes species as well as binding of a range of sialic acid analogues. determination of the crystal structure of nanu revealed a monomeric susd-like structure containing a novel motif characterized by an extended kinked helix that might determine sugar-binding specificity. the results of the present study characterize the first bacterial extracellular sialic acid-binding protein and define a sialic acid-specific pul (polysaccharide utilization locus).

TI  == "cross-glycosylation" of proteins in bacteroidales species.
AB  == while it is now evident that the two bacteroidales species bacteroides fragilis and tannerella forsythia both have general o-glycosylation systems and share a common glycosylation sequon, the ability of these organisms to glycosylate a protein native to the other organism has not yet been demonstrated. here, we report on the glycosylation of heterologous proteins between these two organisms. using genetic tools previously developed for bacteroides species, two b. fragilis model glycoproteins were expressed in the fastidious anaerobe t. forsythia and the attachment of the known t. forsythia o-glycan to these proteins was demonstrated by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. likewise, two predominant t. forsythia glycoproteins were expressed in b. fragilis and glycosylation with the b. fragilis o-glycan was confirmed. purification of these proteins from b. fragilis allowed the preliminary characterization of the previously uncharacterized b. fragilis protein o-glycan.  based on mass spectrometric data, we show that the b. fragilis protein o-glycan is an oligosaccharide composed of nine sugar units. compositional and structural  similarities with the t. forsythia o-glycan suggest commonalities in their biosynthesis. these data demonstrate the feasibility of exploiting these organisms for the design of novel glycoproteins.

TI  == an orthologue of bacteroides fragilis nanh is the principal sialidase in tannerella forsythia.
AB  == sialidase activity is a putative virulence factor of the anaerobic periodontal pathogen tannerella forsythia, but it is uncertain which genes encode this activity. characterization of a putative sialidase, siahi, by others, indicated that this protein alone may not be responsible for all of the sialidase activity. we describe a second sialidase in t. forsythia (tf0035), an orthologue of bacteroides fragilis nanh, and its expression in escherichia coli. sialidase activity of the expressed nanh was confirmed by using 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-d-n-acetylneuraminic acid as a substrate. biochemical characterization of the recombinant t. forsythia nanh indicated that  it was active over a broad ph range, with optimum activity at ph 5.5. this enzyme has high affinity for 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-d-n-acetylneuraminic acid (k(m) of 32.9 +/- 10.3 microm) and rapidly releases 4-methylumbelliferone (v(max) of 170.8 +/- 11.8 nmol of 4-methylumbelliferone min(-1) mg of protein(-1)). e. coli lysates containing recombinant t. forsythia nanh cleave sialic acid from a range of substrates, with a preference for alpha2-3 glycosidic linkages. the genes adjacent to nanh encode proteins apparently involved in the metabolism of sialic acid, indicating that the nanh sialidase is likely to be involved in nutrient acquisition.

TI  == phase-variable expression of a family of glycoproteins imparts a dynamic surface  to a symbiont in its human intestinal ecosystem.
AB  == the recent report of the synthesis of glycoproteins by the abundant intestinal symbionts bacteroides showed that these organisms use a novel bacterial enzyme to decorate their surfaces with a sugar residue derived from their environment. as a first step in understanding the importance of these glycoproteins to the bacteria and to the bacterial-host symbiosis, we identified and characterized the abundant glycoproteins of bacteroides distasonis (proposed reclassification as parabacteroides distasonis) [sakamoto m, benno y (2006) int j syst evol microbiol 56:1599-1605]. using lectin-affinity purification followed by tandem mass spectrometry, we identified a family of at least nine glycoproteins, similar only to the s-layer glycoproteins of tannerella forsythia. analysis of one of these purified glycoproteins demonstrated that the glycan is primarily a polymer of xylose, a monosaccharide rarely found in bacterial glycans. even more unexpected  was the finding that seven of nine of the glycoprotein promoters undergo dna inversion, a process that we show is active in their endogenous human environment. using cross-species functional assays, we show that a single serine  family site-specific recombinase globally mediates the inversions of these glycoprotein promoters. this regulatory mechanism is similar to that of the bacteroides fragilis capsular polysaccharides and establishes dna inversion as a  general and ancient means of regulation of glycan-containing surface molecules of these important human intestinal symbionts.
