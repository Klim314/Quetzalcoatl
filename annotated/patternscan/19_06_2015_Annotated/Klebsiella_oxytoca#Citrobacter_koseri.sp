TI  == supporting the ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam enterobacteriaceae breakpoint determination using humanised in vivo exposures in a thigh model.
AB  == previous in vivo studies using a human-simulated regimen of ceftaroline/avibactam 600/600mg every 8h (q8h) showed activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-, ampc- and kpc-producing enterobacteriaceae with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) </= 1 mug/ml. here we sought to determine the efficacy of this human-simulated regimen against organisms with mics >/= 1 mug/ml to help determine a breakpoint value that would reliability predict efficacy in humans. in total, 31 isolates (1 escherichia coli, 9 klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 enterobacter cloacae, 1 citrobacter koseri, 2 serratia marcescens, 1 klebsiella oxytoca and 8 pseudomonas aeruginosa) with ceftaroline/avibactam mics of 1 to 16  mug/ml were tested in a murine immunocompromised thigh infection model; 15 isolates were also tested in an immunocompetent model. doses were given to simulate human free drug exposures of ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam 600/600 mg q8h over 24h as a 1-h infusion by targeting the ft>mic profile. efficacy was evaluated as the change in log10 cfu compared with 0-h controls after 24h. reductions in bacterial cfu in the neutropenic model were seen against a majority of isolates tested with mics </= 4 mug/ml, where ft>mic was >55%. more variable efficacy was seen in isolates with mics >/= 8 mug/ml, where ft>mic drops below 40%. overall activity was enhanced in the immunocompetent model. the humanised regimen of ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam 600/600 mg q8h as a 1-h infusion showed  predictable efficacy against isolates with various genotypic and phenotypic profiles and mics </= 4 mug/ml. these data provide valuable information to help determine a ceftaroline/avibactam breakpoint for enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == evaluation of the betalacta test, a rapid test detecting resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in clinical strains of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == for decades, third-generation cephalosporins (3gc) have been major drugs used to  treat infections due to enterobacteriaceae; growing resistance to these antibiotics makes the rapid detection of such resistance important. the betalacta test is a chromogenic test developed for detecting 3gc-resistant isolates from cultures on solid media within 15 min. a multicenter prospective study conducted  in 5 french and belgian hospitals evaluated the performance of this test on clinical isolates. based on antibiotic susceptibility testing, strains resistant  or intermediate to cefotaxime or ceftazidime were classified as 3gc resistant, and molecular characterization of this resistance was performed. the rates of 3gc resistance were 13.9% (332/2,387) globally, 9.4% in escherichia coli (132/1,403), 25.6% in klebsiella pneumoniae (84/328), 30.3% in species naturally producing inducible ampc beta-lactamases (109/360), and 5.6% in klebsiella oxytoca and citrobacter koseri (7/124). the sensitivities and specificities of the betalacta  test were, respectively, 87.7% and 99.6% overall, 96% and 100% for e. coli and k. pneumoniae, and 67.4% and 99.6% for species naturally producing inducible ampc beta-lactamase. false-negative results were mainly related to 3gc-resistant strains producing ampc beta-lactamase. interestingly, the test was positive for all 3gc-resistant extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolates (n = 241).  the positive predictive value was 97% and remained at >/=96% for prevalences of 3gc resistance ranging between 10 and 30%. the negative predictive values were 99% for e. coli and k. pneumoniae and 89% for the species producing inducible ampc beta-lactamase. in conclusion, the betalacta test was found to be easy to use and efficient for the prediction of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, particularly in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains.

TI  == identification of enterobacteriaceae by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using the vitek ms system.
AB  == this multicenter study evaluated the accuracy of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry identifications from the vitek ms system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) for enterobacteriaceae typically encountered in the clinical laboratory. enterobacteriaceae isolates (n = 965) representing 17 genera and 40 species were  analyzed on the vitek ms system (database v2.0), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. colony growth (</=72 h) was applied directly to the  target slide. matrix solution (alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) was added and  allowed to dry before mass spectrometry analysis. on the basis of the confidence  level, the vitek ms system provided a species, genus only, or no identification for each isolate. the accuracy of the mass spectrometric identification was compared to 16s rrna gene sequencing performed at midi labs (newark, de). supplemental phenotypic testing was performed at biomerieux when necessary. the vitek ms result agreed with the reference method identification for 96.7% of the  965 isolates tested, with 83.8% correct to the species level and 12.8% limited to a genus-level identification. there was no identification for 1.7% of the isolates. the vitek ms system misidentified 7 isolates (0.7 %) as different genera. three pantoea agglomerans isolates were misidentified as enterobacter spp. and single isolates of enterobacter cancerogenus, escherichia hermannii, hafnia alvei, and raoultella ornithinolytica were misidentified as klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter koseri, obesumbacterium proteus, and enterobacter aerogenes, respectively. eight isolates (0.8 %) were misidentified as a different species in the correct genus. the vitek ms system provides reliable mass spectrometric identifications for enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == intestinal enterobacteriaceae and escherichia coli populations in japanese adults demonstrated by the reverse transcription-quantitative pcr and the clone library  analyses.
AB  == a primer set specific for escherichia coli/shigella 16s rrna was developed and used for rt-qpcr analysis of fecal samples from 35 healthy adult volunteers in combination with the previously reported primer set specific for enterobacteriaceae. enterobacteriaceae and e. coli were present in the 29 out of  35 volunteers tested as intestinal commensals at the average population levels of 10(7.1+/-0.9) and 10(6.8+/-0.7)cellsg(-1) of stools (mean+/-standard deviation),  respectively. among the 7 volunteers, the significant deviation between the count of enterobacteriaceae and that of e. coli was observed, suggesting non-e. coli/shigella species were predominant in their enterobacteriaceae populations. the clone library analysis revealed that the non-e. coli/shigella populations included citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae/variicola and morganella morganii. these data suggested that the rt-qpcr method with the primer sets specific to both enterobacteriaceae and e. coli/shigella enabled the accurate enumeration of  intestinal e. coli populations and the other enterobacteriaceae species populations.

TI  == characterization of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in enterobacteriaceae clinical strains and characterization of the plasmids implicated in their diffusion.
AB  == a total of 788 clinical enterobacteriaceae were collected to describe the aminoglycoside-modifying genes (ame genes) and to characterize the plasmids that  carry these genes. among the 788 strains collected, 330 (41.8%) were aminoglycoside-resistant: 264 escherichia coli (80%), 33 proteus mirabilis (10%), 10 klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), six k. oxytoca (1.8%), five enterobacter cloacae (1.5%), three morganella morganii (0.9%), three providencia stuartii (0.9%), two  salmonella enterica (0.6%), and one each citrobacter freundii, c. koseri, proteus vulgaris, and shigella sonnei. the most affected aminoglycoside was streptomycin  (92.7%), followed by kanamycin (26.3%), gentamicin (18%), tobramycin (16.9%), netilmicin (3.6%), and amikacin (1.5%). the ame genes found were aph(3'')-ib (65.4%), ant(3'')-ia (37.5%), aph(3')-ia (13.9%), aac(3)-iia (12.4%), aac(6')-ib  (4.2%), ant(2'')-ia (3.6%), and aph(3')-iia (1.2%). thirty-four percent of the strains showed more than one enzyme. the most frequent association was ant(3'')-ia plus aph(3'')-ib (35 strains). from 66 selected ame genes, 24 were plasmid located: 12 aac(3)-iia, six aph(3')-ia, three ant(3'')-ia, two ant(2'')-ia, and one aac(6')-ib. these genes were located in plasmids belonging to incompatibility groups f, fia, fib, or hi2. in conclusion, the ame genes involved in aminoglycoside-clinical resistance were aac(3)-iia, aac(6')-ib, and ant(2'')-ia, genes that confer resistance to tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin.

TI  == molecular analysis of type 3 fimbrial genes from escherichia coli, klebsiella and citrobacter species.
AB  == background: catheter-associated urinary tract infection (cauti) is the most common nosocomial infection in the united states and is caused by a range of uropathogens. biofilm formation by uropathogens that cause cauti is often mediated by cell surface structures such as fimbriae. in this study, we characterised the genes encoding type 3 fimbriae from cauti strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter koseri and citrobacter freundii. results: phylogenetic analysis of the type 3 fimbrial genes (mrkabcd) from 39 strains revealed they clustered into five distinct clades (a-e) ranging from one to twenty-three members. the majority of sequences grouped in clade a, which was represented by the mrk gene cluster from the genome sequenced k. pneumoniae mgh78578. the e. coli and k. pneumoniae mrkabcd gene sequences clustered together in two distinct clades, supporting previous evidence for the occurrence of inter-genera lateral gene transfer. all of the strains examined caused type 3 fimbriae mediated agglutination of tannic acid treated human erythrocytes despite sequence variation in the mrkd-encoding adhesin gene.  type 3 fimbriae deletion mutants were constructed in 13 representative strains and were used to demonstrate a direct role for type 3 fimbriae in biofilm formation. conclusions: the expression of functional type 3 fimbriae is common to many gram-negative pathogens that cause cauti and is strongly associated with biofilm growth. our data provides additional evidence for the spread of type 3 fimbrial genes by lateral gene transfer. further work is now required to substantiate the clade structure reported here by examining more strains as well  as other bacterial genera that make type 3 fimbriae and cause cauti.

TI  == [infectious complications of surgically treatment pelvic fractures].
AB  == based on case histories, the authors draw attention to important infectious complications in patients surgically treated for pelvic injuries. these complications were recorded in four out of 75 patients (5.3%) undergoing surgery  for pelvic fracture in the period from 2001 to 2005. the chief risk factors for the development of infection included the poor state of health of a polytraumatized patient in combination with a long stay in an acute care unit, and severe trauma and bleeding of soft tissue structures in b and c types of pelvic injury. bacteriological findings showed the presence of several pathogenic species (enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter koseri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella oxytoca) or multi-resistant bacteria (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus).

TI  == identification of type 3 fimbriae in uropathogenic escherichia coli reveals a role in biofilm formation.
AB  == catheter-associated urinary tract infection (cauti) is the most common nosocomial infection in the united states. uropathogenic escherichia coli (upec), the most common cause of cauti, can form biofilms on indwelling catheters. here, we identify and characterize novel factors that affect biofilm formation by upec strains that cause cauti. sixty-five cauti upec isolates were characterized for phenotypic markers of urovirulence, including agglutination and biofilm formation. one isolate, e. coli ms2027, was uniquely proficient at biofilm growth despite the absence of adhesins known to promote this phenotype. mini-tn5 mutagenesis of e. coli ms2027 identified several mutants with altered biofilm growth. mutants containing insertions in genes involved in o antigen synthesis (rmlc and manb) and capsule synthesis (kpsm) possessed enhanced biofilm phenotypes. three independent mutants deficient in biofilm growth contained an insertion in a gene locus homologous to the type 3 chaperone-usher class fimbrial genes of klebsiella pneumoniae. these type 3 fimbrial genes (mrkabcdf), which were located on a conjugative plasmid, were cloned from e. coli ms2027 and could  complement the biofilm-deficient transconjugants when reintroduced on a plasmid.  primers targeting the mrkb chaperone-encoding gene revealed its presence in cauti strains of citrobacter koseri, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca. all of these mrkb-positive strains caused type 3 fimbria-specific agglutination of tannic acid-treated red blood cells. this is the first description of type 3 fimbriae in e. coli, c. koseri, and c. freundii.  our data suggest that type 3 fimbriae may contribute to biofilm formation by different gram-negative nosocomial pathogens.

TI  == dry stress and survival time of enterobacter sakazakii and other enterobacteriaceae in dehydrated powdered infant formula.
AB  == powdered infant formula is not a sterile product, and opportunistic pathogens could multiply in the reconstituted product, resulting in neonatal infections. in this study, the generation of sublethally injured enterobacteriaceae during desiccation and their persistence in dehydrated powdered infant formula was assessed during a 2.5-year period. the study included 27 strains of enterobacter  sakazakii, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella enteritidis, citrobacter koseri, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, escherichia vulneris, pantoea spp., klebsiella oxytoca, and klebsiella pneumoniae. the number of sublethally injured  cells generated during desiccation was lower for k. oxytoca, pantoea spp., salmonella enteritidis, and capsulated strains of e. sakazakii than for the other enterobacteriaceae. the enterobacteriaceae could be divided into three groups with respect to their long-term survival in the desiccated state. c. freundii, c. koseri, and e. cloacae were no longer recoverable after 6 months, and salmonella  enteritidis, k. pneumoniae, and e. coli could not be recovered after 15 months. pantoea spp., k. oxytoca, and e. vulneris persisted over 2 years, and some capsulated strains of e. sakazakii were still recoverable after 2.5 years.

TI  == regional variation in the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing clinical isolates in the asia-pacific region (sentry 1998-2002).
AB  == we examined the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter koseri, and salmonella spp. that were isolated as part of  the sentry asia-pacific surveillance program between 1998 and 2002. during the study period, a total of 6,388 strains were gathered from 17 medical centers in 7 countries and examined for esbl production and hyperproduction of k. oxytoca chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase enzyme. high rates of confirmed esbl-producing isolates were found in k. pneumoniae strains from singapore (35.6%), followed by  those from mainland china (30.7%), south africa (28.1%), and the philippines (21.9%), whereas the rates were less than 10% in japan and australia. esbl-producing e. coli strains were also prominent in mainland china (24.5%), hong kong (14.3%), and singapore (11.3%). esbl-producing k. oxytoca were common in the philippines (38.5%), singapore (33.3%), and china (30.0%). hyperproduction of k. oxytoca chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase enzyme was common in australia and japan. p. mirabilis strains from singapore produced esbl (17.9%) despite the low  prevalence (0-8.1%) in other countries. few esbl-producing c. koseri and salmonella spp. strains were found in japan, singapore, taiwan, and south africa. although there was variation among countries in substrate preference, ceftazidime was more likely to detect presumptive esbl phenotype in k. pneumoniae and aztreonam more likely in e. coli, whereas ceftriaxone was the best substrate for  the confirmation of esbl production. esbl-producing strains showed high levels of co-resistance to aminoglycosides, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin. imipenem retained activity against all esbl-producing strains. organisms expressing esbls are widely distributed in the asia-pacific region, although prevalence rates vary significantly.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == indole can act as an extracellular signal to regulate biofilm formation of escherichia coli and other indole-producing bacteria.
AB  == we demonstrated previously that genetic inactivation of tryptophanase is responsible for a dramatic decrease in biofilm formation in the laboratory strain escherichia coli s17-1. in the present study, we tested whether the biochemical inhibition of tryptophanase, with the competitive inhibitor oxindolyl-l-alanine,  could affect polystyrene colonization by e. coli and other indole-producing bacteria. oxindolyl-l-alanine inhibits, in a dose-dependent manner, indole production and biofilm formation by strain s17-1 grown in luria-bertani (lb) medium. supplementation with indole at physiologically relevant concentrations restores biofilm formation by strain s17-1 in the presence of oxindolyl-l-alanine and by mutant strain e. coli 3714 (s17-1 tnaa::tn5) in lb medium. oxindolyl-l-alanine also inhibits the adherence of s17-1 cells to polystyrene for a 3-h incubation time, but mutant strain 3714 cells are unaffected. at 0.5 mg/ml, oxindolyl-l-alanine exhibits inhibitory activity against biofilm formation in lb  medium and in synthetic urine for several clinical isolates of e. coli, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter koseri, providencia stuartii, and morganella morganii but has no affect on indole-negative klebsiella pneumoniae strains. in conclusion, these data suggest that indole, produced by the action of tryptophanase, is involved in polystyrene colonization by several indole-producing bacterial species. indole may act as a signalling molecule to regulate the expression of adhesion and biofilm-promoting factors.

TI  == characterization of clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from italy by the bd  phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection method.
AB  == production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteriaceae: identification of esbls based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. the phoenix esbl test (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of esbl-producing gram-negative bacteria. an algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid,  cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical  isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus  mirabilis, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and citrobacter  koseri. of these isolates, 319 were identified as esbl producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-esbl producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. combined use of isoelectric focusing, pcr, and/or dna sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(tem-1)- and/or bla(shv-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(ctx-m) gene. among the 191 non-esbl-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an ampc-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed tem-1, tem-2, or shv-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all k. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced k1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. the phoenix esbl test system gave positive results for all the 319 esbl-producing isolates and also for two of the four k1-hyperproducing isolates of k. oxytoca. compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. these findings suggest that the phoenix esbl test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of  esbl resistance in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == betalasen: microdilution panel for identifying beta-lactamases present in isolates of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == a dried investigational use-only microdilution panel named betalasen (a short named derived from the panel's purpose, to identify beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae) containing 10 beta-lactam drugs with and without beta-lactamase inhibitors was developed to identify beta-lactamases among clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter koseri, citrobacter freundii group, enterobacter spp., and serratia marcescens. the mics obtained with a collection of 383 organisms containing well-characterized beta-lactamases were used to develop numeric codes and logic pathways for computerized analysis of results. the resultant logic pathways and betalasen panel were then used to test and identify beta-lactamases among 885 isolates of enterobacteriaceae recovered in cultures obtained at six different hospital laboratories across the united states. beta-lactamases present in 801 (90.5%) of the 885 isolates were identified by betalasen by using the existing logic pathways and codes or after minor modifications were made to the existing codes. the 84 strains that gave codes that betalasen could not identify were collected, reidentified, and retested by using betalasen. three strains had been  misidentified, 54 strains gave different codes upon repeat testing that could be  identified by betalasen, and 27 strains repeated new codes. the beta-lactamases in these strains were identified, and the new codes were added to the betalasen logic pathways. these results indicate that betalasen can identify clinically important beta-lactamases among most isolates of enterobacteriaceae. the results  also show that good quality control and attention to proper performance of the tests are essential to the correct performance of betalasen.

TI  == novel class a beta-lactamase sed-1 from citrobacter sedlakii: genetic diversity of beta-lactamases within the citrobacter genus.
AB  == citrobacter sedlakii 2596, a clinical strain resistant to aminopenicillins, carboxypenicillins, and early cephalosporins such as cephalothin, but remaining susceptible to acylureidopenicillins, carbapenems, and later cephalosporins such  as cefotaxime, was isolated from the bile of a patient treated with beta-lactam and quinolone antibiotics. the isolate produced an inducible class a beta-lactamase of pi 8.6, named sed-1, which was purified. characterized by a molecular mass of 30 kda, sed-1 preferentially hydrolyzed benzylpenicillin, cephalothin, and cloxacillin. the corresponding gene, bla(sed-1), was cloned and  sequenced. its deduced amino acid sequence shared more than 60% identity with the chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases from citrobacter koseri (formerly c. diversus) (84%), klebsiella oxytoca (74%), serratia fonticola (67%), and proteus vulgaris (63%) and 71% identity with the plasmid-mediated enzyme men-1. a gene coding for  a lysr transcriptional regulator was found upstream from bla(sed-1). this regulator, named sedr, displayed 90% identity with the ampr sequence of the chromosomal beta-lactamase from c. koseri and 63 and 50% identity with the ampr sequences of p. vulgaris and enterobacter cloacae, respectively. by using dna-dna hybridization, a bla(sed-1)-like gene was identified in two reference strains, c. sedlakii (cip-105037) and citrobacter rodentium (cip-104675), but not in the 18 strains of c. koseri studied. two dna fragments were amplified and sequenced from the reference strains of c. sedlakii cip-105037 and c. rodentium cip-104675 using two primers specific for bla(sed-1). they shared 98 and 80% identity with bla(sed-1), respectively, confirming the diversity of the chromosomally encoded class a beta-lactamases found in citrobacter.

TI  == taxonomic diversity of anaerobic glycerol dissimilation in the enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == a total of 1,123 strains representing 128 taxa in the enterobacteriaceae (named species or subspecies and genomic species) were screened for the presence of glycerol dehydrogenases and 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase. only eight taxa, citrobacter freundii sensu stricto, c. youngae, c. braakii, c. werkmanii, citrobacter genomospecies 10 and 11, enterobacter gergoviae and klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae could grow fermentatively on glycerol and possessed  both glycerol dehydrogenase type i (induced by glycerol and dihydroxyacetone) and 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase which are typical enzymes of the anaerobic glycerol dissimilation pathway. six other species, c. koseri, e. aerogenes, e. intermedium, k. oxytoca, k. planticola and k. terrigena could not grow fermentatively on glycerol and possessed a glycerol dehydrogenase type i but no 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase. other glycerol dehydrogenases types were found: type ii (induced by glycerol and hydroxyacetone), type iii (induced by glycerol only) and type iv (induced by hydroxyacetone only). they were widely distributed  among the enterobacteriaceae. classification and identification may take advantage of tests exploring the dissimilation of glycerol.

TI  == population analysis of susceptibility to cefotaxime in enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == population analysis of susceptibility to cefotaxime (ctx) in eight species of enterobacteriaceae was carried out. one strain of each species was examined. the  strains represented their individual species as regards natural susceptibility to ampicillin (a) and carbenicillin (ca). cephalothinase activity of the parental strains and strains selected on the plates with the highest concentration that allowed growth was determined by an ultraviolet assay. the populations of the a-susceptible/ca-susceptible (a-s/ca-s) species, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis were homogeneous as regards susceptibility to ctx. the a-resistant/ca-resistant (a-r/ca-r) species, klebsiella oxytoca and citrobacter koseri, were less homogeneous, but in all four mentioned species no increase in cephalothinase activity was observed between the parental strains and the strains selected in the population analysis. the four a-r/ca-s species, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii, were heterogeneous. the frequency of ctx-r mutants was approx. 10(-6.5). the ic50 for  ctx was 2(7.5)-2(8.5) times higher for the mutants than for the parental strains. the ctx resistance was maintained in subcultures of the strains. all four species had a very high increase in cephalothinase activity from parental strains to the  strains selected in the population analysis. only the enzyme of proteus vulgaris  was able to hydrolyze ctx.
