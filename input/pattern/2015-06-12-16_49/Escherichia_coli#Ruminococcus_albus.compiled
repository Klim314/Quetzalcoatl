TI  - Characterization of Ruminococcus albus cellodextrin phosphorylase and identification of a key phenylalanine residue for acceptor specificity and affinity to the phosphate group.
AB  - Ruminococcus albus has the ability to intracellularly degrade cello-oligosaccharides primarily via phosphorolysis. In this study, the enzymatic characteristics of R. albus cellodextrin phosphorylase (RaCDP), which is a member of glycoside hydrolase family 94, was investigated. RaCDP catalyzes the phosphorolysis of cellotriose through an ordered 'bi bi' mechanism in which cellotriose binds to RaCDP before inorganic phosphate, and then cellobiose and glucose 1-phosphate (Glc1P) are released in that order. Among the cello-oligosaccharides tested, RaCDP had the highest phosphorolytic and synthetic activities towards cellohexaose and cellopentaose, respectively. RaCDP successively transferred glucosyl residues from Glc1P to the growing cello-oligosaccharide chain, and insoluble cello-oligosaccharides comprising a mean of eight residues were produced. Sophorose, laminaribiose, beta-1,4-xylobiose, beta-1,4-mannobiose and cellobiitol served as acceptors for RaCDP. RaCDP had very low affinity for phosphate groups in both the phosphorolysis and synthesis directions. A sequence comparison revealed that RaCDP has Gln at position 646 where His is normally conserved in the phosphate binding sites of related enzymes. A Q646H mutant showed approximately twofold lower apparent K(m) values for inorganic phosphate and Glc1P than the wild-type. RaCDP has Phe at position 633 corresponding to Tyr and Val in the +1 subsites of cellobiose phosphorylase and N,N'-diacetylchitobiose phosphorylase, respectively. A F633Y mutant showed higher preference for cellobiose over beta-1,4-mannobiose as an acceptor substrate in the synthetic reaction than the wild-type. Furthermore, the F633Y mutant showed 75- and 1100-fold lower apparent Km values for inorganic phosphate and Glc1P, respectively, in phosphorolysis and synthesis of cellotriose.
TI  - Identification and characterization of cellobiose 2-epimerases from various aerobes.
AB  - Cellobiose 2-epimerase (CE), found mainly in anaerobes, reversibly converts D-glucose residues at the reducing end of beta-1,4-linked oligosaccharides to D-mannose residues. In this study, we characterized CE-like proteins from various aerobes (Flavobacterium johnsoniae NBRC 14942, Pedobacter heparinus NBRC 12017, Dyadobacter fermentans ATCC 700827, Herpetosiphon aurantiacus ATCC 23779, Saccharophagus degradans ATCC 43961, Spirosoma linguale ATCC 33905, and Teredinibacter turnerae ATCC 39867), because aerobes, more easily cultured on a large scale than anaerobes, are applicable in industrial processes. The recombinant CE-like proteins produced in Escherichia coli catalyzed epimerization at the C2 position of cellobiose, lactose, epilactose, and beta-1,4-mannobiose, whereas N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, N-acetyl-D-mannosamine, D-glucose, and D-mannose were inert as substrates. All the CEs, except for P. heparinus CE, the optimum pH of which was 6.3, showed highest activity at weakly alkaline pH. CEs from D. fermentans, H. aurantiacus, and S. linguale showed higher optimum temperatures and thermostability than the other enzymes analyzed. The enzymes from D. fermentans, S. linguale, and T. turnerae showed significantly high k(cat) and K(m) values towards cellobiose and lactose. Especially, T. turnerae CE showed a very high k(cat) value towards lactose, an attractive property for the industrial production of epilactose, which is carried out at high substrate concentrations.
TI  - Catalytic efficiency diversification of duplicate beta-1,3-1,4-glucanases from Neocallimastix patriciarum J11.
AB  - Four types of beta-1,3-1,4 glucanase (beta-glucanase, EC 3.2.1.73) genes, designated bglA13, bglA16, bglA51, and bglM2, were found in the cDNA library of Neocallimastix patriciarum J11. All were highly homologous with each other and demonstrated a close phylogenetic relationship with and a similar codon bias to Streptococcus equinus. The presence of expansion and several predicted secondary structures in the 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of bglA16 and bglM2 suggest that these two genes were duplicated recently, whereas bglA13 and bglA16, which contain very short 3'UTRs, were replicated earlier. These findings indicate that the beta-glucanase genes from N. patriciarum J11 may have arisen by horizontal transfer from the bacterium and subsequent duplication in the rumen fungus. beta-Glucanase genes of Streptococcus equinus, Ruminococcus albus 7, and N. patriciarum J11 were cloned and expressed by Escherichia coli. The recombinant beta-glucanases cloned from S. equinus, R. albus 7, and N. patriciarum J11 were endo-acting and had similar substrate specificity, but they demonstrated different properties in other tests. The specific activities and catalytic efficiency of the bacterial beta-glucanases were also significantly lower than those of the fungal beta-glucanases. Our results also revealed that the activities and some characteristics of enzymes were changed during the horizontal gene transfer event. The specific activities of the fungal beta-glucanases ranged from 26,529 to 41,209 U/mg of protein when barley-derived beta-glucan was used as the substrate. They also demonstrated similar pH and temperature optima, substrate specificity, substrate affinity, and hydrolysis patterns. Nevertheless, BglA16 and BglM2, two recently duplicated beta-glucanases, showed much higher k(cat) values than others. These results support the notion that duplicated beta-glucanase genes, namely, bglA16 and bglM2, increase the reaction efficiency of beta-glucanases and suggest that the catalytic efficiency of beta-glucanase is likely to be a criterion determining the evolutionary fate of duplicate forms in N. patriciarum J11.
TI  - Enzymatic characteristics of cellobiose phosphorylase from Ruminococcus albus NE1 and kinetic mechanism of unusual substrate inhibition in reverse phosphorolysis.
AB  - Cellobiose phosphorylase (CBP) catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of cellobiose to produce alpha-D-glucopyranosyl phosphate (Glc1P) and D-glucose. It is an essential enzyme for the metabolism of cello-oligosaccharides in a ruminal bacterium, Ruminococcus albus. In this study, recombinant R. albus CBP (RaCBP) produced in Escherichia coli was characterized. It showed highest activity at pH 6.2 at 50 degrees C, and was stable in a pH range of 5.5-8.8 and at below 40 degrees C. It phosphorolyzed only cellobiose efficiently, and the reaction proceeded through a random-ordered bi bi mechanism, by which inorganic phosphate and cellobiose bind in random order and D-glucose is released before Glc1P. In the synthetic reaction, RaCBP showed highest activity to D-glucose, followed by 6-deoxy-D-glucose. D-Mannose, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, D-glucosamine, D-xylose, 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol, and gentiobiose also served as acceptors, although the activities for them were much lower than for D-glucose. D-Glucose acted as a competitive-uncompetitive inhibitor of the reverse synthetic reaction, which bound not only the Glc1P site (competitive) but also the ternary enzyme-Glc1P-D-glucose complex (uncompetitive).
TI  - Functional analyses of multiple lichenin-degrading enzymes from the rumen bacterium Ruminococcus albus 8.
AB  - Ruminococcus albus 8 is a fibrolytic ruminal bacterium capable of utilization of  various plant cell wall polysaccharides. A bioinformatic analysis of a partial genome sequence of R. albus revealed several putative enzymes likely to hydrolyze glucans, including lichenin, a mixed-linkage polysaccharide of glucose linked together in beta-1,3 and beta-1,4 glycosidic bonds. In the present study, we demonstrate the capacity of four glycoside hydrolases (GHs), derived from R. albus, to hydrolyze lichenin. Two of the genes encoded GH family 5 enzymes (Ra0453 and Ra2830), one gene encoded a GH family 16 enzyme (Ra0505), and the last gene encoded a GH family 3 enzyme (Ra1595). Each gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein was purified to near homogeneity. Upon screening on a wide range of substrates, Ra0453, Ra2830, and Ra0505 displayed different hydrolytic properties, as they released unique product profiles. The Ra1595 protein, predicted to function as a beta-glucosidase, preferred cleavage of a nonreducing end glucose when linked by a beta-1,3 glycosidic bond to the next glucose residue. The major product of Ra0505 hydrolysis of lichenin was predicted to be a glucotriose that was degraded only by Ra0453 to glucose and cellobiose. Most importantly, the four enzymes functioned synergistically to hydrolyze lichenin to glucose, cellobiose, and cellotriose. This lichenin-degrading enzyme mix should be of utility as an additive to feeds administered to monogastric animals, especially those high in fiber.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a ferulic acid esterase (Fae1A) from the rumen  fungus Anaeromyces mucronatus.
AB  - AIMS: A novel ferulic acid esterase gene from rumen fungus Anaeromyces mucronatus was cloned, heteroexpressed in Escherichia coli and characterized. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 30 clones exhibiting activity on alpha-naphthyl acetate (alpha-NA) were isolated from an A. mucronatus YE505 cDNA library. Sequence analysis revealed that these clones represented two esterase-coding sequences. The gene, fae1A, showed highest amino acid sequence identity to CE family 1 esterases from anaerobic micro-organisms such as Orpinomyces sp., Ruminococcus albus and Clostridium thermocellum. The gene comprised 828 nucleotides encoding a polypeptide of 275 amino acids. The coding sequence was cloned into the pET30a expression vector and overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Gene product Fae1A was found to exhibit activity against a number of substrates including naphthyl fatty acid esters, p-nitrophenyl fatty acid esters and hydroxylcinnamic acid esters. CONCLUSIONS: Fae1A exhibited a lower K(m) and higher catalytic efficiency (k(cat) /K(m) ) on ferulic acid esters than on alpha-NA or p-nitrophenyl acetate, suggesting that it has a higher affinity for ethyl and methyl ferulate than for the acetyl esters. It releases ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid from barley straw. Activity of Fae1A was inhibited by the serine-specific protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, indicating that a serine residue plays a role in its activity. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: To our knowledge, this is the first report of characterization of carbohydrate esterase gene from the genus of Anaeromyces.
TI  - Dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  RNA probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and Crohn's disease (CD) patients. METHODS: Oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "GoArray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16S rRNA sequences. Fecal 16S rDNA from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six CD patients were used as template to generate fluorescently labeled cRNA that was hybridized to the microarray. Differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with species-specific primer sets. RESULTS: The microarray analyses showed that Eubacterium rectale, Bacteroides fragilis group, B. vulgatus, Ruminococcus albus, R. callidus, R. bromii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the CD patients, while Enterococcus sp., Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and Listeria sp. were more abundant in the CD group. CONCLUSIONS: The microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum Firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. In addition, the microarray showed that Enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the CD patients. This microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Differential translocation of green fluorescent protein fused to signal sequences of Ruminococcus albus cellulases by the Tat and Sec pathways of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Ruminococcus albus is a Gram-positive bacterium that degrades plant cell walls in the rumen of herbivores. It was described to synthesize two major glycoside-hydrolases (Cel9B and Cel48A), which are exported and anchored at the cell surface. In bacteria, proteins destined to cross the cytoplasmic membrane are synthesized as precursors and possess a signal sequence (SS) directing them to the 'Sec' (general secretory) or 'Tat' (twin arginine translocation) pathway. SS composition of Cel9B and Cel48A suggests that these two enzymes translocate using different secretory pathways. In order to confirm this hypothesis, the SSs of Cel9B and Cel48A were fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and expressed in wild-type Escherichia coli and in its Tat and Sec isogenic mutants. The SS cleavage and the formation of the mature protein were then followed by Western blot and fluorescence microscopy. This study shows that the SS of Cel9B directs the preprotein to the 'Tat' translocation pathway while the GFP fused to the SS of Cel48A is exported through the 'Sec' machinery. These observations suggest that R. albus possess a Tat pathway, in addition to the general secretory pathway.
TI  - Site-directed mutagenesis of possible catalytic residues of cellobiose 2-epimerase from Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - The cellobiose 2-epimerase from Ruminococcus albus (RaCE) catalyzes the epimerization of cellobiose and lactose to 4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-D-mannose and 4-O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-D-mannose (epilactose). Based on the sequence alignment with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerases of known structure and on a homology-modeled structure of RaCE, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of possible catalytic residues in the enzyme, and the mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli cells. We found that R52, H243, E246, W249, W304, E308, and H374 were absolutely required for the activity of RaCE. F114 and W303 also contributed to catalysis. These residues protruded into the active-site cleft in the model (alpha/alpha)(6) core barrel structure.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the gene for cellobiose 2-epimerase from a ruminal strain of Eubacterium cellulosolvens.
AB  - Cellobiose 2-epimerase (CE; EC 5.1.3.11) is known to catalyze the reversible epimerization of cellobiose to 4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-D-mannose in Ruminococcus albus cells. Here, we report a CE in a ruminal strain of Eubacterium cellulosolvens for the first time. The nucleotide sequence of the CE had an ORF of 1218 bp (405 amino acids; 46 963.3 Da). The CE from E. cellulosolvens showed 44-54% identity to N-acyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerase-like hypothetical proteins in the genomes of Coprococcus eutactus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Clostridium phytofermentans, Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus, and Eubacterium siraeum. Surprisingly, it exhibited only 46% identity to a CE from R. albus. The recombinant enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli was purified by two-step chromatography. The purified enzyme had a molecular mass of 46.7 kDa and exhibited optimal activity at around 35 degrees C and pH 7.0-8.5. In addition to cello-oligosaccharides, it converted lactose to epilactose (4-O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-D-mannose).
TI  - Detection of possible AI-2-mediated quorum sensing system in commensal intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The Vibrio harveyi strain BB170-autoinducer bioassay was used to detect possible  quorum sensing autoinducer-2 molecule (AI-2) in culture fluids of commensal intestinal bacteria. Culture fluids of Bacteroides vulgatus, Clostridium proteoclasticum, Escherichia coli, Eubacterium rectale, Lachnospira multipara, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Roseburia intestinalis, Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens contained AI-2-like molecules. The PCR bands from some of the tested strains could be also amplified using primers designed for the luxS gene. These findings suggest that AI-2 is present in the gastrointestinal tract; however, it has not yet been proved whether it is used for bacterial cell-to-cell communication.
TI  - Enzymatic properties of cellobiose 2-epimerase from Ruminococcus albus and the synthesis of rare oligosaccharides by the enzyme.
AB  - The gene for cellobiose 2-epimerase (CE) from Ruminococcus albus NE1 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells. The recombinant CE was purified to homogeneity by a simple purification procedure with a high yield of 88%, and the molecular mass was 43.1 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 44.0 kDa on gel chromatography. It exhibited optimal activity around at 30 degrees C and pH 7.5, and the enzyme activity was inhibited by Al3+, Fe3+, Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, Ag+, N-bromosuccinimide, iodoacetate, and 4-chloromercuribenzoate. In addition to cello-oligosaccharides, the enzyme was found to effectively 2-epimerize lactose to yield 4-O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-D-mannose (epilactose), which occurs in cow milk as a rare oligosaccharide. The Km and kcat/Km values toward lactose were 33 mM and 1.6 s(-1) mM(-1), and those toward cellobiose were 13.8 mM and 4.6 s(-1) mM(-1), respectively. N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine, uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucose, D-glucose 6-phosphate, maltose, sophorose, laminaribiose, and gentiobiose were inert as substrates for the recombinant CE. We demonstrated that epilactose was resistant to rat intestinal enzymes, utilized by human adult bifidobacteria, and stimulated the tight junction permeability in Caco-2 cells. These results strongly suggest that this rare disaccharide is promising for use as a prebiotic.
TI  - Biochemical and mutational analysis of glutamine synthetase type III from the rumen anaerobe Ruminococcus albus 8.
AB  - Two different genes encoding glutamine synthetase type I (GSI) and GSIII were identified in the genome sequence of R. albus 8. The identity of the GSIII protein was confirmed by the presence of its associated conserved motifs. The glnN gene, encoding the GSIII, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells. The recombinant protein was purified and subjected to biochemical and physical analyses. Subunit organization suggested a protein present in solution as both monomers and oligomers. Kinetic studies using the forward and the gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma-GT) assays were carried out. Mutations that changed conserved glutamic acid residues to alanine in the four GSIII motifs resulted in drastic decreases in GS activity using both assays, except for an E380A mutation, which rather resulted in an increase in activity in the forward assay compared to the wild-type protein. Reduced GSIII activity was also exhibited by mutating, individually, two lysines (K308 and K318) located in the putative nucleotide-binding site to alanine. Most importantly, the presence of mRNA transcripts of the glnN gene in R. albus 8 cells grown under ammonia limiting conditions, whereas little or no transcript was detected in cells grown under ammonia sufficient conditions, suggested an important role for the GSIII in the nitrogen metabolism of R. albus 8. Furthermore, the mutational studies on the conserved GSIII motifs demonstrated, for the first time, their importance in the structure and/or function of a GSIII protein.
TI  - Cloning of the Ruminococcus albus cel5D and cel9A genes encoding dockerin module-containing endoglucanases and expression of cel5D in Escherichia coli.
AB  - An EcoRI chromosomal DNA fragment of Ruminococcus albus F-40 that conferred endoglucanase activity on Escherichia coli was cloned. An open reading frame (ORF1) and another incomplete reading frame (ORF2) were found in the EcoRI fragment. The ORF2 was completed using inverse PCR genome walking technique. ORF1 and ORF2, which confront each other, encoded cellulases belonging to families 5 and 9 of the glycoside hydrolases and were designated cel5D and cel9A respectively. The cel5D gene encodes 753 amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 83,409. Cel5D consists of a signal peptide of 24 amino acids, a family-5 catalytic module, a dockerin module, and two family-4 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs). The cel9A gene encodes 936 amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 104,174, consisting of a signal peptide, a family-9 catalytic module, a family-3 CBM, and a dockerin module. The catalytic module polypeptide (rCel5DCat) derived from Cel5D was constructed, expressed, and purified from a recombinant E. coli. The truncated enzyme hydrolyzed cellohexaose, cellopentaose, and cellotetraose to yield mainly cellotriose and cellobiose with glucose as a minor product, but the enzyme was less active toward cellotriose and not active toward cellobiose, suggesting that this enzyme is a typical endoglucanase. rCel5DCat had a Km of 3.9 mg/ml and a Vmax of 37.2 micromol/min/mg for carboxymethycellulose.
TI  - Development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  - A membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. The 16S rDNA sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. Three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled 16S rDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. Hybridization signals were read by NBT/BCIP color development. The 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, B. fragilis, B. distasonis, Clostridium clostridiiforme, C. leptum, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Peptostreptococcus productus, Ruminococcus obeum, R. bromii, R. callidus, R. albus, Bifidobacterium longum, B. adolescentis, B. infantis, Eubacterium biforme, E. aerofaciens, Lactobacillus acidophilus,Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecium. The two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16S rDNA from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. The hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. The result was also confirmed by using specific PCR methods for these bacteria.
TI  - Design and evaluation of oligonucleotide-microarray method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  - An oligonucleotide-microarray method was developed for the detection of intestinal bacteria in fecal samples collected from human subjects. The 16S rDNA sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. Three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to glass slides. Cyanine5 (CY5)-labeled 16S rDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from human fecal samples or bacterial DNA using two universal primers and were hybridized to the oligo-microarray. The 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides distasonis, Clostridium clostridiiforme, Clostridium leptum, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Peptostreptococcus productus, Ruminococcus obeum, Ruminococcus bromii, Ruminococcus callidus, Ruminococcus albus, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium infantis, Eubacterium biforme, Eubacterium aerofaciens, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecium. The two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16S rDNA from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. The hybridization results indicated that the oligo-microarray method developed in this study is a reliable method for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel glucocerebrosidase of Paenibacillus sp. TS12.
AB  - We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of a glucocerebrosidase [EC 3.2.1.45] from Paenibacillus sp. TS12. The open reading frame of the glucocerebrosidase gene consisted of 2,493 bp nucleotides and encoded 831 amino acid residues. The enzyme exhibited no sequence similarity with a classical glucocerebrosidase belonging to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 30, but rather showed significant similarity with GH family 3 beta-glucosidases from Clostridium thermocellum, Ruminococcus albus, and Aspergillus aculeateus. The recombinant enzyme, expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, had a molecular weight of 90.7 kDa and hydrolyzed NBD-labeled glucosylceramide, but not galactosylceramide, GM1a or sphingomyelin. The enzyme was most active at pH 6.5, and its apparent Km and Vmax values for NBD-labeled glucosylceramide and p-nitrophenyl-beta-glucopyranoside were 223 microM and 1.60 micromol/min/mg of protein, and 593 microM and 112 micromol/min/mg of protein, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that Asp-223 is an essential amino acid for the catalytic reaction and possibly functions a catalytic nucleophile, as in GH family 3 beta-glucosidases. This is the first report of the molecular cloning and characterization of a glucocerebrosidase from a procaryote.
TI  - Sequence of egV and properties of EgV, a Ruminococcus albus endoglucanase containing a dockerin domain.
AB  - The Ruminococcus albus F-40 egV gene, encoding endoglucanase V (EGV), consists of an open reading frame of 1,833 nucleotides and encodes 611 amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 67,103. The deduced EGV is a modular enzyme composed of a catalytic domain of family 5 of glycosyl hydrolases, a domain of unknown function, and a dockerin domain responsible for cellulosome assembly, suggesting that R. albus F-40 produces a cellulosome, and EGV is a component of the cellulosome. A truncated form of EGV with an apparent molecular weight of 42,000 was purified from a recombinant Escherichia coli and characterized since EGV suffered from partial proteolysis by E. coli protease(s). The truncated EGV was active toward carboxylmethyl cellulose, xylan, lichenan, and acid-swollen cellulose. The pH and temperature optima of the enzyme were 7.0 and 40 degrees C, respectively. By Western blot analysis using the antiserum raised against the truncated enzyme, EGV was detected in the whole cells but not in the culture supernatant of R. alubus F-40, suggesting that EGV was located on the cell surface.
TI  - A cysteine desulphurase gene from the cellulolytic rumen anaerobe Ruminococcus flavefaciens.
AB  - A gene whose predicted product shows 40-50% sequence identity with the products of nifS genes from nitrogen-fixing bacteria was found downstream from a cellulase gene in a DNA fragment from the cellulolytic rumen anaerobe, Ruminococcus flavefaciens 17. The R. flavefaciens gene product released sulphur from l-cysteine when expressed in Escherichia coli, indicating that the R. flavefaciens NifS enzyme may play a role in sulphuration, perhaps, as in nitrogen-fixing bacteria, supplying sulphur to FeS proteins. Sequences hybridising with the R. flavefaciens 17 nifS-like gene were also detected in R. flavefaciens 007 and in R. albus SY3.
TI  - Microbial production of hydrogen: an overview.
AB  - Production of hydrogen by anaerobes, facultative anaerobes, aerobes, methylotrophs, and photosynthetic bacteria is possible. Anaerobic Clostridia are potential producers and immobilized C. butyricum produces 2 mol H2/mol glucose at 50% efficiency. Spontaneous production of H2 from formate and glucose by immobilized Escherichia coli showed 100% and 60% efficiencies, respectively. Enterobactericiae produces H2 at similar efficiency from different monosaccharides during growth. Among methylotrophs, methanogenes, rumen bacteria, and thermophilic archae, Ruminococcus albus, is promising (2.37 mol/mol glucose). Immobilized aerobic Bacillus licheniformis optimally produces 0.7 mol H2/mol glucose. Photosynthetic Rhodospirillum rubrum produces 4, 7, and 6 mol of H2 from acetate, succinate, and malate, respectively. Excellent productivity (6.2 mol H2/mol glucose) by co-cultures of Cellulomonas with a hydrogenase uptake (Hup) mutant of R. capsulata on cellulose was found. Cyanobacteria, viz., Anabaena, Synechococcus, and Oscillatoria sp., have been studied for photoproduction of H2. Immobilized A. cylindrica produces H2 (20 ml/g dry wt/h) continually for 1 year. Increased H2 productivity was found for Hup mutant of A. variabilis. Synechococcus sp. has a high potential for H2 production in fermentors and outdoor cultures. Simultaneous productions of oxychemicals and H2 by Klebseilla sp. and by enzymatic methods were also attempted. The fate of H2 biotechnology is presumed to be dictated by the stock of fossil fuel and state of pollution in future.
TI  - Bovine spongiform encephalopathy: is it an autoimmune disease due to bacteria showing molecular mimicry with brain antigens?
AB  - Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) could be an autoimmune disease produced following exposure of cattle to feedstuffs containing bacteria showing molecular mimicry between bacterial components and bovine tissue. Analysis of molecular sequence databases (Genbank and SwissProt) shows that three bacteria (Acinetobacter calcoaceticus,Ruminococcus albus, and Agrobacter tumefaciens) share sequences with the encephalitogenic peptide of bovine myelin, while three molecules in Escherichia coli show molecular mimicry with host-encoded prion protein. Immune responses against these bacteria at both T and B cell levels may cause neurological tissue injury resembling BSE. The role of these bacteria in BSE, if any, merits further investigation.
TI  - Identification and characterization of cellulose-binding domains in xylanase A of Clostridium stercorarium.
AB  - The xynA gene encoding a major xylanase of Clostridium stercorarium F-9 was sequenced. The structural gene consists of an open reading frame of 1533 bp encoding a protein of 511 amino acids with an M(r) of 56,519. XynA consists of a catalytic domain belonging to family G at the NH2-terminus and two direct repeats of about 90 amino acids with a short spacing at the COOH-terminus. The repeated sequences, CBDI and CBDII, were not homologous with amino acid sequences of the CBDs classified into families I to V. Nevertheless, XynA showed an affinity for insoluble cellulose such as Avicel. Binding of XynA to Avicel was strongly dependent on the concentration of the incubation buffer and was inhibited by Triton X-100. XynA bound to Avicel (2.4 nmol/g-cellulose) and acid-swollen cellulose (180 nmol/g-cellulose), suggesting that this enzyme has higher affinity for amorphous cellulose than for crystalline cellulose. Functions of CBDI and CBDII were investigated by constructing the mutant enzymes and evaluating the cellulose-binding ability of each of them. XynA4 lacking CBDI and XynA5 lacking CBDII bound to Avicel to a lesser extent than the parental enzyme XynA; but XynA6, devoid of both CBDs, did not bind at all, indicating that CBDI and CBDII each functioned independently as CBD in XynA and their binding capacity was additive. Although the Ruminococcus albus endoglucanase EgIV that was joined to CBDs of XynA acquired cellulose-binding ability, the substrate specificity of EgIV was not altered in the presence or absence of CBDs.
TI  - An endo-beta-1,4-glucanase gene (celA) from the rumen anaerobe Ruminococcus albus 8: cloning, sequencing, and transcriptional analysis.
AB  - A genomic library of Ruminococcus albus 8 DNA was constructed in Escherichia coli using bacteriophage lambda ZapII. This library was screened for cellulase components and several Ostazin brilliant red/carboxymethyl cellulose positive clones were isolated. All of these clones contained a common 3.4-kb insert, which was recovered as a plasmid by helper phage excision. The carboxymethyl cellulase coding region was localized to a 1.4-kb region of DNA by nested deletions, and a clone containing the entire celA gene was sequenced. Analysis of the sequence revealed a 1231-bp open reading frame, coding for a protein of 411 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 45 747. This protein, designated CelA, showed extensive homology with family 5 endoglucanases by both primary amino acid sequence alignment and hydrophobic cluster analysis. Cell-free extracts of E. coli containing the celA clone demonstrated activity against carboxymethyl cellulose and acid swollen cellulose but not against any of the p-nitrophenol glycosides tested, indicating an endo-beta-1,4-glucanase type of activity. In vitro transcription-translation experiments showed that three proteins of 48,000, 44,000, and 23,000 molecular weight were produced by clones containing the celA gene. Northern analysis of RNA extracted from R. albus 8 grown on cellulose indicated a celA transcript of approximately 2700 bases, whereas when R. albus 8 was grown on cellobiose, celA transcripts of approximately 3000 and 600 bases were detected. Primer extension analysis of these RNAs revealed different transcription initiation sites for the celA gene when cells were grown with cellulose or cellobiose as the carbon source. These two sites differed by 370 bases in distance. A model, based on transcription and sequence data, is proposed for celA regulation.
TI  - Cloning of a beta-glucosidase gene from Ruminococcus albus and its expression in  Escherichia coli.
AB  - A HindIII fragment of R. albus DNA encoding beta-glucosidase was cloned into E. coli. The DNA sequence (3158 bp) was determined, and the longest potential encoding sequence consisted of 2,841 bp (947 amino acids with the calculated molecular weight of 104,276. The deduced NH2-terminal amino acid sequence from the first (methionine) to the twentieth (glycine) was identical to that of the purified enzyme, suggesting that the gene for beta-glucosidase does not encode a signal peptide. The enzyme purified from the culture supernatant of the transformant had a molecular weight of 120,000 and its maximum activity was revealed at pH 6.5 and 30 degrees C. Reducing reagents activated the enzyme, whereas the sulfhydryl group-blocking reagents and reaction products (glucose) inhibited the activity. Hydrolyzates of celloorigomers contained glucose as a major product, indicating that the enzyme acts as beta-glucosidase. The enzyme from the transformant revealed similar properties to that from R. albus, and both enzyme proteins were immunologically the same to each other, indicating that the cloned gene encodes beta-glucosidase from R. albus.
TI  - Modification of the properties of a Ruminococcus albus endo-1,4-beta-glucanase by gene truncation.
AB  - An endo-1,4-beta-glucanase (EgI) gene isolated from Ruminococcus albus was deleted at the 5'-flanking region by gene truncation or at the 3'-flanking region by insertion of an omega (omega) fragment with a universal stop codon at the EcoRI or BamHI site. These modified genes were integrated into pUC vectors to construct chimera plasmids for Escherichia coli. The truncated EgIs were produced from transformants (E. coli) harboring the chimera plasmids. An EgI with a 15-amino-acid N-terminal deletion exibited higher activity at lower pH and temperature compared with the activity of the original EgI. The EgIs with 59- and 75-amino-acid deletions from the N and C terminals, respectively, had no activity, indicating that both terminal moieties are essential for enzyme activity.
TI  - Mode of action and substrate specificity of a purified exo-1,4-beta-D-glucosidase cloned from the cellulolytic bacterium Ruminococcus albus AR67.
AB  - A gene encoding exo-1,4-beta-D-glucosidase, from Ruminococcus albus AR67, was cloned in Escherichia coli, restriction mapped, and shown to be expressed from sequences within the insert that function as a promoter in E. coli. The cloned enzyme was located predominantly in the cytoplasm (40%) and attached to insoluble cell components (48%). After purification to homogeneity, the enzyme (Mr = 64,000, monomeric) was specific for substrates with beta-D-glucopyranosyl configuration and was inactive against alpha-glucosides, lactosides and xylosides. Km values of the enzyme decreased with increasing chain length (G2-G5). Glucose was the major product of hydrolysis from cellodextrins. Preference for longer chain cellodextrins is consistent with exo-1,4-beta-D-glucan glucohydrolase mode of action [E.C. 3.2.1.74].
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the Ruminococcus albus SY3 endoglucanase genes celA and celB.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of Ruminococcus albus genes celA and celB coding for endoglucanase A (EGA) and endoglucanase B (EGB), respectively, have been determined. The celA structural gene consists of an open reading frame of 1095 bp. Confirmation of the nucleotide sequence was obtained by comparing the predicted amino acid sequence with that derived by N-terminal analysis of purified EGA. The celB structural gene consists of an open reading frame of 1227 bp; 7 bp upstream of the translational start codon of celB is a typical gram-positive Shine-Dalgarno sequence. The deduced N-terminal region of EGB conforms to the general pattern for the signal peptides of secreted prokaryotic proteins. The complete celB gene, cloned into pUC vectors, caused lethality in Escherichia coli. In contrast, celA cloned in pUC18, under the control of lacZp, directed high-level synthesis of EGA in E. coli JM83. EGA in cell-free extract, purified to near homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography, had a Mr of 44.5 kDa. Gene deletion and subcloning studies with celA revealed that EGA hydrolysed both CMC and xylan, and did not contain discrete functional domains. EGA and EGB showed considerable homology with each other, in addition to exhibiting similarity with Eg1 (R. albus), EGE (Clostridium thermocellum) and End (Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens).
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of a Bacteroides ruminicola B(1)4 endoglucanase gene.
AB  - Bacteroides ruminicola B(1)4, a noncellulolytic rumen bacterium, produces an endoglucanase (carboxymethylcellulase [CMCase]) that is excreted into the culture supernatant. Cultures grown on glucose, fructose, maltose, mannose, and cellobiose had high specific activities of CMCase (greater than 3 mmol of reducing sugar per mg of protein per min), but its synthesis was repressed by sucrose. B. rumincola did not grow on either ball-milled or acid-swollen cellulose even though the CMCase could hydrolyze swollen cellulose. The CMCase gene was cloned into Escherichia coli, and its nucleotide sequence contained a single open reading frame coding for a protein of 40,481 daltons. The enzyme was overproduced in E. coli under the control of the tac promoter and purified to homogeneity. The N-terminal sequence, amino acid composition, and molecular weight of the purified enzyme were similar to the values predicted from the open reading frame of the DNA sequence. However, the CMCase present in B. ruminicola was found to have a monomer molecular weight of 88,000 by Western immunoblotting. This discrepancy appeared to have resulted from our having cloned only part of the CMCase gene into E. coli. The amino acid sequence of the CMCase showed homology to sequences of beta-glucanases from Ruminococcus albus and Clostridium thermocellum.
TI  - Antigenic nature of the chloride-stimulated cellobiosidase and other cellulases of Fibrobacter succinogenes subsp. succinogenes S85 and related fresh isolates.
AB  - Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to the Cl-stimulated cellobiosidase of Fibrobacter succinogenes subsp. succinogenes S85 reacted with numerous proteins of both higher and lower molecular weights from F. succinogenes subsp. succinogenes S85, but not with Escherichia coli proteins, and only one protein each from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Ruminococcus albus. Different profiles were observed for Western blots (immunoblots) of peptide digests of both the purified enzyme from F. succinogenes and immunoreactive proteins of higher and lower molecular weights, demonstrating that they were different proteins. Therefore, F. succinogenes appeared to produce numerous proteins with one or more common antigenic determinants. However, with the exception of Cl-stimulated cellobiosidase, none were cellulases that have been characterized. An affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to Cl-stimulated cellobiosidase reacted with numerous proteins in cells of each of three fresh isolates of F. succinogenes subsp. succinogenes and one of F. succinogenes subsp. elongata when analyzed by Western blotting. Antibodies to periplasmic cellodextrinase, endoglucanase 2 (EG2), and EG3, when reacted in Western blots with the various cellulases, including Cl-stimulated cellobiosidase, revealed limited antigenic similarity among the different proteins and none with either B. fibrisolvens or R. albus proteins. The periplasmic cellodextrinase antibody reacted with an antigen with a size corresponding to cellodextrinase in each of the three F. succinogenes subsp. succinogenes isolates but not with any antigens from the F. succinogenes subsp. elongata isolate. The anti-EG2 antibody reacted with single antigens in each of the four isolates, while the anti-EG3 antibody reacted with only one of the four isolates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - DNA sequence of a beta-glucosidase from Ruminococcus albus.
AB  
TI  - Modification of an endo-1,4-beta-glucanase from Ruminococcus albus by gene truncation.
AB  
TI  - Structure of a Ruminococcus albus endo-1,4-beta-glucanase gene.
AB  - A chromosomal DNA fragment encoding an endo-1,4-beta-glucanase I (Eg I) gene from Ruminococcus albus cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli with pUC18 was fully sequenced by the dideoxy-chain termination method. The sequence contained a consensus promoter sequence and a structural amino acid sequence. The initial 43 amino acids of the protein were deduced to be a signal sequence, since they are missing in the mature protein (Eg I). High homology was found when the amino acid sequence of the Eg I was compared with that of endoglucanase E from Clostridium thermocellum. Codon usage of the gene was not biased. These results suggested that the properties of the Eg I gene from R. albus was specified from the known beta-glucanase genes of the other organisms.
TI  - Escherichia coli Spheroplast-Mediated Transfer of pBR322 Carrying the Cloned Ruminococcus albus Cellulase Gene into Anaerobic Mutant Strain FEM29 by Protoplast Fusion.
AB  - Intergeneric protoplast fusion between Escherichia coli HB101 with pBR322 carrying the cloned o-(carboxymethyl)cellulase (CMCase) gene of Ruminococcus albus (Pro Leu Ap Km) and an anaerobic mutant strain, FEM29 (Trp His Ap Km), with dehydrodivanillin-degrading activity was performed in the presence of 40% polyvinyl alcohol 300 under aerobic and anaerobic conditions to transfer the cloned cellulase gene into the mutant. The mutant FEM29 had a unique property. When it was incubated in liquid medium with 1% glucose and sucrose, protoplasts could be produced autogenously and regenerated on the agar slant. E. coli spheroplasts formed from a plasmid-amplified overnight culture after 10 min of treatment with lysozyme (20 mug/ml) in a hypertonic solution (0.01 M Tris hydrochloride [pH 7.5], 0.4 M mannitol). Protoplast regeneration rates of FEM29 and HB101 were 30 and 83%, respectively, on the agar-yeast extract medium. Ap Km fusants were obtained at high frequency: 1.7 x 10 anaerobically and 8.2 x 10 aerobically. These fusants showed 23 to 57% of CMCase and dehydrodivanillin-degrading activities, respectively, as compared with parental strains. All the fusants isolated were gram-negative rods with main phenotypes such as urease and catalase activities as in HB101 and esterase and chymotrypsin activities as in FEM29. Southern hybridization experiments suggested that pBR322 with the cloned CMCase gene existed autonomously in the fusant cells. This is the first report describing transfer of pBR322 with a cloned cellulase gene into an anaerobic mutant by polyvinyl alcohol-mediated fusion with an E. coli spheroplast.
TI  - Molecular Cloning and Expression of Cellulase Genes from Ruminococcus albus 8 in  Escherichia coli Bacteriophage lambda.
AB  - A genomic library of Ruminococcus albus 8 DNA was constructed by using the Escherichia coli bacteriophage lambdaDASH. Recombinants were screened for cellulolytic activity by plating in soft agar (0.7%) overlays containing either 1% (wt/vol) carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-d-cellobioside (MUC, 1 mg/ml), or 1% (wt/vol) Ostazin brilliant red-hydroxyethyl cellulose (OBR-HEC). One hundred and three recombinant phage exhibiting activity against OBR-HEC were found, and these fell into different classes based on the size of the zone of hydrolysis. Twenty-one recombinant phage exhibiting activity against CMC and 19 recombinant phage exhibiting activity against MUC were isolated. Four OBR-HEC, five CMC, and seven MUC clones were further analyzed by restriction endonuclease mapping and cellulase substrate specificity to identify unique clones and to determine their cellulase type. Three different clone types representing endoglucanase activity were identified. Three clones that appeared to encode exoglucanase type activity and four clones that had a mixed specificity, including beta-glucosidase activity, were also identified.
TI  - Cloning of the cellulase gene from Ruminococcus albus and its expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The gene for cellulase from Ruminococcus albus F-40 was cloned in Escherichia coli HB101 with pBR322. A 3.4-kilobase-pair HindIII fragment encoding cellulase hybridized with the chromosomal DNA of R. albus. The Ouchterlony double-fusion test gave a single precipitation line between the cloned enzyme and the cellulase from R. albus. The size of the cloned fragment was reduced by using HindIII and EcoRI. The resulting active fragment had a size of 1.9 kilobase pairs; and the restriction sites EcoRI, BamHI, PvuII, EcoRI, PvuII, and HindIII, in that order, were ligated into pUC19 at the EcoRI and HindIII sites (pURA1). Cellulase production by E. coli JM103(pURA1) in Luria-Bertani broth was remarkably enhanced, up to approximately 80 times, by controlling the pH at 6.5 and by reducing the concentration of NaCl in the broth to 80 mM.
TI  - Intergeneric Protoplast Fusion between Ruminococcus albus and an Anaerobic Recombinant, FE7.
AB  - Intergeneric protoplast fusion between Ruminococcus albus, a cellulolytic, gram-positive, anaerobic bacterium (Pc Sm Km), and an anaerobic recombinant, FE7 (Pc Sm Km), having lignin-related compound-degrading activities, was performed under strictly anaerobic conditions to introduce cellulase genes into strain FE7. The fusion frequency varied with different selected markers from 3.0 x 10 to 3.3 x 10. Two fusants, obtained from a synthetic medium with selective pressures of penicillin and streptomycin and with cellooli-gomer as the sole carbon source, were gram-negative rods. One of them, named FE7R2, showed 45 to 47% of the beta-glucosidase and cellobiosidase activities of its parent R. albus and still maintained a level of degradation activity against dehydrodivanillin, a lignin-related compound, of up to 87% of that of the parent strain FE7. To verify that the cellulolytic activities expressed in the fusant FE7R2 originated from R. albus cellulase genes, the beta-glucosidase gene of R. albus was cloned into Escherichia coli HB101 with plasmid pBR322. Cells bearing a recombinant plasmid, pRAII, produced high enzyme activities against both p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucoside and p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-cellobioside and could degrade cellobiose to glucose. Southern blot results showed that the cloned DNA fragment could hybridize with chromosomal DNAs of both R. albus and FE7R2, but did not with the chromosomal DNA of FE7, indicating that the beta-glucosidase gene fragment was introduced into the chromosome of FE7R2 from R. albus via the protoplast fusion. The fusant FE7R2 could utilize simultaneously both cellobiose and dehydrodivanillin. These results gave evidence that the fusion product FE7R2 is a recombinant strain between its parents R. albus and FE7. This recombinant has stably kept the above properties for about 2 years.
TI  - Antibiotic activity of an isocyanide metabolite of Trichoderma hamatum against rumen bacteria.
AB  - A metabolite of Trichoderma hamatum, 3-(3-isocyanocyclopent-2-enylidene)propionic acid, was tested for its effects on growth of and carbohydrate metabolism in 11 strains of functionally important rumen bacteria. To standardize the biological activity of this unstable metabolite, a rapid, aerobic disc diffusion assay was developed using Escherichia coli ATCC 11775. In an anaerobic broth dilution assay using a medium lacking rumen fluid and containing a soluble carbohydrate, the minimum inhibitory concentration of the metabolite which completely inhibited growth of the rumen bacteria for 18 h at 39 degrees C was generally less than 10 micrograms X mL-1; however, the minimum inhibitory concentrations for Megasphaera elsdenii B159 and Streptococcus bovis Pe(1)8 were 10-25 and 25-64 micrograms X mL-1, respectively. In general, the Gram-negative strains were more sensitive than the Gram positive. The minimum inhibitory concentration for Bacteroides ruminicola 23 grown with glucose was 1 micrograms X mL-1; for B. ruminicola GA33 (glucose), B. succinogenes S85 (cellobiose), and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens 24 (maltose), it was 2 microgram X mL-1. When added to a cellulose-containing rumen fluid medium, 1-4 micrograms X mL-1 of the metabolite delayed cellulose hydrolysis by B. succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus albus 7, and R. flavefaciens FD1 for up to 4 days, and 6-7 micrograms X mL-1 prevented hydrolysis for at least 1 month. In the presence of the metabolite, the proportion of acetate produced from soluble carbohydrate by the majority of strains increased, but with some strains net production of acetate decreased relative to production of other acidic fermentation products.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Molybdate and sulfide inhibit H2 and increase formate production from glucose by  Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - H2 production from glucose by Ruminococcus albus was almost completely inhibited  by 10(-5) M molybdate only when sulfide was present in the growth medium. Inhibition was accompanied by a significant increase in the production of formate. Extracts of molybdate-sulfide-grown cells did not contain hydrogenase activity. Active enzyme in extracts of uninhibited cells was not inhibited by the molybdate-sulfide-containing growth medium. The results indicate that a complex formed from molybdate and sulfide prevents the formation of active hydrogenase and electrons otherwise used to form H2 are used to reduce CO2 to formate. Growth was significantly inhibited when molybdate was increased to 10(-4) M. Reversal of growth inhibition but not inhibition of H2 production occurred between 10(-4) and 10(-3) M molybdate. H2 production by R. bromei but not by R. flavefaciens, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Veillonella alcalescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli was inhibited by molybdate and sulfide.
TI  - Studies on some characteristics of hydrogen production by cell-free extracts of rumen anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Hydrogen production was studied in the following rumen anaerobes: Bacteroides clostridiiformis, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Enbacterium limosum, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Megasphaera elsdenii, Ruminococcus albus, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens. Clostridium pasteurianum and Escherichia coli were included for comparative purposes. Hydrogen production from dithionite, dithionite-reduced methyl viologen, pyruvate, and formate was determined. All species tested produced hydrogen from dithionite-reduce methyl viologen, but only C. pasteurianum, B. clostridiiformis, E. limosum, and M. elsdenii produced hydrogen from dithionite. All species except E. coli produced hydrogen from pyruvate, but activity was low or absent in extracts of E. limosum, F. necrophorum, R. albus, and R. flavefaciens unless methyl viologen was added. Hydrogen was produced from formate only by E. coli, B. clostridiiformis, E. limosum, F. necrophorum, and R. flavefaciens. Extracts were subjected to ultracentrifugation in an effort to determine the solubility of hydrogenase. The hydrogenase of all species except E. coli appeared to be soluble, although variable amounts of hydrogenase activity were detected in the pellet. Treatment of extracts of the rumen microbial species with DEAE-cellulose resulted in loss ofhydrogen production from pyruvate. Activity was restored by the addition of methyl viologen. It is concluded that hydrogen production in these rumen microorganisms is similar to that in the saccharolytic clostridia.
