TI  == crystal structure of peptidyl-trna hydrolase from a gram-positive bacterium, streptococcus pyogenes at 2.19 a resolution shows the closed structure of the substrate-binding cleft.
AB  == peptidyl-trna hydrolase (pth) catalyses the release of trna and peptide components from peptidyl-trna molecules. pth from a gram-positive bacterium streptococcus pyogenes (sppth) was cloned, expressed, purified and crystallised.  three-dimensional structure of sppth was determined by x-ray crystallography at 2.19 a resolution. structure determination showed that the asymmetric unit of the unit cell contained two crystallographically independent molecules, designated a  and b. the superimposition of c(alpha) traces of molecules a and b showed an r.m.s. shift of 0.4 a, indicating that the structures of two crystallographically independent molecules were identical. the polypeptide chain of sppth adopted an overall alpha/beta conformation. the substrate-binding cleft in sppth is formed with three loops: the gate loop, ile91-leu102; the base loop, gly108-gly115; and  the lid loop, gly136-gly150. unlike in the structures of pth from gram-negative bacteria, the entry to the cleft in the structure of sppth appeared to be virtually closed. however, the conformations of the active site residues were found to be similar.

TI  == quorum quenching bacteria isolated from the sludge of a wastewater treatment plant and their application for controlling biofilm formation.
AB  == bacteria recognize changes in their population density by sensing the concentration of signal molecules, n-acyl-homoserine lactones (ahls). ahl-mediated quorum sensing (qs) plays a key role in biofilm formation, so the interference of qs, referred to as quorum quenching (qq), has received a great deal of attention. a qq strategy can be applied to membrane bioreactors (mbrs) for advanced wastewater treatment to control biofouling. to isolate qq bacteria that can inhibit biofilm formation, we isolated diverse ahl-degrading bacteria from a laboratory-scale mbr and sludge from real wastewater treatment plants. a total of 225 ahldegrading bacteria were isolated from the sludge sample by enrichment culture. to identify the enzyme responsible for ahl degradation in qq  bacteria, ahl-degrading activities were analyzed using cell-free lysate, culture  supernatant, and whole cells. afipia sp. and acinetobacter sp. strains produced the intracellular qq enzyme, whereas pseudomonas sp. and micrococcus sp. produced the extracellular qq enzyme that was most likely to produce ahlacylase. ahl-degrading activity was observed in whole-cell assay with the microbacterium sp. and rhodococcus sp. strains. there has been no report for ahl-degrading capability in the case of streptococcus sp. and afipia sp. strains. finally, inhibition of biofilm formation by isolated qq bacteria or enzymes was observed on glass slides and 96-well microtiter plates using crystal violet staining. qq strains or enzymes not only inhibited initial biofilm development but also reduced established biofilms.

TI  == increased constituent ratios of klebsiella sp., acinetobacter sp., and streptococcus sp. and a decrease in microflora diversity may be indicators of ventilator-associated pneumonia: a prospective study in the respiratory tracts of neonates.
AB  == ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is a common complication and cause of death in neonates on mechanical ventilation. however, it is difficult to define the causes of vap. to understand the causes of vap, we undertook a prospective study  based on the diversity of the microflora in vap. the experimental group consisted of newborns who suffered from respiratory distress syndrome (rds) and vap, while  the control group suffered from rds without vap. sputa were collected within 1, 3, and 5 days of ventilation and were divided into six groups. dna was extracted  from the samples, and the 16s rdna was pcr amplified, separated using denaturing  gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), cloned and sequenced. the resulting sequences were compared using blast. the dgge pictures were measured, and the richness, shannon-wiener index, and cluster maps were analyzed. no differences were found regarding the constituent ratio of any genus between the non-vap and vap group within 1 day after intubation. after 1 to 3 days, the constituent ratios of klebsiella sp., acinetobacter sp., and streptococcus sp. in the vap group were higher than those in the non-vap group, and the ratios of serratia sp. and achromobacter sp. were lower. after 3 to 5 days, the ratios of klebsiella sp., acinetobacter sp., serratia sp., and achromobacter sp. were lower than those in the non-vap group. the richness and shannon-wiener index of the non-vap group  were higher than those of the vap group from 1 to 3 days after intubation, while  no differences were found within 1 day and from 3 to 5 days. we conclude that during the first three days of intubation, the microflora diversity in the lower  respiratory tract was reduced due to vap, and the greater constituent ratios of klebsiella sp., acinetobacter sp., and streptococcus sp. in the sputum may be indicators of vap.

TI  == identification of polybacterial communities in patients with postoperative, posttraumatic, and endogenous endophthalmitis through 16s rrna gene libraries.
AB  == endophthalmitis is a potential vision-threatening complication following surgical procedures (postoperative endophthalmitis [poe]), trauma (posttraumatic endophthalmitis [pte]), and bacteremic seeding of the eye from a distant infection site (endogenous endophthalmitis [ee]). several studies have revealed the polybacterial characteristics of endophthalmitis, which make the administration of antibiotics to treat the disease challenging. however, until now, the polybacterial communities of poe, pte, and ee have not been precisely studied. hence, the present study was designed to identify the bacterial community of endophthalmitis through 16s rrna gene libraries. of the 40 intraocular samples tested, 30 libraries were constructed with bacterial nested-pcr-positive samples. the obtained recombinant clones were screened through amplified rrna gene restriction analysis (ardra) to identify unique clones. the multiple types of ardra patterns (p=0.345) and diverse bacterial sequences (p=0.277) within the libraries revealed the polybacterial nature of infection in poe, pte, and ee. moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on polybacterial infection in ee. gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus spp. (n=19), streptococcus spp. (n=18), staphylococcus spp. (n=6), exiguobacterium spp. (n=3), gemella spp. (n=2), enterococcus spp. (n=2), a lysinibacillus sp. (n=1), a clostridium sp. (n=1), and a nocardia sp. (n=1), and  gram-negative bacteria, including serratia spp. (n=18), pseudomonas spp. (n=10),  enterobacter spp. (n=8), acinetobacter spp. (n=3), pantoea spp. (n=3), a haemophilus sp. (n=1), and a massilia sp. (n=1), were identified. interestingly,  among them, 10 bacterial species were not previously reported to be associated with endophthalmitis or other ocular infections. besides, the presence of 4 unidentifiable clones suggests the possibility of novel organisms that might cause eye infections. therefore, it is recommended that, in addition to the polybacterial nature of poe, pte, and ee infections, the spectrum of the pathogenic bacterial community identified in this work should be considered while administering antibiotic therapy in suspected endophthalmitis cases.

TI  == [diversity analysis of biofilm bacteria on tracheal tubes removed from intubated  neonates].
AB  == objective: the catheter-related infections caused by mechanical ventilation have  become a intractable clinical problem, and it is related to the formation of bacterial biofilm (bf) on the surface of the implanted material. the majority of  natural biofilms are formed by multiple bacterial species. however, there always  only one or limited species were detected on tracheal tubes removed from intubated neonates by using traditional methods including bacterium culture and antigen detection. the aims of this study were to observe the bacterial communities diversity of bf on endotracheal tube (ett), and discuss the difference between traditional bacterium culture methods and the use of molecular biology techniques on the basis of denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), to provide new ideas for clinical prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections. method: thirty-five etts were obtained from 26 neonates on  mechanical ventilator (from october 2012 to march 2013) in department of neonatology of children's hospital. among the patients, 18 were boys and 8 girls, and 19 patients were < 37 weeks gestational age and 7 patients >/= 37 weeks. dgge profiling of 16s rdna gene amplicons was used to assess the diversity of the bacterial population by using the software of quantity one. ta cloning kit and sequencing were used to investigate the distribution of bacteria and common dominant bacteria in ett-bf. result: the mean bands of 35 etts cases were 13.8 +/- 5.4 from 16s rdna pcr-dgge, and the mean shanon-wiener indexes was 2.42 +/- 0.38. the 16 etts were collected in different stages of diseases from the 7 patients. the indwelling days of 6/7 patients' etts increased, the shanon-siener  indexes were decreased. among the 6 cases from different basic illnesses, and there were different shanon-siener indexes. the result of molecular cloning and sequencing for 24 dominant bands showed that 35 cases (100%) contained klebsiella sp., 28 cases (80%) had pseudomonas sp., 27 cases (77%) had streptococcus sp., and 32 cases (91%) had uncultured bacterium, while more than 2 bacterial species  were found in 34 cases (97%). 28/35 (80%) klebsiella sp. and 22/27(82%) streptococcus sp. were accompanied by pseudomonas sp.. there were 22 positive results of sputum culture from 26 newborns, including 10 strains (45%) of klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains (9%) of acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and non-cultured bacterium in each patient (5%), but only one bacterium isolated from every sputum. eight sputum samples had normal flora only, corresponding to the etts on which klebsiella and other bacterial genuses were found. conclusion: the diversity of microbiota in bf on ett was confirmed. 16s rdna pcr-dgge could produce a more complete picture of bacterial community than traditional bacterium culture method. klebsiella, pseudomonas and streptococcus were common dominant bacteria in ett-bf, and there might be interactions among them in the formation of bf.

TI  == analysis of the airway microbiota of healthy individuals and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by t-rflp and clone sequencing.
AB  == chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is a progressive, inflammatory lung  disease that affects a large number of patients and has significant impact. one hallmark of the disease is the presence of bacteria in the lower airways. objective: the aim of this study was to analyze the detailed structure of microbial communities found in the lungs of healthy individuals and patients with copd. nine copd patients as compared and 9 healthy individuals underwent flexible bronchoscopy and bal was performed. bacterial nucleic acids were subjected to terminal restriction fragment (trf) length polymorphism and clone library analysis. overall, we identified 326 t-rflp band, 159 in patients and 167 in healthy controls. the results of the trf analysis correlated partly with the data obtained from clone sequencing. although the results of the sequencing showed high diversity, the genera prevotella, sphingomonas, pseudomonas, acinetobacter,  fusobacterium, megasphaera, veillonella, staphylococcus, and streptococcus constituted the major part of the core microbiome found in both groups. a trf band possibly representing pseudomonas sp. monoinfection was associated with a reduction of the microbial diversity. non-cultural methods reveal the complexity  of the pulmonary microbiome in healthy individuals and in patients with copd. alterations of the microbiome in pulmonary diseases are correlated with disease.

TI  == stability of airborne microbes in the louvre museum over time.
AB  == the microbial content of air has as yet been little described, despite its public health implications, and there remains a lack of environmental microbial data on  airborne microflora in enclosed spaces. in this context, the aim of this study was to characterize the diversity and dynamics of airborne microorganisms in the  louvre museum using high-throughput molecular tools and to underline the microbial signature of indoor air in this human-occupied environment. this microbial community was monitored for 6 month during occupied time. the quantitative results revealed variations in the concentrations of less than one logarithm, with average values of 10(3) and 10(4) escherichia coli/aspergillus fumigatus genome equivalent per m(3) for bacteria and fungi, respectively. our observations highlight the stability of the indoor airborne bacterial diversity over time, while the corresponding eukaryote community was less stable. bacterial diversity characterized by pyrosequencing 454 showed high diversity dominated by  the proteobacteria which represented 51.1%, 46.9%, and 38.4% of sequences, for each of the three air samples sequenced. a common bacterial diversity was underlined, corresponding to 58.4% of the sequences. the core species were belonging mostly to the proteobacteria and actinobacteria, and to the genus paracoccus spp., acinetobacter sp., pseudomonas sp., enhydrobacter sp., sphingomonas sp., staphylococcus sp., and streptococcus sp.

TI  == intestinal microbiota of gibel carp (carassius auratus gibelio) and its origin as revealed by 454 pyrosequencing.
AB  == the intestinal microbiota has received increasing attention, as it influences growth, feed conversion, epithelial development, immunity as well as the intrusion of pathogenic microorganisms in the intestinal tract. in this study, pyrosequencing was used to explore the bacterial community of the intestine in gibel carp (carassius auratus gibelio), and the origin of these microorganisms. the results disclosed great bacterial diversities in the carp intestines and cultured environments. the gibel carp harbored characteristic intestinal microbiota, where proteobacteria were predominant, followed by firmicutes. the analysis on the 10 most abundant bacterial operational taxonomic units (otus) revealed a majority of firmicutes in the intestinal content (by decreasing order: veilonella sp., lachnospiraceae, lactobacillales, streptococcus sp., and lactobacillus sp.). the second most abundant otu was rothia sp. (actinobacteria). the most likely potential probiotics (lactobacillus sp., and bacillus sp.) and opportunists (aeromonas sp., and acinetobacter sp.) were not much abundant. bacterial community comparisons showed that the intestinal community was closely  related to that of the sediment, indicating the importance of sediment as source  of gut bacteria in gibel carp. however, 37.95 % of the otus detected in feed were retrieved in the intestine, suggesting that food may influence markedly the microbiota of gibel carp, and therefore may be exploited for oral administration  of probiotics.

TI  == antibiotic activity of tigecycline against clinical pathogens by the micro dilution method.
AB  == resistant pathogens are the cause of clinical infections which threatening the patients lives and challenging the health systems through their economic importance. therefore, new antibacterial agents with a broader spectrum of activity that protect against development of resistance are required. tigecycline (tygacil, wyeth) is a relatively new fda and emea approved glycylcycline antimicrobial with an expanded broad-spectrum activity against pathogens involved in complicated skin and skin structure infections. in this study we evaluated the in vitro activity of tigecycline in comparison to 14 other antibiotics against 182 clinical pathogens by use of the micro dilution method. in overall, tigecycline exhibited the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values in almost all bacteria with a mean of 0.52 +/- 1.25mg/l, followed by meropenem and levofloxacin (mean mic values 1.29 +/- 2.52 and 1.45 +/- 3.078 mg/l, respectively). mic50 and mic90 values of tigecycline were: 0.06 and 0.15 mg/l for e. coli, 0.12 and 1.00 mg/l for klebsiella sp., 0.12 and 0.85 mg/l for various enterobacter sp., 1.00 and 8.00 mg/l for pseudomonas sp., 0.25 and 1.00 mg/l for  acinetobacter sp., 0.06 and 0.12 mg/l for serratia sp., 0.12 and 0.25mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, 0.5 and 5.00 mg/l for streptococcus sp. the mic values recorded were among the lowest in recent literature for acinetobacter sp. (included a. baumannii), and comparable to those obtained for klebsiella, serratia and enterobacter indicating that tigecycline has a promising in vitro activity.

TI  == [usefulness and limit of gram staining smear examination].
AB  == gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. it yields results much faster than  culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. however, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from gram staining smears is also present. the gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. species of  gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive diplococcus, forming gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling streptococcus pneumoniae. acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, gram-negative  short rod in the sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. capnocytophaga sp. is a gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling fusobacterium nucleatum.

AB  == the objective of this multicenter study was to determine tigecycline susceptibility rates, measured by agar diffusion, in nine hospitals in santiago and to compare these rates with other antimicrobials. each center studied 20 strains per month. all intermediate and fully resistant strains as well as 10% of susceptibile strains were also studied by the broth microdilution method. overall, 2301 strains were studied displaying the following susceptibility rates  for tigecycline: 100% for streptococcus sp, enterococcus sp, and e. coli respectively, 99.8% for staphylococcus sp, 93% for klebsiella and 80% for acinetobacter baumarmii. for proteus, providencia and morganella the susceptibility rates were 4%. for cefotaxime-resistant klebsiella and imipenem-resistant a. baumarmii susceptibility rates were 95% and 80% respectively. the agar diffusion and broth dilution method were 100% concordant for tigecycline susceptible strains but only 27% for resistant or intermediate strains represented mostly by acinetobacter baumannii. the majority of these strains (57/59) proved to be susceptible after retesting. the great majority (96,6%) of strains tested from nine chilean hospitals proved to be susceptible to tigecycline with exception for proteus, providencia and morganella (66% resistance). using the agar diffusion method for measuring tigecycline susceptibility to a. baumannii may be misleading.

TI  == role of mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == eighty per cent of the cases of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aecopd) have an infective aetiology, atypical bacteria including mycoplasma pneumoniae accounting for 5-10 % of these. however, the importance of association of m. pneumoniae with episodes of aecopd still remains  doubtful. the present study was therefore undertaken to delineate the extent of involvement of m. pneumoniae in patients with aecopd at a referral hospital in delhi, india. sputum samples and throat swabs from a total of 100 aecopd patients attending the clinical research center of vallabhbhai patel chest institute, delhi, were collected during a 2-year period (january 2004-june 2006). the samples were investigated for the presence of aerobic bacterial pathogens and m.  pneumoniae. diagnosis of infection with m. pneumoniae was based on culture, serology, direct detection of m. pneumoniae specific antigen and pcr. bacterial aetiology could be established in 16 of the 100 samples studied. pseudomonas spp. were recovered from eight cases, streptococcus pneumoniae from four and klebsiella spp. from two cases. acinetobacter sp. and moraxella catarrhalis were  isolated from one case each. serological evidence of m. pneumoniae infection and/or detection of m. pneumoniae specific antigen were seen in 16 % of the cases. one case with definite evidence of m. pneumoniae infection also had coinfection with pseudomonas spp. however, no direct evidence of m. pneumoniae infection was found in our study population as defined by culture isolation or pcr. in conclusion, although the serological prevalence of m. pneumoniae infection in our study population was significantly higher than in the control group, there was no direct evidence of it playing a role in aecopd.

TI  == analysis of the composition of bacterial communities in oil reservoirs from a southern offshore brazilian basin.
AB  == the aim of this study was to characterize and compare the bacterial community structure of two distinct oil samples from a petroleum field in brazil by using both molecular, based on the construction of 16s rrna gene libraries, and cultivation methods. statistical comparisons of libraries based on amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) data revealed no significant differences between the communities recovered in the non-biodegraded (nbd) and highly biodegraded oils (hbd). blastn analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequences representative of distinct ribotypes from both oils showed the presence of nine different bacterial genera in these samples, encompassing members of the genera arcobacter, halanaerobium, marinobacter, propionibacterium, streptomyces, leuconostoc, acinetobacter, bacillus and streptococcus. enrichments obtained using oil as inoculum and sole carbon source yielded bacterial isolates showing high 16s rrna gene sequence similarity with achromobacter xylosoxidans, bacillus  subtilis, brevibacillus sp., dietzia sp. and methylobacterium sp. comparison between the data obtained using cultivation-independent and enrichment cultures suggests that different selection of community members may occur when using distinct approaches. all the organisms found, except for leuconostoc sp. and streptococus sp., have been previously reported in the literature as hydrocarbon  degraders and/or associated to oil field environments.

TI  == bacteria fauna from the house fly, musca domestica (l.).
AB  == the house fly, musca domestica has long been considered a potential agent for disease transmission ever since its existence. the general truth of this assertion remains undisputed till the present day in spite of increasing awareness toward an improved sanitation and better hygiene. the habitual movement of house fly from filthy substrata such as human faeces, animal excreta, carcasses, garbage, etc. makes them ideal candidates for disease transmission such as cholera, shigellosis, salmonellosis and others when settling on food. fly as a potential mechanical vector of pathogenic bacteria was elucidated in this study by examining flies from various breeding sites such as food courts, dumping ground, food processing areas and poultry farm in peninsular malaysia. the flies  were baited with 10% sugar solution on a glass slide in the field. all materials  used for collection of samples were sterile. bacteria from fly sample were isolated using the normal isolation technique. bacillus sp., coccobacillus sp., staphylococcus sp., microccus sp., streptococcus sp., acinetobacter sp., enterobacter sp., proteus sp., escherichia sp., klebsiella sp. and yeast cells were isolated from feaces, vomitus, external surfaces and internal organs of house fly. newly emerged house fly did not harbour any bacteria.

TI  == [guidelines for treatment of pneumonia in intensive care units].
AB  == patients affected by pneumonia can be admitted in intensive care units (icus) independently by the setting where the infection has been acquired (community, hospital, long-term care facilities); even more frequently pneumonia can develop  in patients already hospitalized in icu especially in those requiring mechanical  ventilation for different reasons. within the severe community acquired pneumonia requiring admission in icu, the most frequently responsible micro-organisms are mainly represented by streptococcus pneumoniae, but also by legionella and haemophilus. pseudomonas aeruginona, anyway, cannot be excluded. the most recent  canadian and american guidelines for treatment of the above mentioned infections  suggest the use of a combination therapy with beta-lactams (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam) and a new generation macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone. in case of allergy to beta-lactams, the association fluoroquinolone-clindamycin should be preferred. whenever a pseudomonas etiology is suspected because of the presence of risk factors such as copd, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, previous and/or frequent therapies with antibiotics and/or steroids, the same guidelines suggest the use of an anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam (such as piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenems, cefepime) associated with an anti-pseudomonas fluoroquinolone (high doses ciprofloxacin). an anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside or aminoglicosyde plus fluoroquinolone can be an alternative. early onset hospital acquired pneumonia (hap) and early onset ventilator associated pneumonia (vap) in patients without risk factors for multi-resistant etiological agents are generally sustained by s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, methicillin-susceptible staphylocccus aureus e gram negative enteric rods. these infections can be treated with one of the following antibiotics: ceftriaxone or fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin or ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) or ampicillin/sulbactam or ertapenem. late onset vap and hap in patients with risk factors for multi-resistant, by contrast, should be treated with a combination therapy: in case of defined or suspected p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl+), acinetobacter sp etiology, it is required the use of an anti-pseudomonas cephalosporin or an anti-pseudomonas carbapenem or b-lactam + beta-lactamase inhibitor associated with an anti-pseudomonas fluoroquinolone or an aminoglicoside. the possible presence of mrsa or legionella pneumophila suggests  the use of anti-gram positive antibiotics such as glycopeptides or linezolid. these quidelines confirm the role of ciprofloxacin combined with beta-lactams whenever p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl+), acinetobacter sp. etiology is suspected.

TI  == characterization of a 3944 da bacteriocin, produced by enterococcus mundtii st15, with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain st15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, propionibacterium sp., clostridium tyrobutyricum, acinetobacter baumanii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus caprinus. bacteriocin st15 is inactivated by proteinase k, pronase, pepsin, protease and triton x-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, triton x-100, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta. no change in activity was recorded after 2 h at ph values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100  degrees c for 90 min. activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees  c for 20 min. the mode of activity is bactericidal. the highest level of activity (51200 au ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in mrs broth, ph 6.5. bacteriocin st15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for enterococcus spp. by being active against gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.

TI  == employment of broad-range 16s rrna pcr to detect aetiological agents of infection from clinical specimens in patients with acute meningitis--rapid separation of 16s rrna pcr amplicons without the need for cloning.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to develop a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page) method for the rapid separation of 16s rrna pcr amplicons from aetiological agents of acute meningitis. methods and results: blood samples from  40 patients with suspected acute meningococcal meningitis were examined for the presence of causal agents, including neisseria meningitidis employing two methods: (i) broad-range 16s rrna pcr in conjunction with page and automated sequencing and (ii) species-specific pcr employing abi taqman technology for n. meningitidis. analysis of clinical specimens employing 16s rrna pcr yielded 33/40 (82.5%) positive for the presence of bacterial dna. species-specific pcr yielded  30/40 (75%) clinical specimens positive for n. meningitidis. prior to separation  by page, only 6/33 (18.2%) amplicons were able to be identified by sequence analysis, the remaining amplicons (n=27) did not yield an identification due to the presence of mixed 16s rrna pcr amplicons. following separation, amplicons were re-amplified and sequenced, yielding 24/27 (88.9%) positive for n. meningitidis and three specimens positive for acinetobacter sp., staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. one specimen was positive for both n. meningitidis and streptococcus spp. and another specimen was positive for n. meningitidis and pseudomonas sp., by broad-range pcr. seven clinical specimens were negative for n. meningitidis and other eubacteria using both detection techniques. conclusions: clinical specimens including blood and cerebrospinal fluid from patients with suspected acute bacterial meningitis, may become contaminated with commensal skin flora, resulting in difficulties in downstream sequencing of pathogen plus contaminant dna. this study allows for the rapid separation of amplified pathogen from contaminant dna. significance and impact of study: this study demonstrated the usefulness of the rapid separation of multiple 16s rrna pcr amplicons using a combination of page and automated sequencing, without the need of cloning. adoption of this technique is therefore proposed when trying to rapidly identify pathogens in clinical specimens employing broad-range 16s rrna pcr.

TI  == expression of bacterial beta-glucuronidase in human bile: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: bacterial beta-glucuronidase causes deconjugation of bilirubin diglucuronide resulting in the precipitation of calcium bilirubinate, which contributes to biliary sludge and stone formation. this process is attributed to  enzyme activity produced by the aerobic enterobacteriaceae such as escherichia coli and klebsiella sp. the presence of clostridium sp. was detected in 48 of 56  intrahepatic stones by using polymerase chain reaction techniques and cultured clostridium perfringens from 14 of 18 unblocked biliary stents. such bacteria are reported to produce beta-glucuronidase activity. the aim of this study was to determine the proportion of biliary bacteria isolated from pigment stones and stents that produce beta-glucuronidase and to compare the enzyme activity expressed by the different bacteria in human bile. methods: a total of 202 bacteria were isolated from blocked and unblocked biliary stents and pigment ductal stones recovered from patients. of these, 61 bacteria expressed beta-glucuronidase activity in brain heart infusion broth. these 61 bacteria were subsequently grown in human bile under aerobic or anaerobic conditions to the early stationary phase and assayed for beta-glucuronidase activity by using rho-nitrophenyl beta-d glucuronide as substrate. results were normalized and reported as units of enzyme activity per milligram protein of the bacteria. results: c. perfringens produced beta-glucuronidase enzyme activity that was 34-fold higher than that for e coli, staphylococcus, corynebacterium sp., bacillus sp., enterococcus sp., acinetobacter sp., streptococcus sp., and klebsiella sp. conclusion: c. perfringens with its higher enzyme activity is more important in the deconjugation of bilirubin diglucuronide than e coli and klebsiella sp.

TI  == [hospital acquired pneumonia--analysis of frequency and etiology in polish hospitals in 1998].
AB  == hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) is one of the most frequently occurring hospital infections in the world. this study describes the incidence of hap in poland, as well as the specific risk factors leading to this type of infection in polish hospitals; including those of patient age, length of hospitalization, and  use of mechanical ventilation. the epidemiology of hap as well as treatment resistance of various causal organisms was studied. data for this study was acquired from the registry of hospital-acquired infectious diseases for the year  1998. out of 329,608 hospital-acquired infections in all patients except newborns, 920 were found to be hap. this study showed that of every 1000 hospital admissions three patients developed hap (0.3%). death occurred in 260 of 920 hap  cases or 30%; and hap found to be the direct cause of death in 66 of the 260 cases (25%). the greatest incidence of hap was found to occur in patients older than 75 years, was directly related to the length of hospital stay, and was higher in patients on mechanical ventilation longer than 10 days. the most frequently isolated causal agents were the gram-negative rods (pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter sp., klebsiella sp., enterobacter sp.), and staphylococcus aureus. streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were found in only 2% and 4% of cases, respectively, and thus were the least likely causes of hap in this population. it was found that the percentage of methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus was very high (55% to 60%); vancomycin-resistant enterococci were only found in patients who did not undergo surgery. the isolated strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa showed marked resistance to chinolones (58-76%) and to imipen (approximately 20%). in the enterobacteriaceae family, klebsiella sp. was found to be resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (56-73%) and enterobacter sp. resistant in 55% to 81% of the isolates.

TI  == 16s rdna-based identification of bacteria from conjunctival swabs by pcr and dgge fingerprinting.
AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

TI  == [a comparative study of antibacterial activity of ceftibuten, ceftazidime, cefuroxime and ampicillin against clinical isolates].
AB  == ceftibuten is an orally active third generation new cephalosporin. its antibacterial activity in vitro was tested to many clinical isolates and was compared to the activity of ceftazidime, cefuroxime and ampicillin, by twofold serial dilution method in muller-hinton agar--detection of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and by the disc-diffusion method of kirby-bauer. the new cephalosporin demonstrated great activity against the different clinical important strains. many resistant strains to ampicillin were high susceptible to  ceftibuten. the majority of gram-negative organisms, including enterobacteriaceae, the respiratory pathogens m.(b.) catarrhalis and h. influenzae are highly susceptible to ceftibuten, however pseudomonas, acinetobacter are resistant. the majority of methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus are resistant too. new cephallosporin was also active against s. pyogenes (streptococcus gr. a) and penicillin-susceptible pneumococci, but was inactive against s. agalactiae (streptococcus gr. b), s. pneumoniae penicillin-resistant strains and enterococci, similar to the other cephalosporins. the activity of ceftibuten was higher than that of ampicillin and cefuroxime against beta-lactamases positive strains of h. influenzae and m.(b) catarrhalis, also against tested strains of enterobacteriaceae. the major priority of the new antibacterial agent over other cephalosporins and ampicillin  is its stability to hydrolysis by the main broad-spectrum beta-lactamases producing e. coli and k. pneumoniae sp.

TI  == comb, a novel competence gene required for natural transformation of acinetobacter sp. bd413: identification, characterization, and analysis of growth-phase-dependent regulation.
AB  == here we describe five tandemly arranged and converging orfs in acinetobacter sp.  bd413, namely lytb, orfy, orfx, comb, and orfz, located upstream of the previously identified competence gene comc. the n-termini of the deduced proteins orfy and comb exhibit the conserved endopeptidase cleavage motifs of prepilin proteins; the deduced protein comb is similar to type iv pilins. lytb is similar  to the escherichia coli lytb, which has been implicated in the stringent response. no homologues of orfx, orfy and orfz could be identified. a mutation in orfy or orfz led to 100-fold reduced transformation frequencies and a mutation in comb resulted in a non-competent phenotype. disruption of lytb did not affect the natural transformation phenotype. complementation studies clearly demonstrated that comb is involved in natural transformation, whereas the transformation-deficient phenotypes of orfy and orfz mutants were due to polar effects on comb and comc, respectively. analyses of the twitching motility phenotype and of the ultrastructure of the noncompetent comb mutant suggested that the competence gene comb is not essential for the biogenesis of type iv pili and expression of the type iv pili-associated property of twitching motility. transcriptional fusions between comb and a promoter-free lacz gene were constructed, and analysis of growth-phase-dependent transcription revealed increased expression of comb during prolonged exponential and stationary phases.

AB  == although the high level of competence for natural transformation of acinetobacter sp. strain bd413 has been the subject of numerous studies, only two competence genes, comc and comp, have been identified to date. by chromosomal walking analysis we found two overlapping open reading frames, designated come and comf,  starting 61 bp downstream of comc. come and comf are expressed as stable proteins in escherichia coli, thus proving that they are indeed coding regions, but expression was successful only with 5'-deleted genes. come and comf are similar to pilins and pilin-like components. both genes were mutated, and the phenotypes  of the mutants were analyzed. natural transformation in comf mutants is 1,000-fold reduced, whereas come mutants exhibit 10-fold-reduced transformation frequencies. this is clear evidence that come and comf are involved in natural transformation. however, come and comf are specific for dna translocation, since  come and comf defects affected neither piliation nor lipase secretion. these results suggest that the type iv pili, the general protein secretion pathway, and the dna translocation machinery in acinetobacter sp. strain bd413 are evolutionary related but functionally distinct systems.

TI  == [the role of carbapenems in the treatment of nosocomial infection].
AB  == carbapenems are active beta-lactam antibiotics versus most of the gram positive and gram negative microorganisms and anaerobes although their activity is lacking in the case of staphylococcus sp. resistant to methicillin, enterococcus faecium  and streptococcus pneumoniae with high resistance to penicillin and some gram negative bacilli which naturally produce an methaloenzyme able to hydrolyze them  such as stenotrophomonas maltophilia. imipenem, the first synthetized carbapenem  requires administration with cilastatin to avoid inactivation by renal dehydropeptidase 1. meropenem does not require being taken with the renal enzyme  inhibitor, with its activity being similar to that of imipenem. in abdominal infection the carbapenems have shown to be the authentic monotherapy in this type of infections being as effective as the different schedules of antibiotic associations normally used. treatment with carbapenems in bacterial meningitis should be currently limited to the cases produced by gram negative bacilli producers of wide spectrum beta-lactamases (wsbl), cases of meningitis by pseudomonas aeruginosa or gram negative bacilli producers of inducible cephalosporinase. meropenem is the carbapenem of choice probably in these cases because the carbapenems are often the only active antibiotics and meropenem, specifically, does not have the risk of convulsions observed with imipenem-cilastatin. the carbapenems have shown to be useful in skin and soft tissue infections as well as in obstetric and gynecologic infections as monotherapy similar to the schedules of the currently used antibiotic associations. in the case of nosocomial pneumonias, all the studies have evaluated the carbapenems in monotherapy as useful and effective, specially in the case of pneumonia by gram negative bacilli. finally, in non filiated nosocomial sepsis and specially in the case of neutropenic patients, the use of carbapenems is particularly attractive in gram negative sepsis in intensive care  units. the appearance in the last few years of strains of gram negative bacilli,  producers of wide spectrum beta-lactamase or stable repressed hyperproducers of class i chromosomic cephalosporinase, as well as other multiresistant gram negative bacilli, such as acinetobacter baumanii make the carbapenems, in many cases, the only effective antibiotic in this type of infections.

TI  == [study on septicaemia in infants and children in the past 20 years. part 1. an analysis of causal organisms].
AB  == causal organisms and their changes were evaluated in 158 cases of septicaemia admitted to jikei university hospital from 1975 to 1994. eighty patients (50.6%)  were aged less than 1 year, and 37 patients (23.4%) were newborns. the average mortality rate was 18.4%. the mortality rate between 1975 and 1984 was 26.8%, and that of the past 10 years (from 1985 to 1994) decreased to 13.7%. staphylococcus  aureus (29 cases, 19.4%) was the most common pathogens isolated, followed by pseudomonas sp. (24 cases, 15.2%), escherichia coli (19 cases, 12.0%), and haemophilus influenzae (18 cases, 11.4%). h. influenzae, acinetobacter sp., streptococcus pneumoniae and group b streptococcus (gbs) increased in the past 10 years (from 1985 to 1994), compared with the preceding 10 years (from 1975 to 1984). the mortality rate of klebsiella sp. septicaemia (28.6%) was highest, followed by pseudomonas sp. (25.0%), s. aureus (24.1%), s. pneumoniae (22.2%). h. influenzae and acinetobacter sp. septicaemia were not fatal. e. coli and gbs were common among neonates and patients aged less than 1 year. h. influenzae septicaemia occurred mainly in patients with meningitis, in those younger than school age. acinetobacter sp. was common among neonates and children with leukaemia pseudomonas sp., klebsiella sp., and acinetobacter sp. were mainly detected in patients with underlying diseases. e. coli, h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae and gbs were mainly detected in patients without underlying diseases.

TI  == childhood bacteremia in israel: causes, age relation, predisposing factors and source.
AB  == to delineate the spectrum of childhood bacteremia in a tertiary medical center in israel and to define the historical, clinical and environmental variables that affect it, 339 bacteremic episodes were studied. ten of the episodes (3%) were polymicrobial and 148 (44%) were hospital acquired. staphylococcus epidermidis (17%), staph. aureus (10%), gram-negative bacilli and haemophilus influenzae (7%) were the most frequent etiologic pathogens. some organisms (e.g., h. influenzae,  streptococcus pneumoniae) caused mainly community-acquired bacteremia, while klebsiella sp., enterococcus faecalis, and acinetobacter sp. caused mainly nosocomial bacteremia. underlying conditions were noted in 72% of the bacteremic  children. a source of the bacteremia was identified in 60% of the episodes; the most common was i.v.-line infection. age, underlying condition, source and location in the hospital markedly affected the profile of microorganisms causing  childhood bacteremia. each of these variables defined 3-5 organisms that were most prominent. in each episode of suspected bacteremia, these variables should be considered, thus defining the most likely causative pathogen(s), which should  be covered by appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment.

TI  == antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). only one strain each of enterococcus faecium and pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and clostridium perfringens. both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, streptococcus pyogenes and bacteroides sp. all other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin  which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.

TI  == [effects of antibiotics and anti-bacterial components of preparations for local treatment of suppurative wounds on pathogens of odonto- genic infections].
AB  == the results of identification and sensitivity assay of 156 strains of pathogens causing odontogenic infections are presented. in the sensitivity assay antibacterial drugs were used. 42.3 percent of the strains were obligate anaerobes belonging to bacteroides, fusobacterium, peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, veillonella and actinomyces. significant differences in the microbial sensitivity to the drugs used for general and local therapy were detected. there was observed high sensitivity of the obligate anaerobes to gramicidin (0.02 micrograms/ml), nitazol (10 micrograms/ml), levomycetin and tetracycline (60 micrograms/ml). antiseptics such as dioxidine and chlorhexidine  used locally showed satisfactory results. the above mentioned drugs and especially levomycetin were also rather active against facultative organisms in associations of pathogens causing odontogenic infections: bacillus coagulans, b.  licheniformis, pseudomonas sp., acinetobacter calcoaceticus, staphylococcus sp. and streptococcus sp.

TI  == [clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  == fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (ipm/cs) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. there were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9  with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with  fever of unknown origin. forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. the overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. the efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. bacteriologically, staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), streptococcus  pneumoniae (5), streptococcus pyogenes (1), other gram-positive coccus (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (8), haemophilus influenzae (4), pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), serratia marcescens (3), escherichia coli (3), branhamella catarrhalis (1),  citrobacter freundii (1), klebsiella oxytoca (1), enterobacter sp. (1), and peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. p. aeruginosa (3) and acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. s. aureus (1), s. epidermidis (1), p. aeruginosa (5), and s. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. the eradication rate was 83.7%. six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of s-got 2. but all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. these findings indicate that ipm/cs is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

AB  == in a systematic approach, 37 duplicate samples of open system circuits (bennett ma-1 ventilators) of patients in medical and surgical intensive care units were processed by direct and serial (apha guidelines) dilutions. the paired difference test on 15 of the in-use circuitry solution samples indicated no difference between the direct and serial dilution methods (p less than 0.001). seventy-seven additional respiratory therapy circuitry samples from similar intensive care patients were analyzed via a direct dilution method alone and processed microbiologically. the direct dilution procedure was a rapid and accurate means of evaluation of microbial contamination in the range of greater than or equal to 10 to less than or equal to 10(6) cfu/ml. high densities of organisms frequently  were found. sites of contamination included the proximal or patient end of the circuitry (heaviest), the nebulizer trap, and the distal or humidifier portions of the circuitry. the contaminants found were predominantly gram-negative nonfermenters: acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. antitratus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas maltophilia, and flavobacterium meningosepticum. fermenters were klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus sp., enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and enterobacter agglomerans. infrequently, gram-positive streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. were noted.

TI  == isolations of aerobic bacteria from wild desert bighorn sheep (ovis canadensis nelsoni and o. c. mexicana) in arizona.
AB  == nasal, pharyngeal, cervical and vaginal swab specimens were obtained from 74 desert bighorn sheep for the purpose of investigating the normal aerobic bacterial flora of wild sheep. a total of 281 isolates was obtained and identified by standard microbiologic tests. one hundred seven of these isolates were gram positive and included bacillus sp. (36%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8%), s. aureus (4%), corynebacterium sp. (diphtheroids, 4%), and streptococcus sp. (48%). gram negative isolates totaled 174 and included neisseria sp. (18%), citrobacter sp. (3%), enterobacter sp. (2%), escherichia coli (2%), proteus sp. (2%) and non-fermentative bacilli (nfb) (73%). of the nfb isolates, pseudomonas sp. (25%), acinetobacter sp. (18%), moraxella sp. (15%) were identified.

TI  == in vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  == norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. we examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including  anaerobic species. it inhibited 90% (mic90) of strains of escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, salmonella and shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. the mics of proteus mirabilis, morganella sp., proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, and providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 of serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the mic50, the mic75, and the mic90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic50 of pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the mic90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. yersinia, arizona, and aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was campylobacter. the activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the mic90s of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. all listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. the activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, ph, or inoculum size. there was no major difference between mic and minimum bactericidal concentration values. norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.

TI  == [minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of cefoperazone, cefotaxime,  cefuroxime and cefalotin against 90 bacterial strains].
AB  == in this work, the sensitivity in vitro of cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, cefoperazone and cephalothin have been examined. test of sensitivity in vitro have been performed as by kirby-bauer method as by measurement of mic and mbc. then the regression lines have been determined. cefotaxime and cefoperazone provided nearly complete coverage of all enterobacteriaceae; 80% were inhibited at less than or equal to 2 mcg./ml. this value is far below therapeutically attainable serum concentrations. cefotaxime has mic lower than cefoperazone. it has a significant spectrum of activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, nonenterococcal streptococcus sp, non enterobacteriaceae gram-negative bacilli. only enterococci and acinetobacter species were relatively resistant to cefoperazone and cefotaxime. the cephalothin and the cefoxitin included excellent antimicrobial coverage of the staphylococci and the anaerobic bacteria respectively.

TI  == arthritis in ducks. i. aetiology and public health aspects.
AB  == a pure culture of potentially pathogenic bacteria was obtained from 90% of 233 joints examined, originating from 232 ducks condemned due to arthritis at slaughter. s. typhi-murium and staph. aureus were isolated from 61% and 18% of the joints respectively. e. coli was obtained from 6% of the cases, serogroup 078 being most prevalent. e. rhusiopathiae, y. pseudo-tuberculosis, p. vulgaris, micrococcus sp., streptococcus sp., acinetobacter sp., flavobacterium sp., pseudomonas sp. and ae. formicans made up 12 cases. serotypes other than s. typhi-murium were prevalent among ducks from all farms investigated, but s. typhi-murium was the only serotype demonstrated in arthritis. a high incidence of s. typhi-murium in the intestinal tract of ducks maintained on free range or in open houses suggests that these sites are sources of infection and that the intestinal tract is the portal of entry for s. typhi-murium causing arthritis. ducks with arthritis at slaughter should always be totally condemned because of the public health hazard from the organisms most often associated with this condition.

TI  == bb-k 122: in vitro and in vivo activity against ocular pathogens.
AB  == bb-k 122 is a new aminoglycoside antibiotic and an analogue of amikacin. this study evaluated the in vitro and in vivo activity of bb-k 122 and gentamicin against important ocular pathogens. bb-k 122 and gentamicin demonstrated generally equivalent in vitro antibacterial activity, except that gentamicin was  more active against streptococcus sp. bb-k 122 showed significant in vitro activity against important ophthalmic pathogens, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and species of klebsiella, escherichia, proteus, haemophilus, and moraxella. solutions of bb-k 122 (1%) and gentamicin sulfate (0.3%) were compared in an experimentally induced rabbit keratoconjunctivitis model. rabbit eyes infected with p. aeruginosa or s.  pneumoniae were treated with one of the two antibiotic formulations and evaluated after 24 h. a topical formulation of 1% bb-k 122 was at least as effective as gentamicin sulfate (0.3%) solution against these infections.

TI  == [kinetics of setting up of a human fecal flora in germ free mice and trial of decontamination of antibiotherapy (author's transl)].
AB  == we have tried in this study to reproduce in germfree mice a bacterial equilibrium observed previously in the gastrointestinal tract of child "l.n.", reared in a plastic isolator. eight bacterial strains were studied. seven had been fortuitously introduced: acinetobacter lwoffi ln1, staphylococcus epidermidis ln2, clostridium perfringens ln3, plectridium anatum ln4, streptococcus bovis ln5, enterobacter cloacae ln6, corynebacterium sp ln7. the eighth strain was purposely administered to the child in order to take advantage of an antagonism between this strain and spontaneously acquired flora. this strain is bacillus licheniformis fd1. the gnotoxenic mice proved to be a good experimental model because we found their bacterial equilibrium comparable to that observed in child l.n. in addition, we studied the decontamination procedures of the gastrointestinal tract of mice by observing both the antagonism of b. licheniformis with bacitracin, and the action of a suitable mixture of antibiotics. conditions for the realization of this decontamination are discussed in this study.
