plantaricin ld1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of lactobacillus plantarum ld1.
plantaricin ld1, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum ld1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees c for 20 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a ph range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. the crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase k showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. the molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kda, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. it inhibited not only related strains but also other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as lactobacillus curvatus nrrl b-4562, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis nrrl b-1821, enterococcus faecium nrrl b-2354, enterobacter cloacae nrrl b-14298, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, urogenic escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri and vibrio sp. these properties of plantaricin ld1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.
high-level gene expression in lactobacillus plantarum using a pheromone-regulated bacteriocin promoter.
aims: to use promoters and regulatory genes involved in the production of the bacteriocin sakacin p to obtain high-level regulated gene expression in lactobacillus plantarum. methods and results: in a plasmid containing all three operons naturally involved in sakacin p production, the genes encoding sakacin p and its immunity protein were replaced by the aminopeptidase n gene from lactococcus lactis (pepn) or the beta-glucuronidase gene from escherichia coli (gusa). the new genes were precisely fused to the start codon of the sakacin p gene and the stop codon of the immunity gene. this set-up permitted regulated (external pheromone controlled) overexpression of both reporter genes in l. plantarum nc8. for pepn, production levels amounted to as much as 40% of total cellular protein. conclusions: promoters and regulatory genes involved in production of sakacin p are suitable for establishing inducible high-level gene expression in l. plantarum. significance and impact of the study: this study describes a system for controllable gene expression in lactobacilli, giving some of the highest expression levels reported so far in this genus.
intra-specific variation of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus pentosus in sensitivity towards various bacteriocins.
fifty-two strains belonging to the lactobacillus plantarum species group were identified and typed. they represented 32 clones of lactobacillus plantarum and 7 clones of lactobacillus pentosus. sensitivity of all strains towards bacteriocins of four different producer strains was investigated using a deferred inhibition test (dit). substantial intra-specific variation in sensitivity of clones was observed towards bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria producing nisin ( lactococcus lactis atcc 11454) or pediocin pa-1 ( pediococcus acidilactici pac-1.0), while none of the strains were sensitive towards the two remaining bacteriocin producers. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of nisin towards selected strains confirmed the dit results. no correlation between the susceptibility of fourteen selected strains towards nisin and an array of antibiotics was found. the present study indicates that the variation in bacteriocin-sensitivity within target species might be a potential limitation for the application of bacteriocins as biopreservatives.
use of bacteriocin promoters for gene expression in lactobacillus plantarum c11.
aims: to exploit promoters involved in production of the bacteriocin sakacin p for regulated overexpression of genes in lactobacillus plantarum c11. methods and results: production of sakacin p by lact. sakei lth673 is controlled by a peptide-based quorum sensing system that drives strong, regulated promoters. one of these promoters (porfx) was used to establish regulated overexpression of genes encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase from bacillus pumilus, aminopeptidase n from lactococcus lactis or chitinase b from serratia marcescens in lact. plantarum c11, a strain that naturally possesses the regulatory machinery that is necessary for promoter activation. the expression levels obtained were highly dependent on which gene was used and on how the promoter was coupled to this gene. the highest expression levels (14% of total cellular protein) were obtained with the aminopeptidase n gene translationally fused to the regulated promoter. conclusions: sakacin promoters permit regulated expression of a variety of genes in lact. plantarum c11. significance and impact of the study: this study shows the usefulness of regulated bacteriocin promoters for developing new gene expression systems for lactic acid bacteria, in particular lactobacilli.
purification and genetic characterization of plantaricin nc8, a novel coculture-inducible two-peptide bacteriocin from lactobacillus plantarum nc8.
a new, coculture-inducible two-peptide bacteriocin named plantaricin nc8 (plnc8)  was isolated from lactobacillus plantarum nc8 cultures which had been induced with lactococcus lactis mg1363 or pediococcus pentosaceus fbb63. this bacteriocin consists of two distinct peptides, named alpha and beta, which were separated by c(2)-c(18) reverse-phase chromatography and whose complementary action is necessary for full plantaricin nc8 activity. n-terminal sequencing of both purified peptides showed 28 and 34 amino acids residues for plnc8 alpha and plnc8 beta, respectively, which showed no sequence similarity to other known bacteriocins. mass spectrometry analysis showed molecular masses of 3,587 da (alpha) and 4,000 da (beta). the corresponding genes, designated plnc8a and plnc8b, were sequenced, and their nucleotide sequences revealed that both peptides are produced as bacteriocin precursors of 47 and 55 amino acids, respectively, which include n-terminal leader sequences of the double-glycine type. the mature alpha and beta peptides contain 29 and 34 amino acids, respectively. an open reading frame, orfc, which encodes a putative immunity protein was found downstream of plnc8b and overlapping plnc8a. upstream of the putative -35 region of plnc8b, two direct repeats of 9 bp were identified, which agrees with the consensus sequence and structure of promoters of class ii bacteriocin operons whose expression is dependent on an autoinduction mechanism.
