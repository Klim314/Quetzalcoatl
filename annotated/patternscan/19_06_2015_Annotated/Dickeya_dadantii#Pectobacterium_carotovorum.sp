TI  == identification of host-microbe interaction factors in the genomes of soft rot-associated pathogens dickeya dadantii 3937 and pectobacterium carotovorum wpp14 with supervised machine learning.
AB  == background: a wealth of genome sequences has provided thousands of genes of unknown function, but identification of functions for the large numbers of hypothetical genes in phytopathogens remains a challenge that impacts all research on plant-microbe interactions. decades of research on the molecular basis of pathogenesis focused on a limited number of factors associated with long-known host-microbe interaction systems, providing limited direction into this challenge. computational approaches to identify virulence genes often rely on two strategies: searching for sequence similarity to known host-microbe interaction factors from other organisms, and identifying islands of genes that discriminate between pathogens of one type and closely related non-pathogens or pathogens of a different type. the former is limited to known genes, excluding vast collections of genes of unknown function found in every genome. the latter lacks specificity, since many genes in genomic islands have little to do with host-interaction. result: in this study, we developed a supervised machine learning approach that was designed to recognize patterns from large and disparate data types, in order to identify candidate host-microbe interaction factors. the soft rot enterobacteriaceae strains dickeya dadantii 3937 and pectobacterium carotovorum wpp14 were used for development of this tool, because  these pathogens are important on multiple high value crops in agriculture worldwide and more genomic and functional data is available for the enterobacteriaceae than any other microbial family. our approach achieved greater than 90% precision and a recall rate over 80% in 10-fold cross validation tests.  conclusion: application of the learning scheme to the complete genome of these two organisms generated a list of roughly 200 candidates, many of which were previously not implicated in plant-microbe interaction and many of which are of completely unknown function. these lists provide new targets for experimental validation and further characterization, and our approach presents a promising pattern-learning scheme that can be generalized to create a resource to study host-microbe interactions in other bacterial phytopathogens.

TI  == top 10 plant pathogenic bacteria in molecular plant pathology.
AB  == many plant bacteriologists, if not all, feel that their particular microbe should appear in any list of the most important bacterial plant pathogens. however, to our knowledge, no such list exists. the aim of this review was to survey all bacterial pathologists with an association with the journal molecular plant pathology and ask them to nominate the bacterial pathogens they would place in a  'top 10' based on scientific/economic importance. the survey generated 458 votes  from the international community, and allowed the construction of a top 10 bacterial plant pathogen list. the list includes, in rank order: (1) pseudomonas  syringae pathovars; (2) ralstonia solanacearum; (3) agrobacterium tumefaciens; (4) xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae; (5) xanthomonas campestris pathovars; (6) xanthomonas axonopodis pathovars; (7) erwinia amylovora; (8) xylella fastidiosa;  (9) dickeya (dadantii and solani); (10) pectobacterium carotovorum (and pectobacterium atrosepticum). bacteria garnering honourable mentions for just missing out on the top 10 include clavibacter michiganensis (michiganensis and sepedonicus), pseudomonas savastanoi and candidatus liberibacter asiaticus. this  review article presents a short section on each bacterium in the top 10 list and  its importance, with the intention of initiating discussion and debate amongst the plant bacteriology community, as well as laying down a benchmark. it will be  interesting to see, in future years, how perceptions change and which bacterial pathogens enter and leave the top 10.

TI  == slya regulates type iii secretion system (t3ss) genes in parallel with the t3ss master regulator hrpl in dickeya dadantii 3937.
AB  == the hypersensitive response and pathogenicity (hrp) genes of dickeya dadantii 3937 encode a type iii secretion system (t3ss) which is essential for its full virulence. previous studies of the t3ss regulation in d. dadantii 3937 revealed that the expression of the hrp genes is regulated by a master regulator, hrpl, through the hrpx-hrpy-hrps-hrpl and gacs-gaca-rsmb-rsma pathways. in this work, we identified a novel regulator of the slya/marr family, slya, which regulates hrp genes of the hrpl regulon in parallel with hrpl in d. dadantii. slya regulates the t3ss in a two-tier manner. it negatively regulates the expression of hrpl by downregulating hrps and upregulating rsma. interestingly, concomitant  with its downregulation of the hrpl, slya positively regulates the expression of  hrpa and hrpn, two hrp genes located in the hrpl regulon. in contrast to pectobacterium carotovorum, the expression of slya is not controlled by expr and  expi in d. dadantii 3937. we further show that slya is involved in controlling swimming motility and pellicle formation in d. dadantii 3937.

TI  == specificity of monoclonal antibodies to strains of dickeya sp. that cause bacterial heart rot of pineapple.
AB  == during a severe outbreak of bacterial heart rot that occurred in pineapple plantations on oahu, hawaii, in 2003 and years following, 43 bacterial strains were isolated from diseased plants or irrigation water and identified as erwinia  chrysanthemi (now dickeya sp.) by phenotypic, molecular, and pathogenicity assays. rep-pcr fingerprint patterns grouped strains from pineapple plants and irrigation water into five genotypes (a-e) that differed from representatives of  other dickeya species, pectobacterium carotovorum and other enteric saprophytes isolated from pineapple. monoclonal antibodies produced following immunization of mice with virulent type c dickeya sp. showed only two specificities. mab pine-1 (2d11g1, igg1 with kappa light chain) reacted to all 43 pineapple/water strains and some reference strains (d. dianthicola, d. chrysanthemi, d. paradisiaca, some d. dadantii, and uncharacterized dickeya sp.) but did not react to reference strains of d. dieffenbachiae, d. zeae, or one of the two malaysian pineapple strains. mab pine-2 (2a7f2, igg3 with kappa light chain) reacted to all type b, c, and d strains but not to any a or e strains or any reference strains except dickeya sp. isolated from malaysian pineapple. pathogenicity tests showed that type c strains were more aggressive than type a strains when inoculated during cool months. therefore, mab pine-2 distinguishes the more virulent type c strains from less virulent type a pineapple strains and type e water strains. mabs with these two specificities enable development of rapid diagnostic tests that will distinguish the systemic heart rot pathogen from opportunistic bacteria associated with rotted tissues. use of the two mabs in field assays also permits  the monitoring of a known subpopulation and provides additional decision tools for disease containment and management practices.

TI  == microarray comparative genomic hybridisation analysis incorporating genomic organisation, and application to enterobacterial plant pathogens.
AB  == microarray comparative genomic hybridisation (acgh) provides an estimate of the relative abundance of genomic dna (gdna) taken from comparator and reference organisms by hybridisation to a microarray containing probes that represent sequences from the reference organism. the experimental method is used in a number of biological applications, including the detection of human chromosomal aberrations, and in comparative genomic analysis of bacterial strains, but optimisation of the analysis is desirable in each problem domain.we present a method for analysis of bacterial acgh data that encodes spatial information from  the reference genome in a hidden markov model. this technique is the first such method to be validated in comparisons of sequenced bacteria that diverge at the strain and at the genus level: pectobacterium atrosepticum scri1043 (pba1043) and dickeya dadantii 3937 (dda3937); and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis il1403 and  l. lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363. in all cases our method is found to outperform  common and widely used acgh analysis methods that do not incorporate spatial information. this analysis is applied to comparisons between commercially important plant pathogenic soft-rotting enterobacteria (sre) pba1043, p. atrosepticum scri1039, p. carotovorum 193, and dda3937.our analysis indicates that it should not be assumed that hybridisation strength is a reliable proxy for sequence identity in acgh experiments, and robustly extends the applicability of  acgh to bacterial comparisons at the genus level. our results in the sre further  provide evidence for a dynamic, plastic 'accessory' genome, revealing major genomic islands encoding gene products that provide insight into, and may play a  direct role in determining, variation amongst the sre in terms of their environmental survival, host range and aetiology, such as phytotoxin synthesis, multidrug resistance, and nitrogen fixation.

TI  == distinguishing bacterial pathogens of potato using a genome-wide microarray approach.
AB  == a set of 9676 probes was designed for the most harmful bacterial pathogens of potato and tested in a microarray format. gene-specific probes could be designed  for all genes of pectobacterium atrosepticum, c. 50% of the genes of streptomyces scabies and c. 30% of the genes of clavibacter michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus utilizing the whole-genome sequence information available. for streptomyces turgidiscabies, 226 probes were designed according to the sequences of a pathogenicity island containing important virulence genes. in addition, probes were designed for the virulence-associated nip (necrosis-inducing protein) genes  of p. atrosepticum, p. carotovorum and dickeya dadantii and for the intergenic spacer (igs) sequences of the 16s-23s rrna gene region. ralstonia solanacearum was not included in the study, because it is a quarantine organism and is not presently found in finland, but a few probes were also designed for this species. the probes contained on average 40 target-specific nucleotides and were synthesized on the array in situ, organized as eight sub-arrays with an identical set of probes which could be used for hybridization with different samples. all bacteria were readily distinguished using a single channel system for signal detection. nearly all of the c. 1000 probes designed for c. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus, c. 50% and 40% of the c. 4000 probes designed for the genes of s. scabies and p. atrosepticum, respectively, and over 100 probes for s. turgidiscabies showed significant signals only with the respective species. p. atrosepticum, p. carotovorum and dickeya strains were all detected with 110 common probes. by contrast, the strains of these species were found to differ in  their signal profiles. probes targeting the igs region and nip genes could be used to place strains of dickeya to two groups, which correlated with differences in virulence. taken together, the approach of using a custom-designed, genome-wide microarray provided a robust means for distinguishing the bacterial pathogens of potato.

TI  == the phytopathogen dickeya dadantii (erwinia chrysanthemi 3937) is a pathogen of the pea aphid.
AB  == dickeya dadantii (erwinia chrysanthemi) is a phytopathogenic bacterium causing soft rot diseases on many crops. the sequencing of its genome identified four genes encoding homologues of the cyt family of insecticidal toxins from bacillus  thuringiensis, which are not present in the close relative pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. atrosepticum. the pathogenicity of d. dadantii was tested on the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum, and the bacterium was shown to be highly virulent for this insect, either by septic injury or by oral infection. the lethal inoculum dose was calculated to be as low as 10 ingested bacterial cells.  a d. dadantii mutant with the four cytotoxin genes deleted showed a reduced per os virulence for a. pisum, highlighting the potential role of at least one of these genes in pathogenicity. since only one bacterial pathogen of aphids has been previously described (erwinia aphidicola), other species from the same bacterial group were tested. the pathogenic trait for aphids was shown to be widespread, albeit variable, within the phytopathogens, with no link to phylogenetic positioning in the enterobacteriaceae. previously characterized gut  symbionts from thrips (erwinia/pantoea group) were also highly pathogenic to the  aphid, whereas the potent entomopathogen photorhabdus luminescens was not. d. dadantii is not a generalist insect pathogen, since it has low pathogenicity for  three other insect species (drosophila melanogaster, sitophilus oryzae, and spodoptera littoralis). d. dadantii was one of the most virulent aphid pathogens  in our screening, and it was active on most aphid instars, except for the first one, probably due to anatomical filtering. the observed difference in virulence toward apterous and winged aphids may have an ecological impact, and this deserves specific attention in future research.
