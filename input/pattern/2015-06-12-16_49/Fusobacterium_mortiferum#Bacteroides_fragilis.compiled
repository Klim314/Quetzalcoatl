TI  - In vitro activity of Biapenem plus RPX7009, a carbapenem combined with a serine beta-lactamase inhibitor, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Biapenem is a carbapenem being developed in combination with RPX7009, a new inhibitor of serine beta-lactamases. Biapenem was tested alone and in combination with fixed concentrations of RPX7009 by agar dilution against 377 recent isolates of anaerobes. A separate panel of 27 isolates of Bacteroides spp. with decreased susceptibility or resistance to imipenem was also tested. Comparator drugs included meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, metronidazole, clindamycin, and tigecycline plus imipenem, doripenem, and ertapenem for the 27 selected strains. For recent consecutive strains of Bacteroides species, the MIC(90) for biapenem-RPX7009 was 1 mug/ml, with a MIC(90) of 4 mug/ml for meropenem. Other Bacteroides fragilis group species showed a MIC90 of 0.5 mug/ml for both agents. The MIC(90)s for biapenem-RPX7009 were 0.25 mug/ml for Prevotella spp., 0.125 mug/ml for Fusobacterium nucleatum and Fusobacterium necrophorum, 2 mug/ml for Fusobacterium mortiferum, 0.5 mug/ml for Fusobacterium varium, </= 0.5 mug/ml for Gram-positive cocci and rods, and 0.03 to 8 mug/ml for clostridia. Against 5 B. fragilis strains harboring a known metallo-beta-lactamase, biapenem-RPX7009 MICs were comparable to those of other carbapenems (>/= 32 mug/ml). Against Bacteroides strains with an imipenem MIC of 2 mug/ml, biapenem-RPX7009 had MICs of 0.5 to 2 mug/ml, with MICs of 0.5 to 32 mug/ml for meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem. For strains with an imipenem MIC of 4 mug/ml, the MICs for biapenem-RPX7009 were 4 to 16 mug/ml, with MICs of 8 to >32 mug/ml for meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem. The inhibitor RPX7009 had no antimicrobial activity when tested alone, and it showed little or no potentiation of biapenem versus anaerobes. Biapenem-RPX7009 showed activity comparable to that of imipenem and was superior to meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem against imipenem-nonsusceptible Bacteroides spp.
TI  - In vitro activities of ramoplanin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, bacitracin, and four other antimicrobials against intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - By using an agar dilution method, the in vitro activities of ramoplanin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, and five other agents were determined against 300 gram-positive and 54 gram-negative strains of intestinal anaerobes. Ramoplanin was active at <or=2 microg/ml against 287 of 300 (95.7%) gram-positive organisms, including 18 strains of Clostridium difficile for which MICs of ramoplanin were 0.25 to 0.5 microg/ml; for 3 of these, linezolid MICs were 8 to 16 micro g/ml. Nineteen Clostridium innocuum strains for which the vancomycin MIC at which 90% of strains were inhibited was 16 microg/ml were susceptible to ramoplanin at 0.06 to 0.25 microg/ml and to teicoplanin at 0.125 to 1.0 microg/ml. All strains of Eubacterium, Actinomyces, Propionibacterium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited by <or=0.25 microg of ramoplanin per ml and <or=1 microg of vancomycin per ml. Ramoplanin was also active at <or=4 microg/ml against 15 of 22 of the Prevotella and Porphyromonas strains tested, but ramoplanin MICs for all 31 strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group, the Fusobacterium mortiferum-Fusobacterium varium group, and Veillonella spp. were >or=256 microg/ml. Ramoplanin displays excellent activity against C. difficile and other gram-positive enteric anaerobes, including vancomycin-resistant strains; however, it has poor activity against most gram-negative anaerobes and thus potentially has a lesser effect on the ecological balance of normal fecal flora.
TI  - In vitro activities of faropenem against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of faropenem, a new oral penem, was tested against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria by using the NCCLS-approved reference method. Drugs tested included amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, faropenem, imipenem, and metronidazole. Of the 176 strains of Bacteroides fragilis group isolates tested, two isolates had faropenem MICs of 64 micro g/ml and imipenem MICs of >32 micro g/ml. Faropenem had an MIC of 16 micro g/ml for an additional isolate of B. fragilis; this strain was sensitive to imipenem (MIC of 1 micro g/ml). Both faropenem and imipenem had MICs of < or=4 micro g/ml for all isolates of Bacteroides capillosus (10 isolates), Bacteroides splanchnicus (13 isolates), Bacteroides ureolyticus (11 isolates), Bilophila wadsworthia (11 isolates), Porphyromonas species (42 isolates), Prevotella species (78 isolates), Campylobacter species (25 isolates), Sutterella wadsworthensis (11 isolates), Fusobacterium nucleatum (19 isolates), Fusobacterium mortiferum/varium (20 isolates), and other Fusobacterium species (9 isolates). Faropenem and imipenem had MICs of 16 to 32 micro g/ml for two strains of Clostridium difficile; the MICs for all other strains of Clostridium tested (69 isolates) were < or =4 micro g/ml. Faropenem had MICs of 8 and 16 micro g/ml, respectively, for two strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (MICs of imipenem were 2 micro g/ml). MICs were < or =4 micro g/ml for all other strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (53 isolates) and non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (28 isolates). Other results were as expected and reported in previous studies. No metronidazole resistance was seen in gram-negative anaerobes other than S. wadsworthensis (18% resistant); 63% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods were resistant. Some degree of clindamycin resistance was seen in most of the groups tested.
TI  - [Retrospective analysis of Fusobacterium associated infections; experience at Aomori Prefectural Hospital with 108 cases from 1995 to 1999].
AB  - We experienced 108 cases of Fusobacterium associated infections, including otolaryngeal, oral, pleuropulmonary, intraabdominal, skin and soft tissue infections, at Aomori Prefectural Hospital during The 5 year-period from 1995 to 1999. A total of 433 organisms, included 113 Fusobacterium spp. (80 Fusobacterium nucleatum, 18 Fusobaterium necrophorum, 5 Fusobacterium varium, 4 Fusobacterium mortiferum, 6 Fusobacterium spp.), were recovered with an average of 4.0 organisms per case of the 108 cases, 68% were mixed aerobic and anaerobic and yielded 185 anaerobic bacteria (2.5 per case) and 137 aerobic bacteria (1.9 per case) with an average of 4.4 per case. The remaining 32% were purely anaerobic and yielded 111 organisms with an average of 3.2 per case, Prevotella spp., Bacteroides fragilis group, Streptococcus milleri group, Enterobacteriaceae, Peptostreptococcus spp. Staphylococcus spp. were most frequently coisolated with Fusobacterium spp.
TI  - In vitro activity of telithromycin (HMR 3647) against 502 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - In a previous study, we compared HMR 3004 with azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin and roxithromycin against 502 anaerobic bacteria using NCCLS-approved procedures. This report extends this study by reporting the activity of telithromycin (HMR 3647) against these strains. Telithromycin inhibited 10% of Bacteroides fragilis, 50% of other B. fragilis group organisms and 93% of other Bacteroides spp. Telithromycin inhibited all Porphyromonas spp. and 98% of Prevotella spp. Activity against Bilophila wadsworthia (85-96%) was excellent. Telithromycin was not active against the Fusobacterium mortiferum/varium group. Telithromycin inhibited 100% of Clostridium perfringens, 46-56% of Clostridium difficile and Clostridium ramosum and approximately 90% of non-spore-forming Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of ABT-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of ABT-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. MICs at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for Actinomyces spp., Clostridium perfringens, Peptostreptococcus spp., Propionibacterium spp., and Porphyromonas spp. The MIC(50)s and MIC(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for Eubacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Clostridium difficile, and Clostridium ramosum. The MIC(90) for Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides ureolyticus, and Campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for Prevotella bivia and other Prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. The MIC(90) for Fusobacterium nucleatum was 8 microg/ml, and that for Fusobacterium mortiferum and Fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. The MIC(90)s for the Bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for B. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides distasonis, and Bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for Bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. Telithromycin MICs for the B. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than ABT-773 MICs. For all strains, ABT-773 was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.
TI  - Synergic activity, for anaerobes, of trovafloxacin with clindamycin or metronidazole: chequerboard and time-kill methods.
AB  - Chequerboard titrations were used to test the activity of trovafloxacin, alone and in combination with clindamycin or metronidazole, against 156 Gram-positive or Gram-negative anaerobes, including 47 Bacteroides fragilis group, 36 Prevotella spp., 26 fusobacteria, 21 peptostreptococci and 26 clostridia. MIC50/MIC90 values (mg/L) of each drug alone against all 156 strains were: trovafloxacin, 0.5/1; clindamycin, 0.25/2; metronidazole, 1/2. Synergy (FIC indices </= 0.5) was seen in two strains with trovafloxacin plus clindamycin, and seven with trovafloxacin plus metronidazole. All other combinations were additive (FIC indices >0. 5-2.0); no antagonism (FIC indices >4.0) was seen. In addition, synergy was tested by time-kill methodology for each of the above combinations against 12 Gram-positive or Gram-negative strains. Results indicated that synergy (defined as a >/= 2 log(10) decrease in cfu/mL at 48 h compared with the more active drug alone) was found between trovafloxacin at or below the MIC and both clindamycin and metronidazole at or below the MIC in one strain each of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium varium, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus and Clostridium bifermentans. Synergy between trovafloxacin (</=MIC) and metronidazole alone was seen in one strain each of Bacteroides distasonis, Prevotella bivia, Fusobacterium mortiferum, P. asaccharolyticus and C. bifermentans. In many cases of synergy, including those at the trovafloxacin MIC, regrowth after 48 h, which was commonly seen with trovafloxacin alone, was inhibited, and 99.9% killing was observed with the combination after 48 h, but not with trovafloxacin alone.
TI  - Comparative antianaerobic activities of the ketolides HMR 3647 (RU 66647) and HMR 3004 (RU 64004).
AB  - HMR 3647 (RU 66647) and HMR 3004 (RU 64004), two ketolides, had MICs at which 50% of the strains are inhibited (MIC50s) of 0.06 to 0.125 microg/ml and MIC90s of 16.0 microg/ml against 352 anaerobes. MIC50s and MIC90s of erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin were 0.5 to 2.0 microg/ml and 32.0 to >64.0 microg/ml, respectively. HMR 3647 and HMR 3004 were more active against non-Bacteroides fragilis-group anaerobes (other than Fusobacterium mortiferum, Fusobacterium varium, and Clostridium difficile).
TI  - Time-kill study of the activity of trovafloxacin compared with ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam against six anaerobes.
AB  - A time-kill method was developed to examine the killing kinetics of trovafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam against one strain each of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium mortiferum, Peptostreptococcus magnus and Clostridium perfringens. Solutions and suspensions were prepared inside an anaerobic glove box, using syringes and prereduced broth. Bottles were then incubated outside the chamber and viability counts determined after incubation for 0, 6, 24 and 48 h in a shaking water bath, avoiding introduction of air. Bacteriostatic/bactericidal concentrations (mg/L) after 48 h for the six strains were: trovafloxacin, 0.03-1/0.03-1; ciprofloxacin, 0.25-16/0.25-32; sparfloxacin, 0.06-2/0.06-8; metronidazole 1-64/1-64; cefoxitin, 0.125-16/0.125-32; piperacillin, 0.125-64/0.125-64; piperacillin/tazobactam, 0.06-2/0.125-8. Bacteriostatic levels were within two dilutions of broth MICs. By this time-kill method, trovafloxacin had the lowest bacteriostatic concentrations of all compounds tested.
TI  - Antianaerobic activity of the ketolide RU 64004 compared to activities of four macrolides, five beta-lactams, clindamycin, and metronidazole.
AB  - Agar dilution methodology (with added Oxyrase in the case of the macrolide group  to allow incubation without added CO2) was used to compare the activity of RU 64004, a new ketolide, with the activities of erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, clindamycin, amoxicillin with and without clavulanate, piperacillin with and without tazobactam, metronidazole, and imipenem against 379 anaerobes. Overall, RU 64004 yielded an MIC at which 50% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC50) of 1.0 microg/ml and an MIC90 of 16.0 microg/ml. In comparison, MIC50s and MIC90s of erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin were 2.0 to 8.0 and >64.0 microg/ml, respectively. MICs of macrolides, including RU 64004, were higher for Bacteroides ovatus, Fusobacterium varium, Fusobacterium mortiferum, and Clostridium difficile than for the other species. RU 64004 was more active against gram-positive rods and cocci, Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp., and fusobacteria other than F. mortiferum and F. varium than against the Bacteroides fragilis group. Overall MIC50s and MIC90s (in micrograms per milliliter), respectively, of other compounds were as follows: clindamycin, 1.0 and 16.0; amoxicillin, 4.0 and 64.0; amoxicillin-clavulanate, 0.5 and 4.0; piperacillin, 8.0 and >64.0; piperacillin-tazobactam, 1.0 and 16.0; metronidazole, 1.0 and 4.0; and imipenem, 0.25 and 1.0.
TI  - In-vitro activity of clinafloxacin (CI-960) and PD 131628-2 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of two new quinolones, CI-960 and PD 131628-2 were determined against 339 strains of anaerobic bacteria and compared to cefoxitin, imipenem and metronidazole. The NCCLS-approved Wadsworth agar dilution technique with Brucella-lysed blood agar was used throughout the study. Breakpoints of the new quinolones are 2 mg/L, and breakpoints for cefoxitin, imipenem and metronidazole are 32, 8 and 16 mg/L, respectively. CI-960 displayed excellent activity, inhibiting all strains tested at 1 mg/L. PD 131628-2 inhibited 94% of Bacteroides fragilis, 75% of other B. fragilis group isolates, 87% of Prevotella spp, 79% of the Fusobacterium mortiferum-varium group, 74% of non-sporing gram-positive bacilli, and 89-100% of Clostridium spp other than Clostridium difficile at 2 mg/L. None of the eight strains of C. difficile was inhibited at 2 mg/L although they were inhibited at 4 mg/L. PD 131628-2 inhibited all strains of other Bacteroides spp, Porphyromonas spp, and Fusobacterium nucleatum at < or = 1 mg/L.
TI  - In vitro activity of DU-6859a against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of a new quinolone agent, DU-6859a, against 330 strains of anaerobic bacteria was determined by using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-approved Wadsworth brucella laked blood agar method; the activity of DU-6859a was compared with those of amoxicillin-clavulanate (2:1), chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, fleroxacin, imipenem, lomefloxacin, metronidazole, sparfloxacin, and temafloxacin. DU-6859a and chloramphenicol inhibited all of the isolates at concentrations of 1 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively; amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, and metronidazole inhibited > or = 94% of the isolates at their respective breakpoints (8, 8, and 16 micrograms/ml). MICs of DU-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible were 1 to 5 twofold dilutions lower than those of the other quinolones for every group of organisms. MICs of DU-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible (total numbers of strains tested are in parentheses) were < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides fragilis (57), other B. fragilis group species (84), Bilophila wadsworthia (15), Clostridium species (27) (including C. difficile, C. perfringens, and C. ramosum), Fusobacterium nucleatum (16), Fusobacterium mortiferum-F. varium group species (10), Peptostreptococcus species (20), non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (20), and Prevotella species (25).
TI  - Fusobacterial infections in children.
AB  - A total of 243 strains of Fusobacteria species was recovered from 226 of 1399 (16%) specimens obtained from 213 children. The strains included 65 (27%) Fusobacterium sp., 144 (59%) Fusobacterium nucleatum, 25 (10%) Fusobacterium necrophorum, five (2%) Fusobacterium varium, three (1%) Fusobacterium mortiferum, and one (0.4%) Fusobacterium gonidiaformans. Most Fusobacteria species were recovered from patients with abscesses (100), aspiration pneumonia (24), paronychia (15), bites (14), chronic sinusitis (ten), chronic otitis media (nine), and osteomyelitis (eight). Predisposing conditions were noted in 32 (15%) of the cases. These included immunodeficiency in nine (4%), steroid therapy in eight (4%), previous surgery in six (3%), diabetes in six (3%) and malignant neoplasms in five (2%). Fusobacteria sp. was the only isolate in 16 (8%) instances while mixed infections were encountered in 197 (92%) patients. The organisms most commonly isolated with Fusobacteria sp. were anaerobic cocci (155), pigmented Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas sp. (95), Bacteroides fragilis group (80), Escherichia coli (43) and Bacteroides sp. (39). Most strains of B. fragilis group and E. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections proximal to the rectal area. Most pigmented Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas sp. were recovered from oropharyngeal and pulmonary sites and from sites around the head and neck. Antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients; surgical drainage was performed in 85 (40%). All patients, except two who died, recovered. These findings illustrate the prevalence of Fusobacteria sp. associated with infections in children.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Bacteroides and other genera of Gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  - A numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of Bacteroides, Polyphyromonas, Prevotella [not Prevotella (Labroue, 1976)] and Fusobacterium. Isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. Computation of similarity coefficients was followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. At the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) Bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) Fusobacterium mortiferum, F. necrogenes, F. necrophorum, F. nucleatum and F. varium; (3) B. caccae, B. distasonis, B. eggerthii, B. fragilis, B. merdae, B. ovatus, B stercoris, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformus and B. vulgatus; (4) B. splanchnicus; (5) Porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) B. bivius (Prevotella bivia); (7) B. disiens (P. disiens); (8) B. intermedius (P. intermedia);and (9) B. melaninogenicus (P. melaninogenica). Single isolates of B. ruminicola (P. ruminicola), B. denticola (P. denticola) and B. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.
TI  - Beta-lactamase production and susceptibilities to amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ticarcillin, ticarcillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, imipenem, and metronidazole of 320 non-Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides isolates and 129 fusobacteria from 28 U.S. centers.
AB  - beta-Lactamase production (nitrocefin disk method) and agar dilution susceptibility of amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ticarcillin, ticarcillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, imipenem, and metronidazole were determined for 320 Bacteroides species (not Bacteroides fragilis group) and 129 fusobacteria from 28 U.S. centers. Overall, 64.7% of Bacteroides species and 41.1% of fusobacteria were beta-lactamase positive. Among the Bacteroides species, positivity rates were highest for B. bivius (85.0%), followed by B. splanchnicus (83.3%), B. eggerthii (77.8%), and B. oralis (77.1%); 54.5% of black-pigmented Bacteroides species were beta-lactamase positive. Among the fusobacteria, Fusobacterium mortiferum showed the highest rate of beta-lactamase positivity (76.9%). MICs of amoxicillin (128 micrograms/ml) and ticarcillin (64 micrograms/ml) for 90% of all beta-lactamase-positive strains were reduced to 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively, with the addition of clavulanate. MICs of amoxicillin and ticarcillin for 90% of all beta-lactamase-negative strains were 1 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively, and greater than or equal to 98.4% of the strains were susceptible to the beta-lactams tested. Of the beta-lactamase-producing strains, 45.9% were susceptible to amoxicillin at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml and 93.4% were susceptible to ticarcillin at less than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml; the addition of clavulanate raised the rates to 90.4 and 100%, respectively. All strains were susceptible to cefoxitin, imipenem, and metronidazole. The activity of amoxicillin against 29 beta-lactamase-producing strains (10 Bacteroides species and 19 fusobacteria) was not enhanced by the addition of clavulanate; however, 82.7% of these strains were susceptible to amoxicillin, and all were susceptible to ticarcillin. Although beta-lactamase positivity is on the increase in non-B. fragilis group Bacteroides species and fusobacteria, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ticarcillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, and metronidazole should be suitable for the treatment of infections with these strains. The addition of clavulanate does not appreciably improve the efficacy of ticarcillin against these organisms.
TI  - 5S ribosomal ribonucleic acid sequences in Bacteroides and Fusobacterium: evolutionary relationships within these genera and among eubacteria in general.
AB  - The 5S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequences were determined for Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides capillosus, Bacteroides veroralis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Anaerorhabdus furcosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium mortiferum, and Fusobacterium varium. A dendrogram constructed by a clustering algorithm from these sequences, which were aligned with all other hitherto known eubacterial 5S rRNA sequences, showed differences as well as similarities with respect to results derived from 16S rRNA analyses. In the 5S rRNA dendrogram, Bacteroides clustered together with Cytophaga and Fusobacterium, as in 16S rRNA analyses. Intraphylum relationships deduced from 5S rRNAs suggested that Bacteroides is specifically related to Cytophaga rather than to Fusobacterium, as was suggested by 16S rRNA analyses. Previous taxonomic considerations concerning the genus Bacteroides, based on biochemical and physiological data, were confirmed by the 5S rRNA sequence analysis.
TI  - Lack of constitutive beta-glucosidase (esculinase) in the genus Fusobacterium.
AB  - Esculin has been incorporated into both a medium and test with 20% bile for many  years to differentiate Bacteroides from Fusobacterium organisms. After 24 to 48 h, all members of the Bacteroides fragilis group grow in 20% bile and hydrolyze esculin. Fusobacterium mortiferum can both grow in bile and hydrolyze esculin, thus limiting the use of the bile-esculin medium and test. The hypothesis that constitutive esculinase (beta-glucosidase) could differentiate Bacteroides from Fusobacterium organisms was investigated. Clinical isolates and American Type Culture Collection clones of the B. fragilis group and other species of Bacteroides and Fusobacterium were tested. All B. fragilis were positive within 30 min. In no case was a Fusobacterium organism positive for constitutive enzyme in a hydrolyzable substrate-based test. The percentage of positive results for other species of Bacteroides agreed with those published in the literature for the esculin test. The genus Fusobacterium can be separated from Bacteroides organisms based on a lack of constitutive beta-glucosidase in the former in a 30-min one-tube test.
TI  - Activation of Hageman factor by lipopolysaccharides of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Fusobacterium mortiferum.
AB  - Preincubation of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Fusobacterium mortiferum with purified human Hageman factor (HF) followed by addition of purified human prekallikrein resulted in the activation of HF, as measured by the generation of kallikrein using the tripeptide substrate N-alpha-benzoyl-L-proline-L-phenylalanine-L-arginine-4-nitroanilide. Addition of purified HF, which had been preincubated with the LPS, to HF-deficient plasma resulted in the acceleration of the recalcification time. Addition of the LPS to HF-deficient plasma reconstituted with various concentrations of HF also resulted in the acceleration of the recalcification time; the magnitude of the acceleration correlated with the amount of HF used to reconstitute the deficient plasma. These results demonstrate that LPS of selected gram-negative anaerobes activate HF and thereby initiate the intrinsic pathway of coagulation.
TI  - Therapeutic effect of cefotetan in an experimental local infection with facultative and obligate anaerobes in granuloma pouches in rats.
AB  - The therapeutic activities of cefotetan against experimentally induced infections with Escherichia coli. Serratia marcescens, Bacteroides fragilis or Fusobacterium mortiferum in the granuloma pouches of rats were compared with those of cefmetazole and cefazolin. Of these antibiotics, cefotetan showed the greatest therapeutic effect against the four bacterial infections after a single intramuscular administration. Cefotetan was found to give much higher pouch exudate concentrations than cefmetazole, and to show prolonged antibacterial levels even when compared with cefazolin. In the granuloma pouch, cefotetan produced similar morphological changes in the cells of E. coli NY-17 as have been observed in vitro by microscopy. Elongation and bulge formation were noted.
TI  - The use of an anaerobic incubator for the isolation of anaerobes from clinical samples.
AB  - An anaerobic incubator was compared with a standard jar system for the isolation  of anaerobes from clinical material. Seventy specimens were selected as likely to yield anaerobes: 342 different anaerobes were isolated in the incubator and 347 in anaebrobic jars. These included Bacteroides spp (43%), Peptococcus spp (26%), Peptostreptococcus spp (13%), Veillonella spp (7%), Fusobacterium spp (7%), Clostridium spp (2%) and miscellaneous Gram-positive nonsporing bacilli (2%). Differences in isolation rates for each system were inconsistent and minor. Sixteen anaerobes were chosen for quantitative tests at the beginning and end of the study period. Miles and Misra counts showed a slight advantage of the incubator for F nucleatum, but no difference for B fragilis, B thetaiomicron, B uniformis, B bivius, B corrodens, F mortiferum, Ps anaerobius, P prevotii or Propionibacterium acnes. In almost all cases, colonies in anaerobic jars were slightly larger than those in the incubator. Disc antibiotic sensitivity tests gave the same results in each system, at the beginning and end of the study period. The anaerobic incubator provides an effective means of isolation of anaerobes in a clinical laboratory. However, several design features of the prototype would require change if the system were introduced.
TI  - Biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-Nitropyrene (1-NP) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the absence of S9 fraction in the Salmonella-microsome test. It is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-NP and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. We determined the 1-NP nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. We found that the mutagenicity of 1-NP mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. The product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-AP), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. The 1-NP nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the anaerobic bacteria, i.e., Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, Fusobacterium mortiferum, F. nucleatum, Clostridium perfringens, C. sporogenes, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. bifidum, Eubacterium lentum, E. limosum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-NP to 1-AP and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-NP.
TI  - Survival of anaerobic bacteria in common laboratory diluents.
AB  - The survival of six species of anaerobic bacteria was studied in simple or commercially available diluents. Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium nucleatum showed excellent survival in all diluents including distilled water. Fusobacterium mortiferum survived well in all diluents except water and water supplemented with 0.1% gelatain. Clostridium perfringens survived best in phosphate-buffered saline with gelatin. Peptococcus asaccharolyticus required gelatin added to the basic diluent, and Streptococcus intermedius showed excellent survival only in minimal essential medium with gelatin. These diluents could provide effective and economical alternatives to more complex and costly diluents often used in work with anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of tiamulin (81.723 HFU), a new pleuromulin derivative, against clinically significant anaerobes.
AB  - The susceptibility of more than 40 strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive anaerobes to tiamulin (Sandoz 81.723 hfu), a new pleuromulin (pleuromutilin) derivative, was determined by broth dilution and agar dilution tests. The influences of density of the inoculum upon MICs was studied by a specially designed pour plate-technique. Bacteroides fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. splanchnicus, B. oralis, B. asaccharolyticus, B. melaninogenicus, Fusobacterium fusiforme (F. nucleatum), Sphaerophorus necrophorus, Clostridium perfringens, C. fallax, Propionibacterium acnes and several species of Peptococcaceae showed broth dilution MICs of 0.03 similar to 1 microgram/ml. Members of B. thetaiotaomicron, B. distasonis and S. freundii (F. mortiferum) were inhibited by 8 similar to 32 microgram/ml and 2 strains of S. varius had a broth dilution MIC of 256 microgram/ml. With most strains, the agar dilution MICs were 2 similar to 4 similar to 8 times the broth dilution MICs. In pour plate-tests, the MICs were not considerably influenced influenced by varying initial concentrations of viable cells. With most anaerobes, the MBCs of tiamulin were more than 100-fold higher than the MICs. The results obtained indicated that, apart from S. varius, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. distasonis and S. freundii (F. mortiferum), members of 16 other anaerobic species including B. fragilis were without exception sensitive to tiamulin.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibility of bacteroidaceae to cefoxitin and cephalothin (author's transl)].
AB  - The activity of the new cephamycin C derivatives cefoxitin against 102 clinical isolates of Bacteroidaceae (95 Bacteroides strains and 7 Fusobacterium-Sphaerophorus cultures) was determined by tube dilution and standardized agar diffusion tests and compared to that of cephalothin. Cefoxitin was more active than cephalothin against 56 Bacteroides fragilis strains, 19 Bacteroides thetaiota-omicron strains and two Bacteroides splanchnicus strains. The difference seemed less pronounced with five Bacteroides vulgatus and four Bacteroides variabilis cultures. Three Bacteroides melaninogenicus and six Bacteroides oralis strains displayed similar sensitivity to both cephalosporins. At concentrations of 32 microng/ml or less, cefoxitin inhibited 91% and cephalothin 33% of the Bacteroides strains. Two strains of Sphaerophorus varius were likewise much more sensitive to cefoxitin than to cephalothin (MIC values 8 micron8/ml of cefoxitin and 256 microng/ml of cephalothin). Three other Sphaerophorus strains (the species necrophorus and freundii/mortiferum) and two of Fusobacterium fusiforme (Fusobacterium nucleatum) strains were very similar in their susceptibility to both cephalosporins. Statistical analysis of the relationship between MIC and zone size diameter showed relatively high correlation coefficients for cefoxitin and cephalothin (r=-0.741 and r=-0.703 respectively).
TI  - Comparison of the in vitro bactericidal activity of human serum and leukocytes against bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium mortiferum in aerobic and anaerobic environments.
AB  - In aerobic and anaerobic in vitro environments, Fusobacterium mortiferum was killed by human leukocytes or serum alone or in combination; clinical isolates of Bacteroides fragilis were killed only by leukocytes in the presence of serum.
TI  - [The Bacteriodaceae flora in the faeces of pigs (author's transl)[].
AB  - A total of 180 Bacteroidaceae strains from the fecal specimens of 31 clinically healthy pigs aged 120 to 180 days from 4 farms were isolated in numbers of 10(8)-10(10) per gram feces and differentiated for their morphological, cultural and biochemical properties. 161 of these strains belonged to Bacteroides ruminicola and related species, 10 to B. fragilis ss. fragilis, 3 to B. fragilis ss. vulgatus, 4 to Fusobacterium necrogenes, 1 to F. mortiferum and 1 to a non-motile variant of F. novum. The taxonomic relationships between B. ruminicola and B. oralis are discussed.
TI  - [Antibacterial and bactericidal activity of tinidazole against anaerobic bacteria comparing with metronidazole (author's transl)].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of tinidazole (1-2-(ethylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole) against anaerobic bacteria including Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium, Propionibacterium, Bacteroides and Fusobacterium was studied by agar dilution method comparing with metronidazole. In addition to this work, bactericidal effect of tinidazole and metronidazole against P. prevotii, B. fragilis ss. fragilis and F. varium was examined by quantitative culture method after incubation in GAM broth containing of 4 MIC, 2 MIC, 1 MIC and 1/2 MIC of both drugs against each of three strains for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. All the strains of Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus including P. anaerobius, P. saccharolyticus, P. prevotii and Ps. anaerobius and others were susceptible to a concentration of 6.25 mcg/ml of this drug. A concentration of 3.13 mcg/ml inhibited all strains of Bacteroides including B. fragilis ss. fragilis (12 strains), ss. vulgatus (5 strains), ss. thetaiotaomicron (4 strains) and ss. distasonis (2 strains). To this concentration all strains of Fusobacterium including F. varium (20 strains), F. mortiferum (2 strains) and other Fusobacterium sp. (5 strains) were susceptible. On the contrary, Propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. The antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against Bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium and Fusobacterium. Tinidazole was bactericidal against F. varium in a concentration of 2 MIC till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on B. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. On the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against B. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against F. varium. Against P. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. Tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding Propionibacterium acnes and Bifidobacterium adolescentis.
TI  - Survival of anaerobic bacteria during transportation. 1. Experimental investigations on the effect of evacuation of atmospheric air by flushing with carbon dioxide and nitrogen.
AB  - The effect of evacuation of atmospheric air during transportation on recovery of  anaerobic bacteria was investigated. Evacuation of atmospheric air from glass tubes by flushing with pure carbon dioxide lowered the content of oxygen to about 0.4 per cent. Three B. fragilis strains and one strain of Fusobacterium mortiferum and of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were investigated. Bacterial recovery was determined one hour and 24 hours after evacuation of atmospheric air by pure carbon dioxide and pure nitrogen, was compared to bacterial recovery from samples transported with free access to atmospheric air. Evacuation by pure carbon dioxide significantly improved the recovery of one B. fragilis strain after 24 hours of transportation and significantly impaired the recovery of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius after one hour of transportation, while evacuation by pure nitrogen significantly improved the recovery of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius after 24 hours of transportation. In all other cases, however, no statistically significant effect on bacterial recovery was found.
TI  - Susceptibility of the liver and biliary tract to anaerobic infection in extrahepatic biliary tract obstruction. II. Liver function and morphology of the liver and biliary tract--an experimental study in rabbits.
AB  - Biliary tract infection with anaerobic bacteria (B. fragilis or Fusobacterium mortiferum) was produced in rabbits by common duct ligation (c.d.l.) 3 days prior to intravenous bacterial inoculation. Animals were investigated 1, 4 or 7 days after inoculation. Histopathological investigations included the liver, the common duct, and the gallbladder, while liver function was evaluated by bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (AP), and L-alanine aminotransferase (GPT) in serum. Rabbits with c.d.l. and biliary tract infection were compared to rabbits with c.d.l. in which bacterial inoculation failed to produce infection, to inoculated rabbits without c.d.l., and to uninoculated rabbits with c.d.l. Anaerobic biliary tract infection in rabbits with c.d.l. caused a significant increase in liver abscesses, a significant increased infiltration with granulocytes in the gallbladder, and a significant increase in serum levels of bilirubin, AP, and GPT, but failed to produce signs of cholangitis in the liver and intramural abscesses in the gallbladder. A material is presented of normal values for bilirubin, AP, and GPT in serum in rabbits.
TI  - Susceptibility of the liver and biliary tract to anaerobic infection in extrahepatic biliary tract obstruction. Bacteriological investigations - an experimental study in rabbits.
AB  - The influence of common duct occlusion on susceptibility to infection with anaerobic gram-negative rods was investigated in rabbits. Intravenous inoculation was performed with three B. fragilis strains isolated from human infections and with a stock culture of Fusobacterium mortiferum. Liver tissue, gallbladder, bile, and blood were investigated. Anaerobic culture procedures were based on the use of a 'glove-box' with an oxygen-free atmosphere and pre-reduced, anaerobically sterilized media. Anaerobic transport was based on flushing of samples with oxygen-free carbon dioxide and transport-time less than 30 minutes. In regard to two B. fragilis strains (ss. fragilis) and in regard to Fusobacterium mortiferum, common duct occlusion significantly increased the number of infected animals compared to a control group of inoculated animals without common duct occlusion. Spontaneous infection did not arise in a control group of animals with common duct ligation. It is concluded that: 1) in biliary tract occlusion, anaerobic bacteria are able to invade the biliary tract from the blood stream, and 2) biliary tract occlusion produces sufficient anaerobic conditions for obligate anaerobic bacteria to multiply in the bile.
TI  - Phosphatase activity of anaerobic organisms.
AB  - Anaerobic organisms were tested for phosphatase activity in different pH ranges.  Several groups of organisms displayed characteristic patterns. Bacteroides fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, and B. ruminicola produced phosphatase with strongest activity at pH 8.6. Fusobacterium mortiferum was the only species of this genus to show strong hydrolysis. The enzyme was active in both acid and alkaline ranges. The activity of gram-positive organisms was variable, the most active groups being Clostridium perfringens, Peptostreptococcus intermedius, P. micros, and Peptococcus constellatus. The incorporation of phosphatase activity into the identification scheme of anaerobes seems feasible. There was a correlation of hydrolysis with several important pathogens.
TI  - Bacteroidaceae in thromboembolic disease: effects of cell wall components on blood coagulation in vivo and in vitro.
AB  - The effects of Bacteroides sp., Fusobacterium mortiferum, Bacteroides fragilis, and Sphaerophorus necrophorus on various parameters of blood coagulation in vivo and in vitro were determined and compared to the coagulation effects of Escherichia coli and Salmonella minnesota, wild type and R595. Intravenous injection of washed cells, culture filtrate, lipopolysaccharide, or lipid A of the anaerobic gram-negative microorganisms into mice resulted in acceleration of coagulation. Lipopolysaccharide and lipid A of the anaerobic microorganisms had no apparent effect on circulating platelets in mice or rabbits and did not cause aggregation of human platelets in vitro. Washed cells, lipopolysaccharide, and lipid A of Bacteroides sp. and F. mortiferum also significantly accelerated the clotting time of recalcified platelet poor normal human plasma and C6-deficient rabbit plasma. Lipid A, but not lipopolysaccharide, of E. coli and washed cells of S. minnesota R595 accelerated coagulation by a similar mechanism. These results indicated that Bacteroides sp. and F. mortiferum can accelerate blood coagulation in vivo and in vitro by a mechanism which does not involve platelets or terminal components of complement.
