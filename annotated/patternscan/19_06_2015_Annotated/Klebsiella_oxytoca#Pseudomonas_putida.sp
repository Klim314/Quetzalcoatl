TI  == microbiological investigation of raphanus sativus l. grown hydroponically in nutrient solutions contaminated with spoilage and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the survival of eight undesired (spoilage/pathogenic) food related bacteria (citrobacter freundii pss60, enterobacter spp. pss11, escherichia coli pss2, klebsiella oxytoca pss82, serratia grimesii pss72, pseudomonas putida pss21, stenotrophomonas maltophilia pss52 and listeria monocytogenes atcc 19114(t)) was  investigated in mineral nutrient solution (mns) during the crop cycle of radishes (raphanus sativus l.) cultivated in hydroponics in a greenhouse. mnss were microbiologically analyzed weekly by plate count. the evolution of the pure cultures was also evaluated in sterile mns in test tubes. the inoculated trials contained an initial total mesophilic count (tmc) ranging between 6.69 and 7.78log cfu/ml, while non-sterile and sterile control trials showed levels of 4.39 and 0.97log cfu/ml, respectively. in general, all inoculated trials showed similar levels of tmc in mns during the experimentation, even though the levels of the inoculated bacteria decreased. the presence of the inoculums was ascertained by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis applied on the  isolates collected at 7-day intervals. at harvest, mnss were also analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). the last analysis, except p. putida pss21 in the corresponding trial, did not detect the other bacteria, but confirmed that pseudomonads were present in un-inoculated mnss. despite the high  counts detected (6.44 and 7.24cfu/g), only c. freundii pss60, enterobacter spp. pss11 and k. oxytoca pss82 were detected in radishes in a living form, suggesting their internalization.

TI  == diversity of bacteria nesting the plant cover of north sinai deserts, egypt.
AB  == north sinai deserts were surveyed for the predominant plant cover and for the culturable bacteria nesting their roots and shoots. among 43 plant species reported, 13 are perennial (e.g. fagonia spp., pancratium spp.) and 30 annuals (e.g. bromus spp., erodium spp.). eleven species possessed rhizo-sheath, e.g. cyperus capitatus, panicum turgidum and trisetaria koelerioides. microbiological  analyses demonstrated: the great diversity and richness of associated culturable  bacteria, in particular nitrogen-fixing bacteria (diazotrophs); the majority of bacterial residents were of true and/or putative diazotrophic nature; the bacterial populations followed an increasing density gradient towards the root surfaces; sizeable populations were able to reside inside the root (endorhizosphere) and shoot (endophyllosphere) tissues. three hundred bacterial isolates were secured from studied spheres. the majority of nitrogen-fixing bacilli isolates belonged to bacillus megaterium, bacillus pumilus, bacillus polymexa, bacillus macerans, bacillus circulans and bacillus licheniformis. the family enterobacteriaceae represented by enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter sackazakii, enterobacter cloacae, serratia adorifera, serratia liquefaciens and klebsiella oxytoca. the non-enterobacteriaceae population was rich in pantoae spp., agrobacterium rdiobacter, pseudomonas vesicularis, pseudomonas putida, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, ochrobactrum anthropi, sphingomonas paucimobilis and chrysemonas luteola. gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus were reported inside root and shoot tissues of a number of tested plants. the dense bacterial populations reported speak well to the very possible significant role played by the endophytic bacterial populations in the survival, in respect of nutrition and health, of existing plants. such groups of diazotrophs are good candidates, as bio-preparates, to support the growth of future field crops grown in deserts of north sinai and irrigated by the water of el-salam canal.

TI  == sulfoquinovose degraded by pure cultures of bacteria with release of c3-organosulfonates: complete degradation in two-member communities.
AB  == sulfoquinovose (sq, 6-deoxy-6-sulfoglucose) was synthesized chemically. an hplc-elsd method to separate sq and other chromophore-free sulfonates, e.g. 2,3-dihydroxypropane-1-sulfonate (dhps), was developed. a set of 10 genome-sequenced, sulfonate-utilizing bacteria did not utilize sq, but an isolate, pseudomonas putida sq1, from an enrichment culture did so. the molar growth yield with sq was half of that with glucose, and 1 mol 3-sulfolactate (mol sq)(-1) was formed during growth. the 3-sulfolactate was degraded by the addition of paracoccus pantotrophus nkncysa, and the sulfonate sulfur was recovered quantitatively as sulfate. another isolate, klebsiella oxytoca taun1, could utilize sq, forming 1 mol dhps (mol sq)(-1) ; the molar growth yield with sq was  half of that with glucose. this dhps could be degraded by cupriavidus pinatubonensis jmp134, with quantitative recovery of the sulfonate sulfur as sulfate. we presume that sq can be degraded by communities in the environment.

TI  == occurrence and diversity of integrons and beta-lactamase genes among ampicillin-resistant isolates from estuarine waters.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence and molecular diversity of beta-lactamase genes and integrons among gram-negative ampicillin-resistant bacteria from ria de aveiro. ampicillin-resistant isolates were selected and subjected to genotyping using rep-pcr. representatives from each rep pattern were affiliated with the following taxa by sequencing the 16s rrna gene: aeromonas caviae, a. hydrophila, a. media, a. molluscorum, a. veronii, a. salmonicida, aeromonas sp., pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas sp., escherichia coli, escherichia sp., shigella sonnei, shigella sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, r. planticola, citrobacter freundii, morganella morganii and enterobacter sp. isolates affiliated with genera escherichia or shigella were identified as escherichia coli using phenotypic-based tests. pcr was used to assess beta-lactamase encoding sequences (bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(carb), bla(ctx-m), bla(imp), bla(vim), bla(cpha/imis), bla(oxa-a), bla(oxa-b), bla(oxa-c)), class 1 and class 2 integrases, and integron variable regions. sequence analysis of pcr products was performed. beta-lactamase genes were detected in 77.8% of the enterobacteriaceae and in 10.5% of the aeromonas. the most frequently detected gene was bla(tem), followed by bla(shv,)bla(oxa-b),  bla(cpha/imis) and bla(carb). retrieved sequences shared high homology with previously described beta-lactamases. the inti1 gene was present in 29.6% of the  enterobacteriaceae and in 21% of the aeromonas isolates. the inti2 gene was present in 4 isolates. a total of 13 cassettes included in 12 different cassette  arrays were identified. the most frequently found resistance gene cassettes were  aada variants. previous investigations based on cultivation-independent approaches revealed higher molecular diversity among beta-lactamase-encoding sequences in this estuary. this fact reinforces the hypothesis that cultivation-dependent approaches may underestimate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental samples and may introduce bias in the recovery  of their molecular variants.

TI  == isolation and characterization of polymeric galloyl-ester-degrading bacteria from a tannery discharge place.
AB  == the culturable bacteria colonizing the rhizosphere of plants growing in the area  of discharge of a tannery effluent were characterized. relative proportions of aerobic, denitrifying, and sulfate-reducing bacteria were determined in the rhizosphere of typha latifolia, canna indica, and phragmites australis. aerobic bacteria were observed to be the most abundant group in the rhizosphere, and plant type did not seem to influence the abundance of the bacterial types analyzed. to isolate bacteria able to degrade polyphenols used in the tannery industry, enrichments were conducted under different conditions. bacterial cultures were enriched with individual polyphenols (tannins tara, quebracho, or mimosa) or with an undefined mixture of tannins present in the tannery effluent as carbon source. cultures enriched with the effluent or tara tannin were able to degrade tannic acid. six bacterial isolates purified from these mixed cultures were able to use tannic acid as a sole carbon source in axenic culture. on the basis of 16s ribosomal dna sequence analysis, these isolates were closely related to organisms belonging to the taxa serratia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, klebsiella oxytoca, herbaspirillum chlorophenolicum, and pseudomonas putida.

TI  == a new generation of vectors with increased induction ratios by overimposing a second regulatory level by attenuation.
AB  == a major drawback of regulated gene expression from vectors bearing strong promoters is the associated high basal expression level. simple regulatory systems have an intrinsic limitation in the range of induction, and attempts to mutate promoters to reduce basal expression usually result in concomitant reduction of induced levels. we have explored the possibility of reducing basal levels of gene expression while keeping induced levels intact by incorporating an additional regulatory circuit controlling a different step of the expression process. we have integrated the nasfedcba transcriptional attenuation system of klebsiella oxytoca into a cascade expression circuit based on different regulatory elements of pseudomonas putida, and also into a system based on the tac promoter, to expand their regulatory capacity. basal expression from the promoters of these circuits was reduced by more than 10-fold by the nasf attenuator sequence while keeping the induced levels intact in the presence of the antiterminator protein, thus increasing the induction ratio by up to 1700-fold. in addition, using different combinations of regulatory elements and inducing conditions, we were able to obtain a broad range of expression levels. these vectors and the concept of their design will be very useful in regulating overproduction of heterologous proteins both at laboratory and industrial scales.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == distribution of amine oxidases and amine dehydrogenases in bacteria grown on primary amines and characterization of the amine oxidase from klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == the bacteria klebsiella oxytoca lmd 72.65 (atcc 8724), arthrobacter p1 lmd 81.60  (ncib 11625), paracoccus versutus lmd 80.62 (atcc 25364), escherichia coli w lmd  50.28 (atcc 9637), e. coli k12 lmd 93.68, pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 lmd 89.1 (atcc 17933) and pseudomonas putida lmd 68.20 (atcc 12633) utilized primary amines as a carbon and energy source, although the range of amines accepted varied from organism to organism. the gram-negative bacteria k. oxytoca and e. coli as well as the gram-positive methylotroph arthrobacter p1 used an oxidase whereas the pseudomonads and the gram-negative methylotroph paracoccus versutus used a dehydrogenase for amine oxidation. k. oxytoca utilized several primary amines but showed a preference for those containing a phenyl group moiety. only a single oxidase was used for oxidation of the amines. after purification, the following characteristics of the enzyme indicated that it belonged to the group of copper-quinoprotein amine oxidase (ec 1.4.3.6): the molecular mass (172,000 da) of the homodimeric protein; the uv/visible and epr spectra of isolated and p-nitrophenylhydrazine-inhibited enzyme; the presence and the content of copper and topaquinone (tpq). the amine oxidase appeared to be soluble and localized in  the periplasm, but catalase and nad-dependent aromatic aldehyde dehydrogenase, enzymes catalysing the conversion of its reaction products, were found in the cytoplasm. from the amino acid sequence of the n-terminal part as well as that of a purified peptide, it appears that k. oxytoca produces a copper-quinoprotein oxidase which is very similar to that found in other enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

(2 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (1 strain), klebsiella oxytoca (1 strain) and pseudomonas putida (1 strain) were all eradicated by the czon treatment. 3. the safety of the drug was analyzed in the 10 patients and rash occurred in 1 patient as a side effect. 4. one patient showed eosinophilia after the czon treatment. it appeared that czon would be useful for the treatment of obstetrical and gynecological infections.

TI  == construction of a transposon containing a gene for polygalacturonate trans-eliminase from klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == a dna fragment containing a klebsiella oxytoca gene for polygalacturonate trans-eliminase was cloned into the kanamycin resistance transposon tn5. this new transposon, designated tn5-pga+, had a transposition frequency of 1 x 10(-6). the broad host range plasmid pr751::tn5-pga+ was conjugally transferred to a variety  of genetic backgrounds. the ability to degrade polygalacturonate was expressed in aeromonas hydrophila, alcaligenes eutrophus, azotomonas insolita, escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida and rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides, but not in zymomonas mobilis.

TI  == chemical structure and inhalation toxicity of lipopolysaccharides from bacteria on cotton.
AB  == lipopolysaccharides from different bacteria isolated from cotton were purified and chemically analyzed. their pulmonary toxicity to animals was tested in inhalation tests. lipopolysaccharides from agrobacterium and xanthomonas were shown to differ from the others in that they contained no heptose and no non-hydroxylated fatty acids with a chain length of 12, 14, or 16 carbon atoms. lipopolysaccharides from pseudomonas putida, enterobacter agglomerans, and klebsiella oxytoca were found to cause an influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes  into the airways. lipopolysaccharides from agrobacterium sp. and xanthomonas sinensis caused no significant invasion. the data point to substances in both the lipid a part and the core part of the lipopolysaccharides being responsible for the capacity to induce leukocyte invasion into the airways.
