TI  == senior thai fecal microbiota comparison between vegetarians and non-vegetarians using pcr-dgge and real-time pcr.
AB  == the fecal microbiotas were investigated in 13 healthy thai subjects using polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). among the 186 dna bands detected on the polyacrylamide gel, 37 bands were identified as representing 11 species: bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides  ovatus, bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium colicanis, eubacterium eligenes, e. rectale, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, megamonas funiformis, prevotella copri, and roseburia intestinalis, belonging mainly to the groups of bacteroides, prevotella, clostridium, and f. prausnitzii. a dendrogram  of the pcr-dgge divided the subjects; vegetarians and non-vegetarians. the fecal  microbiotas were also analyzed using a quantitative real-time pcr focused on bacteroides, bifidobacterium, enterobacteriaceae, clostrium coccoides-eubacterium rectale, c. leptum, lactobacillus, and prevotella. the nonvegetarian and vegetarian subjects were found to have significant differences in the high abundance of the bacteroides and prevotella genera, respectively. no significant  differences were found in the counts of bifidabacterium, enterobacteriaceae, c. coccoides-e. rectale group, c. leptum group, and lactobacillus. therefore, these  findings on the microbiota of healthy thais consuming different diets could provide helpful data for predicting the health of south east asians with similar  diets.

TI  == influence of environmental and genetic factors linked to celiac disease risk on infant gut colonization by bacteroides species.
AB  == celiac disease (cd) is an immune-mediated enteropathy involving genetic and environmental factors whose interaction might influence disease risk. the aim of  this study was to determine the effects of milk-feeding practices and the hla-dq  genotype on intestinal colonization of bacteroides species in infants at risk of  cd development. this study included 75 full-term newborns with at least one first-degree relative suffering from cd. infants were classified according to milk-feeding practice (breast-feeding or formula feeding) and hla-dq genotype (high or low genetic risk). stools were analyzed at 7 days, 1 month, and 4 months by pcr and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). the bacteroides species diversity index was higher in formula-fed infants than in breast-fed infants. breast-fed infants showed a higher prevalence of bacteroides uniformis at 1 and 4 months of age, while formula-fed infants had a higher prevalence of b. intestinalis at all sampling times, of b. caccae at 7 days and 4 months, and of b. plebeius at 4 months. infants with high genetic risk showed a higher prevalence of b. vulgatus, while those with low genetic risk showed a higher prevalence of b. ovatus, b. plebeius, and b. uniformis. among breast-fed infants, the prevalence of b. uniformis was higher in those with low genetic risk than in  those with high genetic risk. among formula-fed infants, the prevalence of b. ovatus and b. plebeius was increased in those with low genetic risk, while the prevalence of b. vulgatus was higher in those with high genetic risk. the results indicate that both the type of milk feeding and the hla-dq genotype influence the colonization process of bacteroides species, and possibly the disease risk.

TI  == bacteroides clarus sp. nov., bacteroides fluxus sp. nov. and bacteroides oleiciplenus sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  == three gram-stain-negative, obligately anaerobic, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacteria (strains yit 12056t, yit 12057t and yit 12058t) were isolated from human faeces. these strains were characterized by phylogenetic analyses based on 16s rrna gene sequence and phenotypic tests. 16s rrna gene sequence analyses revealed that strains yit 12056t, yit 12057t and yit 12058t were most closely related to the type strains of bacteroides gallinarum, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides intestinalis with approximate similarity values of 96.6, 95.0 and 96.7%, respectively. the dna g+c contents of the novel strains were 45.3 (yit 12056t), 45.2 (yit 12057t) and 43.6 mol% (yit 12058t) and the major respiratory quinones of all three isolates were menaquinones mk-10 and mk-11. these properties were typical for members of the genus bacteroides. the results of the other phenotypic analyses also supported the affiliation of these strains to the genus bacteroides. the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, analysis of the major cellular  fatty acids and other biochemical tests enabled the genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of the three new strains. based on these data, three novel species, bacteroides clarus sp. nov., bacteroides fluxus sp. nov. and bacteroides oleiciplenus sp. nov. are proposed. the type strains of b. clarus, b. fluxus and  b. oleiciplenus are yit 12056t (=jcm 16067t=dsm 22519t), yit 12057t (=jcm 16101t=dsm 22534t) and yit 12058t (=jcm 16102t=dsm 22535t), respectively.

TI  == bacteroides intestinalis sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  == during studies of the microbiota of human faeces, five strains of gram-negative anaerobic rods were isolated following growth in a polyamine-deficient medium. these strains belonged to the genus bacteroides on the basis of 16s rrna gene sequence data. 16s rrna gene sequence similarity between one of the strains, 341t, and recognized species within the genus bacteroides was <95 %. the dna g+c  content (44 mol%) and major fatty acid composition (anteiso-c(15 : 0), 32.0 %) supported the affiliation of strain 341(t) to the genus bacteroides. biochemical  tests and dna-dna hybridization analysis demonstrated that strain 341t was distinct from bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides helcogenes, to which it was related most closely. on the basis of these data, a novel bacteroides species, bacteroides intestinalis sp. nov., is proposed with strain 341t (= jcm 13265t = dsm 17393t) as the type strain.
