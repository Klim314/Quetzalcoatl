TI  == in vitro functional and immunomodulatory properties of the lactobacillus helveticus mimlh5-streptococcus salivarius st3 association that are relevant to the development of a pharyngeal probiotic product.
AB  == the use of proper bacterial strains as probiotics for the pharyngeal mucosa is a  potential prophylactic strategy for upper respiratory tract infections. in this context, we characterized in vitro the functional and immunomodulatory properties of the strains lactobacillus helveticus mimlh5 and streptococcus salivarius st3 that were selected during previous investigations as promising pharyngeal probiotics. in this study, we demonstrated in vitro that strains mimlh5 and st3,  alone and in combination, can efficiently adhere to pharyngeal epithelial cells,  antagonize streptococcus pyogenes, and modulate host innate immunity by inducing  potentially protective effects. in particular, we found that the strains mimlh5 and st3 activate u937 human macrophages by significantly inducing the expression  of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha). nonetheless, the induction of the anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (il-10) by mimlh5 or st3 was never lower than that of tnf-alpha, suggesting that these bacteria can potentially exert a regulatory rather than a proinflammatory effect. we also found that the strains mimlh5 and st3 induce cyclooxygenase 2 (cox-2) expression and demonstrated that toll-like receptor 2 (tlr-2) participates in the recognition of the strains mimlh5 and st3 by u937 cells. finally, we observed that these microorganisms grow efficiently when cocultured in milk, suggesting that the preparation of a milk-based fermented product containing both mimlh5 and st3 can be a practical solution for the administration of these bacteria. in conclusion, we propose the combined use of l. helveticus mimlh5 and s. salivarius st3 for the preparation of novel products that display probiotic properties for the pharyngeal mucosa.

TI  == ctsr, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == clpp and clpc of bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the clp atp-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. they play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the  so-called class iii group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. the product of ctsr, the first gene of the clpc operon, has now been  shown to act as a repressor of both clpp and clpc, as well as clpe, which encodes a novel member of the hsp100 clp atpase family. the ctsr protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. random mutagenesis, dnasel footprinting and dna sequence deletions and comparisons were  used to define a consensus ctsr recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. this target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus salivarius, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc oenos, lactobacillus sake, lactococcus lactis and clostridium acetobutylicum. ctsr homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by ctsr is highly conserved in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == cell wall anchoring of the streptococcus pyogenes m6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the m6 protein from streptococcus pyogenes is the best-characterized member of a  family of cell envelope-associated proteins. based on the observation that the c-terminal sorting signals of these proteins can drive cell wall anchoring of heterologous unanchored proteins, we have cloned and expressed the emm6 structural gene for the m6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria (lab). the emm6 gene was successfully expressed from lactococcal promoters in several lactococcus lactis strains, an animal-colonizing lactobacillus fermentum strain,  lactobacillus sake, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. the m6 protein was efficiently anchored to the cell wall in all strains tested. in lactobacilli, essentially all detectable m6 protein was cell wall associated. these results suggest the feasibility of using the c-terminal anchor moiety of m6 for protein surface display in lab.

TI  == inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-p), has been documented for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and lactococcus lactis, but not for other gram-positive bacteria. using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated atp-dependent hpr(ser) kinase that phosphorylates ser-46 in hpr of the phosphotransferase system. a small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-p phosphatase (pase  ii), previously identified only in lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. further, lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks pase ii. the results reveal that pase ii is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-p hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. they provide correlative evidence that pase ii initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.

TI  == binding of streptococcal antigens to muscle tissue in vitro.
AB  == antigens extracted from cells of streptococcus pyogenes t6 and streptococcus mutans strains aht, bht, 10449, omz175, and k1r adsorbed to the sarcolemmal sheath of cardiac muscle cells in vitro. similar preparations from s. salivarius, s. sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, and lactobacillus casei had weak or negligible tissue-binding activity. tissue-bound bacterial antigens were detected with homologous rabbit antisera with both indirect immunofluorescence tests and an indirect radioimmunoassay. serological cross-reactivity was observed between the  tissue-binding factors of s. pyogenes and s. mutans cells but not between the bacteria and muscle tissue. in a comparative study of extraction procedures, the  greatest yield of tissue-binding factors was obtained from group a streptococci by cell disruption in buffer at 4 degrees c. hot aqueous phenol and hot water extracts were inactive. antibodies specific for the tissue-binding factor(s) were readily adsorbed from rabbit anti-s. pyogenes serum by a preparation of isolated  cytoplasmic membranes but not by a suspension of cell wall fragments. the heart-binding component of s. pyogenes cell extracts was inactivated by protease  digestion and heat treatment and to a lesser extent by periodic acid oxidation. the capacity of heart cell components to adsorb streptococcal antigens was reduced by protease treatment but not by the action of neuraminidase, hyaluronidase, organic solvents, or detergents.
