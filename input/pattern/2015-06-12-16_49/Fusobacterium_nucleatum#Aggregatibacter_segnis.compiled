TI  - The antibacterial activity of various saturated and unsaturated fatty acids against several oral pathogens.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of various saturated fatty acids (SFA) and unsaturated fatty acids (USFA) against different oral pathogens which are implicated in the cause of dental caries, stomatitis, gingivitis, and periodontitis was examined. The saturated fatty acids Pa, StA and ArA, and the unsaturated omega-7 fatty acids PLA and omega-9 fatty acids OA showed either none to low antimicrobial activity against all of the 12 oral pathogenic strains used in this study. In contrast, the omega-3 PUFAs, ALA, SDA, EPA and DHA, and the omega-6 PUFAs, LA, GLA, and AA showed considerable antimicrobial activity against 8, 7, 6 and 5 strains, and 6, 10 and 5 strains, respectively. In particular, the omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs showed strong antimicrobial activity against Porphyromonas gingivalis KCTC 381, the cause of periodontitis, and against Aggregatibacter segnis KCTC 5968, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. Polymorphum KCTC 5172 and Prevotella intermedia KCTC 25611, all organisms implicated in the cause of gingivitis. To date, no bacterial resistance to free fatty acids has been encountered and no resistance phenotype has emerged. Therefore, these results suggest that PUFAs may be useful in the development of therapeutic agents for oral diseases, and in particular, in the development of agents that have minimal side effects and against which there is no bacterial resistance.
TI  - Preliminary molecular analysis of bacterial composition in periapical lesions with primary endodontic infections of deciduous teeth.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The bacterial composition of periapical lesions in deciduous teeth has not been well documented. This study was designed to explore the bacterial compositions, especially the dominant bacteria in periapical lesions using 16S rRNA sequencing. METHODS: Tissue samples were collected from 11 periapical lesions in deciduous teeth with primary endodontic infections. DNA was extracted from each sample and analyzed using 16S rRNA cloning and sequencing for the identification of bacteria. RESULTS: All DNA samples were positive for 16S rRNA gene PCR. One hundred and fifty-one phylotypes from 810 clones were identified to eight phyla, and each sample contained an average of 25.9 phylotypes. In addition, 59 phylotypes were detected in more than two samples, and Fusobacterium (F.) nucleatum (8/11), Dialister (D.) invisus (8/11), Campylobacter (C.) gracilis (7/11), Escherichia (E.) coli DH1 (6/11), Aggregatibacter (A.) segnis (6/11), and Streptococcus (S.) mitis (6/11) were the most prevalent species. Furthermore, 45 as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes were also identified. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic periapical lesions in deciduous teeth contained polymicrobial infections. F. nucleatum, D. invisus, C. gracilis, E. coli DH1, A. segnis, and S. mitis were the most prevalent species detected by 16S rRNA sequencing.
TI  - Predominant microflora of severe, moderate and minimal periodontal lesions in young adults with rapidly progressive periodontitis.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to study the microflora of severe, moderate and minimal periodontal lesions, in young adults with rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP). Subgingival plaque samples were taken from 142 periodontal lesions in 10 young adults aging 25 to 35 years. The examination of the subgingival microflora indicated that certain species, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Campylobacter species were found to be predominant in severe periodontal lesions. B. forsythus, P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, F. nucleatum, Capnocytophaga ochracea, were predominant in medium lesions while Streptococcus species and Actinomyces species, C. ochracea, Haemophilus segnis and Veillonella parvula, were found in higher levels in minimal periodontal lesions.
