TI  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 Lactobacillus and three Bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. Agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (pH 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; CFS) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; CFW) from de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. Acid CFS and CFW showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against C. albicans. Neutralized CFS/CFW assays showed six strains active against S. aureus (L. acidophilus L-1, L. brevis 1, L. fermentum 1, B. animalis subsp. lactis L-3), E. coli (L. bulgaricus 6) or B. cereus (L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic). Inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized CFS (L. bulgaricus 6, L. helveticus 3, L. plantarum 24-2L, L. fermentum 1)/CFW (L. plantarum 24-5D, L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic) was detected. Some strains maintained activity after pH neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. The antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the Epsilometer test method. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. Four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (L. rhamnosus Lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (L. acidophilus L-1 and L. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; L. casei L-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). Vancomycin MICs > 256 mug/mL indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. The antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.
TI  - [Comparison of expression and antibacterial activities of recombinant porcine lactoferrin expressed in four Lactobacillus species].
AB  - The coding sequence for the mature peptide of porcine lactoferrin (Plf) was synthesized according to the codon usage of lactobacillus, to establish optimized porcine lactoferrin Lactobacillus expression system. The gene was ligated into the Xho I/BamH I site of Lactobacillus expression vector pPG612.1 and the recombinant plasmid pPG612.1-plf was transformed individually into Lactobacillus casei ATCC393, Lactobacillus pentosus KLDS1.0413, Lactobacillus plantarum KLDS1.0344 or Lactobacillus paracasei KLDS1.0652 by electroporation. After induction with xylose, expression of the recombinant proteins was detected by Western blotting and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Secretion of recombinant Plf proteins from four recombinant species was determined quantitatively by ELISA. The antibacterial activities of recombinant proteins were measured by agar diffusion method. The result shows that Plf was correctly expressed in four species of recombinant lactobacillus, with molecular weight of about 73 kDa. The expression levels in recombinant Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei were 9.6 mug/mL, 10.8 mug/mL, 12.5 mug/mL and 9.9 mug/mL, respectively. Antimicrobial activity experiment shows that the recombinant proteins were active against E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria, Pasteurella. The recombinant Plf expressed by recombinant Lactobacillus plantarum showed the best antibacterial activity among all recombinant lactobacillus species. These data represent a basis for the development and application of porcine lactoferrin from recombinant lactobacillus.
TI  - Influence of a probiotic Lactobacillus casei strain on the colonisation with potential pathogenic streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus in the nasopharyngeal space of healthy men with a low baseline NK cell activity.
AB  - The effect of a daily intake of the probiotic strain Lactobacillus casei Shirota  (LcS) on the colonisation of pathogens, specifically streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus, in the nose and throat of healthy human volunteers with low natural killer cell activity, was investigated in a randomised and controlled intervention study. The study consisted of a 2-week run-in phase, followed by a 4-week intervention phase. The probiotic treatment group received a fermented milk drink with LcS, while the placebo group received an equally composed milk drink without the probiotic additive. To isolate potential pathogenic streptococci and Staph. aureus, samples from the pharynx, as well as of both middle nasal meati, were taken, once after the run-in phase and once at the end of the intervention phase. Isolated bacteria were identified as either Staph. aureus and alpha- or beta-haemolytic streptococci in a polyphasic taxonomical approach based on phenotypic tests, amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis genotyping, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing of representative strains. Salivary secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) was used as marker of protective mucosal immunity to evaluate whether LcS treatment influenced SIgA production. No statistically significant effect could be determined for intervention with LcS on the incidence of Staph. aureus in the nasal space, Staph. aureus in the pharyngeal space or for beta-haemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae in the pharyngeal space. Thus, the intervention did not influence the nasopharyngeal colonisation with Gram-positive potential pathogens. Production of salivary SIgA as a potential means of microbiota modulation was also not affected.
TI  - Molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old Tunisian children.
AB  - The occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old Tunisian children was investigated. Samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). Genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. All samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. Streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic DNA collected from carious lesions. Other prevalent species were Candida spp (63%), Streptococcus salivarius (59%) and Streptococcus oralis (42%). The frequency of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. Pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. Frequency of Porphyromonas endodontali, Actinomyces radicidentis and Treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. PCR analysis of genomic DNA detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. In addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (S. mutans, S. salivarius, L. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.
TI  - Plasmin digest of kappa-casein as a source of antibacterial peptides.
AB  - This study investigated the antibacterial properties of plasmin, the plasmin hydrolysis of bovine kappa-casein and the fractions (named kappaC1, kappaC2, kappaC3, kappaC4, and kappaC5) liberated from it using RP-HPLC. The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus (probiotic). Three peptides (kC1, kC3, and kC4) were found to have antibacterial activity, with kappaC3 peptide being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine kappa-casein proved to be stronger than any of its fractions in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) showed that Gram-positive bacteria are generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than Gram-negative bacteria. The MIC of nisin, as a bacteriocin peptide, was also measured. The three antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular mass of kC1, kC3, and kC4 corresponded to the f(17-21), f(22-24), and f(1-3) of bovine kappa-casein, respectively. It was also found that the positive charge and hydrophobicity of a peptide are not key factors in antibacterial activity. On the whole, the present study demonstrated that the plasmin digest of kappa-casein has a high antibacterial potential and can be considered as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.
TI  - [Development of polycomponent metabolite probiotic].
AB  - AIM: Construct composition of polycomponent probiotic based on lactobacilli cultural fluid (CF) supernatant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Species membership of lactobacilli strains was specified by analysis of nucleotide sequences of 16S RNA genes. For comparison of probiotic effect of CF, supernatant and ultrafiltrate of a consortium of lactobacilli strains, studies of specter of peptides, amino- and other organic acids contained in them as well as profile of bactericidal and fungicidal activity was carried out. RESULTS; Technology of production of amicrobial probiotic agent based on CF of the consortium of lactobacilli strains was developed. During determination of concentration of metabolites of protein nature analogy of parameters was shown in CF supernatant and native lactobacilli cultures. In both the studied supernatants and CF the same set of organic acids was also reported to be present. During comparison of antimicrobial and anticandidosis activity of lactobacilli native culture and CF supernatant against Staphylococcus aureus 209, Enterococcus faecalis 1154 and Candida albicans 5 test-strains, an equivalent effect of both samples was shown. CONCLUSION: Polycomponent metabolite probiotic based on CF supernatant of Lactobacillus helveticus NKJC, Lactobacillus helveticus JCH and Lactobacillus casei KAA strains completely retains bactericidal and fungicidal activity of the native culture of the consortium of strains and at the same time lacks disadvantages of compositions containing live microorganisms.
TI  - Detection, partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus brevis FPTLB3 isolated from freshwater fish: Bacteriocin from Lb. brevis FPTLB3.
AB  - Lactobacillus brevis FPTLB3 was isolated from freshwater fish, capable of producing bacteriocin that had broad spectrum of inhibition (3200 AU/ml) against Escherichia coli MTCC 1563, Enterococcus faecalis MTCC 2729, Lactobacillus casei MTCC 1423, Lactobacillus sakei ATCC 15521 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. The antimicrobial activity of crude supernatant fluid was stable after heating at 121 degrees C for 60 min and declined thereafter. Stability of antimicrobial activity was observed at pH range of 2.0 to 8.0. Its active principle was proteinaceous in nature since the bacteriocin was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but not by other non-proteolytic enzymes. Mitomycin C and UV light did not affect the activity of the bacteriocin, while chloroform extraction completely destroyed their activity. Exposure to surfactant resulted in an increase in titre, except Nonidet P-40, which led to total loss of activity. No bacteriocin adsorption was detected at pH 1 to 2, whereas 100% bacteriocin adsorption was found at pH 6.5. Based on Tricine SDS-PAGE the estimated molecular mass of bacteriocin was 54 kDa. No plasmid was found to present in the isolate.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (ITCs) extracted from horseradish (Armoracia rusticana) root against oral microorganisms.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (ITCs) extracted from horseradish root was investigated against oral microorganisms: 6 strains of facultative anaerobic bacteria, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus casei, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; one strain of yeast, Candida albicans, and 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella nigrescens, and Clostridium perfringens. The ITCs extracted from horseradish root showed antimicrobial activity against all oral microorganisms by the paper disk method. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the ITCs extracted from horseradish root ranged from 1.25 to 5.00 mg/ml against 6 strains of facultative anaerobic bacteria and one strain of yeast, and 4.17 to 16.67 mg/ml against 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria. The ITCs extracted from horseradish root showed the strongest antimicrobial activity, with a MBC of 1.25 mg/ml, against C. albicans among facultative microorganisms, and 4.17 mg/ml against F. nucleatum among anaerobic bacteria. These results suggest that the ITCs extracted from horseradish root may be a candidate for use as an antimicrobial agent against oral microorganisms.
TI  - Role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  - Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. Following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285((R)) and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R((R)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical MRSA isolates, we conducted a literature search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment of S. aureus infection. As summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of S. aureus and clinical isolates of MRSA in vitro. The most active strains were Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Propionibacterium freudenreichii, Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus paracasei, L. acidophilus, L. casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactococcus lactis. Their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. L. acidophilus also inhibited S. aureus biofilm formation and lipase production. In vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. S. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in vitro to L. acidophilus, whilst in vivo Bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. On the other hand, L. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against S. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with S. aureus in mice. Very few clinical data were found on the interactions between probiotics and MRSA, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of MRSA colonisation with probiotic use.
TI  - Anticariogenic and phytochemical evaluation of Eucalyptus globules Labill.
AB  - In the present study, in vitro anticariogenic potential of ethyl acetate, hexane  and methanol and aqueous extracts of plant leaves of Eucalyptus globules Labill. were evaluated by using four cariogenic bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans. Agar well diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were used for this purpose. The ethyl acetate extracted fraction of plant leaves showed good inhibitory effects against all selected bacteria. In Eucalyptus globules, hexane and ethyl acetate extracts found highly effective against, Lactobacillus acidophilus with MIC value of 0.031 and 0.062 mg/mL, respectively. Qualitative phytochemical investigation of above extracts showed the presence of alkaloids, phenolic compounds, steroids, cardiac glycosides and terpenes. Based on the MIC value and bioautography, ethyl acetate of plant leaf was selected for further study. Further investigation on the structure elucidation of the bioactive compound using IR, GC-MS and NMR techniques revealed the presence of alpha-farnesene, a sesquiterpene. Eucalyptus globules plant leaf extracts have great potential as anticariogenic agents that may be useful in the treatment of oral disease.
TI  - The effect of Lacto- and Bifidobacteria in monoculture on the vaginal microflora  in norm and in cases of intravaginal staphylococcosis.
AB  - The influence of probiotic strains of Lactobacillus casei IMV B-7280, Lactobacillus acidophilus IMV B-7279, Bifidobacterium animalis VKL, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus IMV B-7281 and Bifidobacterium animalis VKB, each strain separately, to the range of the urogenital tract microflora in physiological norm and in cases of experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis of mice induced by Staphylococcus aureus 8325-4. It was found that all these strains had different efficiency in Staphylococcus aureus 8325-4 growth suppression in the vagina of infected mice and affect the spectrum of microorganisms. Lactobacillus casei IMV B-7280 strain had effective antistaphylococcal effect and reduced the number of coliform bacteria and fungi in the vagina in cases of intravaginal staphylococcosis of mice. Lactobacillus casei IMV B-7280 strain is promising to create probiotic drugs effective in treating intravaginal staphylococcosis.
TI  - Evaluation of three medicinal plants for anti-microbial activity.
AB  - Herbal remedies have a long history of use for gum and tooth problems such as dental caries. The present microbiological study was carried out to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of three medicinal plants (Terminalia chebula Retz., Clitoria ternatea Linn., and Wedelia chinensis (Osbeck.) Merr.) on three pathogenic microorganisms in the oral cavity (Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus casei, and Staphylococcus aureus). Aqueous extract concentrations (5%, 10%, 25%, and 50%) were prepared from the fruits of Terminalia chebula, flowers of Clitoria ternatea, and leaves of Wedelia chinensis. The antimicrobial efficacy of the aqueous extract concentrations of each plant was tested using agar well diffusion method and the size of the inhibition zone was measured in millimeters. The results obtained showed that the diameter of zone of inhibition increased with increase in concentration of extract and the antimicrobial efficacy of the aqueous extracts of the three plants was observed in the increasing order - Wedelia chinensis < Clitoria ternatea < Terminalia chebula. It can be concluded that the tested extracts of all the three plants were effective against dental caries causing bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of silver zeolite, silver zirconium phosphate silicate and  silver zirconium phosphate against oral microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antimicrobial activities of silver inorganic materials, including silver zeolite (AgZ), silver zirconium phosphate silicate (AgZrPSi) and silver zirconium phosphate (AgZrP), against oral microorganisms. In line with this objective, the morphology and structure of each type of silver based powders were also investigated. METHODS: The antimicrobial activities of AgZ, AgZrPSi and AgZrP were tested against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus casei, Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus using disk diffusion assay as a screening test. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum lethal concentration (MLC) were determined using the modified membrane method. Scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction were used to investigate the morphology and structure of these silver materials. RESULTS: All forms of silver inorganic materials could inhibit the growth of all test microorganisms. The MIC of AgZ, AgZrPSi and AgZrP was 10.0 g/L whereas MLC ranged between 10.0-60.0 g/L. In terms of morphology and structure, AgZrPSi and AgZrP had smaller sized particles (1.5-3.0 microm) and more uniformly shaped than AgZ. CONCLUSIONS: Silver inorganic materials in the form of AgZ, AgZrPSi and AgZrP had antimicrobial effects against all test oral microorganisms and those activities may be influenced by the crystal structure of carriers. These results suggest that these silver materials may be useful metals applied to oral hygiene products to provide antimicrobial activity against oral infection.
TI  - Blood contamination of used dental anesthetic cartridges.
AB  - This study sought to determine the levels of blood contamination found in and/or  on used dental anesthetic cartridges and to measure antibacterial effects after exposure to a local anesthetic solution. The study analyzed a total of 1000 used cartridges from an oral surgery clinic, containing 1 of 3 anesthetic types. Blood testing included visual observations (using a dissecting microscope) and chemical analyses. From each cartridge, either 0.5 ml of residual anesthetic solution or a combination of anesthetic solution plus added saline was removed. Using reagent strip dipsticks, the solutions were analyzed for minute amounts of blood. Visual examinations were scored on a positive or negative scale. In addition, 4 types of bacteria were mixed with lidocaine or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for up to 30 days, and viable cell counts decreases were measured for the 2 solutions. A majority of the cartridges evaluated contained lidocaine, and while only 7 of the 1000 cartridges examined contained visible blood, the reagent strips detected blood in more than 76% of all cartridges. Lidocaine and PBS produced similar bacterial death rates. The authors concluded that blood contamination levels in the absence of pronounced antibacterial activity indicate that dental anesthetic cartridges could be considered a potential type of regulated medical waste.
TI  - Bacteriocin PJ4 active against enteric pathogen produced by Lactobacillus helveticus PJ4 isolated from gut microflora of wistar rat (Rattus norvegicus): partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin.
AB  - The increase of multidrug-resistant pathogens and the restriction on the use antibiotics due to its side effects have drawn attention to the search for possible alternatives. Bacteriocins are small antimicrobial peptides produced by numerous bacteria. Much interest has been focused on bacteriocins because they exhibit inhibitory activity against pathogens. Lactic acid bacteria possess the ability to synthesize antimicrobial compounds (like bacteriocin) during their growth. In this study, an antibacterial substance (bacteriocin PJ4) produced by Lactobacillus helveticus PJ4, isolated from rat gut microflora, was identified as bacteriocin. It was effective against wide assay of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria involved in various diseases, including Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. The antimicrobial peptide was relatively heat-resistant and also active over a wide pH range of 2-10. It has been partially purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate precipitation and size exclusion chromatography and checked on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of bacteriocin PJ4 purified through size exclusion chromatography resolved ~6.5 kDa protein with bacteriocin activity. The peptide is inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, trypsin, and lipase but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, and pepsin. It showed a bactericidal mode of action against the indicator strains E. coli MTCC443, Lactobacillus casei MTCC1423, and E. faecalis DT48. Such characteristics indicate that this bacteriocin may be a potential candidate for alternative agents to control important pathogens.
TI  - Early-life gut bacteria associate with IL-4-, IL-10- and IFN-gamma production at  two years of age.
AB  - Microbial exposure early in life influences immune maturation and potentially also the development of immune-mediated disease. Here we studied early-life gut colonization in relation to cytokine responses at two years of age. Fecal samples were collected from infants during the first two months of life. DNA was extracted from the fecal samples and Bifidobacterium (B.) adolescentis, B. breve, B. bifidum, a group of lactobacilli (L. casei, L. paracasei and L. rhamnosus) as well as Staphylococcus (S.) aureus were detected with real time PCR. Peripheral mononuclear cells were stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and numbers of IL-4-, IL-10- and IFN-gamma secreting cells were evaluated using ELISpot. We further stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants in vitro and assessed the IL-4-, IL-10- and IFN-gamma inducing capacity by flow cytometry and ELISA. Early S. aureus colonization associated with higher numbers of IL-4- (p = 0.022) and IL-10 (p = 0.016) producing cells at two years of age. In contrast to colonization with S. aureus alone, co-colonization with lactobacilli associated with suppression of IL-4- (p = 0.004), IL-10- (p = 0.004) and IFN-gamma (p = 0.034) secreting cells. In vitro stimulations of mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants supported a suppressive role of L. rhamnosus GG on S. aureus-induced cytokine responses. We demonstrate that the early gut colonization pattern associates with the PHA-induced cytokine profile at two years of age and our in vitro findings support that specific bacterial species influence the T helper cell subsets. This suggests that dysbiosis in the early microbiota may modulate the risk of developing inflammatory conditions like allergy.
TI  - Inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus invasion into bovine mammary epithelial cells by contact with live Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a major pathogen that is responsible for mastitis in dairy herds. S. aureus mastitis is difficult to treat and prone to recurrence despite antibiotic treatment. The ability of S. aureus to invade bovine mammary epithelial cells (bMEC) is evoked to explain this chronicity. One sustainable alternative to treat or prevent mastitis is the use of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as mammary probiotics. In this study, we tested the ability of Lactobacillus casei strains to prevent invasion of bMEC by two S. aureus bovine strains, RF122 and Newbould305, which reproducibly induce acute and moderate mastitis, respectively. L. casei strains affected adhesion and/or internalization of S. aureus in a strain-dependent manner. Interestingly, L. casei CIRM-BIA 667 reduced S. aureus Newbould305 and RF122 internalization by 60 to 80%, and this inhibition was confirmed for two other L. casei strains, including one isolated from bovine teat canal. The protective effect occurred without affecting bMEC morphology and viability. Once internalized, the fate of S. aureus was not affected by L. casei. It should be noted that L. casei was internalized at a low rate but survived in bMEC cells with a better efficiency than that of S. aureus RF122. Inhibition of S. aureus adhesion was maintained with heat-killed L. casei, whereas contact between live L. casei and S. aureus or bMEC was required to prevent S. aureus internalization. This first study of the antagonism of LAB toward S. aureus in a mammary context opens avenues for the development of novel control strategies against this major pathogen.
TI  - Probiotic potential of Lactobacillus spp. isolated from Brazilian regional ovine  cheese.
AB  - Twelve Lactobacillus isolates from Brazilian starter-free ovine cheeses were evaluated for their probiotic potential. The strains were identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as Lactobacillus plantarum (7), Lb. brevis (2), Lb. casei (2) and Lb. parabuchneri (1). All strains showed variable resistance to gastric juices and relative tolerance to pancreatin and bile salts. Only five strains of Lb. plantarum could not deconjugate the sodium salt of taurodeoxycholic acid. Autoaggregation ability after 24 h was above 50% and hydrophobicity was higher than 60% for most strains. All lactobacilli could inhibit linolenic acid oxidation, except Lb. parabuchneri strain, whereas none of them could scavenge DPPH radical. beta-Galactosidase activity ranged from 47.7 to 2503 Miller units. Inhibition of food pathogens Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium was demonstrated and the production of organic acids could be associated with this effect. The Lactobacillus strains from Brazilian regional ovine cheese showed interesting functional characteristics, mainly the strains Lb. brevis SM-B and Lb. plantarum SM-I. Both presented high acid tolerance. In addition, Lb. brevis SM-B also displayed remarkable antioxidant activity and Lb. plantarum SM-I was the highest beta-galactosidase producer, exhibited high autoaggregation and hydrophobicity properties.
TI  - The effect of lacto- and bifidobacteria compositions on the vaginal microflora in cases of intravaginal staphylococcosis.
AB  - The effect of intravaginal injection of Lactobacillus casei IMV B-7280, Lactobacillus acidophilus IMV B-7279, Bifidobacterium animalis VKL and Bifidobacterium animalis VKB strains in various compositions on the range of microflora of the urogenital tract on the model of experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis of mice was determined. It was established that under the influence of various compositions of these strains changes in microflora spectrum occurred: the number of representatives of normoflora increased and the number of pathogenic microorganisms, including staphylococci, streptococci, coliform bacteria and fungi, significantly decreased. It was determined that strains of lacto- and bifidobacteria, that were studied, are prospective components of future probiotic drugs efficient in treating staphylococcosis.
TI  - Development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in Thai fermented sausage.
AB  - To improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. Microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. A total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16S rRNA gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species, including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. After fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. The array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (Lactobacillus plantarum group, L. fermentum, L. brevis, L. delbrueckii, L. casei, L. sakei, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Listeria monocytogenes) except L. animalis. Multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. The feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with Thai fermented sausages (Nham). Meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, L. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and L. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. The naturally-fermented Nham contained L. sakei, L. delbrueckii, L. plantarum and L. fermentum. The L. plantarum-inoculated Nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for L. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. The L. brevis-inoculated Nham contained L. brevis, L. plantarum, L. delbrueckii and L. fermentum. The array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. The naturally-fermented and L. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of L. plantarum on day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. In contrast, the L. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and L. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. The bacteria identification array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.
TI  - Effects of bile salt deconjugation by probiotic strains on the survival of antibiotic-resistant foodborne pathogens under simulated gastric conditions.
AB  - This study was designed to evaluate the effects of bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains on the antibiotic susceptibility of antibiotic-sensitive and multiple antibiotic-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. Eight probiotic strains, Bifidobacterium longum B6, Lactobacillus acidophilus ADH, Lactobacillus brevis KACC 10553, Lactobacillus casei KACC 12413, Lactobacillus paracasei ATCC 25598, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Leuconostoc mesenteroides KACC 12312, and Pediococcus acidilactici KACC 12307, were used to examine bile acid tolerance. The ability to deconjugate bile acids was evaluated using both thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. The antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out to determine the synergistic inhibitory activity of deconjugated bile acids. L. acidophilus, L. brevis, and P. acidilactici showed the most tolerance to the conjugated bile acids. P. acidilactici deconjugated glycocholic acid and glycodeoxycholate from 3.18 and 3.09 mM to the detection limits, respectively. The antibiotic susceptibility of selected foodborne pathogens was increased by increasing the concentration of deconjugated bile acids. The study results are useful for understanding the relationship between bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains and antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of deconjugated bile acids, and they may be useful for designing new probiotic-antibiotic combination therapy based on bile acid deconjugation.
TI  - Antagonistic Action of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria in Relation to Staphylococcus aureus and Their Influence on the Immune Response in Cases of Intravaginal Staphylococcosis in Mice.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus casei IMV B-7280, Lact. acidophilus IMV B-7279, Bifidobacterium longum VK1, and B. bifidum VK2 strains or their various compositions in relation to Staphylococcus aureus in vitro and on models of experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis of mice was determined. It was found that under the influence of these strains and their various compositions, the in vitro growth of Staph. aureus was inhibited, and the number of colonies of Staph. aureus plated from the vagina of infected mice was significantly reduced. The antibacterial activity of these strains separately and in compositions correlated with their ability to improve the performance of the immune response. These strains were the most effective in the following compositions: Lact. casei IMV B-7280-B. longum VK1-B. bifidum VK2. Strains of Lact. casei IMV B-7280, Lact. acidophilus IMV B-7279, B. bifidum VK2, and B. longum VK1 are prospective components of future probiotic drugs efficient in treating staphylococcosis and for immunity correction.
TI  - Inhibitory activity of fermented milk with Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota against common multidrug-resistant bacteria causing hospital-acquired infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine inhibitory activity of fermented milk with Lactobacillus  casei strain Shirota (FMLC) against common multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria causing hospital-acquired infections. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Time-kill methods of FMLC and cell-free filtered fluid of FMLC (CF-FMLC) against Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ESBL-producing Escherichia coli & Klebsiella pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were conducted. The control solutions were Mueller Hinton broth (MHB) and distilled water. The mixtures of FMLC, CF-FMLC, MHB and DW with 10(5) to 10(6) CFU/ml of each bacterium were prepared and incubated at 35 degrees C. Each mixture was quantified for viable bacteria at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 24 hr after incubation onto brain heart infusion agar plates. The inoculated agar plates were incubated at 35 degrees C for 24-48 hr. Bacterial colonies on agar plates were counted and compared among the mixtures. RESULTS: Log CFUs of each organism in MHB and distilled water after incubation were increased from 5.1-6.3 at 0 h to 6.4- > 11 at 24 hr. Log CFUs of each organism in FMLC and CF-FMLC after incubation with study bacteria for 0, 1, 3, 6 and 24 hr were decreased to undetectable amounts at 24 hr. CONCLUSION: FMLC and CF-FMLC exerted slow inhibitory activity against MDR bacteria resulting in eradication of all study bacteria at 24 hr. Such inhibitory effects were probably due to the products of the milk fermented by Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota. Clinical study is needed to determine if consumption of FMLC can prevent and treat colonization and infection with MDR bacteria in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Characteristics of microbial biofilm on wooden vats ('gerles') in PDO Salers cheese.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterize microbial biofilms from 'gerles' (wooden vats for making PDO Salers cheese) and identify their role in milk inoculation and in preventing pathogen development. Gerles from ten farms producing PDO Salers cheese were subjected to microbial analysis during at least 4 periods spread over two years. They were distinguished by their levels of Lactobacillus (between 4.50 and 6.01 log CFU/cm(2)), Gram negative bacteria (between 1.45 and 4.56 log CFU/cm(2)), yeasts (between 2.91 and 5.57 log CFU/cm(2)), and moulds (between 1.72 and 4.52 log CFU/cm(2)). They were then classed into 4 groups according their microbial characteristics. These 4 groups were characterized by different milk inoculations (with either sour whey or starter culture, daily or not), and different washing procedures (with water or whey from cheese making). The farm gerles were not contaminated by Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes or Staphylococcus aureus. Only one slight, punctual contamination was found on one gerle among the ten studied. Even when the milk was deliberately contaminated with L. monocytogenes and S. aureus in the 40 L experimental gerles, these pathogens were found neither on the gerle surfaces nor in the cheeses. Using 40 L experimental gerles it was shown that the microbial biofilms on the gerle surfaces formed in less than one week and then remained stable. They were mainly composed of a great diversity of lactic acid bacteria (Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus hilgardii,...), Gram positive catalase positive bacteria (Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, Curtobacterium oceanosedimentum Citrococcus spp., Brachybacterium rhamnosum, Kocuria rhizophila, Arthrobacter spp....) and yeast (Kluyveromyces lactis, Kluyveromyces marxianus). In less than 1 min, even in a 500 L farm gerle, the gerle's microbial biofilm can inoculate pasteurized milk with micro-organisms at levels superior to those in raw milk.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of an antimicrobial monomer for application in prosthodontics.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of the monomer methacryloyloxyundecylpyridinium bromide (MUPB), an antiseptic agent capable of copolymerizing with denture base acrylic resins. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of MUPB was tested against the species Candida albicans, Candida dubliniensis, Candida glabrata, Lactobacillus casei, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus mutans. The minimum inhibitory and fungicidal/bactericidal concentrations (MIC, MFC/MBC) of MUPB were determined by serial dilutions in comparison with cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC). The cytotoxic effects of MUPB at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1 g/L were assessed by MTT test on L929 cells and compared with methyl methacrylate (MMA). The antimicrobial activity of copolymerized MUPB was tested by means of acrylic resin specimens containing three concentrations of the monomer (0, 0.3, 0.6% w/w). Activity was quantified by means of a disc diffusion test and a quantification of adhered planktonic cells. Statistical analysis employed the Mann-Whitney test for MIC and MFC/MBC, and ANOVA for the microbial adherence test (alpha = 0.05). RESULTS: MUBP presented lower MIC values when compared with CPC, although differences were significant for C. dubliniensis and S. mutans only (p= 0.046 and 0.043, respectively). MFC/MBC values were similar for all species except C. albicans; in that case, MUPB presented significantly higher values (p = 0.046). MUPB presented higher cytotoxicity than MMA for all tested concentrations (p < 0.001) except at 0.01 g/L. Irrespective of the concentration incorporated and species, there was no inhibition halo around the specimens. The incorporation of MUPB influenced the adhesion of C. albicans only (p = 0.003), with lower CFU counts for the 0.6% group. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that non-polymerized MUPB has an antimicrobial capacity close to that of CPC and high cytotoxicity when compared with MMA. The antimicrobial activity of MUPB after incorporation within a denture base acrylic resin did not depend on its elution, but was shown to be restricted to C. albicans.
TI  - [The influence of lactic acid bacteria and yeast on production of staphylococcal  enterotoxins].
AB  - Research of influence of 10 lactic acid bacteria cultures on staphylococcal growth and production of staphylococcal enterotoxins SEA and SEB has shown that lactic acid bacteria slow down SEA in 5,7 fold and SEB - 1,56 fold. All investigated cultures possessed inhibition action on SEA and SEB production. Has been established, what lactic acid bacteria slow down growth of staphylococcus in 1,48 fold. It has shown that appears, that the most effective inhibitors of SEA and SEB production are strains L. casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus 317/402.
TI  - Antimicrobial prenylated acetophenones from berries of Harrisonia abyssinica.
AB  - The ripe berries of Harrisonia abyssinica yielded two new prenylated acetophenones, namely 5-(ethan-1'''-one)-4,6-dihydroxy-7-(3'',3''-dimethylallyl)-2 S-(1' S-hydroxy-1',5'-dimethylhex-4'-enyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (1) and 5-(2'''-hydroxyethan-1'''-one)-4,6-dihydroxy-7-(3'',3''-dimethylallyl)-2 S-(1' S-hydroxy-1',5'-dimethylhex-4'-enyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (2), herein named harronin I and harronin II, respectively. The compounds were isolated following activity guided fractionation and the structures were determined using 1D, 2D NMR spectroscopic, CD and MS spectrometric techniques. The methanol-dichloromethane mixture (1 : 1 v/v) crude extract exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Lactobacillus casei. Harronin I (1) showed a MIC of 5 microg/mL against C. albicans, 6 microg/mL against B. cereus, and more than 20 microg/mL against other tested microorganisms. Harronin II (2) showed much weaker MIC values (> 100 microg/mL) against all the tested microorganisms.
TI  - Probiotic features of two oral Lactobacillus isolates.
AB  - In this study, we checked lactobacilli strains of human origin for their potential as probiotic. Samples were collected from oral mucosa of 16 healthy individuals, out of which twenty isolates were obtained and two of them were selected and identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (G1) and L. casei (G3). Both isolates exhibited antagonistic action towards pathogenic microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella abony, and Clostridium sporogenes, but not on the growth of Candida albicans. The bacteriocin activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6358-P was shown only by L. plantarum G1. Moreover, the isolates G1 and G3 showed good viability in the acid gastric environment and in the gut environment containing bovine bile salts. The viability of G1 and G3 isolates in the gastrointestinal tract, and the adhesion to the intestinal mucosa were also confirmed in vivo. The biochemical tests of blood samples revealed lower levels of serum triglycerides and cholesterol, as well as reduced activity of alkaline phosphatase in all lactobacilli-treated Wistar rats, compared to control ones. No toxicity for NMRI Ham mice was observed. According to our experimental results, these findings imply that L. plantarum G1 and L. casei G3 could be characterized as potential probiotics.
TI  - Synthesis, SAR and antibacterial activity of hybrid chloro, dichloro-phenylthiazolyl-s-triazines.
AB  - A series of hybrid novel chloro (1a-9a) and dichloro (10b-18b) phenylthiazolyl-s-triazine were synthesized and subsequently subjected to their antibacterial activity against three gram positive viz. Lactobacillus casei (NCIM-2651); Bacillus cereus (NCIM-2458); Staphylococcus aureus (NCIM-2120) and three gram negative viz Salmonella typhimurium (NCIM-2501); Escherichia coli (NCIM-2065); Klebsiella aerogenes (NCIM-2098). The SAR studies around the lead compound revealed that introduction of electron withdrawing groups and amino (-NH-) and mercapto (-S-) linker bridge seemed more promising towards antibacterial activity. Moreover, the virtual Molinspiration screenings are in compliance with Ghose's rule.
TI  - The fate of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua and Staphylococcus aureus in Danish raw milk and cheeses determined by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR.
AB  - The purpose of this work was to study the bacterial communities in raw milk and in Danish raw milk cheeses using pyrosequencing of tagged amplicons of the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rDNA and cDNA. Furthermore, the effects of acidification and ripening starter cultures, cooking temperatures and rate of acidification on survival of added Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua and Staphylococcus aureus in cheeses at different stages of ripening were studied by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR. A high diversity of bacterial species was detected in raw milk. Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus were the main bacteria detected in raw milk and cheeses. Bacteria belonging to the genera Brevibacterium, Staphylococcus, Escherichia, Weissella, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus were also detected in both 16S rDNA and cDNA obtained from raw milk and cheeses. E. coli, which was added to milk used for production of some cheeses, was detected in both DNA and RNA extracted from cheeses at different stages of ripening showing the highest percentage of the total sequence reads at 7 days of ripening and decreased again in the later ripening stages. Growth of E. coli in cheeses appeared to be affected by the cooking temperature and the rate of acidification but not by the ripening starter cultures applied or the indigenous microbiota of raw milk. Growth of L. innocua and S. aureus added to milks was inhibited in all cheeses at different stages of ripening. The use of 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and qRT-PCR allows a deeper understanding of the behavior of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures and pathogenic bacteria in raw milk and cheeses.
TI  - Early colonization with a group of Lactobacilli decreases the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbial deprivation early in life can potentially influence immune  mediated disease development such as allergy. The aims of this study were to investigate the influence of parental allergy on the infant gut colonization and associations between infant gut microbiota and allergic disease at five years of age. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Fecal samples were collected from 58 infants, with allergic or non-allergic parents respectively, at one and two weeks as well as at one, two and twelve months of life. DNA was extracted from the fecal samples and Real time PCR, using species-specific primers, was used for detection of Bifidobacterium (B.) adolescentis, B. breve, B. bifidum, Clostridium (C.) difficile, a group of Lactobacilli (Lactobacillus (L.) casei, L. paracasei and L. rhamnosus) as well as Staphylococcus (S.) aureus. Infants with non-allergic parents were more frequently colonized by Lactobacilli compared to infants with allergic parents (p = 0.014). However, non-allergic five-year olds acquired Lactobacilli more frequently during their first weeks of life, than their allergic counterparts, irrespectively of parental allergy (p = 0.009, p = 0.028). Further the non-allergic children were colonized with Lactobacilli on more occasions during the first two months of life (p = 0.038). Also, significantly more non-allergic children were colonized with B. bifidum at one week of age than the children allergic at five years (p = 0.048). CONCLUSION: In this study we show that heredity for allergy has an impact on the gut microbiota in infants but also that early Lactobacilli (L. casei, L. paracasei, L. rhamnosus) colonization seems to decrease the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.
TI  - Incorporation of probiotic bacteria in whey cheese: decreasing the risk of microbial contamination.
AB  - For dairy products that are consumed fresh, contamination by spoilage microorganisms and pathogens from the environment is a major concern. Contamination has been associated with a number of outbreaks of foodborne illnesses; however, consistent data pertaining to the microbial safety of whey cheeses specifically have not been reported. Hence, the goals of this research effort were (i) to manufacture a probiotic whey cheese with Bifidobacterium animalis and Lactobacillus casei and (ii) to assess the antimicrobial activity of these probiotics against a set of foodborne pathogens (Listeria innocua, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Staphylococcus aureus) and food spoilage microorganisms (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli). Three ranges of these microbial contaminants were used for inoculation of cheeses: 10(3) to 10(4), 10(4) to 10(6), and 10(6) to 10(8) CFU/g. Inoculation in plain culture medium served as a control. The inhibition produced by the probiotics was calculated, and the major effect was found to be bacteriostatic. In specific cases, full inhibition was observed, i.e., by B. animalis against P. aeruginosa and by L. casei against Salmonella Enteritidis and L. innocua. Conversely, the least inhibition was detected for L. casei against P. aeruginosa. Our results suggest that use of these probiotic strains can extend the shelf life of whey cheeses and make them safer by delaying or preventing growth of common contaminant bacteria.
TI  - NOD dendritic cells stimulated with Lactobacilli preferentially produce IL-10 versus IL-12 and decrease diabetes incidence.
AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) from NOD mice produced high levels of IL-12 that induce IFNgamma-producing T cells involved in diabetes development. We propose to utilize the microorganism ability to induce tolerogenic DCs to abrogate the proinflammatory process and prevent diabetes development. NOD DCs were stimulated with Lactobacilli (nonpathogenic bacteria targeting TLR2) or lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Staphylococcus aureus (TLR2 agonist). LTA-treated DCs produced much more IL-12 than IL-10 and accelerated diabetes development when transferred into NOD mice. In contrast, stimulation of NOD DCs with L. casei favored the production of IL-10 over IL-12, and their transfer decreased disease incidence which anti-IL-10R antibodies restored. These data indicated that L. casei can induce NOD DCs to develop a more tolerogenic phenotype via production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. Evaluation of the relative production of IL-10 and IL-12 by DCs may be a very useful means of identifying agents that have therapeutic potential.
TI  - Typing of bacteriophages by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR to assess genetic diversity.
AB  - The recent boom in phage therapy and phage biocontrol requires the design of suitable cocktails of genetically different bacteriophages. The current methods for typing phages need significant quantities of purified DNA, may require a priori genetic information and are cost and time consuming. We have evaluated the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR technique to produce unique and reproducible band patterns from 26 different bacteriophages infecting Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus thermophilus, Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus casei bacterial strains. Initially, purified DNA and phage suspensions of seven selected phages were used as a template. The conditions that were found to be optimal 8 muM of 10-mer primers, 3 muM magnesium oxalacetate and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. The RAPD genomic fingerprints using a phage titer suspension higher than 10(9) PFU mL(-1) were highly reproducible. Clustering by the Pearson correlation coefficient and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages clustering algorithm correlated largely with genetically different phages infecting the same bacterial species, although closely related phages with a similar DNA restriction pattern were indistinguishable. The results support the use of RAPD-PCR for quick typing of phage isolates and preliminary assessment of their genetic diversity bypassing tedious DNA purification protocols and previous knowledge of their sequence.
TI  - Evaluating the In-vitro Antibacterial Effect of Iranian Propolis on Oral Microorganisms.
AB  - Propolis has traditionally been used in curing infections and healing wounds and  burns. Current researches have shown that propolis has antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral actions however, the pharmacological activity of propolis is highly variable depending on its geographic origin. There have been few studies on the effects of Iranian propolis on the oral microorganisms. In this in-vitro study, the antimicrobial activity of the ethanolic and water extracts of the Iranian propolis (10%, w/v) from north-east area of Tehran was evaluated. Susceptibility of the oral strains tested (Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 9222; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 9854 and Lactobacillus casei ATCC 39392) was evaluated using the agar diffusion method at a concentration of 20 mg/mL of propolis and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. Antibacterial activity was determined by using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) at different concentrations of propolis. The ethanolic extract showed bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against all the strains, with MIC and MBC ranges of 250-500 microg/mL. The MIC concentration of the water extract was 500 microg/mL against S. mutans and E. faecalis. The water extract showed bactericidal activity only against S. mutans (20 mg/mL). These results indicate that the ethanolic extract is probably more useful in the control of oral biofilms and subsequent dental caries development. However, to determine the consequence of the ethanolic extract of Iranian propolis on the oral mucosa, in-vivo studies of its possible effects are needed.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a multidrug-resistant microorganism and the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. The antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria against MRSA from ten human clinical isolates as well as MRSA standard strain ATCC 43300 was tested in vitro. The Lactobacillus (Lb.) strains (Lb. acidophilus CL1285((R)) and Lb. casei LBC80R) as pure cultures, which came from commercial food products were employed. The growth inhibitory effect produced by the antimicrobial activity of the lactic acid bacteria on the MRSA strains was tested on solid medium using agar diffusion methods as well as a using a liquid medium procedure that contained a mixture of MRSA and lactic acid bacteria cultures. In the latter instance, we were able to demonstrate that the direct interaction of lactic acid bacteria and MRSA in such a mixture led to the elimination of 99% of the MRSA cells after 24 h of their incubation at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Peptidoglycan from lactobacilli inhibits interleukin-12 production by macrophages induced by Lactobacillus casei through Toll-like receptor 2-dependent and independent mechanisms.
AB  - We previously showed that Lactobacillus strains having a rigid cell wall resistant to intracellular digestion can stimulate macrophages to induce large a quantity of interleukin-12 (IL-12). In this study, we examined the influence of lactobacilli and bacterial cell wall components on IL-12 production by macrophages that was induced by Lactobacillus casei, which has a rigid cell wall. Easily digestible lactobacilli such as Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lactobacillus plantarum or their intact cell walls (ICWs) weakly or very weakly induced IL-12 production by macrophages, and inhibitedL. casei-induced IL-12 production. While the ICW of L. casei was resistant to intracellular digestion and did not inhibit L. casei-induced IL-12 production, its polysaccharide-depleted ICW, i.e. intact peptidoglycan, was sensitive to intracellular digestion and inhibited L. casei-induced IL-12 production. Furthermore, the peptidoglycans of L. johnsonii, L. plantarum and Staphylococcus aureus also inhibited L. casei-induced IL-12 production. Peptidoglycans from lactobacilli suppressed L. casei-induced expression of IL-12p40 but not IL-12p35 mRNA. Inhibition of IL-12 production by peptidoglycan was mitigated in Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-deficient macrophages compared with the inhibition in wild-type macrophages. A derivative of the minimal structural unit of peptidoglycan (6-O-stearoyl-muramyl dipeptide) recognized by nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) could also suppress L. casei-induced IL-12 production. These findings demonstrate that easily digestible bacteria and peptidoglycan suppress IL-12 production through pattern recognition receptors such as TLR2 and NOD2. IL-12 production in the gut may be negatively regulated by the simultaneous inhibitory actions of various resident bacteria that are susceptible to intracellular digestion.
TI  - Assessment of cell surface properties and adhesion potential of selected probiotic strains.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the physicochemical cell surface and adhesive properties of selected probiotic strains for human use. METHODS AND RESULTS: Probiotic strains, Bifidobacterium longum B6, Lactobacillus acidophilus ADH, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus casei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Pediococcus acidilactici were tested for the physicochemical properties of cell surfaces and the adhesion abilities against foodborne pathogens. Bif. longum B6 (53.6%) and Lact. rhamnosus GG (46.5%) showed the highest hydrophobicity, while the least affinity to xylene was observed in Ped. acidilactici (10.4%). Bifidobacterium longum B6 showed the strongest coaggregation phenotype with Listeria monocytogenes (53.0%), Shigella boydii (42.0%) and Staphylococcus aureus (45.9%). Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG had the strong binding ability to Caco-2 cells and effectively inhibited the adhesion of L. monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium, Sh. boydii and Staph. aureus to Caco-2 cells. The hydrophobicity was highly correlated with coaggregative abilities and competitive inhibition, suggesting a good relationship between in vitro adhesion and in vivo colonization. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that Bif. longum B6 and Lact. rhamnosus GG can be candidate probiotics available for human consumption. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Because the use of probiotic strains has been more concerned with their beneficial effects in the GI tract, it is essential to examine the potential of probiotic strains based on the physicochemical properties in terms of bacterial-binding and adhesion capabilities.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of three experimental quaternary ammonium salt (QAS) monomers on bacteria associated with oral infections.
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the antibacterial effects of three experimental quaternary ammonium salt monomers in order to evaluate their potential applications as dental materials. In vitro susceptibility testing of the monomers was performed by the broth dilution method on bacteria associated with oral infections: Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Actinomyces viscosus ATCC 15987, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393. The time-kill kinetics of the monomer with relatively higher antibacterial activity against S. mutans were also investigated. It was found that all the tested bacteria strains were susceptible to the three monomers, among which methacryloxylethyl cetyl ammonium chloride (DMAE-CB) exhibited the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations, ranging from 1.2 to 4.8 microg/ml. The time-kill curve showed that DMAE-CB achieved 99.44% killing at 19.2 microg/ml (4 times the minimal bactericidal concentration) against S. mutans after 1 min and 100% killing within 10 min of contact. This result indicates that the quaternary ammonium salt monomer DMAE-CB may be a candidate antibacterial agent for incorporation into dental restorative materials.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of culture fluid components of Lactobacillus fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21) clone 3, and their capacity to modulate adhesion of Candida albicans yeast-like fungi to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - Antagonistic activities of L. fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21), L. casei ATCC 27216, and L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 and bactericidal activity of lactobacillus culture fluid towards E. coli strain K12, S. aureus, and S. epidermidis test cultures were studied. The bactericidal effect of L. fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21) clone 3 culture fluid preparation (pH 6.0) on the test cultures was dose-dependent. Adhesion of C. albicans yeast-like fungi to vaginal epitheliocytes was more pronounced for strains isolated from women with asymptomatic infection than for strains isolated from women with manifest forms. L. fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21) clone 3 culture fluid preparation modulated adhesion of yeast-like fungi only if the fungal strain was initially highly adherent.
TI  - [Evaluation of the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus probiotic culture added to yogurt over Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enteritidis populations].
AB  - The effect of different types of probiotics present in yogurt over known populations of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enteritidis was evaluated. The three types of yogurt used were: without added probiotics, with added probiotics (Lactobacillus casei CRL_431 and L. acidophilus CRL_730 CHR HANSEN) and another one with the same probiotics mentioned above and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LR-35) culture. About 10(9) CFU/ mL of each potentially pathogenic bacteria was added to each type of yogurt tested, and kept in refrigeration at 4 degrees C during its shelf life, about 30 days. Bacterial count was done the initial day and every four days. Results obtained show that there is a difference in the inhibition between yogurts without added probiotics and the commercial yogurt with added probiotics; there is a clear inhibitory effect of the last one over S. aureus, E. coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes. The yogurt with added probiotics and L. rhamnosus did not show any additional inhibitory effect over the bacteria tested when compared with the yogurt with added probiotics. S. enteritidis could not be evaluated because it was not detectable in any yogurt samples evaluated four days after its inoculation. This study confirms the antagonic effect of probiotic cultures over potentially pathogenic bacteria for human beings and animals that may be present in food. Nevertheless, the use of L. rhamnosus did not produce any additional inhibitory effect.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of peroxide-based bleaching agents.
AB  - Antibacterial activity of 4 commercial bleaching agents (Day White, Colgate Platinum, Whiteness 10% and 16%) on 6 oral pathogens (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus sanguinis, Candida albicans, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus) and Staphylococcus aureus were evaluated. A chlorhexidine solution was used as a positive control, while distilled water was the negative control. Bleaching agents and control materials were inserted in sterilized stainless-steel cylinders that were positioned under inoculated agar plate (n = 4). After incubation according to the appropriate period of time for each microorganism, the inhibition zones were measured. Data were analyzed by 2-way analysis of variance and Tukey test (a = 0.05). All bleaching agents and the chlorhexidine solution produced antibacterial inhibition zones. Antimicrobial activity was dependent on peroxide-based bleaching agents. For most microorganisms evaluated, bleaching agents produced inhibition zones similar to or larger than that observed for chlorhexidine. C albicans, L casei, and L acidophilus were the most resistant microorganisms.
TI  - In vitro growth control of selected pathogens by Lactobacillus acidophilus- and Lactobacillus casei-fermented milk.
AB  - AIMS: Food-borne pathogen inhibition was tested in the presence of a mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei during fermentation under controlled pH conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS: The growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella serotype Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria innocua, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis was evaluated for 48 h at 37 degrees C. In the presence of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB), an increase of the generation time was observed for all the gram-positive bacteria evaluated. Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive strain showing an increase of the generation time by 210%. However, for all the gram-negative bacteria evaluated, no inhibition occurred after 8 h of fermentation. The soluble portion of Lact. acidophilus- and Lact. casei-fermented milk was recuperated and tested for its antimicrobial activity. Listeria innocua and Staph. aureus were the most sensitive to the presence of fermented milk supernatant showing an inhibition of 85.9% and 84.7%, respectively. This soluble fraction was neutralized to eliminate the antimicrobial effect of the organic acids produced; the most sensitive strains were L. innocua and E. coli O157:H7 showing an inhibition of 65.9% and 61.9%, respectively. Finally, the soluble fraction was neutralized and irradiated at 45 kGy using a (60)Co source to eliminate the possible antimicrobial effect of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like substances. Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli O157:H7 and Staph. aureus were the most affected bacteria by this fraction, showing 39.1, 32 and 31.2% inhibition, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study suggest the implication of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances in the antimicrobial activity observed in the soluble fraction of the probiotic preparation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study revealed the antimicrobial mechanisms of action of Lact. acidophilus- and Lact. casei-fermented milk used to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
TI  - [The electron microscopic study of cell-to-cell interactions between antagonistic microorganisms].
AB  - The electron microscopic study of thin sections and positively stained specimens  of cells taken from particular cocultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus D75, Lactobacillus casei YIT 9018, Shigella flexnery 2a, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 (some of these bacteria are antagonistic to others) showed the presence of specific ultrastructural elements indicating cell specialization and cooperation. The responses of antagonistic bacteria manifested themselves at the cellular and population levels.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of inorganic agents on six bacteria associated with oral infections by two susceptibility tests.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of six inorganic antibacterial agents were assessed using broth dilution and agar dilution tests on six pathogenic bacteria associated with oral infectious diseases: Streptococcus mutans (ATCC 25175), S. mutans (Ingbritt), Actinomyces viscosus (ATCC 15987), Lactobacillus casei (ATCC 393), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213) and Candida albicans (ATCC 90028). The results of the broth dilution test were significantly lower than those of the agar dilution test (F=38.290; P<0.01). The six inorganic agents notably inhibited the growth of tested common oral bacteria in vitro. Among them, Longbei inorganic antibiotic powder was the strongest antibacterial agent, followed by ZnO whisker antibacterial complex (ZnOw) AT-83, IONPURE-H, basic magnesium hypochlorite, ZnOw AT-88 and Antim-AMS2. The broth dilution test appears to be more suitable for testing insoluble inorganic agents.
TI  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (CIS). When chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. Testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of CIS using various microbes such as Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces ludwigii, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. In particular, recovery was improved when L-cysteine was added. A mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto CIS could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. Most of the desorbed cells were alive. Thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.
TI  - [Evaluation of the effect of probiotic cultures on two different yogurt brands over a known population of Staphylococcus aureus and the production of thermonuclease].
AB  - The effect of probiotic cultures over known populations of Staphylococcus aureus  inoculated in yogurt was studied; also the production and stability of its thermonuclease during yogurt storage was evaluated. In three different occasions, two different yogurt brands, one with additional probiotic cultures (Lactobacillus casei and L. acidophilus), were inoculated with known populations of S. aureus in high and low concentration (10(9) CFU/g and 10(7) CFU/g), respectively. These samples were stored for 28 days at 5 degrees C. Every four days the count of lactic bacteria, S. aureus and pH were evaluated, according to the methodology described in the Compendium of Methods for the Microbiological Examination of Foods, Vanderzant & Splittstoesser. The presence of thermonuclease was determined using petrifilm for S. aureus from 3M company. The pH and lactic bacteria population were constant during the testing period. Yogurt with additional probiotic cultures (high and low concentration) lowered the population of S. aureus to non detectable levels in 8 days; but, S. aureus could be cultured from yogurt without probiotics even after 24 days of incubation. Same time, the presence of thermonuclease was positive in all tests; it was not affected by probiotics. The presence of thermonuclease is related to the production of S. aureus enterotoxin. This work emphasizes again the beneficial effects of probiotic cultures in yogurt over bacteria and the importance of keeping hygienic practices in order to avoid the contamination of food with S. aureus and the eventual production of its enterotoxin, since it is not affected by probiotics.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Croton cajucara Benth linalool-rich essential oil on artificial biofilms and planktonic microorganisms.
AB  - We have previously demonstrated that a linalool-rich essential oil from Croton cajucara Benth presents leishmanicidal activity. In the present study, we demonstrate that this essential oil inhibits the growth of reference samples of Candida albicans, Lactobacillus casei, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sobrinus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Streptococcus mutans cell suspensions, all of them associated with oral cavity disease. The purified linalool fraction was only inhibitory for C. albicans. Microbes of saliva specimens from human individuals with fixed orthodontic appliances, as well as the reference strains, were used to construct an artificial biofilm which was exposed to linalool or to the essential oil. As in microbial suspensions, the essential oil was toxic for all the microorganisms, while the purified linalool fraction mainly inhibited the growth of C. albicans. The compounds of the essential oil were separated by thin layer chromatography and exposed to the above-cited microorganisms. In this analysis, the proliferation of the bacterial cells was inhibited by still uncharacterized molecules, and linalool was confirmed as the antifungal component of the essential oil. The effects of linalool on the cell biology of C. albicans were evaluated by electron microscopy, which showed that linalool induced a reduction in cell size and abnormal germination. Neither the crude essential oil nor the purified linalool fraction is toxic to mammalian cells, which suggests that the essential oil or its purified components may be useful to control the microbial population in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances.
TI  - In vitro screening of potential probiotic activities of selected lactobacilli isolated from unpasteurized milk products for incorporation into soft cheese.
AB  - The aim was to select potentially probiotic lactobacilli from 88 strains isolated from unpasteurized milk and cheese products, and to incorporate these bacteria in a viable state into a soft cheese, without changing its quality. The survival of these bacteria was assessed in acidic and bile conditions, after freezing at -80 degrees C. Four strains from unpasteurized Camembert--two Lactobacillus plantarum strains and two Lb. paracasei/casei strains--were identified and typed by PCR and PFGE and were found to display potentially probiotic characteristics in addition to resistance to low pH and bile. These characteristics were resistance to lysozyme, adhesion to CACO-2 cells, antimicrobial effects against common foodborne pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, innocuity following the ingestion of high doses by mice and appropriate antibiotic susceptibility profiles. The potential of Lb. plantarum strain UCMA 3037 for incorporation into a soft cheese (Pont-l'Eveque registered designation of origin (RDO)) was investigated. This strain grew well and survived in sufficient numbers (more than 10(7) cfu/g throughout the shelf-life of the product) in the cheese. This strain did not change the quality score of the product until the best before date (75 days after manufacture). Thus, unpasteurized Camembert is a natural source of potentially probiotic lactobacilli, which could be used as an additive in the development of potentially probiotic soft cheeses. Further work is required to demonstrate the persistence and efficacy of these strains in the human host upon ingestion.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - High-resolution structure of the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein (HPr) from Staphylococcus aureus and characterization of its interaction with the bifunctional HPr kinase/phosphorylase.
AB  - A high-resolution structure of the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein (HPr) from Staphylococcus aureus was obtained by heteronuclear multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy on the basis of 1,766 structural restraints. Twenty-three hydrogen bonds in HPr could be directly detected by polarization transfer from the amide nitrogen to the carbonyl carbon involved in the hydrogen bond. Differential line broadening was used to characterize the interaction of HPr with the HPr kinase/phosphorylase (HPrK/P) of Staphylococcus xylosus, which is responsible for phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of the hydroxyl group of the regulatory serine residue at position 46. The dissociation constant Kd was determined to be 0.10 +/- 0.02 mM at 303 K from the NMR data, assuming independent binding. The data are consistent with a stoichiometry of 1 HPr molecule per HPrK/P monomer in solution. Using transversal relaxation optimized spectroscopy-heteronuclear single quantum correlation, we mapped the interaction site of the two proteins in the 330-kDa complex. As expected, it covers the region around Ser46 and the small helix b following this residue. In addition, HPrK/P also binds to the second phosphorylation site of HPr at position 15. This interaction may be essential for the recognition of the phosphorylation state of His15 and the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of the kinase/phosphorylase activity. In accordance with this observation, the recently published X-ray structure of the HPr/HPrK core protein complex from Lactobacillus casei shows interactions with the two phosphorylation sites. However, the NMR data also suggest differences for the full-length protein from S. xylosus: there are no indications for an interaction with the residues preceding the regulatory Ser46 residue (Thr41 to Lys45) in the protein of S. xylosus. In contrast, it seems to interact with the C-terminal helix of HPr in solution, an interaction which is not observed for the complex of HPr with the core of HPrK/P of L. casei in crystals.
TI  - Influence of growth conditions on the production of a bacteriocin by Lactococcus  lactis subsp. lactis ST34BR, a strain isolated from barley beer.
AB  - Bacteriocin ST34BR, a small polypeptide of 2.9 kDa produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ST34BR, inhibits the growth of Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. MRS broth, adjusted to pH 6.0 yielded 6,400 AU/ml, compared to 400 AU/ml recorded in BHI broth, M17 broth, 10% (w/v) soy milk, and 8% and 10% (w/v) molasses. At pH of 4.5 only 800 AU/ml was produced. Based on comparative studies in MRS broth, without organic nitrogen, supplemented with different combinations of tryptone, meat extract and yeast extract, tryptone was identified as the stimulating nitrogen compound. Growth in the presence of 20 g/l glucose, maltose, mannose or sucrose yielded bacteriocin levels of 6,400 AU/ml, whereas the same concentration of lactose and fructose yielded 3,200 AU/ml and 1,600 AU/ml, respectively. No difference in bacteriocin ST34BR activity was recorded in MRS broth supplemented with 2 g/l K2HPO4 and 2 g/l, 5 g/l, 10 g/l or 50 g/l KH2PO4. However, 20 g/l KH2PO4 increased bacteriocin ST34BR production to 12,800 AU/ml. Glycerol at 1g/l to 10 g/l in MRS broth reduced bacteriocin activity to 3,200 AU/ml, whilst 20 g/l and 50 g/l yielded only 1,600 AU/ml. The presence of cyanocobalamin, L-ascorbic acid, thiamine and DL-6,8-thioctic acid in MRS broth at 1.0 ppm, respectively, did not result in increased activity levels.
TI  - Purification of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Bacteriocins are antibacterial substances of a proteinaceous nature that are produced by different bacterial species. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) produce biologically active peptides or protein complexes that display a bactericidal mode of action almost exclusively toward Gram-positive bacteria and particularly toward closely related species. Generally they are active against food spoilage and foodborne pathogenic microorganisms including Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes. There is an increased tendency to use natural occurring metabolites to prevent the growth of undesirable flora in foodstuffs. These metabolites could replace the use of chemical additives such as sorbic acid, sulfur dioxide, nitrite, nitrate, and others. For instance, bacteriocins produced by LAB may be promising for use as bio-preservaties. Bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria are typically cationic, hydrophobic peptides and differ widely in many characteristics including molecular weight, presence of particular groups of amino acids, pI, net positive charge, and post-translational modifications of certain amino acids. This heterogeneity within the LAB bacteriocins may explain the different procedures for isolation and purification developed so far. The methods most frequently used for isolation, concentration, and purification involve salt precipitation of bacteriocins from culture supernatants, followed by various combinations of gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). In this chapter, a protocol is described that combines several methods used in our laboratory for the purification of two cationic bacteriocins, Lactocin 705AL and Enterocin CRL10, produced by Lactobacillus casei CRL705 and Enterococcus mundtii CRL10, respectively.

TI  - Growth-inhibiting effects of seco-tanapartholides identified in Artemisia princeps var. orientalis whole plant on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The present work aimed at isolating antibacterial constituents from the whole plant of Artemisia princeps var. orientalis active towards nine human intestinal bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: The growth-inhibiting activities of materials derived from the Artemisia whole plant towards test bacteria were examined using an impregnated paper disc method. The biologically active constituents of the Artemisia whole plant were characterized as the sesquiterpene lactones seco-tanapartholides A and B by spectroscopic analysis. In a test using 1 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides A and B produced a clear inhibitory effect against Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis and Staphylococcus aureus. These compounds did not affect the growth of test lactic acid-producing bacteria (Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bif. breve, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lact. casei) and Escherichia coli, whereas weak growth inhibition towards Bif. bifidum was observed. At 0.5 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides A and B exhibited moderate growth inhibition towards Cl. perfringens but weak growth inhibition towards Bact. fragilis and Staph. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibitory action of seco-tanapartholides A and B towards specific bacteria without any adverse effects on lactic acid-producing bacteria may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of A. princeps var. orientalis whole plant. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These naturally occurring Artemisia whole plant-derived materials could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria such as clostridia.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  - Annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. There are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. However, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. This study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. Disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the MICs and MBCs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. Standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. The results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus, with MICs of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. A concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, Lactococcus lactis, and Paenibacillus polymyxa. The MICs for Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. No activity was detected against Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Lactobacillus casei acquires the binding activity to fibronectin by the expression of the fibronectin binding domain of Streptococcus pyogenes on the cell surface.
AB  - Fibronectin binding domain was expressed on the cell surface of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota which hardly adheres to fibronectin. DNA for the fibronectin binding domain of the sfbl gene, which encodes a fibronectin binding protein of Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 21059, was amplified with polymerase chain reaction, cloned into a surface display vector pSAK332, and introduced into L. casei. The fibronectin binding domain was expressed as a fusion protein consisting of staphylokinase of Staphylococcus aureus and the anchor sequence of cell wall-associated 763 proteinase of Lactococcus lactis NCDO 763. The fibronectin binding ability of the resulting L. casei was confirmed with Western blot analysis, immunoelectron microscopic analysis, and adherence to fibroblast cells. These results indicate that L. casei has acquired a new phenotype to bind fibronectin upon the expression of the fibronectin binding domain on the cell surface. This L. casei also shows binding affinity to fibrinogen, indicating that fibronectin binding domain is involved in the binding to fibrinogen as well.
TI  - Verbalactone, a new macrocyclic dimer lactone from the roots of Verbascum undulatum with antibacterial activity.
AB  - A novel macrocyclic dimer lactone, named verbalactone, was isolated from the roots of Verbascum undulatum and exhibited interesting antibacterial activity. It is the first time that 1,7-dioxacyclododecane is reported as the ring system of a natural product. The structure and the absolute stereochemistry of the new compound were determined by spectral methods and chemical correlation.
TI  - [Cloning and gene expression in lactic acid bacteria].
AB  - The possibility of using the genera Lactobacillus and Lactococcus as vector representatives is widely discussed at present. The prospects of the construction of recombinant bacteria are closely connected with the solution of a number of problems: the level of the transcription of cloned genes, the effectiveness of the translation of heterologous mRNA, the stability of protein with respect to bacterial intracellular proteases, the method by protein molecules leave the cell (by secretion or as the result of lysis). To prevent segregation instability, the construction of vector molecules on the basis of stable cryptic plasmids found in wild strains of lactic acid bacteria was proposed. High copying plasmids with low molecular weight were detected in L. plantarum and L. pentosus strains. Several plasmids with molecular weights of 1.7, 1.8 and 2.3 kb were isolated from bacterial cells to be used as the basis for the construction of vector molecules. Genes of chloramphenicol- and erythromycin-resistance from Staphylococcus aureus plasmids were used as marker genes ensuring cell transformation. The vector plasmids thus constructed exhibited high transformation activity in the electroporation of different strains, including L. casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. fermentum and L. brevis which could be classified with the replicons of a wide circle of hosts. But the use of these plasmids was limited due to the risk of the uncontrolled dissemination of recombinant plasmids. L. acidophilus were also found to have strictly specific plasmids with good prospects of being used as the basis for the creation of vectors, incapable of dissemination. In addition to the search of strain-specific plasmids, incapable of uncontrolled gene transmission, the use of chromosome-integrated heterologous genes is recommended in cloning to ensure the maximum safety.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus species against Vibrio species.
AB  - Forty-one Lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of Vibrio. L. plantarum and L. casei were the most effective, and L. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of Vibrio species. L. gasseri and L. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while L. reuteri and L. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against Vibrio species. L. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against Vibrio species. However, none of the Lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of Salmonella enteritidis, S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. Inhibition of the Vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Effects of tamoxifen, melatonin, coenzyme Q10, and L-carnitine supplementation on bacterial growth in the presence of mycotoxins.
AB  - The involvement of toxic oxygen intermediates in the bacteriostatic effects of mycotoxins (T-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin A, aflatoxin B1, and fumonisin B1) was investigated by producing bacterial growth curves using turbidimetry assays in the presence and absence of oxygen radical-scavenging substances. The strains used in this study included Escherichia coli (FT 101), Streptococcus agalactiae (FT 311, FT 313, FT 315), Staphylococcus aureus (FT 192), Yersinia enterocolitica (FT 430), Salmonella infantis (FT 431), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (FT 432), Lactobacillus plantarum (FT234) and Lactobacillus casei (FT 232). Tamoxifen, melatonin, l-carnitine and coenzyme Q10 were used as radical scavengers against oxygen toxicity to the strains studied. Tamoxifen was the most effective in inhibiting bacterial growth when used at a high concentration, whereas melatonin and l-carnitine were less effective. A combination of l-carnitine and coenzyme Q10 provided better protection against oxygen toxicity caused by the mycotoxins growth than they did individually. It was concluded that oxygen radicals are involved in the killing of bacteria and that there is endogenous formation of toxic oxygen products by mycotoxins. The objective of this study was to determine whether the antioxidants were able to counteract the toxic effects of the mycotoxins. The data obtained indicate that bacterial growth can be inhibited especially by T-2 toxin, aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin A and that this effect can be partially counteracted by antioxidants such as coenzyme Q10 plus l-carnitine.
TI  - Growth inhibition of oral bacteria related to denture stomatitis by anti-candidal chalcones.
AB  - In the antimicrobial therapy of denture stomatitis, it is desirable to inhibit the growth of not only the primary causative organism, Candida albicans, but also other oral bacteria closely associated with the condition. Three synthetic anti-candidal chalcones were characterized and compared for their additional activity in inhibiting these causative bacteria. Among the tested chalcones, 2,4,2'-trihydroxy-5'-methylchalcone showed the highest activity for different Gram-positive bacteria. It inhibited the growth of streptococci, staphylococci and lactobacilli at 25.0-50.0 micrograms/mL which was lower than or comparable to its minimum inhibitory concentration for candida. It functioned with a bactericidal action and leaked 260 nm-absorbing substances from the streptococcal cells. The antimicrobial activity of 2,4,2'-trihydroxy-5'-methylchalcone against both primary and secondary causative agents suggests it could be useful as a potent therapeutic agent in denture stomatitis.
TI  - The lac operon of Lactobacillus casei contains lacT, a gene coding for a protein  of the Bg1G family of transcriptional antiterminators.
AB  - The 5' region of the lac operon of Lactobacillus casei has been investigated. An  open reading frame of 293 codons, designated lacT, was identified upstream of lacE. The gene product encoded by lacT is related to the family of transcriptional antiterminator proteins, which includes BglG from Escherichia coli, ArbG from Erwinia chrysanthemi, SacT, SacY, and LicT from Bacillus subtilis, and BglR from Lactococcus lactis. Amino acid sequence identities range from 35 to 24%, while similarities range from 56 to 47%. The transcriptional start site of the lac operon was identified upstream of lacT. The corresponding mRNA would contain in the 5' region a sequence with high similarity to the consensus RNA binding site of transcriptional antiterminators overlapping a sequence capable of folding into a structure that resembles a rho-independent terminator. LacT was shown to be active as an antiterminator in a B. subtilis test system using the sacB target sequence. lacT directly precedes lacEGF, the genes coding for enzyme IICB, phospho-beta-galactosidase, and enzyme IIA, and these genes are followed by a sequence that appears to encode a second rho-independent transcription terminator-like structure. Northern hybridizations with probes against lacT, lacE, and lacF revealed transcripts of similar sizes for the lac mRNAs of several L. casei strains. Since the length of the lac mRNA is just sufficient to contain lacTEGF, we conclude that the lac operon of L. casei does not contain the genes of the accessory tagatose-6-phosphate pathway as occurs in the lac operons of Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus mutans, or Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Application of antimicrobial-producing lactic acid bacteria to control pathogens  in ready-to-use vegetables.
AB  - Five psychrotrophic strains of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus casei, Lact. plantarum and Pediococcus spp.) were isolated from 22 samples of commercial salads. These strains were shown to inhibit Aeromonas hydrophila, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus on MRS agar, in salads and in juice prepared from vegetable salads. Lactobacillus casei IMPCLC34 was most effective in reducing total mesophilic bacteria and the coliform group; Aer. hydrophila, Salm. typhimurium and Staph. aureus disappeared after 6 d of storage, while the counts for L. monocytogenes remained constant. The potential application of antimicrobial-producing lactic acid bacteria as biopreservatives of ready-to-use vegetables is suggested.
TI  - Antagonism of lactic acid bacteria towards Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia  coli on agar plates and in milk.
AB  - The antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB, including Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei and Streptococcus thermophilus) on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was evaluated on MRS agar with the deferred and cross-streaking techniques, and in milk with the plate counting method. All LAB were repressive to S aureus and E coli on the agar medium. However, their suppressive activity was significantly reduced when the agar medium was buffered to pH 7.2. In normal milk, L acidophilus strains A and B, S thermophilus and its combinations with L acidophilus A and L bulgaricus 6032 were inhibitory to S aureus, while in mastitic milk, only S thermophilus and its combinations showed inhibition. L acidophilus A and L bulgaricus 34104 were repressive to E coli growth in normal milk. S thermophilus and its combinations were inhibitory to E coli in both the normal and mastitic milk samples. These results indicate that the antagonistic activity of LAB on pathogenic bacteria varied with the type of media in which the tests were done, and that testing of in vitro antagonism in milk would be more informative than that in artificial media for in vivo tests concerning the possible roles of competitive microbiological ecology in mastitis control.
TI  - Influence of lactobacilli on the adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans to fibers and epithelial cells.
AB  - The ability of organisms to adhere to and form biofilms on fibrous materials is believed to be an important initiating step in the induction of several diseases, such as toxic shock syndrome. Using an in vitro assay, a moderately hydrophobic strain of Staphylococcus aureus (water contact angle 35 degrees) and a hydrophilic Candida albicans (shown by a hexadecane test) were highly adherent to commercial diaper fibers. The lumen side of the diaper was porous and the fibers were very hydrophobic (> 140 degrees), but the internal section was very hydrophilic (0 degrees), presumably for lus strains was present. Surfaces precoated with lactobacilli inhibited staphylococcal adhesion by 26-97%, and candida by 0-67%. When the lactobacilli were used to challenge adherent pathogens, there was 99% displacement of the S. aureus and up to 91% displacement of C. albicans. Hydrophobic L. acidophilus 76 (54 degrees) and T-13 (80 degrees) were the most effective of five Lactobacillus isolates tested at interference by precoating. The moderately hydrophilic L. casei var rhamnosus GR-1 (33 degrees) was the most effective at displacing the yeast. Experiments with uroepithelial cells also showed that the lactobacilli could significantly interfere with the adhesion of both pathogens to the cells. The results demonstrate the rapidity with which two pathogens adhered to fibers and epithelial cells, and raised the possibility that members of the normal female urogenital flora might interfere with infections caused by these organisms.
TI  - Distribution of proteins similar to IIIManH and IIIManL of the Streptococcus salivarius phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system among oral and nonoral bacteria.
AB  - In Streptococcus salivarius, the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system, which concomitantly transports and phosphorylates mannose, glucose, fructose, and 2-deoxyglucose, is composed of the general energy-coupling proteins EI and HPr, the specific membrane-bound IIIMan, and two forms of a protein called IIIMan, with molecular weights of 38,900 (IIIManH) and 35,200 (IIIManL), that are found in the cytoplasm as well as associated with the membrane. Several lines of evidence suggest that IIIManH and/or IIIManL are involved in the control of sugar metabolism. To determine whether other bacteria possess these proteins, we tested for their presence in 28 oral streptococcus strains, 3 nonoral streptococcus strains, 2 lactococcus strains, 2 enterococcus strains, 2 bacillus strains, 1 lactobacillus strain, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Three approaches were used to determine whether the IIIMan proteins were present in these bacteria: (i) Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, using anti-IIIManH and anti-IIIManH rabbit polyclonal antibodies; (ii) analysis of PEP-dependent phosphoproteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and (iii) inhibition by anti-IIIMan antibodies of the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose (a mannose analog) by crude cellular extracts. Only the species S. salivarius and Streptococcus vestibularis possessed the two forms of IIIMan. Fifteen other streptococcal species possessed one protein with a molecular weight between 35,200 and 38,900 that cross-reacted with both antibodies. In the case of 9 species, a protein possessing the same electrophoretic mobility was phosphorylated at the expense of PEP. No such phosphoprotein, however, could be detected in the other six species. A III(Man)-like protein with a molecular weight of 35,500 was also detected in Lactobacillus casei by Western blot experiments as well as by PEP-dependent phosphoprotein analysis, and a protein with a molecular weight of 38,900 that cross-reacted with anti-III(Man) antibodies was detected in Lactococcus lactis. In several cases, the involvement of these putative III(Man) proteins in the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose was substantiated by the inhibition of phosphorylation activity of anti-III(Man) antibodies. No proteins cross-reacting with anti-III(Man) antibodies were detected in enterococci, bacilli, and E. coli. In S. aureus, a membrane protein with a molecular weight of 50,000 reacted strongly with the antibodies. This protein, however, was not phosphorylated at the expense of PEP.
TI  - Studies on bacteriocinogenic Lactobacillus isolates from selected Nigerian fermented foods.
AB  - Ten bacteriocin-producing (bacteriocinogenic) Lactobacillus isolates obtained from three Nigerian fermented foods namely: kenkey, ogi and wara were tested against the following indicator organisms: Lactobacillus plantarum and food borne pathogens comprising enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli, Serratia, Pseudomonas, Vibrio cholerae, Aeromonas sobria, Aeromonas cavice, Salmonella typhimurium, Plesiomonas shigelloides and Staphylococcus aureus. All the bacteriocinogenic Lactobacillus were found to inhibit L. plantarum while some inhibited some of the food borne pathogens listed above. The antimicrobial activities of bacteriocins from L. plantarum KKY12 and L. casei OGM12 were caused by proteins detectable in the culture liquids. They are designated Plantacin N and Caseicin A and they have narrow antimicrobial spectra. Plantacin N from L. plantarum KKY12 was active against L. plantarum, Pseudomonas, Aeromonas sobria and Aeromonas cavice whereas Caseicin A from L. casei OGM12 inhibited L. plantarum, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae. Caseicin A is stable at 121 degrees C/15 mins, and both are inactivated by proteolytic enzymes. The bacteriocinogenic properties of the local isolates of Lactobacillus can help to reduce hygienic risk and the spoilage of fermented foods.
TI  - Binding studies of vancomycin to the cytoplasmic peptidoglycan precursors by affinity capillary electrophoresis.
AB  - The ability of vancomycin to bind three cytoplasmic peptidoglycan precursors in bacterial species was studied using affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE). The ACE binding assay was established with the normal precursor, UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-L-Ala-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala, from Staphylococcus aureus 209P under conditions where vancomycin served as substrate ligand included in the buffer system. This precursor was found to bind to vancomycin with a binding constant of 1.6 x 10(-5) M-1 (or a dissociation constant of 62.5 microM) obtained from Scatchard plots. No migration shifting was observed under the same conditions for the other two precursors from Leuconostoc mesenteroides VR1 and Lactobacillus casei 7469, suggesting structural modifications at the stem peptide terminus. The reduction of their affinity to vancomycin is consistent with proposed structures, UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-L-Ala-D-Glu-L-Lys-(L-Ala)-D-Ala-D-lactate and UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-L-Ala-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-lactate, from L. mesenteroides VR1 and L. casei 7469, respectively, based on mass spectrometry. This rapid technique provides additional evidence in the understanding of one mechanism of bacterial resistance.
TI  - 6-Phospho-beta-galactosidases of gram-positive and 6-phospho-beta-glucosidase B of gram-negative bacteria: comparison of structure and function by kinetic and immunological methods and mutagenesis of the lacG gene of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase of Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus casei and 6-phospho-beta-glucosidase B of Escherichia coli build a subfamily inside a greater enzyme family, named the glycosal hydrolase family 1, which, in addition, contains nine beta-glycosidases of different origins. Kinetic and immunological evidence is provided in this report which strengthens the relationship of the four 6-phospho-beta-glycosidases. It is shown that the 6-phospho-beta-galactosidases and 6-phospho-beta-glucosidase B are able to split aromatic beta-galactoside phosphates and beta-glucoside phosphates. The turnover numbers of hydrolysis of substrates with different epimerization at C-4 of the glycon vary up to 15-fold only. Two polyclonal antisera, one derived against the native 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase from S. aureus and the other derived against the 6-phospho-beta-glucosidase B, cross-reacted with both enzymes. Peptides of the proteins were separated by reverse phase HPLC. The cross-reacting peptides were sequenced and shown to be localized at almost the same position in the aligned primary structures of both enzymes. An insertion of nine amino acids near these antigenic domains is unique for the 6-phospho-beta-glycosidases and missing within the sequences of the beta-glycoside-specific members of the family. The lacG gene of a 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase negative S. aureus mutant was cloned into E. coli and sequenced. In the totally inactive mutant protein only the glycine at position 332 was changed to an arginine. This amino acid is part of the sequence insertion near the antigenic domain reacting with both antisera.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Isolation, characterization and nucleotide sequence of the Streptococcus mutans lactose-specific enzyme II (lacE) gene of the PTS and the phospho-beta-galactosidase (lacG) gene.
AB  - The lacE and lacG genes from Streptococcus mutans have been isolated and characterized, and their nucleotide sequence has been determined. The lacE gene encodes the lactose-specific Enzyme II component of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS). The lacG gene encodes the phospho-beta-galactosidase which cleaves the lactose phosphate that is formed by the lactose PTS. The S. mutans lacE and lacG genes are located in the same operon as the tagatose genes. S. mutans metabolizes lactose via the tagatose phosphate pathway. The deduced LacE and LacG proteins of S. mutans display high homology with the corresponding proteins from Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus aureus and Lactobacillus casei.
TI  - Growth of lactobacilli, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in normal and  mastitic milk and whey.
AB  - The growth of three lactobacilli (Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus and L. casei), Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was followed in normal and mastitic milk and whey using the standard plate count method. L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus 6032 and L. casei 6028 grew well in normal milk, but had decreased growth in mastitic milk if not pre-adapted in mastitic whey. S. aureus 26003 and E. coli 44102 showed enhanced growth in mastitic milk as compared with their growth in normal milk. These mastitis pathogens grew faster than the lactobacilli in both the normal milk and the mastitic milk. Among the lactobacilli, L. acidophilus and L. bulgaricus grew faster than L. casei in both types of milk samples. All the bacteria tested grew well in the normal and mastitic whey samples. However, they seemed to have enhanced growth in mastitic whey with the exception of L. casei. Pre-adaptation of the bacteria in mastitic whey in subculture markedly improved the growth of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria in mastitic milk. All the bacteria showed decreased replication in mastitic milk as compared with mastitic whey.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus strains isolated from dry fermented sausages.
AB  - One hundred strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from dry cured sausages were tested for antagonistic activity against a set of test strains. Nine of 52 strains of Lactobacillus casei and three of 48 strains of Lact. plantarun produced inhibition zones against the indicator species. The substance excreted by Lact. casei CRL 705 was active against Lact. plantarum, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria. The activity of the antibacterial compound from Lact. casei CRL 705 was destroyed by papain, trypsin and pepsin, but was resistant to heat (100 degrees C for 20 min), lysozyme and catalase. The agent was produced during the growth cycle and when the concentrated and neutralized supernatant fluid was added to a fresh culture of sensitive cells it produced a rapid inactivation. A decrease in optical density (O.D.) over time, indicative of cell lysis, was also observed. These characteristics allowed us to identify the inhibitory compound as a bacteriocin which we termed Lactocin 705.
TI  - Refined structures of substrate-bound and phosphate-bound thymidylate synthase from Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - Crystal structures of two crystal forms of the complex of Lactobacillus casei (TS) with its substrate dUMP have been solved and refined at 2.55 A resolution. The two crystal forms differ by approximately 5% in the c-axis length. The TS-dUMP complexes are symmetric dimers with dUMP bound equivalently in both active sites. dUMP is non-covalently bound in the same conformation as in ternary complexes of TS with dUMP and cofactor or cofactor analogs. The same hydrogen bonds are made between TS and substrate in the binary and ternary complexes. We have also determined the 2.36 A crystal structure of phosphate-bound L. casei TS. This structure has been refined to an R-factor of 19.3% with highly constrained geometry. Refinement has revealed the locations of all residues in the protein, including the disordered residues 90 to 119, which are part of an insert found only in the L. casei and Staphylococcus aureus transposon Tn4003 TS sequences. The 2.9 A multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) structure of L. casei TS in a complex with its substrate dUMP has been refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 15.5%. Reducing agents were withheld from crystallization solutions during MIR structure determination to allow heavy-metal labeling of the cysteine residues. Therefore, the active-site cysteine residue in this structure is oxidized and the dUMP is found at half-occupancy in the active site. No significant conformational difference was found between the phosphate-bound and dUMP-bound structures. The TS-dUMP structures were better ordered than the phosphate-bound TS or the oxidized TS-dUMP, particularly Arg23, which is clearly hydrogen-bonded to the phosphate group of dUMP. A large and a small P6(1)22 crystal form are observed for both phosphate-bound and dUMP-bound L. casei TS. The small cell forms of the phosphate-bound and dUMP-bound enzyme are isomorphous, whereas the cell constants of the larger cell form change slightly when dUMP is bound (c = 240 A versus c = 243 A). For both liganded and unliganded enzyme, conversion from the small to the large crystal form sometimes occurs spontaneously, and the crystal packing changes at a single interface. Conversion may be the result of a small change in pH in the mother liquor surrounding the crystal. A single intermolecular contact between symmetry-related Asp287 residues is disrupted on going from the small to the large crystal form.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus has clustered tRNA genes.
AB  - The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect large tRNA gene clusters in Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus badius, Bacillus megaterium, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus casei, and Staphylococcus aureus. The primers were based on conserved sequences of known gram-positive bacterial tRNA(Arg) and tRNA(Phe) genes. This PCR procedure detected an unusually large tRNA gene cluster in S. aureus. PCR-generated probes were used to identify a 4.5-kb EcoRI fragment that contained 27 tRNA genes immediately 3' to an rRNA operon. Some of these 27 tRNA genes are very similar, but only 1 is exactly repeated in the cluster. The 5' end of this cluster has a gene order similar to that found in the 9- and 21-tRNA gene clusters of B. subtilis. The 3' end of this S. aureus cluster exhibits more similarity to the 16-tRNA gene cluster of B. subtilis. The 24th, 25th, and 26th tRNA genes of this S. aureus tRNA gene cluster code for three similar, unusual Gly-tRNAs that may be used in the synthesis of the peptidoglycan in the cell wall but not in protein synthesis. Southern analysis of restriction digests of S. aureus DNA indicate that there are five to six rRNA operons in this bacterium's genome and that most or all may have large tRNA gene clusters at the 3' end.
TI  - Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the lacR, lacABCD, and lacFE genes encoding the repressor, tagatose 6-phosphate gene cluster, and sugar-specific phosphotransferase system components of the lactose operon of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of lacRABCDF and partial nucleotide sequence of lacE from the lactose operon of Streptococcus mutans are presented. Comparison of the streptococcal lac determinants with those of Staphylococcus aureus and Lactococcus lactis indicate exceptional protein and nucleotide identity. The deduced polypeptides also demonstrate significant, but lower, sequence similarity with the corresponding lactose proteins of Lactobacillus casei. Additionally, LacR has sequence homology with the repressor (DeoR) of the Escherichia coli deoxyribonucleotide operon, while LacC is similar to phosphokinases (FruK and PfkB) from E. coli. The primary translation products of the lacRABCDFE genes are polypeptides of 251 (M(r) 28,713), 142 (M(r) 15,610), 171 (M(r) 18,950), 310 (M(r) 33,368), 325 (M(r) 36,495), 104 (M(r) 11,401), and 123 (NH2-terminal) amino acids, respectively. As inferred from their direct homology to the staphylococcal lac genes, these determinants would encode the repressor of the streptococcal lactose operon (LacR), galactose-6-phosphate isomerase (LacA and LacB), tagatose-6-phosphate kinase (LacC), tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (LacD), and the sugar-specific components enzyme III-lactose (LacF) and enzyme II-lactose (LacE) of the S. mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. The nucleotide sequence encompassing the S. mutans lac promoter appears to contain repeat elements analogous to those of S. aureus, suggesting that repression and catabolite repression of the lactose operons may be similar in these organisms.
TI  - Isolation and properties of the Capnocytophaga ochracea bacteriocin.
AB  - A bacteriocin from a subgingival plaque isolate of Capnocytophaga ochracea was purified and characterized. It was isolated from cell extract and had a molecular weight of 100,000. Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans and Propionibacterium acnes were susceptible to the bacteriocin.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli and streptococci.
AB  - Of nine strains of lactic acid bacteria commonly used as starter cultures for the dalry industry and ensiling, six (Lactobacillus bulgaricus, L. casei, L. acidophilus CH=5, L. plantarum, Streptococcus latis and Strep. taecium) had antibiotic activity. Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive than Gram-negative bacteria to the antibiotics. The most sensitive strain of Staphylococcus aureus was used as a target micro-organism for the characterization of the antimicrobial substance. The cultures of Streptococcus faecium and L. plantarum gave the most intense antimicrobial activity. Adding CaCO3 to the medium (to bind accumulated lactic acid) increased the antibiotic activity of the lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Incompatibility of Lactobacillus Vectors with Replicons Derived from Small Cryptic Lactobacillus Plasmids and Segregational Instability of the Introduced Vectors.
AB  - Three new Lactobacillus vectors based on cryptic Lactobacillus plasmids were constructed. The shuttle vector pLP3537 consists of a 2.3-kb plasmid from Lactobacillus pentosus MD353, an erythromycin resistance gene from Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pE194, and pUC19 as a replicon for Escherichia coli. The vectors pLPE317 and pLPE323, which do not contain E. coli sequences, were generated by introducing the erythromycin resistance gene of pE194 into a 1.7- and a 2.3-kb plasmid from L. pentosus MD353, respectively. These vectors and the shuttle vector pLP825 (M. Posno, R. J. Leer, J. M. M. van Rijn, B. C. Lokman, and P. H. Pouwels, p. 397-401, in A. T. Ganesan and J. A. Hoch, ed., Genetics and biotechnology of bacilli, vol. 2, 1988) could be introduced by electroporation into Lactobacillus casei, L. pentosus, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. fermentum, and L. brevis strains with similar efficiencies. Transformation efficiencies were strain dependent and varied from 10 to 10 transformants per mug of DNA. Plasmid DNA analysis of L. pentosus MD353 transformants revealed that the introduction of pLP3537 or pLPE323 was invariably accompanied by loss of the endogenous 2.3-kb plasmid. Remarkably, pLPE317 could only be introduced into an L. pentosus MD353 strain that had been previously cured of its endogenous 1.7-kb plasmid. The curing phenomena are most likely to be explained by the incompatibility of the vectors and resident plasmids. Lactobacillus vectors are generally rapidly lost when cells are cultivated in the absence of selective pressure. However, pLPE323 is stable in three of four Lactobacillus strains tested so far.
TI  - Staphylococcal lactose phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system: site-specific mutagenesis on the lacE gene gives evidence that a cysteine residue is responsible for phosphorylation.
AB  - The lactose-specific phosphocarrier protein enzyme II of the bacterial phosphoenol-pyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system of Staphylococcus aureus was modified by site-specific mutagenesis on the corresponding lacE gene in order to replace the histidine residues 245, 274 and 510 and the cysteine residue 476 of the amino acid sequence with a serine residue. The wild-type and mutant genes were expressed in Escherichia coli and the gene products were characterized in different in vitro test systems. In vitro phosphorylation studies on mutant derivatives of the lactose-specific enzyme II led to the conclusion that cysteine residue 476 is the active-site for phosphorylation of this enzyme II by a phospho-enzyme III of the same sugar specificity. A cysteine residue phosphorylated intermediate was first postulated for the mannitol-specific enzyme II of E. coli and studies performed independently concerning the lactose-specific enzyme II of Lactobacillus casei are in agreement with the above results.
TI  - Molecular cloning and DNA sequence of lacE, the gene encoding the lactose-specific enzyme II of the phosphotransferase system of Lactobacillus casei. Evidence that a cysteine residue is essential for sugar phosphorylation.
AB  - The gene coding for the lactose-specific Enzyme II of the Lactobacillus casei phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system, lacE, has been isolated by molecular cloning and expressed in Escherichia coli. The DNA sequence of the lacE gene and the deduced amino acid sequence are presented. The putative translation product comprises a hydrophobic protein of 577 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 62,350 Da. The deduced polypeptide has a high degree of sequence similarity with the corresponding lactose-specific enzymes II of Staphylococcus aureus and Lactococcus lactis. The sequence surrounding cysteine 483 was strongly conserved in the three proteins. The identity of the lacE product as the Enzyme IIlacL.casei was demonstrated by in vitro lactose phosphorylation assays using the protein expressed in E. coli. Single replacement of each of the histidine and cysteine residues by site-directed mutagenesis pointed to cysteine 483 as an amino acid residue essential for the phosphoryl group transfer reaction.
TI  - Characterization of the lactose-specific enzymes of the phosphotransferase system in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The plasmid-encoded lactose genes of the Lactococcus lactis phosphotransferase system encoding Enzyme IIIlac (lacF) and Enzyme IIlac (lacE) have been identified and cloned in Escherichia coli and L. lactis. Nucleotide sequence and transcription analysis showed that these genes are organized into a lactose-inducible operon with the gene order lacF-lacE-lacG-lacX, the latter two genes encoding phospho-beta-galactosidase and a 34-kDa protein with an unknown function, respectively. The lac-operon is immediately followed by an IS element that is homologous to ISS1. Enzyme IIIlac was purified from L. lactis and determination of its NH2-terminal sequence demonstrated that the lacF gene starts with a TTG codon and encodes a 105 amino acid protein (Mr = 11416). Cross-linking studies with the purified enzyme showed that Enzyme IIIlac is active as a trimer. A mutant lacF gene was identified in strain YP2-5 and appeared to encode Enzyme IIIlac containing the missense mutation G18E. The lacF gene could be expressed under control of vector-located promoter sequences resulting in overproduction of Enzyme IIIlac in E. coli and complementation of the L. lactis lacF mutant YP2-5. The deduced amino acid sequence of Enzyme IIlac consists of 586 amino acids (Mr = 61562) and shows the characteristics of a hydrophobic, integral membrane protein. The deduced primary structures of the L. lactis Enzyme IIIlac and Enzyme IIlac are homologous to those of Staphylococcus aureus (72 and 71% identity, respectively) and Lactobacillus casei (48 and 47% identity, respectively). In contrast, the organization of the lactose genes differs significantly between those Gram-positive bacteria. Heterogramic homology in specific domains was observed between the derived amino acid sequences of the lactose-specific enzymes and that of E. coli Enzyme IIIcel and Enzyme IIcel, which suggest a common function in the transport and phosphorylation of these structurally related beta-glucosides.
TI  - A IIIman protein is involved in the transport of glucose, mannose and fructose by oral streptococci.
AB  - We show in this article that the transport of glucose, mannose and fructose by the phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose phosphotransferase system of oral streptococci requires the participation of a protein component that we have called IIIman. This protein was purified from Streptococcus salivarius by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, DEAE-TSK, hydroxyapatite, and Dyematrex Green A. The purified protein migrated as a 38,900 molecular weight protein on a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel. However, electrophoretic analysis of phosphoproteins and Western blot experiments indicated the presence in membrane-free cellular extracts of S. salivarius of 2 different forms of IIIman having molecular weights of 38,900 and 35,200. The presence of the high-molecular-weight form of IIIman was observed by immunodiffusion, Western blot and phosphorylation by [32]PEP in S. salivarius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, and Streptococcus lactis but not in Streptococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus casei. Antibodies directed against the IIIman of S. salivarius did not react with the IIIman of Escherichia coli.
TI  - [Bacterial penetration of bovine dentinal tubules. 1].
AB  - The penetration by bacteria through dentinal tubules was studied using a device that included portion of bovine anterior teeth. Strains of 4 genera, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus casei, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, were used for the experiment, and the effects of acid etching of dentin on the penetration of bacteria through the dentin was examined. The time required for penetration through dentinal tubules of acid-etched samples was shorter than that of unetched samples. The minimum time required for half the samples to become positive for bacterial penetration through dentin MPT50 was 4 hours for all strains chosen when the acid-etched dentin was the target. In non-acid etched samples, the MPT50 varied among the genera and ranged from 20 hours to 48 hours; the speed of penetration was Sta. aureus = L. casei greater than Str. mutans greater than E. coli. Observation under the scanning electron microscope indicated that the smeared layer was completely coated on the surface of the prepared cavity, and when bacterial penetration occurred, a portion of the smear layer on the dentin disappeared. In longitudinal sections, the penetration by the bacteria into the tubules was visible. From these results, it is suggested that the smeared layer have an important effects on bacterial penetration through these tubules.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the factor IIIlac gene of Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - The lactose-specific factor III (FIIIlac of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) was isolated from Lactobacillus casei and purified to homogeneity by conventional protein purification methods. Its apparent native Mr, estimated from steric exclusion chromatography (approx. 39 kDa), and subunit Mr, estimated from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, indicated that it exists as a trimer of identical subunits of 13 kDa. The gene for FIII L. casei lac was cloned into Escherichia coli using the vector pUC18. The coding sequences were contained on an 860-bp BglII-HindIII DNA fragment of the L. casei lactose plasmid, pLZ64. A protein identical in properties to FIII L. casei lac was isolated from clones of E. coli carrying this DNA insert. The nucleotide sequence of the FIII L. casei lac gene was determined by the dideoxy chain-termination technique. The 336-bp open reading frame for FIII L. casei lac was followed by a stem-loop structure, analogous to a Rho-independent terminator. We concluded that the FIII L. casei lac was the terminal gene in what appears to be an operon comprised of the lactose-PTS-P-beta Gal-coding genes. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of FIII L. caseilac with the amino acid sequence of FIII S. aureus lac (derived from peptide sequencing) demonstrated a high degree of homology (49 identical residues and 21 conservative exchanges out of 103 total aa residues). The FIII L. casei lac lacked his82, previously identified as the phosphorylation site of FIII S. aureus. lac His80 was proposed to be the site of histidyl phosphorylation of FIII L. casei lac.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the beta-D-phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase gene of Lactobacillus casei: comparison to analogous pbg genes of other gram-positive organisms.
AB  - Lactose metabolism in Lactobacillus casei occurs via phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase uptake of lactose and subsequent cleavage of lactose-6-phosphate by beta-D-phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase (P-beta Gal). The genes for lactose uptake and P-beta Gal have been shown to be plasmid-associated in L. casei 64H [Chassy et al., Curr. Microbiol. 1 (1978) 141-144]. The cloned P-beta Gal-coding gene (pbg) previously described [Lee et al., J. Bacteriol. 152 (1982) 1138-1146] was subcloned on a 2.9-kb KpnI-Bg/II fragment isolated from pLZ605. Sequence analysis of this fragment revealed an open reading frame of 1422 bp capable of coding for a protein product containing 474 amino acids and having an Mr of 53,989. The L. casei protein showed a high degree of homology to the proteins whose sequence was deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the pbg genes of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus lactis. Because of the significant homologies observed, as reflected in amino acid content as well as predicted structural characteristics of the three proteins, we suggest a common origin for the P-beta Gals of these three organisms.
TI  - Radiation resistance of lactobacilli isolated from radurized meat relative to growth and environment.
AB  - Of 113 lactobacilli isolated from radurized (5 kGy) minced meat, 7 Lactobacillus  sake strains, 1 L. curvatus strain, and 1 L. farciminis strain were used for radiation resistance studies in a semisynthetic substrate (i.e., modified MRS broth). Five reference Lactobacillus spp., one Staphylococcus aureus strain, and one Salmonella typhimurium strain were used for comparative purposes. All L. sake isolates exhibited the phenomenon of being more resistant to gamma-irradiation in the exponential (log) phase than in the stationary phase of their growth cycles by a factor of 28%. Four references strains also exhibited this phenomenon, with L. sake (DSM 20017) showing a 68% increase in resistance in the log phase over the stationary phase. This phenomenon was not common to all bacteria tested and is not common to all strains with high radiation resistance. Four L. sake isolates and three reference strains were used in radiation sensitivity testing in a natural food system (i.e., meat). The bacteria were irradiated in minced meat and packaged under four different conditions (air, vacuum, CO2, and N2). Organisms exhibited the highest death rate (lowest D10 values [doses required to reduce the logarithm of the bacterial population by 1] ) under CO2 packaging conditions, but resistance to irradiation was increased under N2. The D10 values of the isolates were generally greater than those of the reference strains. The D10 values were also higher (approximately two times) in meat than in semisynthetic growth medium.
TI  - [Effect of antibiotics on the adhesive properties of microorganisms and an available model for its study].
AB  - The effect of benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, bicillin-3, carbenicillin, levomycetin, erythromycin, streptomycin and kanamycin on the adhesive properties of 9 test microbes including 5 strains of Lactobacillus from human microflora, 3 uropathornic strains of E. coli and 1 strain of S. aureus was studied with the method developed by the authors. The method is based on the use of formalinized human erythrocytes as macroorganism cells. It was shown that the antibiotic inhibitory effect on adhesion depended on mechanism of action of the antibiotics and their concentration, was associated with the level of the microbial adhesion and did not depend on the microbial sensitivity to the drugs.
TI  - Phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase transport system of Streptococcus mutans: purification of HPr and enzyme I and determination of their intracellular concentrations by rocket immunoelectrophoresis.
AB  - Enzyme I and HPr, the general proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system, play a pivotal role in the control of sugar utilization in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. To determine whether growth conditions could modify the rate of biosynthesis of these proteins in Streptococcus mutans, we first purified to homogeneity enzyme I and HPr from S. mutans ATCC 27352. Using specific antibodies obtained against these proteins, we determined by rocket electrophoresis the intracellular levels of enzyme I and HPr in cells of S. mutans 27352 grown under various batch culture conditions and in a number of glucose-grown cells of other strains of S. mutans. HPr was purified by the procedure reported by Gauthier et al. (L. Gauthier, D. Mayrand, and C. Vadeboncoeur, J. Bacteriol. 160:755-763, 1984) and displayed a single band with a molecular weight of 6,650 when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea gel electrophoresis. Enzyme I was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, affinity chromatography on an anti-Streptococcus salivarius column, and preparative electrophoresis. The protein migrated as a single band in native and denaturating gel electrophoresis. The subunit molecular weight of enzyme I determined by electrophoresis under denaturating conditions was 68,000. In gel filtration chromatography at 4 degrees C, the enzyme migrated as a 135,000- to 160,000-molecular-weight species, suggesting that enzyme I is a dimer. In double immunodiffusion experiments, antibodies against HPr reacted with several oral streptococci, Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus faecium, and Lactobacillus casei, but not with Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Antibodies against enzyme I of S. mutans 27352 cross-reacted with enzyme I from all the other oral streptococci tested. No cross-reaction was observed with other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The levels of enzyme I and HPr determined by rocket electrophoresis in S. mutans 27352 varied at the most by twofold, depending on the growth conditions. Glucose-grown cells of other S. mutans strains contained levels of enzyme I and HPr which were similar to those found in S. mutans 27352.
TI  - Further studies on thymidine kinase: distribution pattern of the enzyme in bacteria.
AB  - Various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (TK; EC 2.7.1.21). Taking the specific TK activity of Escherichia coli K12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific TK activities. In the Gram-positive cocci, Staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than Staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and Streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of Strep. pyogenes (29%). Neisseria sicca, a Gram-negative coccus, lacked TK. Gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (Bacillus, 13-51%; Clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of B. megaterium (2%) and C. difficile (1-3%). Among the Gram-positive asporogenous rods, Listeria monocytogenes and six species of Lactobacillus (especially L. brevis, L. buchneri and L. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. lactis and L. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). Of the species of Pseudomonas studied, most lacked TK but Ps. fluorescens and Ps. maltophilia had significant TK activity (15-53%). Of the Gram-negative facultative anaerobes, Vibrio lacked TK, while Enterobacteriaceae, including Salmonella (148-1120%), Escherichia (59-141%), Klebsiella (78-299%) and Serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. Proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'Pr. rettgerella' (307%). Propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium and related organisms other than Streptomyces, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium lacked TK. The seven species of Candida tested, and Cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked TK.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Limited proteolysis of the bifunctional thymidylate synthase-dihydrofolate reductase from Leishmania tropica.
AB  - The structure and activity of the bifunctional thymidylate synthase-dihydrofolate reductase (TS-DHFR) from the protozoan parasite Leishmania tropica were examined by limited proteolysis with five different endopeptidases. Each reaction resulted in a rapid, time-dependent loss of TS activity and no effect on DHFR activity. The proteolytic products were examined by NaDodSO4/PAGE; each digestion produced a fragment of apparent Mr approximately 35,000, and three of the five digestions generated a fragment of Mr approximately 20,000. Attempts to separate the fragments under nondenaturing conditions failed, suggesting that the proteolyzed protein remains a dimer with the gross structure of the subunits more or less undisturbed. In contrast, kinetic data indicate that some aspects of higher-order structure in the native protein are affected by proteolysis. The fragments (Mr 36,600 and 20,000) generated by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease were subjected to sequence analysis. Whereas neither the native protein nor the Mr 36,600 fragment yielded an NH2-terminal amino acid, we obtained the sequence of the first 28 amino acids of the Mr 20,000 fragment. This sequence bore strong homology with sequences situated within TS of human, Lactobacillus casei, Escherichia coli, and bacteriophage T4. These and other data indicate that the TS-DHFR polypeptide consists of a DHFR sequence at the blocked NH2-terminal and a TS sequence at the COOH-terminal end of the protein. The region that is the target of the five proteases corresponds to a highly variable region within the sequences of the other four TSs. We suggest that an insertion occurs within the TS-DHFR sequence, positioned on the surface of the protein and quite vulnerable to the action of endopeptidases.
TI  - Streptococcal phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system: purification  and characterization of a phosphoprotein phosphatase which hydrolyzes the phosphoryl bond in seryl-phosphorylated histidine-containing protein.
AB  - Histidine-containing protein (HPr) of gram-positive bacteria was found to be phosphorylated at a seryl residue (P-ser-HPr) in an ATP-dependent reaction catalyzed by a protein kinase (J. Deutscher and M. H. Saier, Jr., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80:6790-6794, 1983). Here we describe the purification and characterization of a soluble enzyme of Streptococcus faecalis which splits the phosphoryl bond in P-ser-HPr. The enzyme has a molecular weight of ca. 7.5 X 10(4), as determined by its migration behavior on a Sephacryl S-200 column. On native polyacrylamide gels the purified enzyme produced only one protein band. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels we found one major protein band of molecular weight 2.9 X 10(4) and two minor protein bands of molecular weights 2.3 X 10(4) and 7 X 10(4). Fructose 1,6-diphosphate, which stimulated the ATP-dependent, protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of HPr, had no effect on the phosphatase activity. Other glycolytic intermediates also had no effect. However, inorganic phosphate, which inhibited the ATP-dependent HPr kinase, stimulated the P-ser-HPr phosphatase. EDTA at a concentration of 0.1 mM completely inhibited the phosphatase. Divalent cations like Mg2+, Mn2+, and Co2+ overcame the inhibition by EDTA. Fe2+, Zn2+, and Cu2+ had no effect, whereas Ca2+ slightly inhibited the phosphatase. ATP was also found to inhibit the phosphatase. Under conditions in which ATP severely inhibited the phosphatase, ADP was found to have no effect on the enzyme activity. Besides P-ser-HPr of S. faecalis, the phosphatase was also able to hydrolyze the phosphoryl bond in P-ser-HPr of Streptococcus lactis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Lactobacillus casei. Phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside phosphorylation, catalyzed by the S. aureus phosphoenolpyruvate:lactose phosphotransferase system, was about 150-fold decreased in the presence of P-ser-HPr of S. aureus, as compared with HPr. However, when P-ser-HPr was first incubated with P-ser-HPr phosphatase to allow complete hydrolysis of the phosphoryl bond, it had the same activity as HPr. Besides this cytoplasmic phosphoprotein phosphatase, we detected a membrane-bound phosphatase which also hydrolyzed the phosphoryl bond in P-ser-HPr.
TI  - Multiplicity of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin antibiotic resistance determinants.
AB  - Bacteria can resist macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin (MLS) antibiotics enzymically by alteration of the target site or detoxification of the antibiotic. N6-dimethylation of adenine in 23 S ribosomal RNA confers resistance to M, L, and S B-type (MLSB) antibiotics. Investigation, by DNA annealing, of the relationship between the genes specifying this resistance mechanism from Streptococcus (groups A,B,D, and H, and pneumoniae), Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacteroides fragilis, Lactobacillus casei, and Streptomyces erythreus indicated substantial sequence diversity among the MLSB resistance (R) determinants. A minimum of four distinct classes of MLSB R determinants could be defined: classes A and B for the Gram-positive cocci (streptococci pmeumococci and staphylococci), class C for B. licheniformis, and class D for Bact. fragilis. These data do not support the hypothesis that the R determinants were acquired recently from a single common origin and suggest an easy exchange of genetic information among the Gram-positive cocci. The genetic classes do not correlate with differences in phenotypic expression or in regulation (inducibility or constitutivity) of resistance towards MLSB antibiotics. Inactivation of the drug confers resistance to M and/or L and/or S or SA or SB antibiotics and has been detected in strains of Streptococcus, Staph. aureus, Lactobacillus, C. perfringens, Streptomyces, and recently in the Gram-negative organism Escherichia coli. We have cloned and sequenced a DNA fragment conferring high level resistance (MIC greater than 2 g/l) to erythromycin by hydrolysis of the antibiotic. The distribution of this 'new' character in enterobacteria isolated from human faeces was studied by colony hybridization using an intragenic probe. The gene for the erythromycin esterase was detected in numerous strains of E. coli belonging to various biotypes, in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter agglomerans, and in one 'coliform'. Moreover, our results indicated the existence of at least two classes of genes specifying resistance to erythromycin by inactivation of the antibiotic in enterobacteria.
TI  - Isolation of a novel protein involved in the transport of fructose by an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase system in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Fructose transport in Streptococcus mutans LG-1 is mediated by at least two distinct phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase systems. One system is constitutive and consists of membrane components enzyme II as well as enzyme I and heat-stable protein. The other system is inducible and requires, in addition to enzyme I and heat-stable protein, a soluble substrate-specific protein for catalytic activity. This protein factor, designated IIIfru, was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, molecular sieving on Sephadex G-75, and preparative electrophoresis. The purified preparation showed only one protein band, with a molecular weight of 12,600, on sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, on gel electrophoresis with the discontinuous buffer Tris-glycine, and after electrofocusing in gel (pI congruent to 3.7). The molecular weight of the native protein determined by gel filtration at 4 degrees C was 51,000. Immunodiffusion experiments performed with immunoglobulins prepared against the purified IIIfru from S. mutans LG-1 suggested that other S. mutans strains possessed a IIIfru. No precipitin bands, however, were detected with extracts from S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. lactis, S. faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus casei, and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Lactose transport in Streptococcus mutans: isolation and characterization of factor IIIlac, a specific protein component of the phosphoenolpyruvate-lactose phosphotransferase system.
AB  - The transport of lactose in Streptococcus mutans is mediated via an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate-lactose phosphotransferase system. This system requires for catalytic activity a membrane fraction (enzyme II), two general proteins called enzyme I and HPr, and a soluble specific protein termed factor IIIlac. This protein factor was purified from S. mutans ATCC 27352 by chromatographies on DEAE-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, Ultrogel AcA 34, and phosphocellulose. The purified protein migrated as a single band with a molecular weight of 10,000 on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and urea. The molecular weight calculated from the amino acid composition was 10,541. Gel filtration of the native protein gave a molecular weight of 41,500. Its isoelectric point was ca. 4.70. A specific antiserum was prepared against purified factor IIIlac. Immunodiffusion experiments revealed that only cellular extracts from lactose-grown cells contained factor IIIlac. A cross-reaction was observed with all of the S. mutans strains tested as well as with Streptococcus sanguis 10556, Streptococcus lactis 11454, and Staphylococcus aureus 6538. No precipitin band was observed with extracts of Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei, and Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - Toxic shock syndrome: an ecologic imbalance within the genital microflora of women?
AB  - Epidemiologic data suggested that toxic shock syndrome (TSS) may be caused by an  imbalance among the flora of the female genital tract. Since natural defense mechanisms often involve antagonistic interactions between the flora and potential pathogens, the ability of genital lactobacilli to inhibit Staphylococcus aureus was determined in agar overlay assays. Lactobacilli were chosen for study because previous investigations had suggested an important role for this genus in maintenance of health of the female genital tract. Fourteen of 50 strains of lactobacilli and Lactinex inhibited the growth of certain staphylococci, including strains from cases of TSS. The inhibitory activity of some lactobacilli was variable and could be enhanced by exogenously supplied substrates. Growth of one consistently inhibitory lactobacillus was inhibited by Staphylococcus aureus. A model for the etiology of toxic shock syndrome in menstruating women is proposed. The model includes antagonistic interactions between lactobacilli and staphylococci and the influence of tampons on these interactions to favor the staphylococcus.

TI  - Binding of streptococcal antigens to muscle tissue in vitro.
AB  - Antigens extracted from cells of Streptococcus pyogenes T6 and Streptococcus mutans strains AHT, BHT, 10449, OMZ175, and K1R adsorbed to the sarcolemmal sheath of cardiac muscle cells in vitro. Similar preparations from S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Lactobacillus casei had weak or negligible tissue-binding activity. Tissue-bound bacterial antigens were detected with homologous rabbit antisera with both indirect immunofluorescence tests and an indirect radioimmunoassay. Serological cross-reactivity was observed between the tissue-binding factors of S. pyogenes and S. mutans cells but not between the bacteria and muscle tissue. In a comparative study of extraction procedures, the greatest yield of tissue-binding factors was obtained from group A streptococci by cell disruption in buffer at 4 degrees C. Hot aqueous phenol and hot water extracts were inactive. Antibodies specific for the tissue-binding factor(s) were readily adsorbed from rabbit anti-S. pyogenes serum by a preparation of isolated cytoplasmic membranes but not by a suspension of cell wall fragments. The heart-binding component of S. pyogenes cell extracts was inactivated by protease digestion and heat treatment and to a lesser extent by periodic acid oxidation. The capacity of heart cell components to adsorb streptococcal antigens was reduced by protease treatment but not by the action of neuraminidase, hyaluronidase, organic solvents, or detergents.
TI  - The interaction of ligands with enzymes. A starting point in drug design.
AB  - The problem of inhibiting a specific enzyme of a pathogen without inhibiting the  corresponding enzyme of the host is one which has intrigued medicinal chemists for years. While it is easy to find potent inhibitors of purified enzymes transforming these inhibitors into effective drugs, it still is a very poorly understood business. This report discusses studies with two enzymes, papain and dihydrofolate reductase, and the nonspecific (phi and MR correlated) interaction of ligands with them. The QSAR which has been developed for the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase by triazines is compared with the QSAR which has been reported for the same inhibitors acting against S. aureus.
TI  - Controlled cell disruption: a comparison of the forces required to disrupt different micro-organisms.
AB  - A cell disrupter has been developed which can measure the forces required to disrupt both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. It operates a continuous process and will disrupt both large and small volumes. Shear forces are set up when a suspension under laminar flow conditions is released under high pressure through a short orifice. If the applied pressure is altered, the shear forces are simultaneously changed so that the amount of cell disruption can be compared under different known and repeatable conditions. The disrupter is now manufactured and supplied by Stansted Fluid Power Limited, Stansted, England. Phase-contrast microscopy has shown that the disrupter will break a variety of organisms including Chlorella, Aspergillus fumigatis, Fusarium sp., Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei, Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium perfringens, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus zooepidermicus and Staphylococcus aureus. The cells are not all broken at one pressure but a certain pressure must be applied before disruption starts which will then increase rapidly as the applied pressure is increased. The applied pressure required to disrupt half the population in a culture is different from one species to another, rods being disrupted more easily than spheres. The case of disruption seems to be related to the shape and chemical composition of the cell wall. Furthermore, the disrupting process, in an unsynchronized culture is not random and may be related to the statistical size distribution of the cells.
TI  - The amino acid sequence of dihydrofolate reductase from the mouse lymphoma L1210.
AB  - The determination of the amino acid sequence of the dihydrofolate reductase (EC 1.5.1.3) from cells of the mouse lymphoma L1210 is described. The protein was cleaved by cyanogen bromide to produce the six fragments CB1 (residues 1 to 14), CB2 (residues 15 to 52), CB3 (residues 53 to 111), CB4 (residues 115 to 125), CB5 (residues 126 to 139), and CB6 (residues 140 to 186). One of the fragments, CB2, contained an internal homoserine derived from a methionine which was not cleaved by cyanogen bromide. The amino acid sequences and order of the cyanogen bromide fragments were determined by a combination of automatic and manual sequence analyses of the fragments and small peptides from tryptic, thermolytic, and Staphylococcus aureus protease digestions. The complete sequence comprises 186 residues in a single polypeptide chain of molecular weight 21,458. Comparison of the sequence of the L1210 dihydrofolate reductase with the sequences of the enzymes from Streptococcus faecium, escherichia coli RT500, and Lactobacillus casei indicates that all enzymes show some homology, which is strongest in the regions forming the substrate binding cleft.
TI  - [Results of measuring the modulus of elasticity of microorganism cell walls].
AB  - The elasticity modulus of Escherichia coli cell walls was found to change in the  course of growth of the culture. It decreased in the middle of the exponential phase, apparently as a result of intensification of biosynthetic and related to them transport processes at this period. If the cells were treated with EDTA, their elasticity modulus was lower, by an order of magnitude, than that of the control cell walls. If the cells were treated with lysozyme, the elasticity modulus of their walls decreased by three orders of magnitude. The elasticity modulus of cell walls was less in gram-positive rods than in E. coli. The elasticity modulus of spherical cells cannot be determined using this technique.
TI  - Dihydrofolate reductases in some folate-requiring bacteria with low trimethoprim  susceptibility.
AB  - Dihydrofolate reductases from the folate-requiring strains Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 8043, Lactobacillus casei ATCC 7496, and Pediococcus cerevisiae ATCC 8081, as well as from Lactobacillus arabinosus, which is not dependent on exogenous folate, were isolated, and their properties were compared to reductases of Escherichia coli B, Staphylococcus aureus, and rat liver reductase. An inhibition profile with six different inhibitors revealed significant differences among all enzymes. All lactobacilli reductases are less sensitive to trimethoprim than the enzymes of E. coli and S. aureus, the reductase of P. cerevisiae requiring a concentration at least 1,000 times higher for 50% inhibition. Inhibition of growth of S. faecalis by pyrimethamine and 2,4-diamino-6,7-diisopropyl-pteridine was seen to be much stronger than was predicted from the enzymatic data.
TI  - On the relationship between glycerophosphoglycolipids and lipoteichoic acids in Gram-positive bacteria. II. Structures of glycerophosphoglycolipids.
AB  - 1. Eight glycerophosphoglycolipids were isolated from six Gram-positive bacteria. Besides sn-glycero-1-phospho-beta-gentiobiosyldiacylglycerol (i) and sn-glycero-1-phospho-alpha-kojibiosyldiacylglycerol (ii), three novel structures have been established: 1,2-di-O-acyl-3-O-[6-(sn-glycero-1-phospho)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 leads to 2)-(6-O-acyl-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)]glycerol (iii), 1,2-di-O-acyl-3-O-[6-(sn-glycero-1-phospho)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 leads to 6)-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-(1 leads to 2)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl]glycerol (iv), and 1,2-di-O-acyl-3-O-[6-(sn-glycero-1-phospho)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 leads to 6)-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-(1 leads to 2)-(6-O-acyl-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)]glycerol (v). 2. Compound i was isolated from Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, compound ii from a group B Streptococcus, compounds ii and iii from Streptococcus lactis, compounds iv and v from Lactobacillus casei. Lactobacillus plantarum contained besides compounds iv and v a glycerophosphate derivative of 1,2-di-O-acyl-3-O-[alpha-D-galactopyranosyl (1 leads to 2)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl]glycerol. 3. Identical structural features of the described glycerophosphoglycolipids and the corresponding lipoteichoic acids are discussed.

TI  - In vitro determination of the antimicrobial properties of two cyanoacrylate preparations.
AB  - Isobutyl and trifluoro cyanoacrylates showed varying degrees of inhibition for Lactobacillus casei and Staphylococcus aureus when tested by the spread plate technique. Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. The results tend to support the view that inhibition of growth was due to the vapor effect and not the diffusibility of the cyanoacrylates.
TI  - Study of antibacterial activity and bacteriology of latex from Asclepias syriaca  L.
AB  - Whole and fractionated latex of Asclepias syriaca was tested for antimicrobial or growth-promoting activity with 16 genera and species of bacteria. Latex and extracted fractions (distilled water, acetic acid, sodium bicarbonate, sulfuric acid, and ethyl ether) possessed no detectable antimicrobial activity. Comparison of growth curves of selected bacteria incubated with serum and rubber fractions, as well as controls, revealed no detectable inhibition of growth, except for a slight inhibitory response to autoclaved serum. Most bacteria were capable of utilizing latex for a substrate as indicated by the increased growth rate in the exponential phase. The stationary phase was entered simultaneously by both the treated cultures and the controls. Various bacteria cultured in a litmus latex mixture yielded populations which ranged from <10(4) organisms/ml for Lactobacillus casei, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus lysodeikticus to 1.1 x 10(10) organisms/ml for Clostridium acetobutylicum. Whole latex, as well as the serum and rubber fractions, support the growth of various bacteria, but under field conditions there is no evidence for systemic infection of this type of cell by bacteria.
TI  - Occurrence of glucosamine residues with free amino groups in cell wall peptidoglycan from bacilli as a factor responsible for resistance to lysozyme.
AB  - Analysis by dinitrophenylation techniques revealed the occurrence of significant  amounts of glucosamine residues with free amino groups in the peptidoglycan component of cell walls isolated from Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus megaterium. A close correlation was demonstrated between the content of N-unacetylated glucosamine residues in the peptidoglycan component and the resistance of the cell walls to lysozyme. These lysozyme-resistant cell walls and peptidoglycan were converted into a lysozyme-sensitive form by means of N-acetylation with acetic anhydride. Thus, the occurrence of the N-unacetylated glucosamine residues in the peptidoglycan component accounts for the resistance of these cell walls to lysozyme. The N-unacetylated glucosamine residues were not found in a significant amount in the cell walls of Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei, or Lactobacillus arabinosus.
TI  - Toxic properties of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The biological activity of Odontomyces viscosus, which has been reported to cause periodontal disease in hamsters, was examined. The microorganism was cultured anaerobically in Brain Heart Infusion broth, and the cells were harvested. The washed cells were injected intradermally into the abdomen of rabbits. After 72 hr, a well-defined, firm, raised nodule (about 1.0 by 1.5 cm) with an erythematous border was seen at the injection site. Suspensions of cell wall and cytoplasmic material were injected intradermally, and the lesions appeared only at the site of cell wall injection. The cell walls, which were then treated with trypsin, pepsin, and ribonuclease, again produced the characteristic lesion. These nodular dermal lesions persisted for a minimal time of 10 days. The enzymatically treated cell walls were then hydrolyzed with 1 n HCl, and such hydrolysis up to 1 hr failed to alter the toxic activity of the cell walls. Similar dermal nodular lesions were obtained by injection of enzymatically treated cell walls of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus groups B, C, E, F, K, Lactobacillus casei, and Actinomyces israelii. Treatment with hot and cold trichloroacetic acid solutions and proteolytic enzymes, or with formamide, yielded insoluble fractions which produced the characteristic nodular lesions. The size of the lesion resulting from injection of these fractions was proportional to the amount of the injected material. The active fraction, which does not appear susceptible to hydrolysis by lysozyme, is thought to be cell wall mucopeptide. Histological studies showed skin abscesses due to the toxic reaction; however, in addition to the acute inflammatory reaction, there was local eosinophilia.
