TI  - Resistance to human beta-defensins is common among oral treponemes.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Oral treponemes are implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. We have previously shown that Treponema denticola ATCC type strains and strain GM-1 are resistant to killing by human beta-defensins (hbetaD)-1 and -2. We hypothesize that resistance to beta-defensins is a common feature of oral treponemes, which allows colonization and persistence in the oral cavity. In this study, we tested additional isolates of T. denticola, as well as six other species of treponemes, for resistance to hbetaD-1, -2 and -3. We also examined the four ATCC strains of T. denticola and strain GM-1 for resistance to hbetaD-3. METHODS: Resistance was determined by motility and Alamar Blue assays for metabolic activity. RESULTS: All T. denticola strains tested were resistant to hbetaD-1, -2 and -3, with the exception of strain Ambigua, which was sensitive to hbetaD-2 and -3. All other treponemes except Treponema vincentii were resistant to hbetaD-1. Treponema pectinovorum was sensitive to hbetaD-2, while T. vincentii, T. pectinovorum and Treponema maltophilum were sensitive to hbetaD-3. Escherichia coli was used as a control organism and was killed by all three defensins. CONCLUSION: Resistance to the constitutively expressed hbetaD-1 may assist treponemes in initial colonization of epithelial surfaces, while resistance to the inducible hbetaD-2 and -3 would allow some treponemes to survive in active periodontal lesions.
TI  - Identification of a Treponema denticola OppA homologue that binds host proteins present in the subgingival environment.
AB  - Proteins secreted or exported by Treponema denticola have been implicated as mediators of specific interactions between the spirochete and subgingival tissues in periodontal diseases. However, limited information is available on the ability of this peptidolytic organism to bind or transport soluble peptides present in the subgingival environment. A prominent 70-kDa protein was isolated from surface extracts of T. denticola ATCC 35405. A clone expressing a portion of the protein was identified in an Escherichia coli expression library of T. denticola DNA. DNA sequence analysis showed that the cloned gene encoded a peptide homologous to OppA, the solute binding protein of an ATP-binding cassette-type peptide transporter involved in peptide uptake and environmental signaling in a wide range of bacteria. Genes encoding OppB, -C, -D, and -F were identified directly downstream of oppA in T. denticola. OppA was present in representative strains of T. denticola and in Treponema vincentii but was not detected in Treponema pectinovorum or Treponema socranskii. Immunogold electron microscopy suggested that OppA was accessible to proteins at the surface of the spirochete. Native OppA bound soluble plasminogen and fibronectin but did not bind to immobilized substrates or epithelial cells. A T. denticola oppA mutant bound reduced amounts of soluble plasminogen, and plasminogen binding to the parent strain was inhibited by the lysine analog epsilon-aminocaproic acid. Binding of soluble host proteins by OppA may be important both for spirochete-host interactions in the subgingival environment and for uptake of peptide nutrients.
TI  - Serological evidence of spirochaetal infections associated with digital dermatitis in dairy cattle.
AB  - A potentially infectious aetiology for digital dermatitis in dairy cattle was investigated and centred on the possible involvement of spirochaetes. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to detect bovine anti-Borrelia burgdorferi (B31) and anti-Treponeme (USA bovine isolates) antibodies in the sera of cows; sera were further tested for antigen specificity by Western blotting. Compared to normal cows, those with digital dermatitis had a much higher seropositivity rate to B. burgdorferi and the treponemes. Significant correlations were shown between antibodies to B. burgdorferi and to Treponemes (P < 0.001), suggesting strong cross-reacting epitopes shared by these spirochaetes. In Western blotting of B. burgdorferi antigens, the main band detected by ELISA positive sera was the 41 kDa flagellar protein; lesser frequency of staining was seen with 34 (OspB), 39 and 55 kDa bands. For the USA treponeme antigens, ELISA positive sera gave reactions to the 34-kDa band and also bands at 41 and 55 kDa. Polyclonal antibodies to Treponema denticola and T. vincentii showed reactions with the bovine treponemes which were predominantly to the 34-kDa antigen. Monoclonal antibodies to B. burgdorferi flagella (41 kDa) antigen and OspA (31 kDa) did not detect any treponeme bands in Western blotting. The study has provided serological evidence that spirochaetes (which are related to human treponemes) may be involved in the pathogenesis of digital dermatitis.
TI  - Conservation of msp, the gene encoding the major outer membrane protein of oral Treponema spp.
AB  - The major surface protein (Msp) of Treponema denticola has been implicated as a mediator of the interaction between the spirochete and the gingival epithelium in periodontal diseases. Previous studies showed that the Msp of T. denticola ATCC 35405 had porin activity, depolarized epithelial cell membranes, bound to extracellular matrix components of epithelial cells, and formed a regular hexagonal surface array in the treponemal outer membrane. The gene encoding Msp in ATCC 35405 was recently cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli (J. C. Fenno, K.-H. Muller, and B. C. McBride, J. Bacteriol. 178:2489-2496, 1996). In the present study, we identified genes encoding Msp-like proteins in several oral spirochetes. A prominent heat-modifiable Msp-like protein having an apparent molecular mass of between 43 and 64 kDa was present in all oral spirochete strains tested. Antibodies raised against the ATCC 35405 Msp reacted strongly with the Msp proteins of T. denticola ATCC 35404 and T. vincentii, reacted very weakly with the Msp protein of T. denticola ATCC 33520, and did not react with T. denticola OTK, T. socranskii, and T. pectinovorum. The msp loci of the T. denticola strains and T. vincentii were identified in analyses using PCR with oligonucleotide primers derived from the DNA sequence flanking msp in ATCC 35405. Southern blot analysis showed at least three groups of related msp DNA sequences. Comparison of DNA sequences of the 5' and 3' ends of the msp genes showed high sequence homology in the flanking regions and signal peptide coding regions, while the homologies between regions encoding the mature peptide were as low as 50%. The entire msp DNA sequences of T. denticola ATCC 33520 and OTK were determined, and the deduced Msp amino acid sequences were compared to the sequence of the previously reported Msp of ATCC 35405. The results show that the msp locus is conserved in oral treponemes but that there are significant differences between the mature Msp peptides of different strains. Further studies of the antigenic domains, functional domains, and physical structures of Msp proteins, based on these results, will enhance understanding of the role of Msp in the cytopathology associated with oral spirochetes.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of pathogen-related oral spirochetes.
AB  - Recently, Riviere et al. reported as yet uncultivable invasive oral spirochetes that cross-reacted with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for Treponema pallidum (G. R. Riviere, K. S. Elliot, D. F. Adams, L. G. Simonson, L. B. Forgas, A. M. Nilius, and S. A. Lukehart, J. Periodontol. 63:131-136, 1992; G. R. Riviere, M. A. Wagoner, S. A. Baker-Zander, K. S. Weisz, D. F. Adams, L. Simonson, and S. A. Lukehart, N. Engl. J. Med. 325:539-543, 1991; G. R. Riviere, K. S. Weisz, D. F. Adams, and D. D. Thomas, Infect. Immun. 59:3377-3380, 1991; G. R. Riviere, K. S. Weisz, L. G. Simonson, and S. A. Lukehart, Infect. Immun. 59:2653-2657, 1991). In an attempt to phylogenetically analyze these pathogen-related oral spirochetes, we used immunomagnetic separation, combined with comparative sequence analysis of 16S rRNA genes amplified in vitro by the PCR. The bacteria were immunomagnetically enriched from subgingival plaque samples of patients with rapidly progressive periodontitis by using MAb H9-2 specific for the 37-kDa endoflagellum sheath protein of T. pallidum. After PCR amplification with universal eubacterial primers 16S rRNA gene fragments were cloned into Escherichia coli. A total of 20 randomly selected recombinants were analyzed by sequencing about 200 to 300 bases of the 500-bp inserts. All the spirochetal 16S rRNA sequences clustered to previously described, as yet uncultivable cluster 7 treponemes of group I (B. K. Choi, B. J. Paster, F. E. Dewhirst, and U. B. Gobel, Infect. Immun. 62:1889-1895, 1994). With a sequence similarity of 96.4% the most closely related cultivable treponeme was Treponema vincentii, which also belongs to the group I treponemes. Subsequent immunological analysis of cultured treponemes with MAb H9-2 revealed that only T. vincentii strains showed specific immunofluorescence or a characteristic 37-kDa band in immunoblots. We therefore conclude that pathogen-related oral spirochetes constitute a heterogeneous population of treponemes comprising T. vincentii and T. vincentii-related organisms that have common epitopes cross-reacting with MAb H9-2.
TI  - Diversity of cultivable and uncultivable oral spirochetes from a patient with severe destructive periodontitis.
AB  - To determine the genetic diversity of cultivable and uncultivable spirochetes in  the gingival crevice of a patient with severe periodontitis, partial 16S rRNA genes were cloned from PCR-amplified products of DNA and RNA extracted from a subgingival plaque sample. Approximately 500 bp were amplified in PCRs by using universally conserved primers with polylinker tails. Purified PCR products were cloned into Escherichia coli by using the plasmid vector pUC19. The resultant clone library was screened by colony hybridization with a radiolabeled, treponeme-specific oligonucleotide probe. The 16S rRNA inserts of 81 spirochetal clones were then sequenced by standard procedures. Sequences were compared with 16S rRNA sequences of 35 spirochetes, including the four known cultivable oral treponeme species. The analysis revealed an unexpected diversity of oral treponemes from a single patient. When 98% or greater sequence similarity was used as the definition of a species-level cluster, the clone sequences were found to represent 23 species. When 92% similarity was used as the definition, the clones fell into eight major groups, only two of which contained named species, Treponema vincentii and Treponema denticola, while Treponema pectinovorum and Treponema socranskii were not represented in any cluster. Seven of the 81 spirochetal clones were found to contain chimeric 16S rRNA sequences. In situ fluorescence hybridization with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled oligonucleotide probe specific for one of the new species representing cluster 19 was used to identify cells of the target species directly in clinical samples.
TI  - Use of randomly cloned DNA fragments for the identification of oral spirochetes.
AB  - DNA probes were produced for the detection and identification of 4 cultivable species of oral spirochetes, Treponema denticola, Treponema socranskii, Treponema vincentii and Treponema pectinovorum. To obtain probe sequences, chromosomal DNA, isolated from representative strains within each species, was cloned in Escherichia coli K-12. Cloned DNA fragments were screened for the ability to hybridize to DNA only from homologous strains. Several such fragments were identified and shown to be specific when tested against a series of DNAs from gram-negative and gram-positive oral bacteria. The selected probe sequences were semi-conserved within strains of T. denticola and T. socranskii such that restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was observed. In the case of T. socranskii, RFLP was useful in distinguishing between the 3 known subspecies. Chromosomal DNA fragments from 2 strains of T. vincentii failed to cross-hybridize, under stringent conditions, to genomic DNA from each of these strains. The hybridization probes were suitable for the identification of clinical isolates of T. denticola and could be used to detect the presence of individual Treponema species in mixed cultures. On this basis, the probes were used successfully to detect T. denticola in uncultured plaque samples.
TI  - [Chemical composition and biological activities of lipopolysaccharides extracted  from Treponema denticola and Treponema vincentii].
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) were isolated from Treponema denticola (T. denticola)  and Treponema vincentii (T. vincentii) by the phenol/water (PW) and the phenol/chloroform/petroleum-ether (PCP) procedures. 1) T. denticola PW-LPS (LPS isolated by the PW procedure), PCP-sup-LPS (LPS isolated by the PCP procedure in the supernates of ultracentrifugation), PCP-ppt-LPS (precipitated LPS isolated by the PCP procedure, obtained after ultracentrifugation), and T. vincentii PCP-ppt-LPS were composed of carbohydrate, hexosamine, protein, fatty acid, and phosphorus. T. vincentii PW-LPS was contained major amount of carbohydrates and small amount of fatty acids. 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonic acid (KDD) was not detected in these LPSs. 2) The major fatty acids of T. denticola PW-LPS and PCP-sup-LPS were palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acids. The major fatty acids of T. vincentii PCP-ppt-LPS were palmitic, stearic, myristic, oleic, and linoleic acids. Hydroxy fatty acids were not detected. 3) Glucose, galactose, and mannose were comprised in T. denticola PW-LPS. Glucose, galactose, and arabinose were comprised in T. denticola PCP-sup-LPS. Glucose and galactose were comprised in T. vincentii PCP-ppt-LPS. 4) The Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) clotting activity of T. denticola PW-LPS was 1/10, as compared with that of Escherichia coli (E. coli) UKT-B LPS standard. The LAL clotting activities of T. denticola PCP-sup-LPS, T. vincentii PW-LPS, and T. vincentii PCP-ppt-LPS were 1/100, as compared with that of E. coli LPS standard. 5) Five hundred micrograms/kg of T. denticola PCP-sup-LPS was pyrogenic in rabbits. Two thousand micrograms/kg of T. vincentii PCP-ppt-LPS was pyrogenic in rabbits. 6) T. denticola PCP-sup-LPS and T. vincentii PCP-ppt-LPS were capable of increasing or decreasing the release of lysosomal enzymes from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
TI  - Serospecificity of a cloned protease-resistant Treponema pallidum--specific antigen expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - We evaluated the serological reactivity of a protease-resistant antigen designated 4D which was encoded by Treponema pallidum DNA and was expressed in Escherichia coli from recombinant plasmid pAW329. This 19,000-molecular-weight antigen was purified in its native, non-protease-treated form from E. coli sonic extracts by molecular sieving and ion-exchange chromatography. Antibody binding to antigen 4D was detected by a radioimmunoassay. Antigen 4D-specific antibody was detected in 95% of the sera in a Centers for Disease Control syphilis serum panel. It was also detected in 55% of 121 primary syphilis patients, whereas syphilis antibody was detected in 83% of the sera by a fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test and in 88% of the sera by a T. pallidum microhemagglutination test. In tests of 118 normal sera, less than 3% demonstrated antibody to antigen 4D; these results are similar to microhemagglutination and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test results. Rabbit antisera against Treponema phagedenis, Treponema refringens, Treponema denticola, and Treponema vincentii did not react with antigen 4D.
