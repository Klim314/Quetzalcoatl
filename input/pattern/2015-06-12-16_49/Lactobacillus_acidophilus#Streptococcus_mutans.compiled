TI  - Effects of Baseplates of Orthodontic Appliances with in situ generated Silver Nanoparticles on Cariogenic Bacteria: A Randomized, Double-blind Cross-over Clinical Trial.
AB  - AIM: Polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) is commonly used primarily for baseplates of  orthodontic appliances (BOA). The activities of cariogenic bacteria in bioflm on these surfaces may contribute to dental caries, gingival infammation and periodontal disease. The PMMA incorporated with nanoparti-cles of silver (NanoAg-I-PMMA) and NanoAg in situ in PMMA (NanoAg-IS-PMMA) have been shown to control the growth of cariogenic bacteria, but clinical trial of anti-cariogenic application of these novel materials in orthodontics has not been evaluated. The main aim of the study is to compare the clinical effectiveness of using NanoAg-IS-PMMA and NanoAg-I-PMMA for construction of new BOA in inhibiting the planktonic growth and bioflm formation of the cariogenic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty four patients with a median age of 12.6 years (7-15) harboring Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and Lactobacillus acidophilus as well as Lactobacillus casei participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. The experimental BOA, NanoAg-IS-BOA and NanoAg-I-BOA, contained 0.5% w/w NanoAg while the control BOA was standard PMMA. Antibacterial effect of NanoAg-IS-BOA and NanoAg-I-BOA was assessed against test cariogenic bacteria by planktonic and bioflm bacterial cells growth inhibition. RESULTS: The average levels of test cariogenic bacteria in saliva decreased about 2 to 70 fold (30.9-98.4%) compared to baseline depending on the microorganism type and test BOA. Bioflm inhibition analysis demonstrated that NanoAg-I-BOA and NanoAg-IS-BOA inhibited the bioflm of all test bacteria by 20.1 to 79.9% compared to BOA. NanoAg-IS-BOA had a strong anti-bioflm effect against S. mutans, S. sobrinus and L. casei. However, NanoAg-I-BOA showed only slight anti-bioflm effects on test bacteria. Most notably, at all period of the clinical trial, NanoAg-IS-BOA showed a higher antibacterial activity than NanoAg-I-BOA. CONCLUSION: Based on the novel data that presented here, the NanoAg-IS-BOA had strong antimicrobial activity in the planktonic phase and subsequent bioflm formation of the cariogenic bacteria. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Wearing of NanoAg-IS-BOA has the potential to minimize dental plaque formation and caries during orthodontic treatment.
TI  - A study of the fluorescence characteristics of common cariogenic microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the fluorescence characteristics of common cariogenic bacteria: Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, Prevotella intermedia, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Candida albicans. METHODS: The bacteria were cultured on brain heart infusion (BHI) agar and BHI blood agar, and bacterial colonies were collected for further amplification in liquid medium. Bacterial suspensions in physiological saline were equally divided into three parts for bacteria counting, fluorescence spectrometry detection, and fluorescence microscope examination. RESULTS: The optimal excitation wavelength of the bacteria was 350 nm; their characteristic fluorescence peak position was at 436 +/- 4 nm. There was a significant linear correlation between fluorescence intensity and bacterial concentration. The mean optical density (MOD) of S. mutans and L. acidophilus cultivated in BHI blood was significantly higher than that cultivated in BHI agar (110 +/- 10 vs. 57 +/- 20; 94 +/- 16 vs. 31 +/- 12, respectively, P < 0.05). The MOD of S. sanguis, A. viscosus, and P. intermedia cultivated in BHI blood agar was higher than that cultivated in BHI agar (37 +/- 12 vs. 36 +/- 11; 43 +/- 17 vs. 38 +/- 6; 86 +/- 21 vs. 72 +/- 8, respectively, P > 0.05); the opposite was observed for C. albicans. CONCLUSION: At 350 nm excitation wavelength, 436 +/- 4 nm is an indicator for detecting six cariogenic bacteria. The fluorescence energy, Q, is a valuable index reflecting bacterial concentration under fluorescence spectrometry detection. Exogenous fluorescence groups have greater influence on fluorescence intensity and little influence on fluorescence peak position detection.

TI  - Bacteriological evaluation of Allium sativum oil as a new medicament for pulpotomy of primary teeth.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of Allium sativum oil and formocresol on the pulp tissue of the pulpotomized teeth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty children were selected for this study. All children had a pair of non-vital primary molars. A sterile paper point was dipped in the root canals prior to the mortal pulpotomy. These paper points were collected in transfer media and immediately transported to the microbiological lab to be investigated microbiologically (for Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus). Then the procedure of mortal pulpotomy was performed. After 2 weeks, the cotton pellets were removed and sterile paper points were dipped in the root canals for microbiological examination. Then comparison between the count of bacteria before and after treatment was conducted. Statistical analysis was performed using independent t-test and paired t-test at the significance level of alpha = 0.05. RESULTS: After application of both medicaments, there was a marked decrease in S. mutans and L. acidophilus counts. The difference between the mean of log values of the count before and after the application was highly significant for both medicaments (P < 0.05); however, better results were obtained when A. sativum oil was used. CONCLUSION: A. sativum oil had more powerful antimicrobial effects than formocresol on the bacteria of the infected root canals.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of antiseptic mouthrinses on Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral antiseptics are valuable in controlling oral infections caused by cariogenic bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of mouthrinses and pure antiseptic compounds on Streptococcus mutans and non-mutans bacteria (Streptococcus sanguinis and Lactobacillus acidophilus). METHODS: The agar diffusion assay was employed to determine bacterial growth inhibition. RESULTS: Commercial mouthrinses containing chlorhexidine gluconate (0.2%), cetylpyridinium chloride (0.05%) and sodium fluoride (0.05%) produced statistically similar growth inhibition of S. mutans, S. sanguinis and L. acidophilus (with zones of inhibition ranging from 7.56 +/- 0.52 mm to 7.39 +/- 0.53 mm, 17.44 +/- 0.94 mm to 18.31 +/- 0.62 mm and 8.61 +/- 1.43 to 8.67 +/- 1.43 mm respectively, p > 0.05). The chlorhexidine mouthwash produced the greatest mean growth inhibition of S. sanguinis and S. mutans compared to all other mouthrinses tested (p < 0.01). The minimum concentrations at which inhibition against S. mutans could be detected were chlorhexidine gluconate at 0.005% (wt/vol), cetylpyridinium chloride 0.01% (wt/ vol), povidone iodine 10% (wt/vol) and sodium hypochlorite 0.5% (vol/vol). CONCLUSIONS: Chlorhexidine (0.01%), cetylpyridinium chloride (0.01%), povidone iodine (10%) and sodium hypochlorite (0.5%) are effective at inhibiting the growth of S. mutans, S. sanguinis and L. acidophilus.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of filling materials used in primary teeth pulpotomy.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of pulp capping materials used in primary teeth (formocresol [FC], zinc oxide and eugenol cement [ZOE], ZOE mixed with FC [ZOEFC], mineral trioxide aggregate [MTA] and calcium hydroxide [CH]) against cariogenic bacteria. The agar plate diffusion test was used for the cultures, including saline solution as a negative control. A base layer of 15 mL of brain heart infusion agar was inoculated with 300 mL of each inoculum. Twelve wells were made and completely filled with one of the testing materials for each bacteria strain. The plates were incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. Zones of microbial inhibition and material diffusion were measured and photographed. The results obtained were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests. Respectively, the medium zones of bacteria inhibition of FC, ZOE, ZOEFC, MTA and CH against Streptococcus mutans growth were 28.5, 15.2, 20.8, 9.3 and 11.6; against Lactobacillus acidophilus growth were 28.7, 14.8, 15.3, 15.2 and 20.0, and against Actinomyces viscosus growth were 13.6, 13.5, 14.7, 10.0 and 13.6. We might confirmed the high antibacterial activity of FC solution, especially against S. mutans and L. acidophilus, as wells as, the low inhibitory effect of MTA cement on the cariogenic bacteria studied.
TI  - Effect of Probiotic Containing Ice-cream on Salivary Mutans Streptococci (SMS) Levels in Children of 6-12 Years of Age: A Randomized Controlled Double Blind Study with Six-months Follow Up.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the caries risk based on the salivary levels of streptococcus mutans in children of 6-12 years of age group before and after consuming probiotic ice-cream containing Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A double blind, placebo controlled trial was carried out in 60 children aged between 6 to 12 years with zero decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT). They were randomly divided into two equal groups. Saliva sample were collected before the consumption of ice-cream and Streptococcus mutans count was calculated and recorded as baseline data. For the next seven days both the groups were given ice creams marked as A and B. Saliva samples were collected after ice-cream consumption at the end of study period and also after a washout period of 30 days and again after six months. Samples were inoculated and colonies were counted. RESULTS: On statistical evaluation by students paired t-test, probiotic ice-cream brought significant reduction in the Streptococcus mutans count after seven days of ice-cream ingestion (p<0.001) and also after 30 d of washout period (p<0.001). There was no significant reduction (p=0.076) by normal ice-cream consumption. After six months of the study period in both the groups the salivary levels of Streptococcus mutans was similar to the baseline. CONCLUSION: Probiotic ice-cream containing Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 can cause reduction in caries causative organism. The dosage of the probiotic organisms for the long term or synergetic effect on the oral health are still needed to be explored.
TI  - Different bacterial models for in vitro induction of non-cavitated enamel caries-like lesions: Microhardness and polarized light miscroscopy analyses.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare different bacterial models for in vitro induction of non-cavitated enamel caries-like lesions by microhardness and polarized light microscopy analyses. One hundred blocks of bovine enamel were randomly divided into four groups (n = 25) according to the bacterial model for caries induction: (A) Streptococcus mutans, (B) S. mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus, (C) S. mutans and L. casei, and (D) S. mutans, L. acidophilus, and L. casei. Within each group, the blocks were randomly divided into five subgroups according to the duration of the period of caries induction (4-20 days). The enamel blocks were immersed in cariogenic solution containing the microorganisms, which was changed every 48 h. Groups C and D presented lower surface hardness values (SMH) and higher area of hardness loss (DeltaS) after the cariogenic challenge than groups A and B (P < 0.05). As regards lesion depth, under polarized light microscopy, group A presented significantly lower values, and groups C and D the highest values. Group B showed a higher value than group A (P < 0.05). Groups A and B exhibited subsurface caries lesions after all treatment durations, while groups C and D presented erosion-type lesions with surface softening. The model using S. mutans, whether or not it was associated with L. acidophilus, was less aggressive and may be used for the induction of non-cavitated enamel caries-like lesions. The optimal period for inducing caries-like lesions was 8 days. Microsc. Res. Tech. 78:444-451, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
TI  - Development of novel formulations containing Lysozyme and Lactoferrin and evaluation of antibacterial effects on Mutans Streptococci and Lactobacilli.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial effect of different formulations containing Lysozyme and Lactoferrin and drug delivery system as well as poloxamer 407 with the trade name of Pluronic F-127 and/or freeze dried liposome containing DOTAP [freeze dried Liposomal DOTAP] on Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus in comparison with 0.2% chlorhexidine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antibacterial effect was assessed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for the study and control groups on Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus. The amounts of biofilm formation accumulation of Mutans Streptococci for 24h on sterile hydroxyapatite discs after application of different formulations were evaluated. The different formulations studied were: (1) Sorensen's Buffer Solution, (2) a gel formulation containing only poloxamer 407, (3) Lysozyme and Lactoferrin dissolved in Sorensen's Buffer Solution, (4) poloxamer 407 combined with the third formulation, (5) Freeze dried Liposomal DOTAP dissolved in Sorensen's Buffer Solution, (6) Freeze dried Liposomal DOTAP combined with poloxamer 407 dispersed in Sorensen's Buffer Solution, (7) Freeze dried Liposomal DOTAP combined with the third formulation, and (8) Lysozyme and Lactoferrin dissolved in Sorensen's Buffer Solution, which was then incorporated into poloxamer 407 and combined with Freeze dried Liposomal DOTAP. The positive and negative control groups were 0.2% chlorhexidine gel and empty hydroxyapatite discs, respectively. Statistical evaluation was carried out with Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's multiple comparison tests. RESULTS: It was observed that the first, third and fifth groups did not have any antibacterial effects on the tested bacteria. The groups that contained poloxamer 407 had nearly identical antibacterial effects on Mutans Streptococci and L. acidophilus. These formulations also inhibited biofilm formation of the bacteria (p<0.05) more effectively. In the positive control group, there was no biofilm formation. CONCLUSIONS: Among the formulations containing poloxamer 407, the one containing Lysozyme and Lactoferrin exhibited the highest inhibitory effect on the tested bacteria. This novel formulation can be beneficial as an antibacterial agent for the prevention of dental caries and biofilm formation.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of synthetic antimicrobial decapeptide against oral bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide, a novel antimicrobial peptide, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria in vitro. METHODS In this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide against Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus gordonii, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Saccharomyces albicans in vitro using the agar diffusion method and broth dilution method. Furthermore, a time-kill kinetic study of decapeptide against S. mutans was performed. RESULTS: The results showed that decapeptide exhibited antimicrobial activity against various oral bacteria and fungi. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of main cariogenic bacteria ranged from 62.5 mug . mL(-1) to 125 mug . mL(-1), and the MIC of periodontopathogenic bacteria tested ranged from 250 mug . mL(-1) to 1,000 mug . mL(-1). Among the bacteria tested, decapeptide had a strong inhibitory effect on cariogenic S. mutans. Results of the time-kill kinetic studies showed that decapeptide reduced the viable counts of S. mutans by more than one order of magnitude after 20 min of incubation, and thoroughly killed S. mutans after 30 min. No viable cells could be detected after 24 h of incubation. CONCLUSION: This study suggest that decapeptide might have potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing S. mutans within dental plaque.

TI  - Inhibitory effects of children's toothpastes on Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - AIM: As suppression of Streptococcus mutans in young children may prevent or delay colonisation of the oral cavity, toothbrushing with dentifrices containing anti-S. mutans activity may aid in preventing caries. The aims of this study were to compare the effects of children's dentifrices on the growth of S. mutans and non-mutans bacteria (Streptococcus sanguinis and Lactobacillus acidophilus). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The agar diffusion assay at neutral pH was used to examine the antibacterial activity of commercial dentifrices and their major constituents. RESULTS: Dentifrices containing 1,450 ppm fluoride produced greater growth inhibition of both S. mutans and S. sanguinis than those with <500 ppm. No inhibition was seen for pure solutions of sodium fluoride or sodium monofluorophosphate at fluoride concentrations up to 100,000 ppm. Stannous fluoride exerted antibacterial effects at concentrations above 10,000 ppm. Significant growth inhibition of both S. mutans and S. sanguinis was seen with sodium lauryl sulphate at 2,500 ppm and with triclosan at 100 ppm. No inhibitory effects were seen for xylitol, sorbitol, sodium pyrophosphate or polyethylene glycol at concentrations up to 80,000 ppm. CONCLUSION: Sodium lauryl sulphate is the major bacterial inhibitory compound in children's dentifrices.
TI  - The antibacterial and antifungal activity of essential oils extracted from Guatemalan medicinal plants.
AB  - CONTEXT: Essential oils are prevalent in many medicinal plants used for oral hygiene and treatment of diseases. OBJECTIVE: Medicinal plant species were extracted to determine the essential oil content. Those producing sufficient oil were screened for activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Candida albicans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plant samples were collected, frozen, and essential oils were extracted by steam distillation. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined using a tube dilution assay for those species yielding sufficient oil. RESULTS: Fifty-nine of the 141 plant species produced sufficient oil for collection and 12 species not previously reported to produce essential oils were identified. Essential oil extracts from 32 species exhibited activity against one or more microbes. Oils from eight species were highly inhibitory to S. mutans, four species were highly inhibitory to C. albicans, and 19 species yielded MIC values less than the reference drugs. DISCUSSION: RESULTS suggest that 11 species were highly inhibitory to the microbes tested and merit further investigation. Oils from Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume (Lauraceae), Citrus aurantiifolia (Christm.) Swingle (Rutaceae), Lippia graveolens Kunth (Verbenaceae), and Origanum vulgare L. (Lamiaceae) yielded highly significant or moderate activity against all microbes and have potential as antimicrobial agents. CONCLUSION: Teas prepared by decoction or infusion are known methods for extracting essential oils. Oils from 11 species were highly active against the microbes tested and merit investigation as to their potential for addressing health-related issues and in oral hygiene.
TI  - Effect of aqueous and alcoholic licorice (glycyrrhiza glabra) root extract against streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus in comparison to chlorhexidine: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glycyrrhiza (licorice) an herb, which has medicinal value and was used in ancient times as a remedy for a great diversity of ailments and sweetener. Roots of Glycyrrhiza contain a high concentration of saponin and glycyrrhizin, which are supposed to be sweetening agents. The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of aqueous and alcoholic licorice root extract against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus in comparison to chlorhexidine (CHX). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the first part of the study, various concentrations of aqueous and ethanolic licorice extract were prepared in the laboratory of Pharmacy College. It was then subjected to microbiological assay to determine its zone of inhibition using agar disk diffusion test and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using serial broth dilution method against S. mutans and L. acidophilus. CHX was used as a positive control. RESULTS: MIC of aqueous and ethnolic licorice root extract against S. mutans and L. acidophilus were 25% and 12.5%, respectively. Mean zone of inhibition of the aqueous and alcoholic licorice extracts against S. mutans at 48 h were 22.8 mm and 26.7 mm, respectively. Mean zone of inhibition of the aqueous and alcoholic licorice extracts against L. acidophilus at 48 h were 14.4 mm and 15.1 mm, respectively. Mean zone of inhibition of the CHX against S. mutans and L. acidophilus at 48 h was 20.5 and 13.2, respectively. CONCLUSION: The inhibitory effect shown by alcoholic licorice root extract against S. mutans and L. acidophilus was superior when compared with that of aqueous form and CHX.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus species on Streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is the primary pathogen responsible for initiating dental caries and decay. The presence of sucrose, stimulates S. mutans to produce insoluble glucans to form oral biofilm also known as dental plaque to initiate caries lesion. The GtfB and LuxS genes of S. mutans are responsible for formation and maturation of biofilm. Lactobacillus species as probiotic can reduces the count of S. mutans. In this study effect of different Lactobacillus species against the formation of S. mutans biofilm was observed. Growing biofilm in the presence of sucrose was detected using 96 well microtiter plate crystal violet assay and biofilm formation by S. mutans in the presence of Lactobacillus was detected. Gene expression of biofilm forming genes (GtfB and LuxS) was quantified through Real-time PCR. All strains of Lactobacillus potently reduced the formation of S. mutans biofilm whereas Lactobacillus acidophilus reduced the genetic expression by 60-80%. Therefore, probiotic Lactobacillus species can be used as an alternative instead of antibiotics to decrease the chance of dental caries by reducing the count of S. mutans and their gene expression to maintain good oral health.
TI  - Addition of silver nanoparticles to composite resin: effect on physical and bactericidal properties in vitro.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate physical properties and antibacterial activity of a light-activated composite modified with silver nanoparticles. Discs were produced with unmodified resin (control group - CG) and modified resin with silver nanoparticles at two concentrations, 0.3% wt (MR03) and 0.6% wt (MR06). Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus biofilms were induced in vitro by incubation of discs in a 20% sucrose medium, followed by sonication and counting of viable cells after 1, 4 and 7 days (n=9). The arithmetic roughness of all three groups was evaluated by atomic force microscopy (n=9). Compression assay was conducted in all groups to measure the compressive strength at failure and elasticity modulus (n=5). Data were subjected to ANOVA and Tukey's tests (alpha=0.05%). At all three time points the number of viable cells was statistically lower for MR03 and MR06 compared with CG, for both specimens. MR03 and MR06 showed no significant differences. Microscopic analysis demonstrated no significant differences for roughness among the three groups (p>0.05). The MR03 was stronger to compression than CG, and MR06 was statistically lower than CG and MR03. It was concluded that the MR03 were less conducive to biofilm growth, without compromising the strength in compression and surface roughness.
TI  - A novel antimicrobial orthodontic band cement with in situ-generated silver nanoparticles.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop an antimicrobial orthodontic band cement for the prevention of white spot lesions using a novel process that generates silver nanoparticles (AgNP) in situ. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven groups of AgNP-loaded Opal Band Cement (OBC) and two control groups were formulated with varying concentrations of additional benzoyl peroxide (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 wt%) and 2,2-(p-Tolylimino) diethanol (0.5 or 1 wt%). Rockwell15T hardness and near-infrared FTIR were used to assess degree of cure, three-point bending was used to determine modulus and ultimate transverse strength (UTS), and Ag(+) ion release was measured for up to 4 months in vitro using atomic absorption spectroscopy. Antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus was tested in vitro by counting colony-forming units for up to 28 days. Biocompatibility was evaluated following ISO specifications 7405 (2008), 10993-3 (2003), 10993-5 (2009), and 10993-10 (2010). RESULTS: Most of the experimental groups had hardness, modulus, and UTS values similar to those of the control group. Ag(+) ion release was observed for all AgNP-loaded groups for up to 4 months. Increase in Ag loading increased Ag(+) ion release and in vitro antimicrobial effect. The biocompatibility of the optimal AgNP-loaded OBC was comparable to that of negative controls. CONCLUSION: A novel antimicrobial orthodontic band cement was developed that has comparable mechanical properties to controls, controlled and sustained Ag(+) ion release, significant bacterial inhibition in vitro, and excellent biocompatibility.
TI  - Plasma deactivation of oral bacteria seeded on hydroxyapatite disks as tooth enamel analogue.
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the plasma treatment effects on deactivation of oral bacteria seeded on a tooth enamel analogue. METHODS: A non-thermal atmospheric pressure argon plasma brush was used to treat two different Gram-positive oral bacteria including Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) and Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans). The bacteria were seeded on hydroxyapatite (HA) disks used as tooth enamel analogue with three initial bacterial seeding concentrations: a low inoculum concentration between 2.1 x 10(8) and 2.4 x 10(8) cfu/mL, a medium inoculum concentration between 9.8x10(8) and 2.4 x 10(9) cfu/mL, and a high inoculum concentration between 1.7 x 10(10) and 3.5 x 10(10) cfu/mL. The bacterial survivability upon plasma exposure was examined in terms of plasma exposure time and oxygen addition into the plasmas. SEM was performed to examine bacterial morphological changes after plasma exposure. RESULTS: The experimental data indicated that a 13-second plasma exposure time completely killed all the bacteria when initial bacterial seeding density on HA surfaces was less than 6.9 x 10(6) cfu/cm2 for L. acidophilus and 1.7 x 10(7) cfu/cm2 for S. mutans, which resulted from low initial seeding inoculum concentration between 2.1 x 10(8) and 2.4 x 10(8) cfu/mL. Plasma exposure of the bacteria at higher initial bacterial seeding density obtained with high initial seeding inoculum concentration, however, only resulted in approximately 1.5 to 2 log reduction and approximately 2 to 2.5 log reduction for L. acidophilus and S. mutans, respectively. It was also noted that oxygen addition into the argon plasma brush did not affect the plasma deactivation effectiveness. SEM images showed that plasma deactivation mainly occurred with the top layer bacteria, while shadowing effects from the resulting bacterial debris reduced the plasma deactivation of the underlying bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of extracts from Ugandan medicinal plants used for oral  care.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Medicinal plants are widely used for treatment of oral/dental diseases in Uganda. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate antibacterial activities of 16 commonly used medicinal plants on microorganisms associated with periodontal diseases (PD) and dental caries (DC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pulp juice and solvent extracts (hexane, methanol and water) from the plants were tested against Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia associated with PD and Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus associated with DC. Tests were done using agar well-diffusion (pulp juice) and agar-dilution (Solvent extracts) assays. RESULTS: Pulp juice from Zanthoxylum chalybeum and Euclea latidens showed activity against all the bacteria, Zanthoxylum chalybeum being most active. Hexane extract from aerial part of Helichrysum odoratissimum was most active (MIC: 0.125-0.5 mg/ml). Methanol extract from leaves of Lantana trifolia showed activity against all bacteria (MIC: 0.25-1 mg/ml). CONCLUSION: Several of the tested plants showed antibacterial activities against bacteria associated with PD and DC, meriting further investigations.

RESULT: Of all the materials tested, AP showed the maximum inhibitory action against S. mutans and L. acidophilus. Aqueous solution of chlorhexidine 0.2% showed the maximum inhibitory action against A. viscosus. Very minimal antibacterial effect was noted for SB. CONCLUSION: The antibacterial effects observed for the tested different dentin bonding systems may be related to the acidic nature of the materials.
TI  - A comparative study of the effect of probiotics on cariogenic biofilm model for preventing dental caries.
AB  - Dental caries is induced by oral biofilm containing Streptococcus mutans. Probiotic bacteria were mainly studied for effect on the gastrointestinal tract and have been known to promote human health. However, the information of probiotics for oral health has been lack yet. In this study, we investigated influence of various probiotics on oral bacteria or cariogenic biofilm and evaluated candidate probiotics for dental caries among them. The antimicrobial activity of the spent culture medium of probiotics for oral streptococci was performed. Probiotics were added during the biofilm formation with salivary bacteria including S. mutans. The oral biofilms were stained with a fluorescent dye and observed using the confocal laser scanning microscope. To count bacteria in the biofilm, the bacteria were plated on MSB and BHI agar plates after disrupting the biofilm and cultivated. Glucosyltransferases (gtfs) expression of S. mutans and integration of lactobacilli into the biofilm were evaluated by real-time RT-PCR. Among probiotics, Lactobacillus species strongly inhibited growth of oral streptococci. Moreover, Lactobacillus species strongly inhibited formation of cariogenic biofilm model. The expression of gtfs was significantly reduced by Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The integration of L. rhamnosus into the biofilm model did not exhibit. However, L. acidophilus and L casei integrated into the biofilm model. These results suggest that L. rhamnosus may inhibit oral biofilm formation by decreasing glucan production of S. mutans and antibacterial activity and did not integrate into oral biofilm, which can be a candidate for caries prevention strategy.
TI  - An investigation of the effect of scaling-induced surface roughness on bacterial  adhesion in common fixed dental restorative materials.
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Bacterial plaque must be routinely removed from teeth, adjacent structures, and prostheses. However, the removal of this plaque can inadvertently increase the risk of future bacterial adhesion. PURPOSE: The purpose of this investigation was to assess the change in the surface roughness of 3 different surfaces after dental prophylactic instrumentation and how this influenced bacterial adhesion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty specimens each of Type III gold alloy, lithium disilicate, and zirconia were fabricated in the same dimensions. The specimens were divided into 4 groups: ultrasonic scaler, stainless steel curette, prophylaxis cup, and control. Pretreatment surface roughness measurements were made with a profilometer. Surface treatments in each group were performed with a custom mechanical scaler. Posttreatment surface roughness values were measured. In turn, the specimens were inoculated with Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Actinomyces viscosus. Bacterial adhesion was assessed by rinsing the specimens with sterile saline to remove unattached cells. The specimens were then placed in sterile tubes with 1 mL of sterile saline. The solution was plated and quantified. Scanning electron microscopy was performed. The statistical analysis of surface roughness was completed by using repeated-measures single-factor ANOVA with a Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: The surface roughness values for gold alloy specimens increased as a result of prophylaxis cup treatment (0.221 to 0.346 Ra) (P<.01) and stainless steel curette treatment (0.264 to 1.835 Ra) (P<.01). The results for bacterial adhesion to gold alloy proved inconclusive. A quantitative comparison indicated no statistically significant differences in pretreatment and posttreatment surface roughness values for lithium disilicate and zirconia specimens. In spite of these similarities, the overall bacterial adherence values for lithium disilicate were significantly greater than those recorded for gold alloy or zirconia (P<.05). Instrumentation of the lithium disilicate and zirconia with the stainless steel curette significantly increased bacterial adhesion compared with the control (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this investigation indicate that Type III gold alloy exhibited increased surface roughness values after stainless steel curette and prophylaxis cup treatments. Zirconia was less susceptible to bacterial adhesion than lithium disilicate, and greater bacterial adhesion was found for the stainless steel curette than the other instrumentation methods.
TI  - Molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old Tunisian children.
AB  - The occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old Tunisian children was investigated. Samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). Genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. All samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. Streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic DNA collected from carious lesions. Other prevalent species were Candida spp (63%), Streptococcus salivarius (59%) and Streptococcus oralis (42%). The frequency of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. Pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. Frequency of Porphyromonas endodontali, Actinomyces radicidentis and Treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. PCR analysis of genomic DNA detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. In addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (S. mutans, S. salivarius, L. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.
TI  - The inhibitory effect of a fermented papaya preparation on growth, hydrophobicity, and acid production of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, and Lactobacillus acidophilus: its implications in oral health improvement of diabetics.
AB  - Fermented papaya preparation (FPP) is a "natural health product." The high incidence of dental caries, gingivitis, periodontitis, and oral microbial infection cases among patients with diabetes mellitus continues to prevail. The potential role of FPP against common oral microbiota (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, and Lactobacillus acidophilus) isolated from the human oral cavity was investigated using in vitro simulation models of dental plaque and caries. FPP showed an inhibitory effect against the growth (at 0.05 mg/mL: S. mutans: -6.9%; S. mitis: -4.47%, P < 0.05), acid production (at 0.05 mg/mL: S. mutans: +6.38%; L. acidophilus: +2.25%), and hydrophobicity (at 50 mg/mL: S. mutans: 1.01%, P < 0.01; S. mitis: 7.66%, P < 0.05) of tested microbiota. The results of this study suggest that low doses of FPP may be a suitable complement to good oral hygiene practice for the effective prevention of dental caries, plaque, and gingivitis. The functional application of FPP as a constituent of a balanced diet and active lifestyle can make a positive contribution to the oral health status and well-being of patients with diabetes.
TI  - Intensity and duration of in-vitro antibacterial activity of different adhesives  used in orthodontics.
AB  - This work investigated the antibacterial activity of 14 bonding agents to predict their ability to inhibit white-spot development during orthodontic treatment. Standardized, sterilized disks of each material were continuously rinsed (for up to 180 d) in a flow of sterile saline. At predetermined time points, the residual ability of each material to inhibit bacterial growth (determined by measuring the size of inhibition halos around disks placed onto appropriate culture media seeded with Streptococcus gordonii DSM6777, Streptococcus sanguinis DSM20567, Streptococcus mutans DSM20523, or Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM20079) and biofilm formation (determined by measuring the numbers of bacteria adherent to disks following incubation in appropriate broths) was tested in triplicate and compared with the baseline activities of freshly prepared materials. Overall antibacterial and anti-biofilm activities, adjusted for exposure time and strain of bacteria, were assessed. The decrease of antibacterial activity was faster (30-60 d) and complete for fluoride-enriched materials, but slower (90 d) and partial for antimicrobial-containing materials (benzalkonium chloride, zinc oxide, chlorexidine, or MDPB). Materials enriched with benzalkonium chloride, chlorexidine, or MDPB showed the highest antibacterial activities. Anti-biofilm assays yielded similar results. These data could be helpful for clinicians in the choice of the best performing bonding agent also in light of duration of the clinical application.
TI  - Systematic screening of plant extracts from the Brazilian Pantanal with antimicrobial activity against bacteria with cariogenic relevance.
AB  - This study proposes a bioprospection methodology regarding the antimicrobial potential of plant extracts against bacteria with cariogenic relevance. Sixty extracts were obtained from ten plants--(1) Jatropha weddelliana, (2) Attalea phalerata, (3) Buchenavia tomentosa, (4) Croton doctoris, (5) Mouriri elliptica, (6) Mascagnia benthamiana, (7) Senna aculeata, (8) Unonopsis guatterioides, (9) Allagoptera leucocalyx and (10) Bactris glaucescens--using different extraction methods - (A) 70 degrees ethanol 72 h/25 degrees C, (B) water 5 min/100 degrees C, (C) water 1 h/55 degrees C, (D) water 72 h/25 degrees C, (E) hexane 72 h/25 degrees C and (F) 90 degrees ethanol 72 h/25 degrees C. The plants were screened for antibacterial activity at 50 mg/ml using the agar well diffusion test against Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC 19039, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, Streptococcus gordonii ATCC 10558, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35688, Streptococcus sanguinis ATCC 10556, Streptococcus sobrinus ATCC 33478 and Streptococcus mitis ATCC 9811. The active extracts were tested to determine their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), cytotoxicity and chemical characterization. Forty-seven extracts (78%) were active against at least one microorganism. Extract 4A demonstrated the lowest MIC and MBC for all microorganisms except S. gordonii and the extract at MIC concentration was non-cytotoxic. The concentrated extracts were slightly cytotoxic. Electrospray ionization with tandem mass spectrometry analyses demonstrated that the extract constituents coincided with the mass of the terpenoids and phenolics. Overall, the best results were obtained for extraction methods A, B and C. The present work proved the antimicrobial activity of several plants. Particularly, extracts from C. doctoris were the most active against bacteria involved in dental caries disease.
TI  - Dental caries and vaccination strategy against the major cariogenic pathogen, Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Although dental caries is a global problem in modern times, no vaccines are available for preventing these diseases. Among the bacterial pathogens that cause dental caries, including Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Actinomyces viscosus, S. mutans is the most prominent and prevalent species. During the past, much effort has been focused on developing vaccines against S. mutans. Early attempts used fixed whole cells of S. mutans, but later it was found that serological cross-reactivity between heart tissue antigens and Streptococcus antigens occurs in patients resulting in rheumatic fever. Recently, with the aid of molecular biology, the genome sequences of S. mutans strains are available, which can greatly accelerate the development of subunit vaccines. Many desirable candidate subunit vaccines have been or are going to be evaluated in either experimental animal models or in human clinical trials. In this review article, we summarized the updated progress made in deciphering the mechanisms of disease development and the achievements of vaccine research against S. mutans.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fractions and subfractions of Elaeagia utilis against microorganisms of importance in dental caries.
AB  - Dental caries is a multifactorial infectious disease that leads to the destruction of dental hard tissue. The main goal of research into medicinal plants is to seek compounds with antimicrobial activity for subsequent use in prevention strategies and control of infectious diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of fractions and subfractions obtained from Elaeagia utilis against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and Lactobacillus acidophilus. The plant material was collected in the town of Alban (Cundinamarca, Colombia), which is located at an altitude of 2245 meters above sea level. Two extracts were obtained by cold maceration of E. utilis leaves in (a) petroleum ether extract and (b) ethanol extract. Fractions were obtained from the petroleum ether extract by column vacuum chromatography, and from the ethanol extract by continuous liquid/liquid partitioning. The antimicrobial activity of fractions and subfractions was evaluated by the well diffusion method. At a concentration of 10 mg/well, several fractions from both extracts showed antimicrobial activity against S. mutans, S. sobrinus and L. acidophilus. Among the ethanol extract fractions, the dichloromethane fraction had notably greater antimicrobial activity. It was sub-partitioned, yielding three subfractions with inhibitory activity, of which the most active was MeOH: H2O (Bp) with minimum inhibitory concentration 0.1 mg/well on the 3 study bacteria. Terpenes, sesquiterpenlactones and simple phenolic compounds were identified in it. In conclusion, this study shows the antimicrobial potential of fractions and subfractions obtained from extracts of E. utilis leaves against bacteria that are important in dental caries.
TI  - Adhesion forces and composition of planktonic and adhering oral microbiomes.
AB  - The oral microbiome consists of a planktonic microbiome residing in saliva and an adhering microbiome (the biofilm adhering to oral hard and soft tissues). Here we hypothesized that possible differences in microbial composition of the planktonic and adhering oral microbiome on teeth can be related to the forces by which different bacterial species are attracted to the tooth surface. The relative presence of 7 oral bacterial species in saliva and biofilm collected from 10 healthy human volunteers was determined twice in each volunteer by denaturing-gradient-gel electrophoresis. Analysis of both microbiomes showed complete separation of the planktonic from the adhering oral microbiome. Next, adhesion forces of corresponding bacterial strains with saliva-coated enamel surfaces were measured by atomic force microscopy. Species that were found predominantly in the adhering microbiome had significantly higher adhesion forces to saliva-coated enamel (-0.60 to -1.05 nN) than did species mostly present in the planktonic microbiome (-0.40 to -0.55 nN). It is concluded that differences in composition of the planktonic and the adhering oral microbiome are due to small differences in the forces by which strains adhere to saliva-coated enamel, providing an important step in understanding site- and material-specific differences in the composition of biofilms in the oral cavity.
TI  - Anti cariogenic efficacy of herbal and conventional tooth pastes - a comparative  in-vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An upsurge of herbal products in various catalogues of fast moving consumer goods is evident. Dental creams or pastes which have numerous brands since years, have addition of many more herbal tooth pastes. Main claim of these herbal tooth pastes being effective reduction in cavities and plaque control. Proven fact is that proper brushing with a tooth brush and tooth paste brings down the caries incidence, and there is a substantial amount of contribution made by indispensable ingredient i.e, tooth pastes and their antibacterial component. AIM: To evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of various herbal tooth pastes available in the market and compare it with a conventional tooth paste with known antibacterial effect. MATERIALS & METHODS: The antibacterial efficacy of five herbal tooth pastes and two conventional tooth pastes with different ingredients was evaluated by the zone of inhibition created around the disc on the culture plates against streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus. RESULTS: The herbal tooth pastes showed similar efficacy as that of the conventional tooth pastes. One herbal tooth paste with multiple herbal ingredients had greater zone of inhibition compared to the conventional tooth pastes and other herbal tooth pastes. CONCLUSION: Herbal tooth pastes have similar antibacterial effect as conventional tooth pastes. Tooth paste with multiple herbal ingredients is more efficient than the tooth pastes with fewer herbal ingredients in an anticariogenic property. Key words: Anti-carcinogenicity, Herbal tooth pastes, Plaque Control. How to cite this article: Mohan Kumar K P, Priya N K, Madhushankari G S.

TI  - Comparative evaluation of the antibacterial effects of four dentine bonding systems: An in vitro study.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate and the compare antibacterial efficacy of four dentin bonding system against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius and Lactobacillus acidophilus over a period of three months using agar disk diffusion test. METHODOLOGY: All the three standard bacterial strains were inoculated into BHI broth and incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. A 100 mul of broth suspension containing aliquots of S. mutans, S. salivarius and L. acidophilus were spread onto M-H agar medium using sterile cotton swabs. The experimental groups were as follows: GROUP A: Test conducted for evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy against S. mutans MTCC 497, GROUP B: Test conducted for evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy against S. salivarius MTCC 1938, and GROUP C: Test conducted for evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy against L. acidophilus MTCC 447. For sample preparation, 20 mul bonding agent was dropped with micropipettes on paper disks, and blown dry for 10 seconds. Then it was light-cured at 2 mm for 20 sec using a QTH visible light curing unit. For first reading, the sample disks were placed over the freshly inoculated agar plates and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. The rest of the paper disks were stored in dark, submerged in distilled water at 37 degrees C. They were placed on freshly inoculated spread plates after specific time intervals- 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months after ageing in PBS. After incubation, the diameters of zones of inhibition around the plates were measured. The experiment was performed twice in triplicate. The data was then statistically analysed using Two way ANOVA test and post hoc. RESULTS: Results showed that Xeno III had the maximum antibacterial efficacy over a period of three months, followed by XP bond. This antibacterial activity was maximum against Streptococcus mutans, followed by Lactobacillus acidophilus and least against Streptococcus salivarius. Adper Easy One and G bond had minimal effect against the test bacteria during the test period. CONCLUSION: The antibacterial effect decreased over a period of three months for all the dentin bonding systems.
TI  - Comparing the efficacy of hyper-pure chlorine-dioxide with other oral antiseptics on oral pathogen microorganisms and biofilm in vitro.
AB  - This study examines the antibacterial properties of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl),  chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX), Listerine(R), and high purity chlorine dioxide (Solumium, ClO2) on selected common oral pathogen microorganisms and on dental biofilm in vitro. Antimicrobial activity of oral antiseptics was compared to the gold standard phenol. We investigated Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Veillonella alcalescens, Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Candida albicans as some important representatives of the oral pathogens. Furthermore, we collected dental plaque from the upper first molars of healthy young students. Massive biofilm was formed in vitro and its reduction was measured after treating it with mouthrinses: CHX, Listerine(R) or hyper pure ClO2. Their biofilm disrupting effect was measured after dissolving the crystal violet stain from biofilm by photometer. The results have showed that hyper pure ClO2 solution is more effective than other currently used disinfectants in case of aerobic bacteria and Candida yeast. In case of anaerobes its efficiency is similar to CHX solution. The biofilm dissolving effect of hyper pure ClO2 is significantly stronger compared to CHX and Listerine(R) after 5 min treatment. In conclusion, hyper pure ClO2 has a potent disinfectant efficacy on oral pathogenic microorganisms and a powerful biofilm dissolving effect compared to the current antiseptics, therefore high purity ClO2 may be a new promising preventive and therapeutic adjuvant in home oral care and in dental or oral surgery practice.
TI  - Antimicrobial Effect of Jasminum grandiflorum L. and Hibiscus rosa-sinensis L. Extracts Against Pathogenic Oral Microorganisms - An In Vitro Comparative Study.
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess and compare the antimicrobial potential and determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Jasminum grandiflorum and Hibiscus rosa-sinensis extracts as potential anti-pathogenic agents in dental caries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aqueous and ethanol (cold and hot) extracts prepared from leaves of Jasminum grandiflorum and Hibiscus rosa-sinensis were screened for in vitro antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus using the agar well diffusion method. The lowest concentration of every extract considered as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined for both test organisms. Statistical analysis was performed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: At lower concentrations, hot ethanol Jasminum grandiflorum (10 mug/ml) and Hibiscus rosa-sinensis (25 mug/ml) extracts were found to have statistically significant (P </= 0.05) antimicrobial activity against S. mutans and L. acidophilus with MIC values of 6.25 mug/ml and 25 mug/ml, respectively. A proportional increase in their antimicrobial activity (zone of inhibition) was observed. CONCLUSION: Both extracts were found to be antimicrobially active and contain compounds with therapeutic potential. Nevertheless, clinical trials on the effect of these plants are essential before advocating large-scale therapy.
TI  - Simultaneous improvement of specificity and affinity of aptamers against Streptococcus mutans by in silico maturation for biosensor development.
AB  - In silico evolution with an in vitro system can facilitate the development of functional aptamers with high specificity and affinity. Although a general technique known as systematic evolution of ligand by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is an efficient method for aptamer selection, it sometimes fails to identify aptamers with sufficient binding properties. We have previously developed in silico maturation (ISM) to improve functions of aptamers based on genetic algorithms. ISM represents an intelligent exploitation of a random search within a defined sequence space to optimize aptamer sequences and improve their function of interest. Here we demonstrated a successful application of ISM of aptamers to simultaneously improve specificity and affinity for Streptococcus mutans with discovery of a core sequence, which was required to form a polymerized guanine quadruplex structure for target binding. We applied ISM to aptamers selected by whole-cell SELEX and identified an aptamer with up to 16-fold improvement in affinity compared to its parent aptamers, and specificity was increased to show 12-fold more binding to S. mutans than to Lactobacillus acidophilus. Furthermore, we demonstrated a specific flow-through detection of S. mutans at a concentration range of 1 x 10(5) -10(8) CFU/mL using the evolved aptamer immobilized on gold colloids.
TI  - Analysis of cariogenic bacteria in saliva of cancer patients.
AB  - This study examined salivary flow and salivary pH and the prevalence and levels of cariogenic bacteria in the saliva of oncological patients and healthy controls. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to assess the levels of microbes including Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Lactobacillus acidophilus in the saliva of 41 patients with a solid tumor (SO), 30 patients with a hematologic malignancy (HE), and 40 healthy controls. Salivary flow and pH were lower in oncological patients than in controls. The frequencies of all four cariogenic bacteria were highest in the SO group. S. mutans and L. salivarius were the most commonly detected in all three study groups. Mean numbers of S. sobrinus and L. salivarius in the SO group were significantly higher than in controls (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between patients and controls with respect to mean numbers of S. mutans and L. acidophilus in saliva. However, the proportions of S. mutans, S. sobrinus, and L. salivarius versus total bacteria in the SO group were significantly higher than in controls. Within patients, both mean numbers and the proportions of S. mutans and S. sobrinus were significantly different (p<0.05). In summary, significant differences were found in salivary pH values and the levels of S. mutans, S. sobrinus, and L. salivarius between SO patients and healthy controls.
TI  - An in vitro study on the secondary caries-prevention properties of three restorative materials.
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Secondary caries is considered to be the most important and common reason for the replacement of all types of restorations. PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate in vitro both the anticaries efficacy and marginal integrity of amalgam, glass ionomer cement, and composite resin restorations in a cariogenic condition. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Class II cavities were prepared on 60 extracted teeth, which were assigned to 3 groups and restored either with amalgam, glass ionomer, or composite resin. After thermal cycling and sterilization, the teeth were set in an artificial carious environment for 10 days. The bacteria from the margin of the restorations were then collected, and microleakage was evaluated by means of dyeing. According to the locations, the demineralization of tooth tissue around the restoration was divided into 3 parts: artificial outer lesion, artificial enamel wall lesion, and artificial dentin wall lesion. The depths of the artificial outer lesion and the areas of the artificial enamel and dentin wall lesions were investigated with a confocal laser scanning microscope after all the specimens had been stained with 0.1 mM Rhodamine B. Statistical analyses consisted of 1-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests (alpha=.05). RESULTS: No significant difference was noted in terms of the number of bacteria around the restorations for the 3 materials; the microleakage of amalgam was the least among the 3 types of restorations; the outer enamel lesion depth around the glass ionomer cement was the lowest, and the wall lesion area around the amalgam was the smallest. CONCLUSIONS: No definite inhibitory effect of fluoride releasing restorative materials (glass ionomer) was apparent on Lactobacillus acidophilus in this study. The amalgam restorations showed the best marginal integrity and the smallest artificial wall lesion among the 3 types of restorations.
TI  - Anticariogenic and phytochemical evaluation of Eucalyptus globules Labill.
AB  - In the present study, in vitro anticariogenic potential of ethyl acetate, hexane  and methanol and aqueous extracts of plant leaves of Eucalyptus globules Labill. were evaluated by using four cariogenic bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans. Agar well diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were used for this purpose. The ethyl acetate extracted fraction of plant leaves showed good inhibitory effects against all selected bacteria. In Eucalyptus globules, hexane and ethyl acetate extracts found highly effective against, Lactobacillus acidophilus with MIC value of 0.031 and 0.062 mg/mL, respectively. Qualitative phytochemical investigation of above extracts showed the presence of alkaloids, phenolic compounds, steroids, cardiac glycosides and terpenes. Based on the MIC value and bioautography, ethyl acetate of plant leaf was selected for further study. Further investigation on the structure elucidation of the bioactive compound using IR, GC-MS and NMR techniques revealed the presence of alpha-farnesene, a sesquiterpene. Eucalyptus globules plant leaf extracts have great potential as anticariogenic agents that may be useful in the treatment of oral disease.
TI  - Effects of 2 bracket and ligation types on plaque retention: a quantitative microbiologic analysis with real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of self-ligating  brackets and conventional brackets ligated with stainless steel ligatures on dental plaque retention and microbial flora. METHODS: Twenty boys (mean age, 14.2 +/- 1.5 years) underwent bonding with self-ligating bracket systems and conventional standard edgewise bracket systems ligated with stainless steel ligatures with a split-mouth design. Clinical measurements, including plaque index, probing pocket depth, and bleeding on probing, were obtained before bonding, 1 week after bonding, and 3 months after bonding. Supragingival plaque samples were obtained at baseline and 3 months after bonding for the detection of bacteria. A quantitative analysis for Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The Mann-Whitney U test and the Hotelling T(2) multivariate test were used for statistical comparisons of the groups. RESULTS: The numbers of S mutans, S sobrinus, L casei, and L acidophilus were not statistically different between self-ligating brackets and conventional brackets ligated with stainless steel ligatures (P >0.05). The 2 archwire ligation techniques showed no statistically significant differences in plaque index, bleeding on probing, and probing pocket depth values of the bonded teeth (P >0.05). All clinical parameters and the numbers of all microorganisms showed statistically significant increases from baseline to 3 months after bonding in both groups (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Self-ligating brackets and conventional brackets ligated with stainless steel ligatures do not differ with regard to dental plaque retention.
TI  - Lab-Test((R)) 4: Dental caries and bacteriological analysis.
AB  - Dental caries is one of the most common infectious ultifactorial diseases worldwide, characterized by the progressive demineralization of the tooth, following the action of bacterial acid metabolism. The main factors predisposing the onset of the carious process are: 1) the presence of bacterial species able to lower the pH until critical values of 5.5, 2) the absence of adequate oral hygiene, 3) an inefficient immune response anti-caries, 4) the type of alimentary diet and 5) the structure of the teeth. Among the 200 bacterial species isolated from dental plaque the most pathogenic for dental caries are: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Actinomices viscusus and Bifidobacterium dentium. Our laboratory (LAB((R)) s.r.l., Codigoro, Ferrara, Italy) has developed a test for absolute and relative quantification of the most common oral cariogenic bacteria. The test uses specific primers and probes for the amplification of bacteria genome sequences in Polymerase Chain Reaction Real Time. The results provide a profile of patient infection, helpful for improving the diagnosis and planning of preventive treatment to reduce the bacterial load.
TI  - Photodynamic antimicrobial therapy of curcumin in biofilms and carious dentine.
AB  - Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a technique that involves the activation of photosensitizers by light in the presence of oxygen, resulting in the production of reactive radicals that are capable of inducing cell death. The present study evaluated the susceptibility of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus to PDT grown as multi-species in the biofilm phase versus in dentine carious lesions. A brain-heart infusion culture medium supplemented with 1% glucose, 2% sucrose, and 1% young primary culture of L. acidophilus 10(8) CFU/mL and S. mutans 10(8) CFU/mL was used to develop multi-species biofilms and to induce caries on human dentine slabs. Five different concentrations of curcumin (0.75, 1.5, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 g/L) were used associated with 5.7 J/cm(2) light emission diode. Four different groups were analyzed L-D- (control group), L-D+ (drug group), L+D- (light group), and L+D+ (PDT group). ANOVA/Tukey's tests were conducted to compare groups. A significant reduction (p <0.05) in cell viability was observed in the biofilm phase following photosensitization with all curcumin concentrations tested. To achieve significant bacterial reduction (p <0.05) in carious dentine, it was necessary to utilize 5.0 g/L of curcumin in association with blue light. No significant reduction was found for L-D+, supporting the absence of the drug's dark toxicity. S. mutans and L. acidophilus were susceptible to curcumin in the presence of blue light. However, due to light penetration and drug diffusion difficulties, these microorganisms within dentine carious lesions were less affected than they were in the biofilm phase.
TI  - Caries arresting effect of silver diamine fluoride on dentine carious lesion with S. mutans and L. acidophilus dual-species cariogenic biofilm.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This in vitro study investigated the effects of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) on dentine carious lesion with cariogenic biofilm. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty human dentine blocks were inoculated with Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus dual-species biofilm to create carious lesion. They were equally divided into test and control group to receive topical application of SDF and water. After incubation anaerobically using micro-well plate at 37oC for 7 days, the biofilms were evaluated for kinetics, morphology and viability by colony forming units (CFU), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and confocal microscopy (CLSM), respectively. The carious lesion underwent crystal characteristics analysis, evaluation of the changes in chemical structure and density of collagen fibrils using x-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and immune-labeling. RESULTS: The log CFU of S. mutans and L. acidophilus in the test group was significantly lower than control group. SEM and CLSM showed confluent biofilm in control group, but not in test group. XRD showed the loss of crystallinity of dentine due to the dissolution of hydroxyapatite crystal structure in test group was less than control group. FTIR showed that log [Amide I: HPO42-] for test vs. control group was 0.31+/-0.10 vs. 0.57+/-0.13 (p<0.05). The gold-labeling density in test vs. control group was 8.54+/-2.44/microm2 vs. 12.91+/-4.24/microm2 (p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: SDF had antimicrobial activity against the cariogenic biofilms and reduced demineralization of dentine.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of four chewing sticks commonly used in South India: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The use of chewing sticks has been well documented since ancient times in India. Chewing sticks are a good alternative to the toothbrush for maintaining oral hygiene. The present study was designed and conducted to compare and evaluate the antimicrobial effects of the aqueous extracts of neem, miswak, mango, and banyan chewing sticks against two bacterial species considered the most important in the initiation and progression of dental caries, namely Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus, respectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twigs of the above mentioned chewing sticks were sun dried and powdered, and sterile aqueous solutions of 10%, 25% and 50% concentrations were prepared. Culture plates for S mutans and L acidophilus were prepared and the growth was transferred to nutrient agar and Mueller-Hinton agar; antimicrobial activity of the extracts was tested after 72 h, using the disc diffusion method. Normal saline was used as control. RESULTS: The antimicrobial activity of neem, miswak, and mango extracts increased as their concentrations increased. Both banyan extract and saline showed no antimicrobial activity against the organisms tested. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Based on the zones of inhibition, aqueous extracts of neem showed the most antimicrobial activity against S mutans, while miswak extracts showed superior antimicrobial activity against L acidophilus. We recommend further phytochemical and pharmacological studies to discover newer nonsynthetic tooth pastes and mouthwashes.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of prophylactic ozone treatment on patients with fixed orthodontic appliances.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the efficacy of ozone on microflora of patients with fixed orthodontic appliances. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten subjects undergoing fixed appliance therapy were enrolled in the study. Before any application, two elastic ligatures were removed with the aid of a sterile probe from the premolar brackets on the upper right and lower left jaws for baseline bacteriological counts. Then ozone gas was applied for 180 s by running the device on prophylaxis mode with included mouth tray according to the manufacturer's recommendations on all brackets. After the ozone application, two other elastic ligatures were removed from the opposite sides of the mouth of the patients. One week after the application two more elastic samples, which were not changed in the previous session, were collected from the upper right and lower left premolar brackets. The elastic ligatures were immersed in transfer solutions and cultured to determine the Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Statistical analysis of the data was obtained by paired Student's t-tests. RESULTS: The ozone treatment reduced the S. mutans and L. acidophilus immediately after the application and these reductions were found to be statistically significant (p = 0.038 and p = 0.020). Both the S. mutans and L. acidophilus values increased by the 1-week period and the S. mutans values were significantly higher than the baseline values (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that the ozone treatment may have an instantaneous lethal effect on S. mutans and L. acidophilus; however, within the limitations of this study, a long-term preventive effect could not be observed.
TI  - Preparation of an orthodontic bracket coated with an nitrogen-doped TiO(2-x)N(y)  thin film and examination of its antimicrobial performance.
AB  - A bracket coated with a nitrogen-doped (N-doped) TiO(2-x)N(y) thin film was prepared using the RF magnetron sputtering method. The physicochemical properties of the thin film were measured using X-ray diffraction and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, while the antimicrobial activity of the bracket against common oral pathogenic microbes was assessed on the basis of colony counts. The rate of antimicrobial activity of the bracket coated with nano-TiO(2-x)N(y) thin film against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Actinomyces viscous, and Candida albicans was 95.19%, 91.00%, 69.44%, and 98.86%, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy showed that fewer microbes adhered to the surface of this newly designed bracket than to the surface of the normal edgewise bracket. The brackets coated with the N-doped TiO(2-x)N(y) thin film showed high antimicrobial and bacterial adhesive properties against normal oral pathogenic bacterial through visible light, which is effective in prevention of enamel demineralization and gingivitis in orthodontic patients.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of silver diamine fluoride on multi-species cariogenic biofilm on caries.
AB  - BACKGROUNDS: Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) has clinical success in arresting dentin caries, this study aimed to investigate its mechanism of action. METHODS: Using a computer-controlled artificial mouth, we studied the effect of 38% SDF on cariogenic biofilms and dentin carious lesions. We used five common cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Actinomyces naeslundii) to form a cariogenic biofilm that generated carious lesions with a depth of approximately 70 um on human dentin blocks. We applied 38% SDF to the lesions in the test group and water to those in the control group. The blocks were incubated in the artificial mouth for 21 days before evaluation. Microbial kinetics, architecture, viability and distribution were evaluated every 7 days using colony forming unit (CFU), scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The physical properties of the carious lesions were evaluated with microhardness testing, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR). RESULTS: The CFU results revealed fewer colony forming units in the test group compared with the control group (p < 0.01). Scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy showed less bacterial growth in the test group, and confluent cariogenic biofilm in the control group (p < 0.01). The microhardness and weight percentages of calcium and phosphorus in the test group from the outermost 50mum were higher than in the control group (p < 0.05). EDS showed that calcium and phosphous were higher in outer 50 mum in test groups than in the control FTIR revealed less exposed collagen I in the test lesions compared with the control group (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: 38% SDF inhibits multi-species cariogenic biofilm formation on dentin carious lesions and reduces the demineralization process.
TI  - In-vitro activity of saponins of bauhinia purpurea, madhuca longifolia, celastrus paniculatus and semecarpus anacardium on selected oral pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dental caries, periodontitis and other mucosal diseases are caused by  a complex community of microorganisms. This study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial properties of saponins of four important oil yielding medicinal plant extracts on selected oral pathogens that are involved in such diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Saponins were extracted from Bauhinia purpurea, Madhuca longifolia, Celastrus paniculatus and Semecarpus anacardium and purified. Antimicrobial properties of these saponins against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus aureus and Lactobacillus acidophilus were determined using well diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined as the lowest concentration of saponins inhibiting bacterial growth after 14 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. The bactericidal activity was evaluated using the viable cell count method. RESULTS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of Madhuca longifolia saponin on Streptococcus mutans MTCC 890, Streptococcus mitis and Staphylococcus aureus was 18.3 +/- 0.15/34.4 +/- 0.24 mug/ml, 19.0 +/- 0.05/32.2 +/- 0.0 mug/ml and 21.2 +/- 0.35/39.0 +/- 0.30 mug/ml, respectively and Bauhinia purpurea saponin on Streptococcus mutans MTCC 890, Staphylococcus aureus and Lactobacillus acidophilus was 26.4 +/- 0.20/43.0 +/- 0.40 mug/ml, 29.0 +/- 0.30/39.6 +/- 0.12 mug/ml and 20.2 +/- 0.05/36.8 +/- 0.23 mug/ml, respectively. CONCLUSION: The strong antimicrobial activity of Madhuca longifolia and Bauhinia purpurea may be due to the presence of complex triterpenoid saponins, oleanane type triterpenoid glycosides or atypical pentacyclic triterpenoid saponin. Hence, these extracted saponins may be used in food and oral products to prevent and control oral diseases.
TI  - Assessment of the effect of probiotic curd consumption on salivary pH and streptococcus mutans counts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial methods of controlling dental caries that include probiotic agents can play a valuable role in establishing caries control in children at moderate to high risk for developing dental caries. Several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of use of various Probiotic products including curd. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of short-term consumption of probiotic curd containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and normal curd on salivary Streptococcus Mutans counts, as well as salivary pH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty, caries-free, 10-12 years old children were selected and randomly allocated to two groups. Test Group consisted of 20 children who consumed 200ml of probiotic curd daily for 30 days. Control Group consisted of 20 children who were given 200ml of regular curd for 30 days. Salivary pH and salivary Streptococcus Mutans counts were recorded at baseline and after 30 days and statistically compared using the Student's t-test. RESULTS: Consumption of probiotic curd resulted in a statistically significant reduction in S. Mutans colony counts (P<0.001) as compared to regular curd. However, there was a slight reduction in pH (P>0.05) in both the groups. CONCLUSION: Short-term consumption of probiotic curds can reduce oral S. Mutans counts. However, this caused a slight reduction in salivary pH.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly Irish subjects.
AB  - AIMS: To isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: Screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects, using the indicator organisms Lactobacillus bulgaricus LMG 6901 and Listeria innocua DPC 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. Genomic fingerprinting following ApaI digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. The antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. The predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus and Enterococcus spp. A number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including ABP-118 and salivaricin B (from Lact. salivarius), enterocin B (Enterococcus faecium), lactacin B (Lact. acidophilus), gassericin T and a variant of gassericin A (Lact. gasseri), were identified. Interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: Lactococcus lactis producing nisin Z and Streptococcus mutans producing mutacin II. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results presented are important due to growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo investigation of the biological and mechanical behaviour of  resin-modified glass-ionomer cement containing chlorhexidine.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate: (1) the in vitro antibacterial, cytotoxic and mechanical properties of a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RMGIC) containing different concentrations of chlorhexidine (CHX) and (2) the in vivo microbiologic action of the best concentration of CHX associated with the RMGIC applied on remaining dentine after indirect pulp treatment (IPT). METHODS: For the in vitro studies, RMGIC was associated with 0.2, 0.5, 1.25 and 2.5% CHX. Microbiologic evaluation consisted of an agar diffusion test on cariogenic bacteria for 24h. Odontoblast-like cell metabolism and morphology analyses measured the cytotoxic effects of the RMGIC groups after 24h. The same groups were submitted to compressive and diametral tensile strength. The in vivo treatment consisted of IPT using an RMGIC associated with the best CHX concentration. Clinical and microbiologic evaluations were performed before and after 3 months. RESULTS: The use of 1.25% CHX significantly improved the antibacterial effects of the evaluated RMGIC, without causing any detrimental effects to the odontoblast-like cells and on the mechanical properties. This RMGIC and CHX combination completely eliminated mutans streptococci after 3 months of IPT. CONCLUSION: The RMGIC and 1.25% CHX mixture showed great biological and mechanical behaviour and could be a good treatment against caries progression. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The association of CHX with a liner RMGIC opens a new perspective for arresting residual caries after IPT.
TI  - Photodynamic effects of curcumin against cariogenic pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND DATA: The presence of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus in dental structure is an indicator of a cariogenic biofilm. Photodynamic therapy is a technique that involves the activation of photosensitizers by light in the presence of oxygen, resulting in the production of reactive radicals capable of inducing cell death. Reduction of bacteria levels can provide additional means of preventing dental caries. OBJECTIVE: The present study evaluated the susceptibility of planktonic cultures of S. mutans (ATCC 25175) and L. acidophilus (ATCC-IAL-523) from the Adolfo Lutz Institute (IAL) to photodynamic therapy after sensitization with curcumin and exposure to blue light at 450 nm. METHODS: Bacterial suspensions of S. mutans and L. acidophilus isolated (as single species) and combined (multspecies) were prepared and then evaluated. Four different groups were analyzed: L-D- (control group), L-D+ (drug group), L+D- (light group), and L+D+ (photodynamic therapy group). Two different concentrations of curcumin were tested (0.75 and 1.5 g/L) associated with a 5.7 J/cm(2) light emission diode. RESULTS: Significant decreases (p<0.05) in the viability of S. mutans were only observed when the bacterial suspensions were exposed to both curcumin and light. Then, reductions in viability of up to 99.99% were observed when using 1.5 g/L of the photosensitizer. The susceptibility of L. acidophilus was considerably lower (21% and 37.6%) for both curcumin concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Photodynamic therapy was found to be effective in reducing S. mutans and L. acidophilus on planktonic cultures. No significant reduction was found for L-D+, proving the absence of dark toxicity of the drug.
TI  - Enzymology and structure of the GH13_31 glucan 1,6-alpha-glucosidase that confers isomaltooligosaccharide utilization in the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM.
AB  - Isomaltooligosaccharides (IMO) have been suggested as promising prebiotics that stimulate the growth of probiotic bacteria. Genomes of probiotic lactobacilli from the acidophilus group, as represented by Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, encode alpha-1,6 glucosidases of the family GH13_31 (glycoside hydrolase family 13 subfamily 31) that confer degradation of IMO. These genes reside frequently within maltooligosaccharide utilization operons, which include an ATP-binding cassette transporter and alpha-glucan active enzymes, e.g., maltogenic amylases and maltose phosphorylases, and they also occur separated from any carbohydrate transport or catabolism genes on the genomes of some acidophilus complex members, as in L. acidophilus NCFM. Besides the isolated locus encoding a GH13_31 enzyme, the ABC transporter and another GH13 in the maltooligosaccharide operon were induced in response to IMO or maltotetraose, as determined by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) transcriptional analysis, suggesting coregulation of alpha-1,6- and alpha-1,4-glucooligosaccharide utilization loci in L. acidophilus NCFM. The L. acidophilus NCFM GH13_31 (LaGH13_31) was produced recombinantly and shown to be a glucan 1,6-alpha-glucosidase active on IMO and dextran and product-inhibited by glucose. The catalytic efficiency of LaGH13_31 on dextran and the dextran/panose (trisaccharide) efficiency ratio were the highest reported for this class of enzymes, suggesting higher affinity at distal substrate binding sites. The crystal structure of LaGH13_31 was determined to a resolution of 2.05 A and revealed additional substrate contacts at the +2 subsite in LaGH13_31 compared to the GH13_31 from Streptococcus mutans (SmGH13_31), providing a possible structural rationale to the relatively high affinity for dextran. A comprehensive phylogenetic and activity motif analysis mapped IMO utilization enzymes from gut microbiota to rationalize preferential utilization of IMO by gut residents.
TI  - Antibacterial and phytochemical studies on Calotropis gigantia (L.) R. Br. latex  against selected cariogenic bacteria.
AB  - In vitro antibacterial potential of the chloroform, ethyl acetate, hexane, methanol and aqueous extracts of Calotropis gigantia (L.) R. Br. was evaluated by using five cariogenic bacteria, Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus mutans. Agar well diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were used for this purpose. The chloroform extracted fraction of latex showed inhibitory effect against S. mutans and L. acidophilus with MIC value of 0.032 and 0.52 mg/mL, respectively. Qualitative investigation on structure elucidation of bioactive compound using IR, NMR and GC-MS techniques revealed the presence of methyl nonanoate, a saturated fatty acid.
TI  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of natural infant fluoride-free toothpastes on oral micro-organisms.
AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of six toothpastes for infants: 3 fluoride-free experimental toothpastes--cashew-based, mango-based and without plant extract and fluoride compared with 2 commercially fluoride-free toothpastes and 1 fluoridated toothpastes. METHODS: Six toothpastes for infants were evaluated in this study: (1) experimental cashew-based toothpaste; (2) experimental mango-based toothpaste; (3) experimental toothpaste without plant extract and fluoride (negative control); (4) First Teeth brand toothpaste; (5) Weleda brand toothpaste; and (6) Tandy brand toothpaste (positive control). The antimicrobial activity was recorded against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Candida albicans using the agar plate diffusion test. RESULTS: First Teeth, Weleda, mango-based toothpaste, and toothpaste without plant extract presented no antimicrobial effect against any of the tested micro-organisms. Cashew toothpaste had antimicrobial activity against S mutans, S sobrinus, and L acidophilus, but it showed no antimicrobial activity against C albicans. There was no statistical difference between the inhibition halo of cashew and Tandy toothpastes against S mutans and L acidophilus. CONCLUSIONS: Cashew fluoride-free toothpaste had inhibitory activity against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus, and these results were similar to those obtained for fluoridated toothpaste.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of punica granatum peel extracts against  oral pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Punica granatum has been used for many years in folk medicine due to several purposes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of methanolic extract of Punica granatum peel (MEPGP) against Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguinis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actynomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Candida albicans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, the mentioned oral organisms were cultured in blood agar and mueller-hinton media and then paper disks containing MEPGP at concentrations of 4 mg/ml, 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml were inserted on medias. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by agar disk diffusion method. The effects of three different concentrations of MEPGP against microorganisms were compared using one-way ANOVA and Tukey tests. RESULTS: All concentrations of MEPGP had antibacterial activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Only at concentration of 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml MEPGP was effective against L. acidophilus, S. mutans and S. salivarius. Furthermore; no concentrations of MEPGP inhibited A. viscosus and C. albicans. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that MEPGP might be used as an antibacterial agent in controlling oral infections.
TI  - Dental health of 6-year-old children in Alpes Maritimes, France.
AB  - AIM: To describe the dental health status of 6-year-old children using the ICDAS-II advanced method and to evaluate the association between the known caries risk factors with the cavitated caries lesion (WHO basic method) or with both non-cavitated and cavitated caries lesion caries (ICDAS II). METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a questionnaire was used to evaluate oral health and dietary habits of children. A clinical examination and a Cario analysis test (Pierre Fabre Oral care) were performed. STATISTICS: Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association between caries and daily tooth-brushing, dietary habits, visible plaque and salivary factors. RESULTS: There were 341 children (52% female and 6.25+/-0.46 years of age) in this study. Using the ICDAS-II advanced method, 39% of the children were caries-free. This proportion was larger (67.2%) using the WHO method. In multivariate models, visible dental plaque and Streptococcus mutans count were associated with caries experience registered as ICDAS-II codes 1-6 or codes 3-6. The absence of daily tooth-brushing with fluoridated toothpaste was associated only with caries experience ICDAS-II codes 3-6. CONCLUSION: The use of WHO or ICDAS-II method changed the proportion of caries-free children but not the clinical caries risk factors associated with caries experience.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial effects of commercially available mouth-wetting agents.
AB  - Products have been developed to provide palliation for persons with dry mouth. In addition to mouth-wetting agents, some products incorporate antimicrobial constituents with the goal of improving oral microbial defenses. The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the potential antimicrobial and antifungal effects of two commercially available saliva substitutes on Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Candida albicans by using the agar-well diffusion method. Antimicrobial activity as measured by the size of the inhibition zone growth for S. mutans and L. acidophilus was observed only with Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse(R) and BioXtra(R) gel. The zone of inhibition of Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse was larger than that of BioXtra gel (p= 0.00, p < 0.01). No anticandidal effect was seen with any of the test products. The pH of the preparations, the variations between the amount of active ingredients within the products, and the potential antimicrobial effects of inactive ingredients should be investigated to determine the factors that impacted microbial inhibition.
TI  - Use of the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridisation technique for in vivo detection of  cariogenic microorganisms on metallic brackets, with or without use of an antimicrobial agent.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridisation (CDDH) assay, this randomised clinical study evaluated the contamination of metallic brackets by four cariogenic bacterial strains (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus) and the efficacy of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) mouthwashes in reducing bacterial contamination. METHODS: Thirty-nine 11-33-year-old patients under treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances were enrolled in the study and had 2 new metallic brackets bonded to premolars. Nineteen patients used a 0.12% CHX mouthwash (Periogard) and 20 patients used a placebo mouthwash (control) twice a week. After 30 days, the brackets were removed and samples were obtained for analysis by CDDH. Data were analysed statistically by the Kruskal-Wallis test (alpha=0.05) using the SAS software. RESULTS: S. mutans, S. sobrinus, L. casei and L. acidophilus were detected in 100% of the samples from both groups. However, brackets of the control group were more heavily contaminated by S. mutans and S. sobrinus (P<0.01). In the experimental group, although all counts decreased after rinsing with the chlorhexidine solution, there was significant difference only for S. mutans (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The use of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwashes can be useful in clinical practice to reduce the levels of cariogenic microorganisms in patients under treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances.
TI  - Salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli modulations in young children on consumption of probiotic ice-cream containing Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La5.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in saliva of school children, before and after consumption of probiotic and control ice-cream. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial was carried out in forty, 12-14 year-old children, with no clinically detectable caries. The selected children were randomized equally into two groups I and II. Following an initial run-in period of 1 week, children in group I and II were given ice-creams 'A' and 'B', respectively, for 10 days. Being a cross-over study, the ice-creams were interchanged in the two groups after a 2-week wash-out period. Saliva samples at baseline and follow-up were assessed using Dentocult SM and Dentocult LB kits. RESULTS: On statistical evaluation, it was seen that probiotic ice-cream brought about a statistically significant reduction (p-value = 0.003) in salivary mutans streptococci levels with no significant effect on lactobacilli levels. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, probiotic ice-cream containing Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 ATCC27536 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 can reduce the levels of certain caries-associated micro-organisms in saliva.
TI  - Prunus mume extract exhibits antimicrobial activity against pathogenic oral bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Prunus mume is a common fruit in Asia, which has been used in traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, we focused on the antimicrobial properties of Prunus mume extract against oral pathogens related to dental caries and periodontal diseases. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 15 oral pathogens including Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, S. mitis, S. sanguinis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, P. gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Candida species were included in the study. Initially, agar diffusion assay was performed to screen the antimicrobial activities of Prunus mume extract. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were then determined for sensitive species. Effect of Prunus mume extract on human oral keratinocytes (HOK) viability was also tested. RESULT: In the agar diffusion assay, drug suspension of 2 g/mL was able to inhibit all the bacterial species tested, but not the fungal species. MIC and MBC range of Prunus mume extract against the oral bacteria was 0.15625-0.0003 g/mL and P. gingivalis being the most susceptible species. Prune extract did not cause any detrimental effect on HOK. CONCLUSION: Prunus mume extract may be a potential candidate for developing an oral antimicrobial agent to control or prevent dental diseases associated with oral pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - The effect of a probiotic strain (Lactobacillus acidophilus) on the plaque formation of oral Streptococci.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the ability of biofilm formation among mutans and non mutans oral streptococci and to determine the effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM 20079 as a probiotic strain on the adhesion of selected streptococcal strains on the surfaces. The sample comprised 40 isolates of oral streptococci from dental plaque and caries of volunteer persons. Streptococcus mutans ATCC35668 (no24) was as an standard strain. The probiotic strain was Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM 20079. The ability of biofilm formation was investigated with colorimetric method and the strongest isolates were selected. Then the effect of probiotic strain on the adhesion of streptococci isolates was determined in polystyrene microtiter plate simultaneously and 30 minutes before streptococci entrance to the system. The results showed that 42% of mutans streptococci were strongly adherent (SA) and in non mutans streptococci, only 23.5% of isolates were found strongly adherent. The strong biofilm forming bacterium isolated was Streptococcus mutans strain22. In the next step, in the presence of probiotic strain the streptococcal adhesion were reduced, and this reduction was non significantly stronger if the probiotic strain was inoculated to the system before the oral bacteria. The Lactobacillus acidophilus had more effect on adherence of mutans streptococci than non mutans streptococci with significant difference (p < 0.05). Adhesion reduction is likely due to bacterial interactions and colonization of adhesion sites with probiotic strain before the presence of streptococci. Adhesion reduction can be an effective way on decreasing cariogenic potential of oral streptococci.
TI  - The effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. METHODS: Twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (MS) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. The experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. The polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. Stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. The samples were cultured for MS, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. A part of the samples were subjected to DNA-DNA hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: Actinomyces naeslundii, A. viscosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. paracasei, L. rhamnose, L. plantarum, Streptococcus gordonii, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, Veillonella parvula. RESULTS: The MS counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (P<.01) in the xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. Also the plaque MS percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (P<.01). The salivary MS counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. Nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. The DNA-DNA hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced MS counts in plaque but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.
TI  - Co-aggregation and growth inhibition of probiotic lactobacilli and clinical isolates of mutans streptococci: an in vitro study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Co-aggregation and growth inhibition abilities of probiotic bacteria may play a key role in their interference with the oral biofilm. The aim was to investigate the in vitro ability of selected commercial probiotic lactobacilli to co-aggregate and inhibit growth of oral mutans steptococci isolated from adults with contrasting levels of caries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mutans streptococci (MS) strains were isolated from caries-free (n = 3) and caries-susceptible (n = 5) young adults and processed with eight commercial probiotic lactobacilli strains. One laboratory reference strain (S. mutans Ingbritt) was selected as control. Co-aggregation was determined spectrophotometrically and growth inhibition was assessed with the agar overlay technique. RESULTS: All probiotic lactobacilli showed an ability to co-aggregate with the isolated MS strains. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found between strains from different individuals when compared with the reference strain. The selected lactobacilli inhibited MS growth, but the ability varied between the strains and was clearly related to pH. No differences were observed between the different MS strains from caries-free and caries-susceptible individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The selected lactobacilli displayed co-aggregation activity and inhibited growth of clinical mutans streptococci. The growth inhibition was strain-specific and dependent on pH and cell concentration. The findings indicate that the outcome of lactobacilli-derived probiotic therapy might vary between individuals and depend on the specific strain used.
TI  - Selected aspects of the oral environment in cleft palate patients--a problem evidently beyond dentists' scope.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The oral cavity is a specialized ecosystem composed of dentition and mucosa exposed to the effects of saliva and gingival liquid. Its structure provides advantageous conditions for various microorganisms, both aerobic streptococci and anaerobic bacilli. The dynamic balance of the oral cavity ecosystem can be threatened by various factors. Lip and palatal clefts are the most frequent disorders in embryonic facial development. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus and oral cavity hygiene in patients with cleft palate treated orthodontically are significantly different compared with patients without these congenital malformations. MATERIAL/METHODS: The study group consisted of 200 patients aged 6-21 who were divided into two groups depending on the presence of cleft palate and treatment method. Group C (control) consisted of 50 orthodontically untreated patients with occlusal dental defects. The performed studies consisted of 2 parts: the clinical-laboratory part and statistical analysis. Clinical-laboratory part RESULTS: High bacteria levels of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus in saliva of patients were comparably frequent between groups, but there were statistically significant differences in inter-group comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: As the orthodontic treatment changes the oral environment, control of proper hygienic behavior is an essential element of health education. Introduction of preventive programs is also very important.
TI  - Lactobacillus Acidophilus-Derived Biosurfactant Effect on GTFB and GTFC Expression Level in Streptococcus Mutans Biofilm Cells.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), harboring biofilm formation, considered as a main aetiological factor of dental caries. Gtf genes play an important role in S. mutans biofilm formation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus-derived biosurfactant on S. mutans biofilm formation and gtfB/C expression level (S. mutans standard strain ATCC35668 and isolated S. mutans strain (22) from dental plaque). The Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) DSM 20079 was selected as a probiotic strain to produce biosurfactant. The FTIR analysis of its biosurfactant showed that it appears to have a protein-like component. Due to the release of such biosurfactants, L. acidophilus was able to interfere in the adhesion and biofilm formation of the S. mutans to glass slide. It also could make streptococcal chains shorter. Using realtime RT-PCR quantitation method made it clear that gtfB and gtfC gene expression were decreased in the presence of L. acidophilus-derived biosurfactant fraction. Several properties of S. mutans cells (the surface properties, biofilm formation, adhesion ability and gene expression) were changed after L. acidophilus- derived biosurfactant treatment. It is also concluded that biosurfacant treatment can provide an optional way to control biofilm development. On the basis of our findings, we can suggest that the prepared biosurfactant may interfere with adhesion processes of S. mutans to teeth surfaces, provided additional evaluation produce satisfactory results.
TI  - Effect of the antimicrobial decapeptide KSL on the growth of oral pathogens and Streptococcus mutans biofilm.
AB  - Dental caries and periodontitis are common oral bacterial infectious diseases. Their prevention and treatment requires control of the causative pathogens, such as Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis, that exist within dental plaque. As one of the attractive future substitutes for conventional antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), both natural and synthetic, have been widely tested and used for controlling bacterial infections. In this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of KSL (KKVVFKVKFK-NH(2)), a novel AMP, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria as well as Candida albicans in vitro. Streptococcus mutans, the causative agent of dental caries, was chosen for in-depth testing. Bacterial susceptibility and time-kill assays were performed to investigate the sensitivity of S. mutans to KSL. The effect of KSL on biofilm formation and on pre-formed biofilm was also examined. For biofilm studies, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to observe and analyse bacterial biofilm. The results showed that KSL had antimicrobial activity against a variety of oral bacteria and fungi. Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus were the most susceptible strains to KSL peptide [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.0625 mg/mL] compared with other species tested (MICs of 0.125-1mg/mL). KSL also inhibited S. mutans biofilm formation, with a minimum biofilm inhibition concentration of 0.0625-0.125 mg/mL, and reduced 1-day-old developed S. mutans biofilm, with a minimum biofilm reduction concentration of 0.25-0.5mg/mL. CLSM images showed that KSL significantly reduced the viability of biofilm cells. This study suggests that KSL may have a potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing S. mutans within dental plaque.
TI  - Oral bacterial deactivation using a low-temperature atmospheric argon plasma brush.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the plasma treatment effects on deactivation effectiveness of oral bacteria. METHODS: A low temperature atmospheric argon plasma brush were used to study the oral bacterial deactivation effects in terms of plasma conditions, plasma exposure time, and bacterial supporting media. Oral bacteria of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus with an initial bacterial population density between 1.0x10(8) and 5.0x10(8)cfu/ml were seeded on various media and their survivability with plasma exposure was examined. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the morphological changes of the plasma treated bacteria. Optical absorption was used to determine the leakage of intracellular proteins and DNAs of the plasma treated bacteria. RESULTS: The experimental data indicated that the argon atmospheric plasma brush was very effective in deactivating oral bacteria. The plasma exposure time for a 99.9999% cell reduction was less than 15s for S. mutans and within 5 min for L. acidophilus. It was found that the plasma deactivation efficiency was also dependent on the bacterial supporting media. With plasma exposure, significant damages to bacterial cell structures were observed with both bacterium species. Leakage of intracellular proteins and DNAs after plasma exposure was observed through monitoring the absorbance peaks at wavelengths of 280 nm and 260 nm, respectively. CONCLUSION: The experimental results from this study indicated that low temperature atmospheric plasma treatment was very effective in deactivation of oral bacteria and could be a promising technique in various dental clinical applications such as bacterial disinfection and caries early prevention.
TI  - Nisin inhibits dental caries-associated microorganism in vitro.
AB  - Nisin, produced by Lactococcus lactis, is an antibiotic peptide to effectively antagonize a broad spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria, and is widely used as a safe food antimicrobial agent. In the present study, we investigated whether nisin could be used as an effective antibiotic peptide against the nine common cariogenic microorganisms, and its antimicrobial activity could be affected by the ingredients of saliva in oral cavity. In the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericide concentration (MBC) and spot-on-lawn assay, nisin displayed different MIC, MBC and antimicrobial activity against the nine tested strains. There was statistical difference between the inhibitory zone diameters of nisin against the different tested bacteria (p<0.05), but no statistical difference between the inhibitory zone diameters of nisin dissolved in PBS and saliva (p>0.05). Furthermore, morphology and membranes of Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus fermenti and Lactobacillus acidophilus with nisin treatment were observed and showed different degrees of variation by a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM). Our findings suggested that nisin has considerable potential for prevention and treatment of dental caries.
TI  - Growth inhibition of oral mutans streptococci and candida by commercial probiotic lactobacilli--an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotic bacteria are suggested to play a role in the maintenance of oral health. Such health promoting bacteria are added to different commercial probiotic products. The aim of the study was to investigate the ability of a selection of lactobacilli strains, used in commercially available probiotic products, to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and C. albicans in vitro. METHODS: Eight probiotic lactobacilli strains were tested for growth inhibition on three reference strains and two clinical isolates of mutans streptococci as well as two reference strains and three clinical isolates of Candida albicans with an agar overlay method. RESULTS: At concentrations ranging from 109 to 105 CFU/ml, all lactobacilli strains inhibited the growth of the mutans streptococci completely with the exception of L. acidophilus La5 that executed only a slight inhibition of some strains at concentrations corresponding to 107 and 105 CFU/ml. At the lowest cell concentration (103 CFU/ml), only L. plantarum 299v and L. plantarum 931 displayed a total growth inhibition while a slight inhibition was seen for all five mutans streptococci strains by L. rhamnosus LB21, L. paracasei F19, L. reuteri PTA 5289 and L. reuteri ATCC 55730. All the tested lactobacilli strains reduced candida growth but the effect was generally weaker than for mutans streptococci. The two L. plantarum strains and L. reuteri ATCC 55730 displayed the strongest inhibition on Candida albicans. No significant differences were observed between the reference strains and the clinical isolates. CONCLUSION: The selected probiotic strains showed a significant but somewhat varying ability to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and Candida albicans in vitro.
TI  - Mechanical non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis: a single-blinded randomized longitudinal clinical study. II. Microbiological results.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peri-implantitis is common in patients with dental implants. We performed a single-blinded longitudinal randomized study to assess the effects of mechanical debridement on the peri-implant microbiota in peri-implantitis lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An expanded checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization assay encompassing 79 different microorganisms was used to study bacterial counts before and during 6 months following mechanical treatment of peri-implantitis in 17 cases treated with curettes and 14 cases treated with an ultrasonic device. Statistics included non-parametric tests and GLM multivariate analysis with p<0001 indicating significance and 80% power. RESULTS: At selected implant test sites, the most prevalent bacteria were: Fusobacterium nucleatum sp., Staphylococci sp., Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Helicobacter pylori, and Tannerella forsythia. 30 min. after treatment with curettes, A. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a), Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Veillonella parvula were found at lower counts (p<0.001). No such differences were found for implants treated with the ultrasonic device. Inconsistent changes occurred following the first week. No microbiological differences between baseline and 6-month samples were found for any species or between treatment study methods in peri-implantitis. CONCLUSIONS: Both methods failed to eliminate or reduce bacterial counts in peri-implantitis. No group differences were found in the ability to reduce the microbiota in peri-implantitis.
TI  - Microbial risk markers for childhood caries in pediatricians' offices.
AB  - Dental caries in pre-school children has significant public health and health disparity implications. To determine microbial risk markers for this infection, this study aimed to compare the microbiota of children with early childhood caries with that of caries-free children. Plaque samples from incisors, molars, and the tongue from 195 children attending pediatricians' offices were assayed by 74 DNA probes and by PCR to Streptococcus mutans. Caries-associated factors included visible plaque, child age, race, and snacking habits. Species were detected more frequently from tooth than tongue samples. Lactobacillus gasseri (p < 0.01), Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus vaginalis, and S. mutans with Streptococcus sobrinus (all p < 0.05) were positively associated with caries. By multifactorial analysis, the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus was negatively associated with caries. Prevotella nigrescens was the only species (p < 0.05) significantly associated with caries by the 'false discovery' rate. Analysis of the data suggests that selected Lactobacillus species, in addition to mutans streptococci, are risk markers for early childhood caries.
TI  - Antibacterial surface properties of fluoride-containing resin-based sealants.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to determine the antibacterial properties of three resin-based pit and fissure sealant products: Clinpro (3M ESPE), Embrace (Pulpdent), and UltraSeal XT plus (Ultradent). METHODS: The antibacterial effects of the sealants were tested in both an agar diffusion assay and a planktonic growth inhibition assay using Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus. The materials were applied to paper and enamel disks in the former and on the side walls of 96-well microtiter plates on the latter. RESULTS: All materials showed either diffusible or contact antibacterial effects in the agar diffusion assays. The effect was diminished when enamel disks were used as substrate. In the planktonic growth inhibition assay, Clinpro had its effect reduced, but retained activity against both bacteria over time. L. acidophilus was more sensitive than S. mutans to UltraSeal. Embrace retained antibacterial activity against both bacteria over time. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this in vitro study it can be concluded that all materials are capable of contact inhibition of L. acidophilus and S. mutans growth. Embrace has the longer lasting antibacterial activity when in solution, especially against S. mutans.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of triclosan incorporated glass ionomer cements--an in vitro pilot study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cement impregnated with different concentrations (0.5%, 1.25% and 2.5%) of a non releasing bactericide--Triclosan (TC) against two common cariogenic bacteria - Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus mutans; and to compare Triclosan incorporated GIC with chlorhexidine (CHX) incorporated GIC (2.5%) in terms of Antibacterial activity. METHODS: Chlorhexidine or Triclosan were added to glass ionomer cement powder to achieve 2.5% CHX--GIC (positive control--Group II), 0.5%, 1.25% and 2.5% TC-GIC (experimental groups III, IV and V respectively) formulations. Restorative glass ionomer cement (Fuji IX GC--Group I) served as negative control. The powder and liquid were mixed and inserted into the wells punched in agar plates (10 mm x 4 mm). The agar diffusion method was used to determine the antibacterial activity of the cements after 1, 7 and 30 days. Mean values were compared between different study groups using One-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD procedure at a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: Triclosan incorporated GIC was more effective against L. acidophilus and S. mutans than Chlorhexidine incorporated GIC. Triclosan at a concentration of 2.5% was more effective than at lower concentrations. At all time periods studied, the maximum zone of inhibition against L. acidophilus was produced by Group V. Against S. mutans, on days 1, 7 and 30, there was no significant difference between Groups II and IV (p > 0.05), while the other groups showed significant differences. CONCLUSION: The use of triclosan as an antibacterial additive in GIC holds promise and further clinical research is needed in this direction.
TI  - Screening of Quercus infectoria gall extracts as anti-bacterial agents against dental pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A number of bacteria have now become antibiotic-resistant. This increases the importance of ayurvedic drugs. We report, here, the activity of different extracts (petroleum ether, chloroform, methanol and water) of Quercus infectoria galls against dental pathogens -- Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus acidophilus (designated) and Streptococcus sanguis (isolated). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cup-plate method was used in anti-bacterial activity of the extracts at concentration of 200 mg/ml against dental pathogens. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of most effective extracts against the most susceptible bacteria were determined using a two-fold serial micro dilution method. RESULTS: Methanolic extract showed maximum anti-bacterial activity against all the bacteria. The most susceptible bacteria were S. sanguis followed by S. aureus, S. mutans, S. salivarius and L. acidophilus. The MIC values showed that methanolic extract was more effective than water extract. CONCLUSION: The plant has the potential to generate herbal metabolites. The crude extracts demonstrating anti-dental caries activity could result in the discovery of new chemical classes of antibiotics. These chemical classes of antibiotics could serve as selective agents for the maintenance of human health and provide bio-chemical tools for the study of infectious diseases.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of aloe vera tooth gel and two popular commercial toothpastes: an in vitro study.
AB  - Aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis Miller) has been suggested for a wide variety of ailments but its use in dentistry is limited. This article reviews the uses of the plant and describes an in vitro investigation that compared the antimicrobial effectiveness of aloe vera tooth gel with two popular, commercially available dentifrices. The preliminary results showed that aloe vera tooth gel and the toothpastes were equally effective against Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Aloe vera tooth gel demonstrated enhanced antibacterial effect against S. mitis.
TI  - Oral bacterial adhesion forces to biomaterial surfaces constituting the bracket-adhesive-enamel junction in orthodontic treatment.
AB  - Bacterial adhesion to biomaterial surfaces constituting the bracket-adhesive-enamel junction represents a growing problem in orthodontics, because bacteria can adversely affect treatment by causing demineralization of the enamel surface around the brackets. It is important to know the forces with which bacteria adhere to the surfaces of these junction materials, as the strength of these forces will determine how easy it will be to remove the bacteria. We compared the adhesion forces of five initially colonizing and four cariogenic strains of bacteria to an orthodontic adhesive, stainless steel, and enamel, with and without a salivary conditioning film. Adhesion forces were determined using atomic force microscopy and a bacterial probe. In the absence of a salivary conditioning film, the strongest bacterial adhesion forces occurred to the adhesive surface (-2.9 to -6.9 nN), while adhesion forces to the enamel surfaces were lowest (-0.8 to -2.7 nN). In the presence of a salivary conditioning film, adhesion forces were reduced strongly, to less than 1 nN, and the differences between the various materials were reduced. Generally, however, initial colonizers of dental hard surfaces presented stronger adhesion forces to the different materials (-4.7 and -0.6 nN in the absence and presence of a salivary conditioning film, respectively) than cariogenic strains (-1.8 and -0.5 nN).
TI  - Isolation and identification of antimicrobial compound from Mentha longifolia L.  leaves grown wild in Iraq.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mentha longifolia L. (Lamiaceae) leaves have been traditionally implemented in the treatment of minor sore throat and minor mouth or throat irritation by the indigenous people of Iraq, although the compounds responsible for the medicinal properties have not been identified. In the present study, an antimicrobial compound was isolated and characterized, and its biological activity was assessed. METHODS: The compound was isolated and characterized from the extracted essential oil using different spectral techniques: TLC, FTIR spectra and HPLC. Antimicrobial activity of the compound was assessed using both disc diffusion and microdilution method in 96 multi-well microtiter plates. RESULTS: A known compound was isolated from the essential oil of the plant and was identified as (-) menthol. The isolated compound was investigated for its antimicrobial activity against seven selected pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the yeast Candida albicans. Menthol at different concentrations (1:1, 1:5, 1:10, 1:20) was active against all tested bacteria except for P. aeruginosa, and the highest inhibitory effect was observed against S. mutans (zone of inhibition: 25.3 mm) using the disc diffusion method. Minimal inhibitory concentration MIC values ranged from 15.6-125.0 microg/ml, and the most promising results were observed against S. aureus and S. mutans (MIC 15.6 microg/ml) while, S. faecalis, S. pyogenis and L. acidophilus ranked next (MIC 31.2 microg/ml). Furthermore, menthol achieved considerable antifungal activity against the yeast C. albicans (zone of inhibition range: 7.1-18.5 mm; MIC: 125.0). CONCLUSION: The isolation of an antimicrobial compound from M. longifolia leaves validates the use of this plant in the treatment of minor sore throat and minor mouth or throat irritation.
TI  - Coaggregation between probiotic bacteria and caries-associated strains: an in vitro study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in vitro abilities of probiotic bacteria derived from  consumer products to coaggregate with caries-associated mutans streptococci. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six lactobacillus strains (L. acidophilus (CCUG 5917), L. plantarum 299v, L. rhamnosus GG and LB21, L. paracasei F19, L. reuteri PTA5289) were cultivated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees C in Man Rogosa Sharpe (MSB) broth for 24 h. Four strains of human streptococci (S. mutans Ingbritt, S. mutans (ATCC 25175), S. mutans GS-5, S. sobrinus (ATCC 33478) were similarly grown in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth. A gastrointestinal pathogen (Escherichia coli) was aerobically cultivated on BHI broth as a positive control. After incubation, the bacteria were aerobically harvested, washed, and suspended in 10 mmol/l phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2). The probiotic strains were characterized with the API 50 CH system to confirm their identity. Coaggregation was determined by spectrophotometry in mixtures and bacterial suspensions alone after 1, 2, 4, and 24 h and expressed as the aggregation ratio (%). RESULTS: All probiotic strains showed coaggregation abilities with the oral pathogens and the results were strain specific and dependent on time. S. mutans GS-5 exhibited a significantly higher ability to coaggregate with all the probiotic strains than the other mutans streptococci and E. coli. The differences among the probiotic strains were modest with L. acidophilus being the most prone and L. rhamnosus LB21 the least prone to coaggregate with the oral streptococci. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated different abilities of lactobacilli-derived probiotic bacteria to coaggregate with selected oral streptococci. Aggregation assays may be a useful complement for screening of probiotic candidates with possible anti-caries properties.
TI  - Methods for optimizing DNA extraction before quantifying oral bacterial numbers by real-time PCR.
AB  - Methods for the optimal extraction of genomic DNA for real-time PCR enumeration of oral bacteria using the muramidase, mutanolysin, were developed using a simple in vitro oral flora model comprised of the facultative anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus mutans, the gram-positive anaerobe, Parvimonas micra, and the gram-negative anaerobes, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella melaninogenica and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Traditional, as well as more elaborate, methods of quantifying bacterial numbers, including colony counting and estimation of DNA content using 4',6-diamino-2-phenylindole were compared in order to validate the real-time PCR approach. Evidence was obtained that P. gingivalis nuclease activity adversely affected the extraction of double-stranded DNA from this bacterium either alone or when it formed part of a consortium with the other bacteria. This nuclease activity could be overcome by treatment of the bacteria with either 20 mM diethyl pyrocarbonate or 70% ethanol at 4 degrees C overnight. A final purification of the DNA to remove any potential PCR inhibitors was added to the protocol in order to accurately quantify the amount of DNA by real-time PCR and hence the number of bacteria in a sample.
TI  - Does strontium play a role in the cariostatic activity of glass ionomer? Strontium diffusion and antibacterial activity.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of strontium ions on the main pathogens of the oral flora. The leaching of strontium from resin modified glass ionomer cements (RMGIC) was evaluated together with its uptake by superficial dental enamel. METHODS: The antibacterial activity was measured by the growth inhibition method following exposure of supra- and sub-gingival bacteria to a range of strontium concentrations (0.19 moll(-1), 0.37 moll(-1), 0.74 moll(-1) and 1.11 moll(-1)). Strontium concentrations were analyzed chemically and migration at 5 microm and 15 microm depths was quantified by microprobe following Fuji Ortho LC application on the vestibular enamel of extracted teeth. RESULTS: Strontium was found in appreciable amounts (0.8 wt.%) in superficial enamel, but in insignificant concentrations deeper in. At the same time, 8% fluoroapatite was formed in the enamel. Under our experimental conditions, strontium had no significant antibacterial activity; only one log reduction of activity was observed at the highest concentrations tested. CONCLUSIONS: RMGIC releases strontium ions which are rapidly exchanged for calcium ions in the superficial enamel. No significant antibacterial activity was observed for strontium ions alone at the concentrations considered. However synergistic effects with fluoride could promote antibacterial activity.
TI  - Dental caries vaccine.
AB  - Dental caries is one of the most common diseases in humans. In modern times, it has reached epidemic proportions. Dental caries is an infectious microbiologic disease of the teeth that results in localized dissolution and destruction of the calcified tissue. Dental caries is a mulitifactorial disease, which is caused by host, agent, and environmental factors. The time factor is important for the development and progression of dental caries. A wide group of microorganisms are identified from carious lesions of which S. mutans , Lactobacillus acidophilus , and Actinomyces viscosus are the main pathogenic species involved in the initiation and development of dental caries. In India, surveys done on school children showed caries prevalence of approximately 58%. Surveys among the U.S. population showed an incidence of 45.3% in children and 93.8% in adults with either past or present coronal caries. Huge amounts of money and time are spent in treating dental caries. Hence, the prevention and control of dental caries is the main aim of public health, eventually the ultimate objective of public health is the elimination of the disease itself. Recently, dental caries vaccines have been developed for the prevention of dental caries. These dental caries vaccines are still in the early stages.
TI  - Distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in five different intra-oral habitats in young children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the colonization patterns and composition of the oral microbiota can lead to a better understanding of disease initiation. AIM: The aim of this study was to examine the distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in samples from five different oral habitats in young Greek children. DESIGN: Ninety-three children 3-12 years old (mean + SD 7.9 +/- 2.5) (60.2% male, 39.8% female) participated and split into three different age groups: primary (3-6 years), early mixed (6-9 years), and mixed dentition (9-12 years). Samples for bacterial enumeration were taken from saliva, supragingival and subgingival plaque, tongue dorsum, and soft tissues from each child, and were further analysed using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: Mean counts and proportions of all the test bacteria differed significantly among sample locations. Cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all healthy children. Mean proportions of Streptococcus mutans isolated from soft tissue and Streptococcus sanguinis from soft tissue, subgingival and saliva samples increased significantly with age, whereas the opposite was seen for Lactobacillus acidophilus. CONCLUSIONS: Cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all young children. Soft tissues, saliva, and tongue were more often colonized by cariogenic streptococcal species than teeth. These surfaces may serve as reservoirs for oral pathogens, requiring attention during preventive interventions.
TI  - The inability of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus to form a biofilm in vitro on dentine pretreated with ozone.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of ozone therapy in the treatment of dental caries is equivocal. The aim of this study was to use an in vitro model to determine the effects of prior ozone application to dentine on biofilm formation and to measure any associated reduction in bacteria viability. METHODS: Twenty dentine discs were bonded to the bases of 5 mL polycarbonate screw top vials. Ten dentine discs were infused with ozone for 40 seconds, 10 samples remained untreated as a control. The vials were filled with nutrient medium, sterilized and placed into the outflow from a continuous chemostat culture of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus for four weeks. At the conclusion of the experiment bacterial growth was monitored by taking optical density readings of the growth medium in each vial and the outer surface of the dentine specimens were examined by scanning electron microscopy as shown by SEM analysis. RESULTS: Ozone infusion prevented biofilm formation on all the treated samples while there was substantial biofilm present on the control specimens. While the average optical density of the control specimens was almost twice that of the ozone infused dentine (0.710 for the control with a SD of 0.288 and 0.446 for the ozonated samples with a SD of 0.371), the results were not significant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study has shown that the infusion of ozone into non-carious dentine prevented biofilm formation in vitro from S. mutans and L. acidophilus over a four-week period. The possibility exists that ozone treatment may alter the surface wettability of dentine through reaction with organic constituents.
TI  - [Initial study on the discrimination of oral microorganisms with a metabonomics method].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the spectra of metabolites that coued be employed in identification of oral pathogenic bacteria, and try to find a convenient and rapid way to discriminate oral microorganisms. METHODS: Suspensions of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556 and Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 with same density were preparecd and cultured respectively at improved TPY liquid culture medium. The growth quantity were measured periodically by a turbidimeter. And the growth curves of the inoculated bacteria were completed. The culture solutions in stationary phase of the three bacteria were tested with 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy respectively. The data of 1H-NMR spectroscopy results were analyzed by principal components analysis (PCA). RESULTS: The PCA showed the obvious clustering phenomena and the points of three group differentially centralized to three clusters. Therefore, the NMR-based metabonomics profiles could discriminate the three different kinds of bacteria. CONCLUSION: The metabonomics is a promising new technology for developing to a rapid discrimination method of oral pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Comparison of the antibacterial activity of different self-etching primers and adhesives.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial effects of different one-step and two-step self-etching primer/adhesives on Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), Lactobacillus casei (L. casei), and Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus). METHODS AND MATERIALS: The antibacterial effects of Clearfil Protect Bond Primer and Bonding agent; AdheSE Primer and Bonding agent; Adper Prompt L-Pop; Futurabond NR; Clearfil Tri S Bond; and Cervitec (positive control, 1% chlorhexidine varnish) were tested against standard strains of S. mutans, L. Casei, and L. acidophilus using the disk diffusion method. Standard filter paper disks (n=5) impregnated with 20 microL of each material were prepared. After incubation at 37 masculineC for 48 hours in a 5-10% CO2 atmosphere, the diameter of inhibition zones were measured in millimeters. Data were analyzed using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Duncan's Multiple Range Test was used for pairwise comparison. RESULTS: The size of inhibition zones produced by primer/adhesives varied among the brands. AdheSE Primer: S. mutans (20.6+/-1.51); L. casei (14.8+/-1.78); L. acidophilus (11.4+/-0.54). Adper Prompt L-Pop: S. mutans (19.6+/-1.51); L. casei (13.8+/-1.64); L. acidophilus (13.8+/-1.09). Cervitec: S. mutans (23+/-0.00); L. casei (27+/-0.70); L. acidophilus (22.4+/-0.54). Clearfil Protect Bond Primer: S. mutans (17+/-0.00); L. casei (17.6+/-0.54); L. acidophilus (22.4+/-0.54). Futurabond NR was found effective only against S. mutans (14.6+/-1.67). Of all the materials tested, AdheSE Bonding agent, Clearfil Protect Bond Bonding agent, and Clearfil Tri S Bond exhibited no inhibition zone (-) for all bacteria tested. CONCLUSION: Among the adhesives tested Clearafil Protect Bond Primer based upon monomer methacryloyloxydodecylpyridiniium bromide (MDPB) was found to be the most potent material against L. acidophilus and L. casei. AdheSE Primer and Adper Prompt L-Pop are highly effective against S. mutans. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Compared with other adhesive systems, Clearfil Protect Bond Primer (containing MDPB) showed a high antibacterial effect against all microorganizms tested. Two-step, self-etching primer/adhesive system Clearfil Protect Bond might be a suitable choice under minimally invasive restorations. The recently developed one-step, self-etching system Clearfil Tri S Bond showed no antibacterial effect against microorgazims tested.
TI  - Acid production from sugars and sugar alcohols by probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in vitro.
AB  - Some probiotic bacterial strains have been suggested to improve oral health. However, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are associated with the progression of dental caries. The pH fall caused by 14 probiotic and dairy bacterial strains from glucose, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol and xylitol was followed. All strains used glucose, nine lactose and seven sucrose. Six of the lactobacilli caused a small decrease in pH with sorbitol and two with xylitol. None of the bifidobacteria fermented sugar alcohols. As all the strains could be considered acidogenic, more long-term clinical trials are needed before recommendations for oral health purposes can be made.
TI  - MLPA diagnostics of complex microbial communities: relative quantification of bacterial species in oral biofilms.
AB  - A multitude of molecular methods are currently used for identification and characterization of oral biofilms or for community profiling. However, multiplex PCR techniques that are able to routinely identify several species in a single assay are not available. Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) identifies up to 45 unique fragments in a single tube PCR. Here we report a novel use of MLPA in the relative quantification of targeted microorganisms in a community of oral microbiota. We designed 9 species specific probes for: Actinomyces gerencseriae, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Candida albicans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Rothia dentocariosa, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis and Veillonella parvula; and genus specific probes for selected oral Streptococci and Lactobacilli based on their 16S rDNA sequences. MLPA analysis of DNA pooled from the strains showed the expected specific MLPA products. Relative quantification of a serial dilution of equimolar DNA showed that as little as 10 pg templates can be detected with clearly discernible signals. Moreover, a 2 to 7% divergence in relative signal ratio of amplified probes observed from normalized peak area values suggests MLPA can be a cheaper alternative to using qPCR for quantification. We observed 2 to 6 fold fluctuations in signal intensities of MLPA products in DNAs isolated from multispecies biofilms grown in various media for various culture times. Furthermore, MLPA analyses of DNA isolated from saliva obtained from different donors gave a varying number and intensity of signals. This clearly shows the usefulness of MLPA in a quantitative description of microbial shifts.
TI  - Strong antibacterial effect of miswak against oral microorganisms associated with periodontitis and caries.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The chewing stick (miswak) is used for oral hygiene in many parts of  the world. In addition to the mechanical removal of plaque, an antibacterial effect has been postulated; however, tests of miswak extract from Salvadora persica (Arak) disclosed only low to moderate antibacterial effects. This may be attributable to the extraction process. Our aim was to test in vitro the antibacterial effect of miswak pieces, without extraction, on bacteria implicated in the etiology of periodontitis and caries. METHODS: Miswak pieces were standardized by size and weight (0.07 and 0.14 g) and tested against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, and, as a reference, Haemophilus influenzae. The miswak pieces were tested in two ways: embedded in the agar plate or suspended above the agar plate. RESULTS: The inhibitory effect was most pronounced on P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and H. influenzae, less on S. mutans, and least on L. acidophilus. Suspended miswak had comparable or stronger effects than miswak embedded in agar. The 0.14-g suspended miswak exhibited significantly greater inhibition on A. actinomycetemcomitans and H. influenzae than the 0.14-g miswak embedded in agar (P<0.01 and P<0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Miswak embedded in agar or suspended above the agar plate had strong antibacterial effects against all bacteria tested. The antibacterial effect of suspended miswak pieces suggests the presence of volatile active antibacterial compounds.
TI  - Antimicrobial photodynamic action on dentin using a light-emitting diode light source.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was the evaluation of two different photosensitizers activated by red light emitted by light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in the decontamination of carious bovine dentin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen bovine incisors were used to obtain dentin samples which were immersed in brain-heart infusion culture medium supplemented with 1% glucose, 2% sucrose, and 1% young primary culture of Lactobacillus acidophilus 10(8) CFU/mL and Streptococcus mutans 10(8) CFU/mL for caries induction. Three different concentrations of the Photogem solution, a hematoporphyrin derivative (1, 2, and 3 mg/mL) and two different concentrations of toluidine blue O (TBO), a basic dye (0.025 and 0.1 mg/mL) were used. To activate the photosensitizers two different light exposure times were used: 60 sec and 120 sec, corresponding respectively to the doses of 24 J/cm(2) and 48 J/cm(2). RESULTS: After counting the numbers of CFU per milligram of carious dentin, we observed that the use of LED energy in association with Photogem or TBO was effective for bacterial reduction in carious dentin, and that the greatest effect on S. mutans and L. acidophilus was obtained with TBO at 0.1 mg/mL and a dose of 48 J/cm(2). It was also observed that the overall toxicity of TBO was higher than that of Photogem, and that the phototoxicity of TBO was higher than that of Photogem. CONCLUSION: Based on our data we propose a mathematical model for the photodynamic effect when different photosensitizer concentrations and light doses are used.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of neuropeptides against a range of micro-organisms from skin, oral, respiratory and gastrointestinal tract sites.
AB  - Many neuropeptides are similar in size, amino acid composition and charge to antimicrobial peptides. This study aimed to determine whether the neuropeptides substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), displayed antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. SP, NPY, VIP and CGRP displayed variable degrees of antimicrobial activity against all the pathogens tested with the exception of S. aureus. These antimicrobial activities add a further dimension to the immunomodulatory roles for neuropeptides in the inflammatory and immune responses.
TI  - Can different chlorhexidine agents be used as cavity disinfectants?
AB  - This study used the agar well method to compare the antimicrobial effect of cavity disinfectants containing chlorhexidine with other chlorhexidine agents (such as mouthrinses and antiseptics) and to determine whether there was a difference in composite bond strength when these chlorhexidine agents were applied to the dentin surface. All tested solutions showed antimicrobial effect against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Candida albicans (p < 0.05). However, Savlex was found to be the most effective antibacterial agent against all microorganisms (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the bond strengths obtained from the cavity disinfectants and those of the control group (p > 0.05). However, the mouthrinse and the antiseptic decreased the shear bond strength compared with the control group (p < 0.05).
TI  - Effect of resin adhesive systems on root caries formation in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the capability of different adhesive systems to inhibit in vitro caries formation. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Four materials were tested: Gluma Comfort Bond (GL; Heraeus Kulzer), Gluma Comfort Bond + Desensitizer (GL+; Heraeus Kulzer), iBond (iB; Heraeus Kulzer), and One-up Bond F (OUB; Tokuyama). Bovine roots were ground to obtain flat mesial and distal dentin surfaces. Nail varnish was applied to the entire root surface except for two 10 mm X 2 mm windows on the flattened surfaces. The adhesives were applied to the exposed areas according to the manufacturers' instructions. The roots were incubated at 37 degrees C for 1 week in a suspension of StreptococcuS mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Control groups either received no root surface treatment or were etched with 37% phosphoric acid (without immersion in the bacterial suspension). Specimens were sectioned perpendicular to the long axis of the roots, stained for 24 hours with Rhodamine B, and analyzed with confocal laser microscopy. The data were analyzed by 1-way ANOVA and Fisher's PLSD test at 95% confidence level. RESULTS: Lesions in the OUB, iB, and GL+ groups were significantly shallower than those in the no-treatment group. Acid etching did not produce any measurable lesions. Mean lesion depth in the GL group was similar to that in the no-treatment group. There was no significant difference between mean lesion depths in the GL+, GL, and iB groups. CONCLUSION: Fluoride- and glutaraldehyde-containing adhesive systems might be an aid in root caries prevention.
TI  - Effects of natural cross-linkers on the stability of dentin collagen and the inhibition of root caries in vitro.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of dentin collagen modifications induced by various cross-linkers on the stability of collagen matrix and the inhibition of root caries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The following cross-linkers were tested: 5% glutaraldehyde (GA), 0.5% proanthocyanidin (PA), 0.625% genipin (GE). In the first experiment, cross-linker-treated demineralized human root dentin was digested with bacterial collagenase, centrifuged, and the supernatants were subjected to amino acid analysis to determine collagen content. The residues were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and hydroxyproline analysis. In the second experiment, bovine root surfaces were conditioned with phosphoric acid, treated with the cross-linkers, incubated with Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus for 1 week and the root caries inhibition was evaluated with confocal microscopy. Lastly, the ability of the bacteria to colonize the root surface was evaluated. In this experiment slabs of bovine root were treated with the cross-linkers and incubated in a suspension of S. mutans and L. acidophilus. The slabs were washed, resuspended in water, glucose was added, and the pH measured. RESULTS: While all collagen was digested with collagenase in the control groups, only a small proportion was solubilized in the GA-, PA-, and GE-treated groups. The root caries was significantly inhibited by treatment with PA or GA. Drops in pH in the cross-linker-treated groups were essentially the same as in the untreated group. CONCLUSION: Naturally occurring cross-linkers, especially PA, could be used to modify root dentin collagen to efficiently stabilize collagen and to increase its resistance against caries.
TI  - Influence of human dentine on the antibacterial activity of self-etching adhesive systems against cariogenic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The incorporation of antibacterial agents into adhesive systems has been proposed to eliminate residual bacteria from dentine. This study used the agar diffusion method to evaluate the antibacterial activity of Clearfil Protect Bond (CPB), Clearfil SE Bond (CSEB), Clearfil Tri-S Bond (C3SB) and Xeno-III (XIII) self-etching adhesive systems, with or without light-activation, against cariogenic bacteria, and to assess the influence of human dentine on the antibacterial activity of these materials. METHODS: An aliquot of 10 microl per material (and individual components) were pipetted onto paper and dentine discs distributed in Petri dishes containing bacterial culture in BHI agar. Positive control was 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX). RESULTS: After incubation, the adhesive components of CPB and CSEB, liquid A of XIII and C3SB did not present antibacterial activity when applied to paper discs. The non-light-activated CPB primer+adhesive promoted the greatest inhibition of Streptococcus mutans (p<0.05), whereas with light-activation, there was no significant difference between primer+adhesive and primer alone. For Lactobacillus acidophilus, CPB primer presented the greatest antibacterial activity in both light-activation conditions (p<0.05). Regarding the dentine discs, only CHX promoted an inhibitory effect, though less intense than on paper discs (p<0.05). CHX presented greater antibacterial activity against S. mutans than against L. acidophilus (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Light-activation significantly reduced the antibacterial activity of the self-etching adhesive systems; MDPB incorporation contributed to the effect of adhesive systems against cariogenic bacteria; the components eluted from the adhesive systems were not capable to diffuse through 400 microm-thick dentine disc to exert their antibacterial activity against cariogenic bacteria.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antibacterial activity of an herbal dentifrice against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Antibacterial activity of a herbal dentifrice Arodent against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus was evaluated using Colgate as standard. Both bacterial strains were isolated from the oral cavity on selective media and identified by standard methods. The antibacterial activity was assayed by cup-well method. The bacterial lawn of facultative anaerobe S. mutans was established between two layers of agar under microaerophilic conditions. Five and a half millimeters and 10 mm zones of inhibition were produced by Arodent against S. mutans and L. acidophilus , respectively, under microaerophilic conditions. On the other hand, the standard dentifrice Colgate produced 5.83 mm and 10.17 mm zones of inhibition against S. mutans and L. acidophilus , respectively, under microaerophilic condition. The results suggest that Arodent is an effective antibacterial herbal dentifrice.
TI  - Long-term antibacterial effects and physical properties of a chlorhexidine-containing glass ionomer cement.
AB  - STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM: Many regions in the world do not have electricity, water, or access to dental facilities that allows the treatment of caries with dental handpieces and rotary burs. For restorative techniques used in these regions, an antibacterial self-adherent glass ionomer material would contribute considerably. PURPOSE: This study aimed to test if chlorhexidine diacetate (Fluka BioChemika, Buchs, Switzerland)- or chlorhexidine digluconate (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany)-added ChemFil Superior glass ionomer cement (Dentsply DeTrey, Konstanz, Germany) had any long-term antibacterial effect against certain oral bacteria and to test the new formulation's physical properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ChemFil Superior was used as a control. Chlorhexidine diacetate (powder) was added to the powder and chlorhexidine digluconate (liquid) was mixed with the powder in order to obtain 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5% concentrations of the respective groups. Setting time, compressive strength, and acid erosion were tested according to ISO 9917-1. Working time, hardness, diametral tensile strength, and biaxial flexural strength were also determined. Long-term antimicrobial activity against S. mutans, L. acidophilus, and C. albicans were tested with the agar diffusion method. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for comparison (p < 0.05). RESULTS: Regarding the immediate antibacterial effect for S. mutans, all the tested groups showed inhibitions of the strain compared with the control group (p < 0.05), with larger zones for the higher concentration groups and all the diacetates. For L. acidophilus, all the groups were effective compared with the control, but the greatest antibacterial effect was observed with the 2.5% diacetate group. The 2.5% group of chlorhexidine diacetate showed antibacterial activity up to 90 days against S. mutans and up to 60 days against L. acidophilus. The working and setting time, acid erosion test, diametral tensile strength, and biaxial flexural strength of the tested groups were not different from the control ChemFil group. However, the 1.25 and 2.5% groups of chlorhexidine diacetate had significantly lower compressive strengths than the control group. Lower hardness values were obtained with the 0.5 and 2.5% chlorhexidine digluconate groups in comparison with the control group. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this in vitro investigation demonstrated that chlorhexidine diacetate or digluconate added to the ChemFil Superior glass ionomer material can exhibit long-term antibacterial effects against S. mutans and L. acidophilus without compromising the physical properties of the material.
TI  - Comparison of antibacterial properties of two fluoride-releasing and a nonfluoride-releasing pit and fissure sealants.
AB  - Occlusal pits and fissures are the most susceptible sites for the development of  dental caries and prevention is difficult in the areas of occurrence. Although only 12.5% of all the tooth surfaces are occlusal, these surfaces develop more than two-thirds of total caries experienced by children. The fate of the bacteria is of significance when they are inadvertently sealed by a dental sealant. This study aimed in examining the antibacterial properties of three commercially available sealants, viz., Teethmate-F, Helioseal-F and Helioseal. Antibacterial testing was done by disc diffusion method. Selective agars were used to grow Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of dental caries. Statistical analysis was carried out using student's t test. The study proved that Helioseal-F and Helioseal did not possess antibacterial properties and Teethmate-F was the only sealant that showed antibacterial properties.
TI  - In vitro inhibition of bacterial growth using different dental adhesive systems.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the antibacterial potential of four different adhesive systems. METHODS & MATERIALS: Gluma Comfort Bond + Desensitizer, Gluma Comfort Bond, iBond and One-Up Bond F were tested against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Actinomyces viscosus. The inhibition of growth by calibrated preparations was quantified by the measurement of zones of inhibition on bacterial lawns. Bactericidal activity was determined as reductions in recoverable colony-forming units in bacterial suspensions exposed to test preparations. RESULTS: All the preparations exhibited detectable zones of inhibition for all target bacteria through six months. When the bactericidal action was evaluated, all the materials were able to kill all the tested bacteria when tested immediately after polymerization. After one week of aging, iBond was the only material that continued to kill all of the test strains.
TI  - Targeted profiling of oral bacteria in human saliva and in vitro biofilms with quantitative real-time PCR.
AB  - An in vitro plaque model based on the use of human salivary bacteria and tooth-like surfaces was previously developed for studying the formation of oral biofilm and its use for pre-clinical testing of candidate antimicrobial or antiplaque agents. In this study, a quantitative Taqman PCR assay (QPCR) was developed to compare the bacterial compositions of in vitro biofilms to parent saliva samples, and to determine the relative contributions of different species in the formation of the oral biofilm. In addition, the growth inhibition of saliva-derived plaque was evaluated by chlorhexidine. With this assay, which consisted of primer/probe sets targeting either 16S rDNA sequences present in public databases or cloned ribosomal intergenic spacer region (ISR) sequences, 15 oral bacteria derived from saliva as well as those that were responsible for biofilm formation in an in vitro plaque model were rapidly identified and quantified. Among the target organisms were Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Micromonas micros, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Tannerella forsythensis, and Veillonella parvula. Primer and probe sets developed were both sensitive and specific. The relative profiles of a number of bacteria in 45-h-old biofilms were determined and, when compared to saliva samples, it was found that most of the bacteria identified in saliva also populated the in vitro plaque, including some anaerobes. Brief exposure of biofilms to chlorhexidine resulted in significant losses in viability. This new broad spectrum QPCR assay in combination with the in vitro plaque model will be of significant value in the quantitative study of the microbial composition of human saliva, saliva-derived plaque, and pre-clinical evaluation of potential antimicrobial and antiplaque molecules.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of peroxide-based bleaching agents.
AB  - Antibacterial activity of 4 commercial bleaching agents (Day White, Colgate Platinum, Whiteness 10% and 16%) on 6 oral pathogens (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus sanguinis, Candida albicans, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus) and Staphylococcus aureus were evaluated. A chlorhexidine solution was used as a positive control, while distilled water was the negative control. Bleaching agents and control materials were inserted in sterilized stainless-steel cylinders that were positioned under inoculated agar plate (n = 4). After incubation according to the appropriate period of time for each microorganism, the inhibition zones were measured. Data were analyzed by 2-way analysis of variance and Tukey test (a = 0.05). All bleaching agents and the chlorhexidine solution produced antibacterial inhibition zones. Antimicrobial activity was dependent on peroxide-based bleaching agents. For most microorganisms evaluated, bleaching agents produced inhibition zones similar to or larger than that observed for chlorhexidine. C albicans, L casei, and L acidophilus were the most resistant microorganisms.
TI  - Supra-gingival microbiota in Sjogren's syndrome.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the microbiota of noncaries associated supra-gingival plaque (SGP) microbiology in Sjogren's syndrome (SS). Stimulated whole saliva (SWS) and full-mouth SGP on intact tooth surfaces were collected from 26 primary (p) SS, 27 secondary (s) SS, and 29 control subjects for selective culture of lactobacilli, mutans streptococci, and aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rods (AGNR). Predominant cultivable anaerobes from SGP of 11 randomly selected subjects from each group were investigated. Clinical and sialometric data were also collected. SS sufferers had significantly lower SWS flow rate and higher mean DMFT (decayed, missing, filled teeth), while pSS subjects also had lower SWS pH and fewer standing teeth. Lactobacillus acidophilus levels in SWS (P = 0.012) and SGP (P < 0.0001) were significantly elevated in pSS sufferers compared with sSS individuals and controls. AGNR isolation was uncommon. SS sufferers had significantly lower proportion of gram-negative species (P = 0.047). Non-oral species were isolated in greater proportions from pSS SGP (P = 0.007). Subjects with pSS harbored increased levels of L. acidophilus and non-oral species, while SS sufferers generally had lower proportions of gram-negative species. The microbial composition of noncaries associated SGP indicates a potential source of increased caries risk in SS.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of four glass ionomer cements used in atraumatic restorative treatment.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of four glass ionomer cements (Fuji IX, Ketac Molar, Vidrion R and Vitromolar) indicated for Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) was studied against strains of bacteria involved in the development of oral diseases, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Actinomyces viscosus. The agar plate diffusion test was used for the cultures, which included chlorhexidine as a positive control. The results demonstrated that all the cements evaluated presented antibacterial activity. Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that Fuji IX and Ketac Molar presented the most effective antibacterial activity considering the ART approach.
TI  - Micronucleus rate of buccal mucosal epithelial cells in relation to oral hygiene  and dental factors.
AB  - Carcinogenesis of squamous cell carcinomas in the upper aero-digestive tract (UADT) is a multi-stage process. Since 1937, micronuclei (MN) have been considered a marker for genome damage in the initiation stage. By help of the micronucleus test, carcinogenic exposure can be proven in the mucosa area of the UADT. The hypothesis to be tested was that individual oral hygiene and the dental status, respectively - just like alcohol and tobacco abuse - are associated with the micronucleus rate in cytological preparations of the buccal mucosa. In a prospective clinical observation study, we determined in 100 probands the micronucleus frequency per 1000 mucosa epithelial cells. Study participants with a high number of missing teeth (M/T index, p=0.037), a below-average papillary bleeding index (PBI, p=0.032) and periodontal status, respectively (PSI, p=0.042) possessed a higher micronucleus number in comparison with restored dental conditions. Probands with composite restorations displayed a higher MN rate (p=0.006) compared to those with amalgam. However, we could not detect any significant relation with the prosthetic status (p> or =0.075). An adjustment was made according to alcohol and tobacco. We therefore conclude that subgingival plaque and synthetic dental materials in addition to chronic alcohol and tobacco consumption might have genotoxic relevance in the oral cavity.
TI  - Molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. METHODS: Samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. On the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. The isolates were determined as Lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16S rDNA. Sequencing of 16S rDNA genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies levels. RESULTS: Predominant species were Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus cellobiosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus gasseri were also present. The isolates Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1, Lactobacillus fermentum BGHO36 and BGHO64, Lactobacillus gasseri BGHO89 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis BGHO99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus flavus, Salmonella enteritidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of Candida albicans. Moreover, the isolates L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 were tolerant to low pH and high concentration of bile salts. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings imply that L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.
TI  - Caries-related plaque microcosm biofilms developed in microplates.
AB  - In vivo dental plaque biofilms consist of complex communities of oral bacteria that are a challenge to replicate in vitro. The aim of this investigation was to establish human dental plaque microcosms in microplates to reflect conditions that are relevant to dental caries. Microcosm plaque biofilms were initiated from the saliva of two different donors, grown for up to 10 days in 24-welled microplates on Thermanox coverslips in various types of artificial saliva with and without sucrose, which were replaced daily. Microbiota composition of 40 species associated with oral health and dental caries was monitored in the plaques using Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization analysis. pH was measured as an indicator of cariogenic potential. The composition of the saliva inocula was different, and yielded plaque microcosms with different composition and growth responses to sucrose. Artificial saliva type and presence of sucrose, and the resulting growth and pH conditions, modified the growth of individual species and hence the ecological profile of the microplate plaques during development. Complex population shifts were observed during development, and older plaques comprised predominantly facultative anaerobic species. Sucrose supplementation limited the decline of Streptococci over time but did not increase the abundance of mutans Streptococci. Sucrose at 0.15% increased levels of caries-associated species including Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Actinomyces gerensceriae; these were further increased with sucrose at 0.5%, in addition to Actinomyces israelii, Rothia dentocariosa and Capnocytophaga gingivalis. The microplate plaques demonstrated complex community dynamics that appeared to reflect the maturation of natural plaques, and sucrose induced a cariogenic plaque composition and pH.
TI  - Incipient caries lesions on cementum by mono- and co-culture oral bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is increasing prevalence of root caries. We hypothesized different biofilms will cause varying demineralization in cementum. This study investigated the extent of demineralization of cementum by oral biofilm formed from three major cariogenic microorganisms: Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Actinomyces israelii. Sound cementum tooth blocks were incubated with mono-, bi-, and tri-species combinations of the bacteria under investigation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The matrix (amide I) and phosphate content of the lesions was analyzed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and calcium and phosphorus levels were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). RESULTS: The log[amide I:HPO(4)(2-) absorbance] values showed that A. israelii mono-culture caused significantly more demineralization than the other bacterial cultures. log[Ca:P] showed that all carious lesions were confined to the cementum. CONCLUSIONS: Oral biofilm arising from bacterial species A. israelii alone was the most cariogenic of those tested and produced the most demineralization in incipient carious lesions in cementum.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrate and nitrite on six common oral pathogens in vitro.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Salivary nitrate is positively correlated with plasma nitrate and its level is 9 times the plasma level after nitrate loading. Nitrate in saliva is known to be reduced to nitrite by oral bacteria. Nitrate and nitrite levels in saliva are 3 - 5 times those in serum in physiological conditions respectively in our previous study. The biological functions of high salivary nitrate and nitrite are still not well understood. The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the antimicrobial effects of nitrate and nitrite on main oral pathogens under acidic conditions. METHODS: Six common oral pathogens including Streptococcus mutans NCTC 10449, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4646, Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277, Capnocytophaga gingivalis ATCC 33624, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953, and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were cultured in liquid medium. Sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite was added to the medium to final concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 10 mmol/L. All of the microorganisms were incubated for 24 to 48 hours. The optical densities (OD) of cell suspensions were determined and the cultures were transferred to solid nutrient broth medium to observe the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration for the six tested pathogens. RESULTS: Nitrite at concentrations of 0.5 to 10 mmol/L had an inhibitory effect on all tested organisms at low pH values. The antimicrobial effect of nitrite increased with the acidity of the medium. Streptococcus mutans NCTC 10449 was highly sensitive to nitrite at low pH values. Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4646 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were relatively resistant to acidified nitrite. Nitrate at the given concentrations and under acidic conditions had no inhibitory effect on the growth of any of the tested pathogens. CONCLUSION: Nitrite, at a concentration equal to that in human saliva, is both cytocidal and cytostatic to six principal oral pathogens in vitro, whereas nitrate at a similar concentration has no antimicrobial effect on these organisms.
TI  - The effectiveness of alumina powder on carious dentin removal.
AB  - This study determined the size of aluminum oxide particles used in an air abrasion system that is able to remove carious dentin tissue with maximum preservation of sound structure. Thirty extracted and carious-free third molars were used in this study. The dentin sample was obtained by sectioning the middle of the crown longitudinal to the long axis of the tooth in a mesio-distal direction. One half of the crown corresponded to the sound dentin group (SD), while the other half was used to develop artificial caries, constituting the carious dentin group (CD). The specimens were air abraded for 15 seconds. The SD and CD groups were each randomly divided into three subgroups (N=10) according to the particle diameter employed (27, 50 and 125 microm). The prepared cavity was perpendicularly cut in half, and the profiles of all hemi-fragments were observed using SEM microscopy. The cavity measurements were made using a modified cephalometric analysis. The 27, 50 and 125 microm aluminum oxide particles did not present selectivity in the removal of carious dentin. However, when using the air abrasive technique for carious dentin treatment, the use of 27 and 50 microm aluminum oxide particles is recommended, due to their capacity to remove less sound tissue than the 125 microm particles.
TI  - Effect of oral bacteria on growth and survival of Candida albicans biofilms.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of eight aerobic and anaerobic oral commensal bacterial species on in vitro Candida albicans biofilm development. A single isolate of C. albicans 2560 g, and eight different species of oral bacteria comprising, Actinomyces israelii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Prevotella nigrescens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus intermedius were studied using an in vitro biofilm assay. Biofilm formation was quantified in terms of the ability of Candida to grow on polystyrene plastic surfaces co-cultured with the foregoing bacteria. A viable cell count was used to quantify the sessile yeast growth and scanning electron microscopy was employed to confirm and visualize biofilm formation. Co-culture with differing concentrations of bacteria had variable effects on Candida biofilm formation. Co-culture with the highest concentrations of each of the foregoing bacteria resulted in a consistent reduction in the yeast counts in the candidal biofilm (P<0.05), except for L. acidophilus, S. mutans, and, S. intermedius co-cultures. Further, on regression analysis a significant negative correlation between the co-culture concentration of either P. gingivalis or E. coli and viable yeast counts in the biofilm was noted (P<0.05) although this was not evident for the other bacterial species. Taken together, our data indicate that, quantitative and qualitative nature of the bacteria modulate C. albicans biofilm formation in mixed species environments such as the oral cavity.
TI  - Effects of sonic energy on monospecific biofilms of cariogenic microorganisms.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the in vitro differential effect of sonic energy, delivered  by Sonicare Advance, on cariogenic and non-cariogenic bacteria biofilms. METHODS: A wild strain of Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus salivarius and Veillonella alcalescens was isolated from human dental plaque. For each of the four microorganisms a biofilm adherent to bovine enamel disks, coated with artificial saliva, was obtained. Biofilms were divided into four groups and were exposed to acoustic energy delivered by Sonicare for 0 (control group), 5, 15 and 30 seconds. The distance between the end of the bristles and the disk surface was set to 7 mm, to ensure that the biofilm removal was simply due to fluid forces and not to the contact with the bristle tips during the brushing cycle. A colorimetric technique (MTT assay), based on the reduction of a yellow tetrazolium salt to a purple formazan, was used to evaluate the reduction of the adherent biomass after the exposure to the sonic energy. RESULTS: ANOVA results showed that sonic energy exposure significantly reduced the biomass of S. mutans and S. salivarius adherent to the disks, while L. acidophilus and V. alcalescens seemed to remain basically unaffected. In the two streptococcal groups, the increase of the exposure time led to different reduction trends; while S. salivarius exhibited a progressive decrease over time, S. mutans showed a rapid reduction of the adherent biomass after a 15-second exposure to Sonicare.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antibacterial activity of Arctium lappa as a phytotherapeutic agent used in intracanal dressings.
AB  - The discovery of natural biocomponents from plants with antibacterial activity on endodontic microbiota may lead to new therapies. This study evaluated the antibacterial activity of a phytotherapeutic agent prepared from an ethyl acetate fraction (AcOEt) extracted from Arctium lappa. This agent was compared with calcium hydroxide as an intracanal dressing. Twenty-seven maxillary canines were instrumented, sterilized and inoculated with a mixed bacterial suspension of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans. The teeth were divided into three groups and their canals filled with: group 1, calcium hydroxide and propylene glycol; group 2, a paste containing AcOEt fraction of A. lappa and propylene glycol; group 3, propylene glycol (control). At 7, 14 and 30 days, three teeth from each group were opened and a paper point was placed in the root canal for 5 min. The paper points were transferred to Petri dishes with Brain Heart Infusion (BHI). The bacterial growth was classified. Mild bacterial growth was found in group 1 at all time intervals; in group 2 there was severe growth at 7 days, but no growth at 14 and 30 days. The phytotherapeutic agent extracted from an AcOEt fraction of A. lappa inhibited the growth of all the microorganisms in this study.
TI  - Anticariogenic activity of macelignan isolated from Myristica fragrans (nutmeg) against Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The occurrence of dental caries is mainly associated with oral pathogens, especially cariogenic Streptococcus mutans. Preliminary antibacterial screening revealed that the extract of Myristica fragrans, widely cultivated for the spice and flavor of foods, possessed strong inhibitory activity against S. mutans. The anticariogenic compound was successfully isolated from the methanol extract of M. fragrans by repeated silica gel chromatography, and its structure was identified as macelignan by instrumental analysis using 1D-NMR, 2D-NMR and EI-MS. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of macelignan against S. mutans was 3.9 microg/ml, which was much lower than those of other natural anticariogenic agents such as 15.6 microg/ml of sanguinarine, 250 microg/ml of eucalyptol, 500 microg/ml of menthol and thymol, and 1000 microg/ml of methyl salicylate. Macelignan also possessed preferential activity against other oral microorganisms such as Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei in the MIC range of 2-31.3 microg/ml. In particular, the bactericidal test showed that macelignan, at a concentration of 20 microg/ml, completely inactivated S. mutans in 1 min. The specific activity and fast-effectiveness of macelignan against oral bacteria strongly suggest that it could be employed as a natural antibacterial agent in functional foods or oral care products.
TI  - Inhibitory activity of glass-ionomer cements on cariogenic bacteria.
AB  - This study evaluated the antibacterial activity of the glass-ionomer cements Vitrebond (3M ESPE), Ketac Molar (3M ESPE) and Fuji IX (GC America) against S mutans, S sobrinus, L acidophilus and A viscosus, using the agar diffusion test. Inocula were obtained by the seed of indicators cultures in BHI broth incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. Base layers containing 15 mL of BHI agar and 300 microL of each bacteria suspension were prepared in Petri dishes. Six wells measuring 4 mm in diameter were made in each plate and completely filled with one of the testing materials. A 0.2% chlorhexidine solution applied in round filter papers was used as control. Tests were performed 12 times for each material and bacteria strain. After incubation of the plates at 37 degrees C for 24 hours, the zones of bacterial growth inhibition around the wells were measured. Overall, the results showed the following sequence of antibacterial activity: Vitrebond (despite the activation mode) > 0.2% chlorhexidine > Ketac Molar > Fuji IX, according to Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney statistical tests. This study confirmed significant antibacterial activity for two conventional glass-ionomers and one resin-modified glass-ionomer material. The resin-modified glass-ionomer cement Vitrebond, regardless of the activation mode, presented the best antibacterial activity against S mutans and S sobrinus. The antibacterial activity against A viscosus for Vitrebond was similar to 0.2% chlorhexidine, while light activation reduced its antibacterial activity against L acidophilus.
TI  - Oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. However, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. We aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative oral pathogens. METHODS: A total of 238 Lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. In all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis. Antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia was assessed. RESULTS: Lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. The most prevalent strains in healthy persons were Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, Lactobacillus plantarum. Obligately homofermentatives, particularly L. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for L. gasseri, P < 0.01). Sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited S. mutans, 88% A. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% P. gingivalis and 65% P. intermedia. The strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with Lactobacillus paracasei, L. plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus salivarius. The strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against S. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. CONCLUSION: The composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly L. gasseri, in the latter group. Both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of MDPB and fluoride in dentin bonding agents.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare in vitro antibacterial activity of MDPB containing bonding system ABF with activities of three Fluoride containing bonding systems (Fuji Bond LC (FBLC), Prime&Bond NT (PBNT), and FluoroBond (FLB). Two bacterial strains were tested: Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus. The study was performed on Muller Hinton Agar by Agar Well Technique. The bacterial agar was evenly distributed over the surface of petri dishes. Standard wells were punched into the agar. The test materials were placed in the wells of Muller Hinton agar plates, inoculated with Streptococcus mutans NCTC10449 and Lactobacillus acidophilus. The diameters of inhibition zones produced around the materials were measured after 24 h of incubation at 37 +/- 1 degrees C. For statistical analysis, Duncan's multiple range test was used. The primers of bonding agents were highly effective against to Streptococcus mutans. The MDPB containing primer of ABF Bond produced the greatest inhibition zones against to Lactobacillus acidophilus. It was followed by FLB primer. Lactobacillus acidophilus was resistant to FBLC primer and bonding, ABF, PBNT and FLB bonding agents. The results of this study indicated that, incorporation of MDPB in primer of self-etch system increased its antibacterial activity especially against to Lactobacillus acidophilus. However, all bonding systems except for bonding agent of ABF showed some antibacterial activity against to Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and tightness of a DCPD-CaO-based hydraulic calcium phosphate cement for root canal filling.
AB  - Calcium hydroxide is currently used in dentistry for endodontic treatments where  its main advantage is its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity. However, it also has some drawbacks such as pulp necrosis, slight solubility, slow and insufficient hardening, and retraction on drying. In consequence, it is used only as temporary material for root canal disinfection. By mixing calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (CaHPO4 . 2H2O, also called dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, DCPD) and calcium oxide with a sodium phosphate buffer as liquid phase, we obtained a CPC with better mechanical properties than calcium hydroxide pastes. The setting reaction produced either hydroxyapatite (HA) or a mixture of HA and calcium hydroxide depending on the relative masses of DCPD and CaO in the cement powder. The presence of calcium hydroxide a priori confers antimicrobial properties to this cement which were investigated in agar plates (diffusion method) against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus hominis (clinical isolates), and a preparation of polymicrobial flora isolated from dental plaque. The cement samples tested were prepared at molar calcium-to-phosphate ratios (Ca/P) of 1.67 to 2.75. A pure calcium hydroxide paste was used as reference material. Clear and reproducible bacterial growth inhibition was observed for cement samples with Ca/P > or = 2 against all the microorganisms tested. With Ca/P = 2.5, this cement alkalinizes dentinal tubules and provides a fluid-tight sealing that well compares with sealing obtained using a zinc oxide-eugenol cement without gutta-percha point. DCPD-CaO-based cement is therefore a potential root canal filler.
TI  - Salivary Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 and Lactobacillus casei levels predict pregnancy outcomes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gravida's poor periodontal health is emerging as a modifiable independent risk factor for preterm delivery and low birth weight. METHODS: To test the hypothesis that oral bacteria other than periodontal pathogens are also associated with pregnancy outcomes, specific oral bacterial levels measured during pregnancy were evaluated in relation to gestational age and birth weight while controlling for demographic, medical, and dental variables. The study population consisted of 297 predominantly African- American women who were pregnant for the first time. The salivary bacterial levels evaluated were Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus sanguinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies (gsp) 1 and 2, total streptococci, and total cultivable organisms. RESULTS: For 1 unit increase in log(10) A. naeslundii gsp 2 levels, there was a 60 gm decrease in birth weight (beta = -59.7 g; SE = 29.1; P = 0.04), and a 0.17 week decrease in gestational age (beta = -0.17 wk; SE = 0.09; P = 0.05). In contrast, per 1 unit increase in log(10) L. casei levels, there was a 42 gm increase in birth weight (beta = 42.2 g; SE = 19.3; P = 0.03), and a 0.13 week increase in gestational age (beta = 0.13 week; SE = 0.06; P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that other oral bacterial species can also be related to pregnancy outcomes in addition to previously reported periodontal pathogens. These organism levels may not only predict poor pregnancy outcomes, but also be used as modifiable risk factors in reducing prematurity and low birth weight.
TI  - Antimicrobial substantivity of cavity disinfectants.
AB  - This study involved a comparative examination of different disinfectant solutions and their antimicrobial substantivity against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Candida albicans. All of the disinfectants containing chlorhexidine and benzalkonium chloride demonstrated substantive antibacterial activity. Chlorhexidine-based solutions displayed the longest and most effective antimicrobial activity.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of probiotics microorganisms adhesion to an artificial caries model.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This in vitro study compared the adhesion of two probiotics microorganisms (Lactobacillus casei Shirota and Lactobacillus acidophilus) to an artificial caries model. METHOD: In total, 30 bovine teeth were longitudinally sectioned, excluding the lingual half surface. The specimens were covered with nail varnish, except for an area of 3 by 5 mm in dentin, suspended in an artificial caries solution promoted by Streptococcus mutans, and incubated at 37 degrees C. After 14 days, the specimens were separated equally into two groups and transferred to a brain heart infusion culture media containing L. acidophilus (group A) and L. casei Shirota (group S), at 37 degrees C. After 48 h, the exposed area of dentin was washed with 1 ml of distilled water and the caries dentin was removed and dispersed in 1 ml of saline solution. The samples of distilled water and caries dentin were diluted and inoculated in Rogosa selective Lactobacillus agar. The results in CFU/ml were analysed by the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between Groups A and S for the lactobacilli count in samples of distilled water (P = 0.237). CONCLUSIONS: The amount of L. acidophilus in the artificially caries dentin was significantly superior compared to L. casei Shirota (P = 0.047), suggesting an inferior adhesion potential for this microorganism.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of different generation dentin-bonding systems.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the antibacterial activities of different generation dentin-bonding systems. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The antibacterial activities of dentin-bonding systems Optibond FL Primer, Single Bond, Clearfil SE Bond Primer, and Prompt-L-Pop were evaluated against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Cervitec (1% chlorhexidine varnish) was also examined as a positive control material. Disk diffusion tests with filter paper disks (n = 10) containing a drop of each material (20 microL) were used. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 48 hours, the growth inhibition zones were measured in millimeters. RESULTS: Of all the materials tested, Optibond FL Primer, Clearfil SE Bond Primer, and Prompt-LPop showed larger growth inhibition zones than the control material for all bacterial strains. No antibacterial effect was noted for Single Bond. The results indicated that Optibond FL Primer had the strongest effect against the S mutans and L casei, and Clearfil SE Bond Primer produced the largest inhibition zone for S salivarius and L acidophilus among the test materials. CONCLUSION: The antibacterial effects observed for the tested different generation dentin-bonding systems may be related to the acidic nature of the materials.
TI  - Influence of dentin on the effectiveness of antibacterial agents.
AB  - The influence of dentin on the effectiveness of three antibacterial agents (triclosan, glutaraldehyde, NaOCl) on Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus was tested using the agar diffusion method with and without bovine dentin discs (200 mum and 500 mum thickness) placed between bacteria and test substances. The effect of 0.3% triclosan on all tester strains (100%) was reduced after passage through 500 mum dentin discs to 0% (L. acidophilus) and to 22% and 28% (S. mutans and S. sobrinus). Seal&Protect (Dentsply, Konstanz, Germany), a triclosan containing dental bonding agent, produced inhibition zones only against S. mutans, but no zone when applied on 200 mum dentin discs. The inhibition zones for 1% NaOCl and 5% glutaraldehyde against all tester strains were significantly increased up to 230% (glutaraldehyde) and 236% (NaOCl) when applied on dentin discs, compared to direct application (100%). Dentin may either decrease or increase the inhibitory effect of antibacterial agents.
TI  - Effects of cecropin-XJ on growth and adherence of oral cariogenic bacteria in vitro.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cecropin-XJ belongs to cecropin-B, which is the most potent antibacterial peptide found naturally. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cecropin-XJ on growth and adherence of oral cariogenic bacteria. METHODS: Four oral cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces naeslundii) were chosen for this experiment. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and reductive percent of bacterial growth were used to assay the antibacterial activity of cecropin-XJ. Mammalian cytotoxicity of cecropin-XJ was tested with human periodontal membrane fibroblasts by tetrazolium (MTT) colorimetric assay. The bacterial morphological changes induced by cecropin-XJ were examined on scanning electron microscope (SEM). The influence of cecropin-XJ on bacterial adhesion to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (S-HA) was measured by scintillation counting. RESULTS: The MICs of cecropin-XJ for inhibition of the growth of four bacteria ranged from 4.0 to 42.8 micromol/L with the highest susceptible to A. naeslundii and the lowest susceptible to L. acidophilus. At pH 6.8, 5.5 and 8.2, 1/2 MIC of cecropin-XJ reduced the number of viable bacteria by 40.9%, 67.8% and 32.8% for S. mutans and by 28.1%, 57.2% and 37.9% for L. acidophilus. The activities against S. mutans and L. acidophilus increased at pH 5.5 compared with pH 6.8 (P < 0.01, respectively). In present of 50% saliva, 1/2 MIC of the peptide decreased the direct count of viable cells by 29.2% and 14.4% for S. mutans and L. acidophilus, respectively (P < 0.01 and P > 0.05, respectively), whereas almost no reduction counts were detected in the presence of 20% serum for both bacteria (P > 0.05, respectively). Mammalian cytotoxicity of cecropin-XJ from 1.0 to 100 micromol/L exhibited no cytotoxicity against human periodontal membrane fibroblasts (P > 0.05). Bacterial morphological changes induced by MIC of cecropin-XJ examined on SEM showed cell surface disruption. Furthermore, the ability of A. naeslundii adhesion to S-HA decreased significantly with MIC of cecropin-XJ for 10 and 20 minutes (P = 0.001 and 0.000, respectively), and S. mutans, A. viscosus to S-HA decreased significantly with MIC of cecropin-XJ for 20 minutes (P = 0.000, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Cecropin-XJ exhibited bactericidal action against cariogenic pathogens, and the antibacterial activity enhanced in the acid environment. The results also demonstrate that cecropin-XJ prevents S. mutans and actinomyces adsorption to S-HA. These findings suggest that Cecropin-XJ may have potential to prevent caries.
TI  - In vitro growth, acidogenicity and cariogenicity of predominant human root caries flora.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans (Sm), Lactobacillus acidophilus (La) and Actinomyces israelii (Ai) have been associated with root surface caries, which is an increasing problem in elderly Chinese. The aim of this study therefore, was to evaluate in vitro, the growth, acidogenicity and cariogenicity of these organisms, both in mono- and co-cultures using an in vitro model. Forty-eight root specimens were prepared using intact extracted human molars. Fresh, wild-type bacteria obtained from root caries lesions were assembled into seven experimental groups as either mono- or co-cultures and incubated with the root specimens. Appropriate controls were included. Growth curve of each experimental group was monitored for 24h, aerobically, at 37 degrees C using a microplate reader. The pH of the medium was recorded after 24-h incubation using a pH meter. Mean depths of artificial root lesions produced in each cultural group were measured using polarized light microscopy in specimens cut into thin sections (100+/-20 microm). Compared with mono-cultures, synergistic growth was observed in co-cultures of 'La+Sm', 'Ai+La' and 'Ai+La+Sm'. Mean lesion depth produced in La group was significantly shallower than other mono- or co-culture groups (p<0.01). The pH values of all culture media were similar after 24-h incubation. The current data elucidate the complex interactions of three predominant bacterial species considered prime agents of human root surface caries.
TI  - Study of a hydraulic calcium phosphate cement for dental applications.
AB  - Calcium phosphate-based cements (CPCs) have attracted much interest because of their good osteoconductivity for bone reconstruction. We obtained CPCs by mixing calcium bis-dihydrogenophosphate monohydrate (MCPM) and calcium oxide with water or sodium phosphate buffers (NaP) as liquid phase. Cement samples with different calcium-to-phosphate ratios (Ca/P), liquid-to-powder ratios (L/P) and liquid phases were analyzed by X-rays diffraction (XRD), pH-metry, extensometry and calorimetry. Antibacterial activity on two bacterial strains (Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus) and a polycontaminated bacterial inoculum was also studied using the agar diffusion method. The best mechanical properties (approximately 25 MPa) corresponded to Ca/P ratios between 1.67 and 2.5, a 1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7, as liquid phase and a L/P ratio of 0.6ml g(-1). The final setting time increased with the Ca/P ratio. The setting expansion, around 1-2%, depended on the Ca/P and L/P ratios. The inner temperature of the cements rose to 45 degrees during setting then decreased rapidly. The injectability was 100% up to 3.5 min and then decreased. It increased with increasing the L/P ratio but to the detriment of the compressive strength and setting time. XRD analysis indicated that the setting reaction led to a mixture of calcium hydroxide and calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite even for a Ca/P ratio of 1.67. Consequently, the pH of the surrounding fluids rose to 11.5-12 during their dissolution. Bacterial growth inhibition was only clearly observed for Ca/P>or=2. This bioactive calcium phosphate cement can potentially be employed for pulp capping and cavity lining as classical calcium hydroxide-based cements, but it is not usable, in the present formulation, for root canal filling because of its short setting time.
TI  - Salivary IgA to cariogenic bacteria in HIV-positive children and its correlation  with caries prevalence and levels of cariogenic microorganisms.
AB  - The interrelationship of HIV infection, dental caries and mucosal immune responses remains controversial. In our study population of 40 HIV-infected and 40 healthy control children (ages 2-5 years) there was a significantly higher prevalence of dental caries in HIV-infected children (P<0.05). The extent of caries correlated with the severity of HIV disease. To determine whether the immunosuppression that ensues after HIV infection could contribute to the increased caries prevalence, the concentrations of total IgA and IgA specific to cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and Lactobacillus acidophilus) were determined in whole saliva by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Levels of the same bacteria were also quantified in saliva using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. A significantly increased level of total salivary IgA was found in the HIV-positive population (P < 0.05), but there were comparable titers of specific IgA to cariogenic bacteria in HIV-positive and healthy controls. The microbiological assessment also demonstrated similar levels of cariogenic microorganisms in both groups. We conclude that HIV-positive children appear to maintain the capacity to mount a mucosal immune response to cariogenic microorganisms, at least until late stages of disease.
TI  - Effect of dentin on the antibacterial activity of dentin bonding agents.
AB  - Dentin bonding agents with antibacterial effects may inhibit secondary caries formation and pulp inflammation by eliminating residual bacteria in and on dentin. Therefore, the antibacterial effects of Prime & Bond NT (PB), Prime & Bond NT without fluoride (PBNF), Gluma Comfort Bond (GL), ABF, Xeno CF II (XE), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEG-DMA), and 0.2% chlorhexidine were tested against Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus using the agar-diffusion method with and without bovine-dentin disks (200 microm and 500 microm thickness) placed between the bacteria and the test substances. Without dentin, ABF Primer showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. XE inhibited S. mutans and S. sobrinus, and PB S. sobrinus. ABF Bonding inhibited L. acidophilus. PBNF, HEMA, and TEGDMA did not have any antibacterial effects. Dentin disks of 500 microm thickness reduced the inhibitory effect of chlorhexidine to 23% to 54% compared with direct application. ABF Primer (nonpolymerized) produced inhibition zones against all tester strains regardless of dentin disks interposed or not. XE (against S. mutans and S. sobrinus) and PB (against S. sobrinus) did not produce any inhibition zones on 200 microm thick dentin. After polymerization, the ABF system did not inhibit bacterial growth on 200 microm thick dentin disks. A dentin barrier reduces significantly the antibacterial activity of chlorhexidine and dentin bonding agents.
TI  - [Dynamic observation of periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria in modified chemostat using confocal laser scanning microscopy].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study dynamic relation between periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria under analogous oral environment. METHODS: Eight periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Provotella intermedium (Pi), Streptococcus mutans (Sm), Streptococcus sanguis (Ss), Actinomyces viscosus (Av) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (La) were used. These eight strains were cultured in modified chemostat under analogous oral environment which contained 600 ml modified BM medium supplemented with 2.5 g/L porcine gastric mucin, respectively. After 1, 24, 48 and 96 h, optical sectioning of plaque biofilms on removable and replaceable hydroxyapatite disks was analyzed by the combination of live bacterial Gram fluorescence staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Biofilm thickness and reconstruction of the three-dimensional architecture of plaque biofilms were made. RESULTS: Biofilm thickness increased significantly with time (P < 0.001). Biofilms of Aa were thinner than those of Ss and eight-specie biofilms were thicker than those formed by Ss and Aa per time point. Three-dimensional images showed periodontal pathogens mainly occurred in cariogenic bacterial complex or on the biofilm surface. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-positive cariogenic species initially predominated in artificial plaque, followed by the increasing proportions of Gram-negative periodontal pathogens. The relation between microecological balance among bacteria and diseases is worthy of further studies.
TI  - Microbiology and management of endodontic infections in children.
AB  - The first step in the origination of caries is the formation of a dental plaque.  Dental caries can lead to destruction of enamel and dentin resulting in bacterial invasion of the pulp. Invasion of the pulp and the periapical areas can promote the development of dento-alveolar abscess and spread of the infection to other anatomical areas. Several oral acid producing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Actinomyces viscosus, are capable of initiating the carious lesion. The organisms that predominate in pulpitis and dento-alveolar abscess are Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. Treatment of caries involves removal of all affected tooth structure and proper replacement with a restorative material. Once pulpitis has developed the infected tissue should be removed and root canal therapy instituted, or the tooth should be extracted. Extraction, root canal therapy and/or drainage of pus usually are indicated for an abscess. Antimicrobial therapy supplementing the dental care should be considered, especially when local or systemic spread of the infection is suspected. Penicillin or amoxicillin are generally effective against most of the aerobic and anaerobic bacteria recovered. The patient whose oral cavity may harbor penicillin-resistant organisms should be considered for treatment with drugs effective against these organisms. These agents include amoxicillin-clavulanate, clindamycin or the combination of metronidazole plus amoxicillin or a macrolide.
TI  - Activity of human beta-defensin 3 alone or combined with other antimicrobial agents against oral bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activities of human beta-defensin 3 (hBD-3) alone or combined with lysozyme, metronidazole, amoxicillin, and chlorhexidine were investigated with the oral bacteria Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. hBD-3 showed bactericidal activity against all of the bacterial species tested. The bactericidal effect was enhanced when the peptide was used in combination with the antimicrobial agents mentioned above.
TI  - Microbial ingrowth around single- and multi-component adhesives studied in vitro.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the in vitro microbial leakage in 4 micro-hybrid composites in combination with 4 single-component dental adhesives (Scotchbond 1/Z100 MP = group 1; Syntac Single-Component/Tetric Flow = group 3; OptiBond Solo/XRV Herculite = group 5; Solobond M/Arabesk Top = group 7) and 4 multi-component dental adhesives (Scotchbond Multi-Purpose/Z100 MP = group 2; Syntac/Tetric Flow = group 4; OptiBond FL/XRV Herculite = group 6; Solobond Plus/Arabesk Top = group 8). Ninety-four mixed standardized Class V cavities of human caries-free extracted premolars were filled with eight different composite adhesive systems using a one-layer (groups 1-4) or a two-layer technique (groups 5-8). After thermocycling and incubation in a broth culture of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus, followed by decalcification and staining, the extent and the type of microbial leakage were measured histologically. The extent of microbial leakage in the composite restorations was very low in all groups and there were no significant differences between adhesives. Z100 MP in combination with single- and multi-component adhesives showed a significantly higher microbial leakage than Tetric Flow systems (U test: p=0.037). XRV Herculite adhesive systems showed significantly less extensive microbial leakage than Arabesk Top adhesive systems (U test: p<0.001). The single-component dental adhesives achieved a marginal adaptation of composites comparable to that of multi-component adhesives in vitro.
TI  - Functional and comparative genomic analyses of an operon involved in fructooligosaccharide utilization by Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus is a probiotic organism that displays the ability to use prebiotic compounds such as fructooligosaccharides (FOS), which stimulate the growth of beneficial commensals in the gastrointestinal tract. However, little is known about the mechanisms and genes involved in FOS utilization by Lactobacillus species. Analysis of the L. acidophilus NCFM genome revealed an msm locus composed of a transcriptional regulator of the LacI family, a four-component ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport system, a fructosidase, and a sucrose phosphorylase. Transcriptional analysis of this operon demonstrated that gene expression was induced by sucrose and FOS but not by glucose or fructose, suggesting some specificity for nonreadily fermentable sugars. Additionally, expression was repressed by glucose but not by fructose, suggesting catabolite repression via two cre-like sequences identified in the promoter-operator region. Insertional inactivation of the genes encoding the ABC transporter substrate-binding protein and the fructosidase reduced the ability of the mutants to grow on FOS. Comparative analysis of gene architecture within this cluster revealed a high degree of synteny with operons in Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, the association between a fructosidase and an ABC transporter is unusual and may be specific to L. acidophilus. This is a description of a previously undescribed gene locus involved in transport and catabolism of FOS compounds, which can promote competition of beneficial microorganisms in the human gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of self-etching primer-bonding systems.
AB  - Self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. The antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers Clearfil SE Bond, Mac Bond, Imperva FL Bond, One-Up BondF and Prompt L-Pop were evaluated using the bacteria Streptococcus mutans ATCC25175, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus catenaforme, Lactobacillus jensenii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Clostridium ramosum, Prevotella oris, Prevotella denticola and Fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. A single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (Excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. After incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. One-Up BondF, Prompt L-Pop and Excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. The bonding agents of Clearfil SE Bond, Mac Bond and Imperva FL Bond were unable to inhibit the growth of Lactobacillus jensenii and Actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.
TI  - Inhibitory effects on selected oral bacteria of antibacterial agents incorporated in a glass ionomer cement.
AB  - The objectives of the study were to investigate the antimicrobial efficacy, over  time, of combining antibacterial agents with a glass ionomer cement (GIC). This was assessed using an agar diffusion test. Chlorhexidine hydrochloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, cetrimide and benzalkonium chloride were added to Fuji IX GIC at 0, 1, 2 and 4% w/w. Antibacterial-GIC specimens were placed onto agar plates inoculated with one of six bacterial species (Streptococcis, Lactobacillus, and Actinomyces, two each) and the area of inhibition calculated after 24 h incubation. The experiment was repeated weekly and at week 11 the surface of the specimen was abraded prior to replacing on inoculated agar plates. Control specimens of the GIC produced no bacterial inhibition. The antibacterial-GIC combination specimens showed significant inhibition which decreased at different rates over the test period. Resurfacing of the specimens showed a dramatic increase of antibacterial action similar to levels produced on week 1. CT-GIC showed the greatest (p < 0.005) inhibitory effect throughout the experimental period for 4 out of 6 test bacteria. The addition of antibacterial agents to Fuji IX creates a GIC material with significant antimicrobial action in vitro which is dependent on concentration and type of antibacterial agent, and appears to be associated primarily with a release of the antibacterial from the surface layer of the specimen.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of a hydraulic calcium phosphate cement for dental applications.
AB  - Calcium hydroxide is currently used in dentistry for endodontic treatment where its main advantage consists of its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory potency. However, it also has some drawbacks such as pulp necrosis, slight solubility, slow and low hardening, and retraction on drying. Since the studies conducted by Brown and Chow (IADR 1983, abst. 207), calcium phosphate-based cements (CPC) have attracted considerable interest in bone reconstruction because of their good osteoconductivity. By mixing calcium bis-dihydrogenphosphate monohydrate (MCPM) and calcium oxide with sodium phosphate buffer in the form of liquid phase, we obtained a CPC with better mechanical properties than calcium hydroxide. The setting reaction produced a mixture of calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite and calcium hydroxide, making this cement more suitable for dental applications than orthopedic ones. The presence of calcium hydroxide a priori confers antibacterial properties to this cement, which were investigated in agar plates (diffusion method) against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Candida albicans (clinical isolates) and a preparation of polymicrobial flora isolated from dental plaque. The cement samples tested were prepared at calcium-to-phosphate molar ratios (Ca/P) ranging from 1.67 to 2.75. A pure calcium hydroxide paste was used as reference material. Clear and reproducible bacterial growth inhibition was observed for cement samples with Ca/P > or = 2 against all the microorganisms tested. MCPM-CaO-based cement is therefore a potential candidate for pulp capping and cavity lining.
TI  - Correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult Sudanese.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult Sudanese. Whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 Sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). Levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. There were significantly ( P< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus salivarius, and Leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( P< or =0.01) lower percentages with Treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. The detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for Selenomonas sputigena, S. anginosus, Streptococcus sanguis, and S. salivarius and significantly lower for Porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( P< or =0.01). Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( P< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. This study indicates that the levels of P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and S. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and subgingival plaque.
TI  - Microbial profile on metallic and ceramic bracket materials.
AB  - The placement of orthodontic appliances creates a favorable environment for the accumulation of a microbiota and food residues, which, in time, may cause caries or exacerbate any pre-existing periodontal disease. The purpose of the present study was to compare the total bacterial counts present on metallic and ceramic orthodontic brackets in order to clarify which bracket type has a higher plaque retaining capacity and to determine the levels of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp on both types of brackets. Thirty-two metallic brackets and 24 ceramic brackets were collected from orthodontic patients at the day of debonding. Two brackets were collected from each patient; one from a maxillary central incisor and another from a maxillary second premolar. Sixteen patients who used metallic brackets and 12 patients who used ceramic brackets were sampled. Bacterial populations were studied using "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization, which uses DNA probes to identify species in complex microbial samples. The significance of differences between groups was determined using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Results showed no significant differences between metallic and ceramic brackets with respect to the caries-inducing S mutans and L acidophilus spp counts. Mean counts of 8 of 35 additional species differed significantly between metallic and ceramic brackets with no obvious pattern favoring one bracket type over the other. This study showed higher mean counts of Treponema denticola, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii, Streptococcus anginosus, and Eubacterium nodatum on metallic brackets while higher counts of Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter showae, and Selenomonas noxia were found on ceramic brackets.
TI  - A mixed-bacteria ecological approach to understanding the role of the oral bacteria in dental caries causation: an alternative to Streptococcus mutans and the specific-plaque hypothesis.
AB  - For more than 100 years, investigators have tried to identify the bacteria responsible for dental caries formation and to determine whether their role is one of specificity. Frequent association of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus mutans with caries activity gave credence to their being specific cariogens. However, dental caries occurrence in their absence, and the presence of other bacteria able to produce substantial amounts of acid from fermentable carbohydrate, provided arguments for non-specificity. In the 1940s, Stephan found that the mixed bacteria in dental plaque produced a rapid drop in pH following a sugar rinse and a slow pH return toward baseline. This response became a cornerstone of plaque and mixed-bacterial involvement in dental caries causation when Stephan showed that the pH decrease was inversely and clearly related to caries activity. Detailed examination of the pH (acid-base) metabolisms of oral pure cultures, dental plaque, and salivary sediment identified the main bacteria and metabolic processes responsible for the pH metabolism of dental plaque. It was discovered that this metabolism in different individuals, in plaque in different dentition locations within individuals, and in individuals of different levels of caries activity could be described in terms of a relatively small number of acid-base metabolic processes. This led to an overall bacterial metabolic vector concept for dental plaque, and helped unravel the bacterial involvement in the degradation of the carbohydrate and nitrogenous substrates that produce the acids and alkali that affect the pH and favor and inhibit dental caries production, respectively. A central role of oral arginolytic and non-arginolytic acidogens in the production of the Stephan pH curve was discovered. The non-arginolytics could produce only the pH fall part of this curve, whereas the arginolytics could produce both the fall and the rise. The net result of the latter was a less acidic Stephan pH curve. Both kinds of bacteria are numerous in dental plaque. By varying their ratios, we were easily able to produce Stephan pH curves indicative of different levels of caries activity. This and substantial related metabolic and microbial data indicated that it is the proportions and numbers of acid-base-producing bacteria that are at the core of dental caries activity. The elimination of S. mutans, as with a vaccine, was considered to have little chance of success in preventing dental caries in humans, since, in most cases, this would simply make more room for one or more of the many acidogens remaining. An understanding of mixed-bacterial metabolism, knowledge of how to manipulate and work with mixed bacteria, and the use of a bacterial metabolic vector approach as described in this article have led to (1) a more ecological focus for dealing with dental caries, and (2) new means of developing and evaluating anti-caries agents directed toward microbial mixtures that counter excess acid accumulation and tooth demineralization.
TI  - Effect of fluoride on cariogenic oral microorganisms (an in vitro study).
AB  - The effect of sodium fluoride and sodium monofluorophosphate at concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 50, 100 and 1000 mg/l in phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) as well as in UHT milk were studied on cultures and suspensions of Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Candida albicans. Using serial tenfold dilutions up to 10(-7) of 24-48 hour cultures, a subsequent 0, 60 and 120 min incubation caused no decrease in the number of CFUs. Growth kinetic studies in the Bioscreen biophotometer (Labsystem, Finland) revealed that sodium fluoride in different concentrations (from 0.875 mg/l up to 500 mg/l) influenced the growth dynamics of S. mutans and C. albicans: the exponential phase flattened out at the highest fluoride concentrations (500 mg/l) present in the growth media. The lag phase of C. albicans became longer. The results of these experiments indicate that sodium fluoride administered at higher concentrations than the usual caries preventive dosage made the generation time of cariogenic oral bacteria and fungi longer, slowing down their multiplication.
TI  - Salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in Sudanese adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult Sudanese subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. The periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. Whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method using whole genomic DNA probes. RESULTS: A high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or = 105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. Between 12% and 16% of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, C. rectus and E. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, respectively. There were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. Presence of > or = 105 L. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). There were significantly higher levels of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, C. rectus, P. micros, V. parvula, S. mutans, S. anginosus, A. israelii, C. sputigena, and C. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, E. corrodens, L. acidophilus, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. oralis, and S. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. CONCLUSIONS: : The findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. This is the first report that the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.
TI  - Bacterial and fungal microleakage of AH26 and AH Plus root canal sealers.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the penetration of Candida albicans alone and a combination of bacteria through root canals filled with gutta-percha and one or other root canal sealers, AH26 and AH Plus. METHODOLOGY: Eighty teeth were randomly divided into two groups of 40 teeth each and obturated with gutta-percha using either AH26 or AH Plus sealer. A further 10 teeth served as negative controls and 10 as positive controls. The external surface of each root, except the apical 2 mm, was covered with two layers of nail varnish. The teeth were inserted into Eppendorf plastic tubes and suspended in glass bottles containing sterile Schaedler broth. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Prevotella melaninogenica and Lactobacillus acidophilus were placed in the access cavities of 20 teeth filled with AH26 and 20 with AH Plus. Candida albicans was placed in the access cavities of the other teeth. The culture medium with microorganisms was changed every 7 days. Every 72 h bacterial or fungal growth in the broth was tested up to a period of 90 days. RESULTS: Leakage in the experimental teeth occurred between 14 and 87 days. Leakage was present in 47% of all samples. From the samples with AH26, 45% leaked bacteria and 60% leaked fungi; whilst from the samples with AH Plus, 50% leaked bacteria and 55% fungi. There was no statistically significant difference in penetration of bacteria and fungi between the sealers. CONCLUSION: In this in vitro study, gutta-percha and the sealers AH26 and AH Plus allowed leakage of bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of fifth-generation dentin bonding systems.
AB  - Past concepts that the pulp does not become infected until an actual carious exposure takes place have been challenged. The antibacterial effects of the dentin bonding systems Single Bond, Prime&Bond NT, and Excite were evaluated using the bacteria Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus intermedius, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Prevotella oris, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Clostridium ramosum with a disk diffusion method. Chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. After incubation zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. Prime&Bond NT showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus mutans were remarkably resistant to Single Bond, whereas EX produced no inhibitory effect on Porphyromonas endodontalis, although the adhesive produced the maximum halo inhibition to Streptococcus mutans (15+/-1 mm), showing an antibacterial effect closest to chlorhexidine. The variety of results obtained in this study suggest that antibacterial properties of current dentin adhesives may depend on components that are originally incorporated to promote adhesion.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  - Bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to China with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. In this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. The cell growth of Streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of S. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. The bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on S. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); pH, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). Bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including S. mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Actinomyces viscosus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, with MICs ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. Furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of S. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of pH in the broth. Thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
TI  - Lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  - Samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for Lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. Yeasts (20.1%), Streptococcus spp. (8.7%), Staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. The Lactobacillus isolates were L. brevis (24.6%) L. fermentum (18.5%) L. casei (16.9%), L. delbrueckii (15.4%), L. plantarum (9.23%), L. acidophilus (7.69%), L. jensenii (4.62%), L. salivarius (1.54%) and L. gasseri (1.54%). The most common species was L. brevis (24.6%). The strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. All the Lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella dysenteriae, S. sonnei, Klebsiella spp. and Campylobacter sp. All the lactobacilli except L. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. The involvement of Lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. The ability of Lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.
TI  - Fractional inhibitory concentration index of combinations of antibacterial agents against cariogenic organisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the inhibitory effects between paired combinations of four antibacterial agents that have been investigated in dentistry against six bacteria associated with dentinal caries. METHODS: The antibacterial agents tested were: chlorhexidine dihydrochloride, benzalkonium chloride, cetrimide and cetylpyridinium chloride. Two organisms each belonging to Streptococcus, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces species were evaluated against these agents. A checkerboard microtitration method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration and fractionary inhibitory concentration (FIC) and summation operator FIC index of the paired combinations of antibacterial agents against the six species of bacteria. Appropriate controls were included. The summation operator FIC index was then used to determine if synergy, antagonism, or indifference occurred as a result of interactions between the antibacterial agents and the test organisms. RESULTS: The data from a total of 295 test results were evaluated. Using summation operator FIC values for synergy as < or = 0.5 and antagonism as > 4.0 as recommended by The American Society for Microbiology, no significant synergistic or antagonistic interactions were observed between the paired antibacterial agents when tested against selected organisms. However, a tendency for an additive antibacterial effect was observed with approximately a third of the test results. Nonetheless, no combination of antibacterial agents appeared to be superior to any other. CONCLUSIONS: According to these in vitro results, there appears to be no beneficial effect of combining the antibacterial agents against the individual cariogenic micro-organisms selected. However, it may be beneficial to use combined antibacterial agents that have a broader range of activity against an ecosystem of bacteria than using individual agents.
TI  - Acid production from lactulose by dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - Representative strains of oral streptococci, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were incubated overnight with lactulose or other carbohydrates and the final pH recorded. Most bacteria tested were able to metabolize lactulose with the exception of strains of Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lact. fermentum. Streptococcus mutans produced most acid overnight but the initial rate of acid production from lactulose by uninduced cultures was very low. Plaque pH was monitored in 12 volunteers following rinsing the mouth with lactulose, sucrose or sorbitol or Lactulose BP. These studies in vivo showed both lactulose and Lactulose BP to exhibit low acidogenic potential. Thus, although plaque bacteria are capable of fermenting lactulose, the results suggest that lactulose is likely to pose a small acidogenic challenge to teeth under normal conditions of use.
TI  - Ecological study of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and Lactobacillus spp. at sub-sites from approximal dental plaque from children.
AB  - Previous immunofluorescence (IF) studies have indicated that Streptococcus mutans may preferentially colonise specific sub-sites within approximal plaque. The present study aimed to extend these observations to other mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in such gingival margin plaque. Two hundred and seventy approximal plaque samples were taken from 90 teeth (3 from each tooth) in 64 children; three gingival margin sub-sites in relation to the contact area: away from (A), to the side of(S) and below (B) the contact area. Samples were processed by indirect IF using high-titred polyclonal anti-S. mutans 'c', anti-S. sobrinus 'd', anti-L. casei and anti-L. acidophilus antisera. An overall positive association was found between S. mutans 'c' and S. sobrinus 'd' (p < 0.001). Significant differences (p < 0.1) were found between the proportional counts at each sub-site for S. mutans 'c': A = 39%, S = 51% and B = 70%, and for S. sobrinus 'd' 21, 33 and 49%. Mutans streptococci (MS) appeared to preferentially colonise the sub-site below the contact area (B = 81%), compared with sub-sites A and S (48 and 62%, respectively). S. mutans 'c' and S. sobrinus 'd' were detected together at subsites A = 12%, S = 22%, and B = 38%, with proportional counts at B sites being higher than those at A (B > A, p < 0.01, and B > S, p < 0.05). Lactobacillus spp. were isolated rarely, and were usually found together with MS. There was a positive relationship between the presence of lactobacilli or MS and caries (white spot lesions only), although these species could frequently be isolated from noncarious sites. The presence of both S. mutans 'c' and S. sobrinus 'd' were strongly correlated with early caries lesions. In addition, this study confirmed the variation in the microflora at different sub-sites within approximal dental plaque.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of 10% carbamide peroxide bleaching agents.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of three commercial 10% carbamide peroxide bleaching agents (Nite White, Karisma, and Opalescence) on Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus was examined. Chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. Test materials and control solution were inserted in wells punched on the surface of disk sensitivity agars seeded with bacteria. After incubation of 24 to 48 h, zones of inhibition were measured. All three of the test materials displayed greater inhibition than the control. The pH of the solutions did not effect the bacterial inhibition.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of the substance isolated from Streptosporangium species which inhibits lactic acid production by oral bacteria.
AB  - 1. The tentatively named MLI, which inhibits lactic acid production in mutants streptococci, was isolated from Streptosporangium species and purified by solvent extraction followed by chromatography, and then powdered. 2. MLI greatly inhibited pH-decline and lactic acid production in glucose-containing reaction mixture by mutans streptococci or Lactobacillus species. 3. These inhibitory mechanisms were not caused by an anti-bacterial effect, since the addition of a sufficient concentration of MLI to inhibit lactic acid production to the culture, recovery of cells in culture was not affected, excluding L. acidophilus. 4. MLI directly affected lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. 5. These results indicate that MLI may represent a new anti-cariogenic substance.
TI  - Bacterial growth inhibition and short-term clinical efficacy of a vegetable oil-based mouthrinse: preliminary study.
AB  - Bacterial growth of a vegetable oil-based product was determined in vitro. Growth of Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella alcalescens was strongly inhibited for dilutions up to 50x. On the basis of these results, it was decided to evaluate the short-term, clinical efficacy of a 1:10 dilution of the concentrated product in water. Fifteen human volunteers employed this rinse twice-a-day during a six-day period. Planimetric plaque scores, as well as the plaque and gingival indexes according to Loe, were assessed at the beginning and end of this period. The efficacy of such a rinse, though less than of chlorhexidine-based products, turned out comparable to several other commercially available products with a reasonable potential in maintaining a low gingival index.
TI  - Antibodies in normal and diseased pulps reactive with microorganisms isolated from deep caries.
AB  - Immunoglobulin molecules in the supernatant fluids (SF) from pulpal explant cultures have been observed to react with microorganisms implicated in infections of root canals. In this study, the reactivity of immunoglobulin molecules in the SF from normal and irreversible pulpitis pulps to six strains of predominant microorganisms isolated from the immediate layer of carious lesions above the pulps used for explant cultures was investigated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Two ATCC strains of Eubacterium were also included in this assay. Specific antibodies to Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus (I), (II), Streptococcus mutans, Bacteroides intermedius, Eubacterium brachy, and Eubacterium alactolyticum in the SF from the normal and irreversible pulpitis tissues were observed with a large variation of antibody levels in both groups. Immunodiffusion assays of the SF revealed that IgG was the major class of immunoglobulin in the normal as well as the irreversible groups. The presence of natural antibodies in the normal pulps suggested a possible protective role of antibodies during the invasive process of caries.
TI  - Noncariogenicity of erythritol as a substrate.
AB  - Erythritol is a sugar alcohol produced by Aureobasidium sp. from glucose. It is 75-80% as sweet as sucrose and is also nonhygroscopic. The aim of this study was to evaluate this sugar substitute from a cariological point of view. Erythritol was neither utilized as a substrate for the lactic acid production nor for plaque formation of mutans streptococci (serotypes a-h) and certain oral microorganisms. It was not utilized for water-insoluble glucan synthesis or cellular adherence by glucosyltransferase from Streptococcus mutans PS-14 (c) and Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 (g). Finally, a significantly lower caries score (3.1 +/- 0.5; mean +/- SEM) was observed in specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. sobrinus 6715 and fed with a diet containing 26% erythritol, as compared to control rats fed with a diet containing 26% sucrose (60.5 +/- 2.0). Also, rats provided a diet containing 56% erythritol chocolate (23.8% erythritol) and challenged with S. mutans PS-14 exhibited a significantly lower caries score (6.7 +/- 0.8) compared to the sucrose chocolate group (82.8 +/- 2.8). The main conclusion from this study is therefore that erythritol is a promising sugar substitute from a cariological point of view.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of orthodontic band cements].
AB  - The prevalence of enamel decalcification and caries beneath orthodontic bands, has indicated the need for a new enamel binding adhesive orthodontic cement. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity, in vitro, on Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus, acidophillus, of three materials used to cements the orthodontic bands. The cements studied were: Zinc phosphate cement, Glass-ionomer cement, and Policarboxylate cement. Thirty petri plates were seeded with S. mutans, and thirty with L. acidophillus; on each plate three pellet were placed, one of each cement studied. Petri plates were incubated under microaerophilic conditions at 37 C, and checked at 72 hrs. for Streptococcus, mutans, and four days for Lactobacillus acidophillus to evaluate the inhibition zone. The results were tabulated for each material. It was demonstrated that exists important variations in the antimicrobial properties of the materials studied, as in the microbial sensitivity to these cements.
TI  - [Analysis of the in vitro antibacterial action of a fluoridated amalgam].
AB  - To a conventional silver amalgam alloy was added 1% of stanous fluoride, to prove in vitro, if it presents any antibacteria actions against S. mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Thirteen Petri plate were seeded with S. mutans and 12 Petri plate with Lactobacillus, in both cases, was disposited fluoride containing amalgam and conventional amalgam. The average of inhibition signs in the Petri plates with S. mutans was 1.7 mm in the Petri plates with Lactobacillus the average was 2.4 mm. Is demonstrated that the fluoride containing amalgam has in vitro antibacteria action in comparison with conventional amalgam, that has none.
TI  - The effect of pH on the sensitivity of species of Lactobacillus to chlorhexidine  and the antibiotics minocycline and spiramycin.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity of a range of Lactobacillus species to chlorhexidine, Minocycline, and Spiramycin, at a range of pH from 5.0 to 7.4. Strains of Streptococcus were also tested for their sensitivity to chlorhexidine, as a comparison between the genera. There were both inter- and intra-species variations in the sensitivity of these strains to chlorhexidine. The strains tested were sensitive at pH 6.7 to the following levels of chlorhexidine (micrograms/mL): L. casei (6 strains), 10-60; L. plantarum (4 strains), 40; L. fermentum (13 strains), 2-20; L. brevis (1 strain), 10; and L. acidophilus (3 strains), 10-60. The Streptococcus species were sensitive to 1-4 micrograms/mL (13 strains); 4-10 micrograms/mL (3 strains); and 10-20 micrograms/mL (2 strains). One strain was able to survive 20 micrograms/mL. Chlorhexidine was found to be less effective at lower pH levels. The following examples show sensitivity (micrograms/mL) at pH 6.5 followed by sensitivity at pH 5.0: L. casei (ATCC 15008), 40,60; L. plantarum (CH 374), 40,100; L. fermentum (CH 324) 10,40; L. acidophilus (ATCC 4356), 10,40; and S. mutans (BM 52), 2,2. All of the strains of Lactobacillus tested with Spiramycin were resistant at pH 5.0. Minocycline was less affected by changes in pH, but at pH 7.4 Lactobacillus strains were more resistant to Minocycline as compared with Spiramycin. Both of these antibiotics are bacteriostatic, and therefore may have a more limited effect than a bactericidal agent such as chlorhexidine. The Lactobacillus strains tested required higher concentrations of chlorhexidine than did the strains of Streptococcus for a killing effect in vitro.

TI  - Deletion analysis of sucrose metabolic genes from a Salmonella plasmid cloned in  Escherichia coli K12.
AB  - The sucrose operon from pUR400, a 78-kbp conjugative Salmonella plasmid, was cloned in Escherichia coli K12. The operon was located in a 5.7-kbp SalI restriction fragment and was subcloned, in each of two possible orientations, using the expression vector pUC18. The insert DNA was restriction mapped and duplicate restriction sites in the insert and in the polylinker of the vector were used to create various deletions promoter distal in the operon sequence. Additional deletions were made with the restriction exonuclease Bal31. Cells containing hybrid plasmids with specified deletions lacked the ability to transport sucrose or were constitutive for hydrolase and/or uptake activities. The scrA (enzyme IIScr) and scrR (regulatory) genes resided within 2900-bp SmaI-SalI DNA fragment and were assigned the order scrB, scrA, scrR. An amplified sucrose-inducible gene product, Mr 68,000, was detected only in the membrane fraction from recombinant cells that contained plasmid with the intact operon sequence. This protein represented 11% of the total membrane protein and was resistant to extraction with 0.5 M sodium chloride, 2% Triton X-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. The protein did not appear to be the product of either the scrA, scrB, or scrR gene and may therefore represent a previously unidentified membrane-bound sucrose protein. A new gene, scrC, is proposed. In addition, the cloned 5.7-kbp SalI and 2.5-kbp SmaI-SalI DNA fragments failed to hybridize to chromosomal DNA from Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus mutans, and Lactobacillus acidophilus as well as to DNA from a sucrose plasmid from Salmonella tennessee. However, the probes showed weak homology with a 20-kbp EcoRI restriction fragment from Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - [Bacteriological investigation of the cariogenic effects of sugar alcohols and sucrose].
AB  - Considerable evidence indicates that the disaccharide, sucrose is probably the major dietary factor in dental caries formation and much subsequent research has gone into the search for another sweetener to replace sucrose. Currently, there is much interest in the development of new sweeteners and the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols. The present study aimed to examine the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols (xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol) and sucrose on growth pattern and acid production of S. mutans, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. faecalis, S. viridans, L. casei and L. acidophilus in vitro by using Photo Electrical Colorimeter and pH meter. In conclusion the results in this study showed that out of sugar alcohols, xylitol is the only compound which, depending on its concentration, significantly did not affect the growth and acid production of all tested micro organisms.

TI  - Immunisation of rhesus monkeys with Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus and lipoteichoic acid for protection against dental caries.
AB  - An attempt was made to protect rhesus monkeys from dental caries by immunisation  with Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus and lipoteichoic acid (LTA). The vaccine composed of S. mutans gave significant protection against caries, a decrease in the number of S. mutans, an increase in IgG antibodies and a moderate increase in complement-fixing antibodies to LTA. When LTA was used as immunogen, there was only a small reduction in caries, without any detectable antibodies to LTA and a slight increase in IgG antibodies to cell of S. mutans. Vaccines of L. acidophilus or L. fermentum gave no protection. A combined vaccine of S. mutans and L. acidophilus did not reduce the incidence of caries but the antibody titre to cells of S. mutans was raised to a level comparable with that in the S. mutans-immunised monkeys. The results of this investigation in a subhuman primate confirm that immunisation with S. mutans induces protection against caries, unlike the attempt to immunise with two selected strains of lactobacilli. More studies are required to establish the role of specific serotypes of lactobacilli in the development of dental caries.

TI  - [Dental caries].
AB  - Recent studies on the etiology and prevention of dental caries are synthetized. Caries is an infectious disease produced by the bacterial plaque where microorganisms act upon hydrocarbon substrate producing acids (lactic, pyruvic, acetic, etc.). These acids decalcify the enamel surface producing the carious cavity. The three types of caries are mentioned: 1. The sucrose-dependent caries on the free surfaces of the tooth with the Streptococcus mutans predominance. 2. The pits and fissures caries with Lactobacillus acidophilus predominance. 3. The root caries with Acinomyces viscosus predominance. Caries prevention points out to three aspects. 1. Increasing tooth resistance through the use of ingested fluoride and/or topical fluorides and pits and fissure sealants. 2. A profuse and promising research work on control of microbial plaque is being done. Meanwhile, the correct and periodically controlled toothbrushing is still the most efficient preventive measure. 3. Diet control. Being carbohydrates a deep rooted habit of our modern culture, its control has to be carefully evaluated. A judicious and reduced strategic consumption of carbohydrates and the use of substitutes are useful ways of achieving the preventive aims.
TI  - Antimicrobial action of dental cements.
AB  - It was observed that some of the cements tested had bacteriostatic and/or bactericidal action. The cements listed in decreasing order of effectiveness are (1) zinc oxide-eugenol, (2) silicophosphate, (3) zinc phosphate, and (4) silicate. The two newer cements, polycarboxylate and composite resin, exhibited no measurable antimicrobial action.

TI  - Proteolytic activity of Streptococcus mutans (GS-5).
AB  - The potential proteolytic ability of cariogenic streptococci was assessed in a strain of Streptococcus mutans (GS-5). Blood-borne S. mutans from rats infected by mouth with GS-5 were cultured, and sterile rat tail tendons were placed on these cultured bacterial colonies. The collagenolytic ability of these organisms was examined under the scanning electron microscope and by testing for reduced tensile strength of the collagen fibers. These experiments showed that GS-5 cariogenic streptococcus can be conditioned to produce significant collagenolytic activity.
TI  - Mutanolysin, bacteriolytic agent for cariogenic Streptococci: partial purification and properties.
AB  - Mutanolysin partially purified from the culture filtrate of Streptomyces globisporus 1829 consists of two main lytic enzymes with an isoelectric point near pH 8.5 and 10, respectively, and proteolytic enzyme is associated with the latter lytic enzyme. Mutanolysin exhibited maximal lytic activity at 60 C in the pH range 6.5 to 7.0 and was stable at 50 C in the acid range. N-bromosuccinimide caused complete inhibition of lytic activity at 1 mM, whereas calcium and magnesium ions at the same concentration caused activation. Mutanolysin had lytic or bactericidal activity against the living cells of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Actinomyces viscosus, which are considered to be etiologic agents of dental caries, but had no activity against S. aureus and all gram-negative strains tested. The lytic activity was well retained in human saliva. Digestion of the cell walls of S. mutans BHT by mutanolysin was accompanied by the liberation of free amino groups and reducing sugars. Mutanolysin may be expected to be a useful agent for dental caries control.
