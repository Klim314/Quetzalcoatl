TI  == pattern of pathogens from surgical wound infections in a nigerian hospital and their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles.
AB  == background: in surgical patients, infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. a prospective study to find the pattern of microorganisms responsible for post operative wound infections and their antibiotic susceptibility profile was therefore conducted. setting and methods: surgical wards in obafemi awolowo university teaching hospital complex, ile-ife, nigeria.  isolation, identification and antimicrobial susceptibility screening of organisms were done employing standard microbiological techniques. results: bacterial pathogens were isolated from all the specimens while the yeast candida species (spp) was isolated from 12.4%. staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent organism isolated accounting for 23 (18.3%) of a total of 126 isolates. other organisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus spp 11.1% each; escherichia coli 10.3%; candida spp 8.7%; coagulase negative staphylococci 8.7%; pseudomonas  spp 6.3%; serratia odorifera 4.7%; bacteroides 4.0%; enterococcus spp 3.2%; the remaining isolates were other enterobacteria. sensitivity of the bacterial isolates to antibiotics varied. in general, resistance to the beta-lactam antibiotics was above 98%, whilst more than 70% of isolates were resistant to erythromycin, fusidic acid and tobramycin. conclusions: the infections were polymicrobic and multidrug resistant. the quinolones, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, should be used as frontline drugs in the management of surgical wound  infections at the hospital.

TI  == short communication: in vitro assessment of antioxidant, antibacterial and phytochemical analysis of peel of citrus sinensis.
AB  == antibacterial effect of citrus sinensis peel extracts was evaluated against several pathogenic bacteria associated with human and fish infections viz., escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcesnces,  shigella flexneri, enterobacter amnigenus, salmonella typhimurium and serratia odorifera. methanol, ethanol, chloroform and diethyl ether solvents were used for extraction. in vitro antibacterial activity was analyzed by agar well and agar disc diffusion methods. it was found that ethanol extract showed highly significant inhibition of e. coli and k. pneumonia (12.6+/-0.94 mm and 11.6+/-1.2 mm) whereas methanol extract of c. sinensis also showed high zone of inhibition of s. odorifera (10.0+/-2.16 mm). the potential activity of active extracts was assessed and also compared with standard antibiotics through activity index formulation. the order of antioxidant activity through abts.+ and dpph free radical scavenging activity was ethanol>methanol>chloroform>diethyl ether. phytochemical screening of all solvents had determined the presence of terpenoids, alkaloids, steroids, glycosides and flavonoids. it was also found that chloroform/methanol (5:5) and butanol/ethanol/water (4:1:2.2) solvent systems showed significant separation of active phytochemical constituents. these findings reveal the potential use of c. sinensis peel to treat infectious diseases, which are being caused by microorganisms.

TI  == the disinfecting potential of contact lens soutions used by sultan qaboos university students.
AB  == objectives: this study aimed to determine the disinfecting potential of some contact lens solutions used by some university students in oman. methods: this work was carried out from january to june 2010 in the department of microbiology  & immunology, college of medicine and health sciences, sultan qaboos university,  oman. fifty disinfecting solutions, in which contact lenses were disinfected according to the manufacturers' instructions, were collected from the students and plated on various microbiological culture media. bacterial isolates were identified by api-20e, api-20ne and phoenix automated systems while fungi were identified by their cultural characteristics and biochemistry. results: from 98 isolates, pseudomonas aeruginosa was 23.5%; penicillium, 13%; candida species, 9.2%; coagulase negative staphylococci, 9.2%; serratia marcescens, 6.1%; bacillus, 5.1%; aspergillus flavus, 5.1%; serratia liquefaciens, pseudomonas fluorescens, enterobacter cloacae and aspergillus niger, 4.1% each; chryseomonas  luteola and chryseomonas indologenes, 3.1% each; stenotrophomonas maltophilia, serratia odorifera, 2.0% each; enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae,  1% each. most isolates (65%) came from polyhexanide containing solutions. conclusion: contact lens disinfecting solutions with the same formulations, but manufactured by different companies, possessed different disinfecting potentials.

TI  == [utility of pyrrolidonyl-arylamidase detection for typing enterobacteriaceae and  non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == detection of pyrrolidonyl-aryl-amidase activity (pyr) is an important tool to identify gram-positive cocci, such as staphylococci, enterococci, streptococci, and other related genera. however, only few studies evaluating its usefulness with gram-negative rods have been published. thus, a prospective study including  542 and 215 unique clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae and non-fermentative gram-negative rods, respectively, was undertaken. strains were identified by conventional methods. pyr test was performed using a commercial kit, according to the manufacturer recommendations. positive results were uniformly obtained for the pyr test with the following species: citrobacter spp, klebsiella spp, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter agglomerans group, serratia marcescens and s. odorifera. on the other hand, negative results were uniformly displayed by e.  coli (including inactive e. coli), protease group, salmonellia spp, shigella spp, acinetobacter spp, burkholderia (pseudomonas) cepacia and flavobacterium spp. variable results were shown in pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) malthophilia, kluyvera cryocrescens, and enterobacter cloacae. pyr  test proved to be a reliable and simple tool to rapidly distinguish certain species belonging to enterobacteriaceae (ie. citrobacter freundii from salmonella spp, and inactive e. coli from k. ozaenae). further studies, including a wide diversity of species, are required to assess usefulness of the pyr test for the identification of non-fermentative gram-negative rods.
