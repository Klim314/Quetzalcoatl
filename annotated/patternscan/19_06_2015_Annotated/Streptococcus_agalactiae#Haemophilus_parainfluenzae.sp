TI  == septic arthritis of the acromioclavicular joint: an uncommon location.
AB  == septic pyogenic arthritis of the acromioclavicular joint is a rare entity that occurs in immunosuppressed patients or those with discontinuity of defense barriers. there are only 15 cases described in the literature. the diagnosis is based on clinical features and the isolation of a microorganism in synovial fluid or blood cultures. the evidence of arthritis by imaging (mri, ultrasound or scintigraphy) may be useful. antibiotic treatment is the same as in septic arthritis in other locations. staphylococcus aureus is the microorganism most frequently isolated. our objective was to describe the clinical features, treatment and outcome of patients diagnosed with septic arthritis of the acromioclavicular joint at a rheumatology department. we developed a study with a retrospective design (1989-2012). the medical records of patients with septic arthritis were reviewed (101 patients). those involving the acromioclavicular joint were selected (6 patients; 6%).

TI  == comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent north american clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29  species isolated in the us and canada between 1997 and 1999. based upon minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. against enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general,  displayed weak activity with only proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of gram-negative non-enterobacteriaceae including haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against burkholderia cepacia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.

TI  == cefetamet pivoxil: comparable evaluation with other orally available antibiotics  against selected species of respiratory pathogens.
AB  == cefetamet pivoxil, the prodrug ester of cefetamet, is a new third-generation cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity. the in vitro activity of cefetamet was superior to that of cefaclor, ceftibuten, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, and amoxicillin alone when tested against 403 strains of freshly isolated upper and lower respiratory tract pathogens. cefetamet killed 100% haemophilus influenzae and h. parainfluenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing  strains, at < or = 0.25 mg/l, streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae at < or =  0.5 mg/l, s. agalactiae at < or = 0.1 mg/l, and streptococci at < or = 2.0 mg/l.  moreover, at < or = 4 mg/l (breaking point), cefetamet was also highly effective  against escherichia coli (94%), klebsiella pneumoniae (92%), k. oxytoca (91%) and, at 1 mg/l, against moraxella catarrhalis (90%), including beta-lactamase-producing strains. furthermore, time-killing analyses at 4 x mic demonstrated that cefetamet was bactericidal against beta-lactamase-producing h.  influenzae, m. catarrhalis, and k. pneumoniae within 6 h and s. pneumoniae within 4 h. hydrolysis studies confirmed cefetamet's stability to tem1 and shv1, the most common enterobacterial beta-lactamases.

TI  == [balanitis and infectious agents. a prospective study of 100 cases].
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was: 1) to evaluate the rate of micro-organism isolation in 100 patients consulting for balanitis at the centre of sexually transmitted diseases at the st. louis hospital in paris in comparison with that of micro-organisms isolated in 60 men without balanitis; 2) to search for a possible correlation between the clinical aspect of the disease and the nature of the infectious agent identified. methods: one hundred consecutive patients were included in the study. all underwent a clinical examination and samples were taken for bacteriology, mycology and virology examinations. sixty healthy volunteers served as controls. two samples were taken from the balanopreputial groove in search for fungi and bacteria. results: candida albicans (ca) was isolated in 33 p. 100 of the patients. a pathogenic bacteria (beta-haemolytic streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella), or a potentially pathogenic germ (haemophilus parainfluenzae, anaerobic bacteria, gardnerella vaginalis, streptococcus milleri, group hb5) was found without ca in  28 p. 100 of the cases, a commensal flora (enterobacteria, group d streptococci)  was found without ca in 8 p. 100 and in 31 p. 100 of the cases non causal agent could be identified. discussion: this series confirms the non-pathogenic nature of commensal bacteria: the number of isolations was similar in the subjects with  and without balanitis (p < 0.9). the role played by the other bacteria in the development of balanitis is discussed: saprophytic association or direct pathogenesis? the significant difference in the rate of bacteria isolations in patients with balanitis compared with controls (p < 0.001) is in favour of a pathogenic role. the clinical presentation was not predictive of the presence of  any particular micro-organism excepting the presence of pustules which were highly suggestive of candidiasis.

TI  == clinical and microbiologic features of urethritis in men in toulouse, france.
AB  == on hundred twenty-six men who attended a hospital microbiology laboratory and 99  men who attended a private laboratory in toulouse, france, for symptoms of urethritis were examined during 1988, for evidence of urethral pathogens. the following incidences were found: neisseria gonorrhoeae: 24 (10.7%); chlamydia trachomatis: 58 (25.8%); ureaplasma urealyticum: 46 (20.4%); gardnerella vaginalis: 21 (9.3%); haemophilus parainfluenzae: 21 (9.3%); streptococcus agalactiae: 15 (6.7%); candida albicans: 10 (4.4%); and trichomonas vaginalis: 4  (1.8%). the prevalence of these microorganisms was similar in the two groups of patients. no pathogen was isolated from 71 patients (31.6%). mixed infections with at least two pathogens were found in 49 men (21.8%). another goal of this study was to determine the relative prevalence of urethral pathogens in relation  to clinical findings. n. gonorrhoeae was isolated significantly more often in patients who had a urethral discharge (p less than .05) that contained five or more polymorphonuclear cells per high-power field (pmn/hpf) (p less than .001). g. vaginalis was isolated significantly more often in patients who did not have an urethral discharge (p less than .05) and in men with less than five pmn/hpf (p less than .05). isolation of c. albicans was significantly associated with pruritus (p less than .05) and balanitis (p less than .001). like the clinical features, the gram-stained urethral smear was of limited value in diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making regarding non-gonococcal urethritis. in contrast, this study underlines the importance of full identification of urethral isolates  in the management of urethritis in men.

TI  == [microbiological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of rokitamycin dry syrup in the pediatric field].
AB  == rokitamycin (rkm), a newly developed macrolide antibiotic with a 16-membered ring, dissolves well under acidic conditions. it has been improved over other macrolides to minimize individual variations in its absorbability. we measured, using the ga-test, variations in gastric acidities of 43 children with ages between 1 to 14 years, and investigated the relationship between gastric acidities and pharmacokinetic values. also activities (expressed in mics) of antimicrobial agents were studied against clinically isolated 229 bacterial strains using an inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. tested organisms included streptococcus pyogenes (77 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (29), streptococcus pneumoniae (2), as gram-positive cocci, and haemophilus influenzae (1), haemophilus parainfluenzae (1), bordetella pertussis (12), salmonella sp. (4) and campylobacter jejuni (103) as gram-negative bacilli. against stock strains of bacteria, mics of 10 drugs (rkm, erythromycin (em), josamycin (jm), midecamycin (mdm), midecamycin acetate (mom), clindamycin (cldm), amoxicillin (ampc), cefaclor (ccl), minocycline, ofloxacin (oflx] were determined. against isolates from patients who underwent treatment with rkm, mics of only 4 drugs (rkm, em, jm, mom) were determined. measurements were made on plasma and urinary concentrations of rkm and its urinary recovery rates after patients including 6 boys with ages between 5 years 1 month and 11 years 6 months were administered with rkm (dry syrup). two groups of 6 boys were administered between meals with rkm at dose levels of 5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. clinical and bacteriological  effects of rkm were evaluated for 175 patients including 5 cases of pharyngitis,  3 tonsillitis, 32 pneumonia, 17 mycoplasmal pneumonia, 34 atypical pneumonia, 28  streptococcal infections, 29 campylobacter enteritis, 4 salmonella gastroenteritis, and 23 enteritis due to unknown organisms. five drop-out cases were excluded from the evaluations. in the evaluable cases, an average dose level used was 31.8 mg/kg/day, with a daily dose divided into 3 to 4 administrations and with an average treatment duration of 9 days. adverse reactions of rkm and its effects on laboratory test values were investigated in these patients including the drop out cases. obtained results of these studies are summarized below. 1. the ga-test produced ph values indicating that amounts of gastric acid  were mostly either normal or high in 42 of the 43 subjects tested (97.7%), and only one low acid case (2.3%) was observed.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
