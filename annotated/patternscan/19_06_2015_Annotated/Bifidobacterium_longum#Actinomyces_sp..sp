TI  == pulp and plaque microbiotas of children with severe early childhood caries.
AB  == background and objective: bacterial invasion into pulps of primary teeth can lead to infection and premature tooth loss in children. this pilot study aimed to explore whether the microbiota of carious exposures of dental pulps resembles that of carious dentin or that of infected root canals. design: children with severe early childhood caries were studied. children were consented and extent of caries, plaque, and gingivitis measured. bacteria were sampled from carious lesion biofilms and vital carious exposures of pulps, and processed by anaerobic  culture. isolates were characterized from partial sequences of the 16s rrna gene  and identified by comparison with taxa in the human oral microbiome database (http://www.homd.org). the microbiotas of carious lesions and dental pulps were compared using univariate and multivariate approaches. results: the microbiota of cariously exposed pulps was similar in composition to that of carious lesion biofilms except that fewer species/taxa were identified from pulps. the major taxa identified belonged to the phyla firmicutes (mainly streptococci) and actinobacteria (mainly actinomyces species). actinomyces and selenomonas species  were associated with carious lesions whereas veillonella species, particularly veillonella dispar was associated with pulps. other bacteria detected in pulps included streptococcus mutans, parascardovia denticolens, bifidobacterium longum, and several lactobacillus and actinomyces species. by principal, component analysis pulp microbiotas grouped together, whereas those in caries biofilms were widely dispersed. conclusions: we conclude that the microbiota of cariously exposed vital primary pulps is composed of a subset of species associated with carious lesions. vital primary pulps had a dominant firmicutes and actinobacteria microbiota which contrasts with reports of endodontic infections which can harbor a gram-negative microbiota. the microbiota of exposed primary pulps may provide insight into bacterial species at the forefront of caries invasion in dentinal lesions that can invade into the pulp and the nature of species that need suppressing for successful pulp therapy.

TI  == site and clinical significance of alloscardovia omnicolens and bifidobacterium species isolated in the clinical laboratory.
AB  == most of the members of the genus bifidobacterium, including the related organism  alloscardovia omnicolens, are inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract and oral  cavity of humans and animals and have been considered nonpathogenic for humans. however, the actual site of isolation and the clinical significance of a. omnicolens and of bifidobacterium species are unclear. this may be due in part to the difficulties in distinguishing these organisms from other genera such as actinomyces. to determine the potential disease-causing role of these organisms,  we analyzed the clinical significance of 15 a. omnicolens and bifidobacterium isolates identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing from a clinical laboratory. all of the organisms in this study were isolated from sterile sites or in significant numbers by standard clinical microbiological culture methods. our 15 clinical strains fit into only four species: a. omnicolens (five isolates), bifidobacterium scardovii (four isolates), b. longum (two isolates), and b. breve (four isolates). all five a. omnicolens isolates, one of the b. breve isolates, and three of the four b. scardovii isolates were cultured from urine at 10(5) cfu/ml. one b. scardovii isolate was from a patient with a genitourinary tract wound infection, two b. longum isolates were from abdominal wounds, and three b.  breve isolates were from blood cultures. this study enlarges the spectrum of diseases and clinical sources associated with a. omnicolens and bifidobacterium species and addresses identification problems.

TI  == [protease activity of microflora in the oral cavity of patients with periodontitis].
AB  == microbial spectrum and non-specific as well as specific iga1 protease activity of isolated microorganisms were investigated in gingival liquid of patients with periodontitis. microorganisms from the gingival liqud of these patients belonged  to conditional-pathogenic obligate and facultatively anaerobic bacteria. 24 strains of microorganisms have been identified. nonspecific proteolytic activity  was found in the following microorganisms: actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, aerococcus viridans, bifidobacterium longum, neisseria subflave, streptococcus parvulus, eubacterium alactolyticum, lactobaccilus catenoforme, bacillus spp. specific iga1-protease activity and lack of proteolytic activity towards igg was found in streptococcus acidominimus, streptococcus hansenii, streptococcus salivarius, leptotrychia buccalis, staphylococcus haemolyticus and  neisseria sicca. no proteolytic activity was found in cultivation medium of eubacterium alactolyticum (1 strain), prevotella buccalis, aerococcus viridans and streptococcus sanguis.

TI  == distribution of secretory inhibitor of platelet microbicidal protein among anaerobic bacteria isolated from stool of children with diarrhea.
AB  == aim: to study the secretory inhibitor of platelet microbicidal protein (sipmp) phenotypes of faecal anaerobic isolates from patients with diarrhea. methods: faecal isolates of anaerobic bacteria (b. fragilis, n = 42; b. longum, n = 70; a. israelii, n = 21; e. lentum, n = 12) from children with diarrhea were tested. sipmp production was tested by inhibition of platelet microbicidal protein (pmp)  bioactivity against b. subtilis and was expressed as percentage of inhibition of  pmp bactericidal activity. results: among anaerobic isolates 80% of b. longum strains, 85.7% of a. israelii strains, 50% of e. lentum strains and 92.86% of b.  fragilis strains were sipmp-positive. the isolated anaerobic organisms demonstrated sipmp production at a mean level of 13.8% +/- 0.7%, 14.7% +/- 1.8%,  3.9% +/- 0.9% (p < 0.05) and 26.8% +/- 7.5% (p < 0.05) for bifidobacteria, a. israelii, e. lentum and b. fragilis, respectively. conclusion: data from the present study may have significant implications in understanding the pathogenesis of microecological disorders in the intestine, as well as for future improvement  in the prevention and therapy of anaerobe-associated infections.

TI  == antibacterial sensitivity of bifidobacterium (lactobacillus bifidus).
AB  == the antibacterial sensitivity patterns of gram-positive, nonsporeforming, anaerobic bacilli variously classed as lactobacillus bifidus, actinomyces bifidus, or bifidobacterium were studied by the plate dilution method. a total of 34 strains, mostly from human feces, was studied. three species, b. longum, b. adolescentis, and b. bifidum, were represented with 11, 11, and 6 strains, respectively. the other six strains fell into four other species. most strains of all types resisted 100 mug/ml or more of neomycin, polymyxin b, and nalidixic acid. they were somewhat less resistant to kanamycin and still less so to streptomycin. all strains were inhibited by less than 1 mug/ml of penicillin g and erythromycin, by 3.1 units or less per ml of bacitracin, by 3.1 mug/ml or less of chloramphenicol, and by 6.2 mug/ml or less of tetracycline and lincomycin. most strains were inhibited by 3.1 mug/ml of vancomycin. results were very variable with cephalothin and nitrofurantoin, with some strains quite resistant. with half of the drugs tested, there were moderate differences in sensitivity between different species. these data are discussed in relation to the effect of antimicrobial agents on bifid bacilli in the normal human fecal flora, in relation to the implications thereof, and in relation to the usefulness of several agents (particularly neomycin, nalidixic acid, and polymyxin b) in selective media for bifidobacterium.
