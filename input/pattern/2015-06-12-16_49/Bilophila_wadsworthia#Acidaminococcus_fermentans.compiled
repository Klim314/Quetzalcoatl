TI  - Comparative In vitro activities of ertapenem (MK-0826) against 1,001 anaerobes isolated from human intra-abdominal infections.
AB  - By using an agar dilution method, the comparative in vitro activities of ertapenem (MK-0826) were studied against 1,001 anaerobes isolated from human intra-abdominal infections in 17 countries worldwide. MK-0826 was uniformly active against all isolates, including all Bacteroides fragilis group species isolates, with the exception of 12 of 61 (20%) strains of Bilophila wadsworthia, 3 strains of lactobacilli, and 1 isolate of Acidaminococcus fermentans. Geographical variation in activity was not observed.
