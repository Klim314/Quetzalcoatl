TI  == [evaluation of prolex for the rapid identification of streptococci isolated in medical microbiology].
AB  == the need to rapidly identify streptococci responsible for acute infectious diseases has led to the development of agglutination techniques that are able to  identify streptococcal group antigens (a, b, c, d, f, and g) directly from primoculture colonies on blood agar. the prolex agglutination tests (pro-lab diagnostics, richmond hill, ontario, canada), distributed in france by i2a, have  been used for the determination of group antigens of 166 isolates of streptococci and enterococci previously identified in the national reference center for streptococci. the results obtained with the prolex reagents have permitted to correctly identify all pyogenic beta-hemolytic streptococci (23 streptococcus pyogenes, 21 streptococcus agalactiae, 33 streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis including 6 group c and 27 group g, and 5 streptococcus porcinus including 4 group b). four differences between unexpected agglutinations (a or f) and species identifications have been obtained. these differences were observed for four non-hemolytic isolates of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii,  streptococcus infantarius, and streptococcus suis. the anti-d reagent has been of value as a marker for isolates of enterococci. thus, these results confirm the abilities of these agglutination tests for the grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococci. moreover, the use of prolex has the advantage to be rapid because of the non-enzymatic but chemical extraction of streptococcal antigens.
