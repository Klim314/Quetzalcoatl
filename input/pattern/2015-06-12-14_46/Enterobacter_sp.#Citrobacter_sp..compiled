TI  - [Selective-differential nutrient medium "Shewanella IRHLS agar" for isolation of  Shewanella genus bacteria].
AB  - AIM: Development of a selective-differential nutrient medium for isolation of Shewanella genus bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 73 strains of Shewanella bacteria (S. algae--3, S. baltica--26, S. putrefaciens--44) and 80 strains of 22 other bacteria genera were used. Shewanella species were identified by methods and criteria proposed by Nozue H. et al., 1992; Khashe S. et al., 1998. RESULTS: Nutrient media "Shewanella IRHLS Agar" for shewanella isolation was developed. Medium selective factors: irgazan DP-300 (I). 0.14-0.2 g/l and rifampicin (R) 0.0005-0.001 g/l. Shevanella colonies were detected by the production of hydrogen sulfide (H), lipase presence (L), lack of sorbitol fermentation (S). The medium suppressed the growth of hydrogen sulfide producers (Salmonella, Proteus) and blocked hydrogen sulfide production by Citrobacter. Growth of Escherichia, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Shigella, Staphylococcus, Bacillus was also suppressed, Analytical sensitivity of the medium was 1-2 CFU/ml for Shewanella and Stenotrophomonas, Aerombnas, Serratia genera bacteria. 72 strains of Shewanella were isolated from water of Neva river in this medium, 91.7 +/- 3.2% of those produced H2S. 1 strain of S. algae was isolated from clinical material. CONCLUSION: The developed media allows to use it in a complex for Stenotrophomo- nas sp., Aeromonas sp., Serratia sp., Citrobactersp. and Shewanella bacteria isolation.
TI  - Biosorption of heavy metals by Pseudomonas species isolated from sugar industry.
AB  - Heavy metal-resistant bacteria can be efficient bioremediators of metals and may  provide an alternative or additional method to conventional methods of metal removal. In this study, 10 bacterial isolates were isolated from soil samples of a sugar industry, located at Peshawar, Pakistan. Morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics of these isolates were observed. Sequence analysis (16S ribosomal RNA) revealed that isolated strains were closely related to the species belonging to the genera Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter, Exiguobacterium, Citrobacter, and Enterobacter. Bacterial isolates were resistant with a minimum inhibitory concentration (500-900 ppm) to lead ion (Pb2+), (500-600 ppm) nickel ion (Ni2+), (500-800 ppm) copper ion (Cu2+), and (600-800 ppm) chromium ion (Cr3+) in solid media. Furthermore, biosorption of metals proved considerable removal of heavy metals by isolated metal-resistant strains. Pseudomonas sp. reduced 37% (Pb2+), 32% (Ni2+), 29% (Cu2+), and 32% (Cr3+) and was thus found to be most effective, whereas Enterobacter sp. reduced 19% (Pb2+), 7% (Ni2+), 14% (Cu2+), and 21% (Cr3+) and was found to be least effective. While average reduction of Pb2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Cr3+ by Citrobacter sp. was found to be 24%, 18%, 23%, and 27%, respectively, among recognized species. This study revealed that Pseudomonas sp. may provide a new microbial community that can be used for enhanced remediation of contaminated environment.
TI  - Dynamics of MDR Enterobacter cloacae outbreaks in a neonatal unit in Nepal: insights using wider sampling frames and next-generation sequencing.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There are limited data on Enterobacter cloacae outbreaks and fewer describing these in association with NDM-1. With whole-genome sequencing, we tested the hypothesis that a cluster of 16 E. cloacae bacteraemia cases in a Nepali neonatal unit represented a single clonal outbreak, using a wider set of epidemiologically unrelated clinical E. cloacae isolates for comparison. METHODS: Forty-three isolates were analysed, including 23 E. cloacae and 3 Citrobacter sp. isolates obtained from blood cultures from 16 neonates over a 3 month period. These were compared with two contemporaneous community-associated drug-resistant isolates from adults, a unit soap dispenser isolate and a set of historical invasive isolates (n=14) from the same geographical locality. RESULTS: There were two clear neonatal outbreaks and one isolated case in the unit. One outbreak was associated with an NDM-1 plasmid also identified in a historical community-associated strain. The smaller, second outbreak was likely associated with a contaminated soap dispenser. The two community-acquired adult cases and three sets of historical hospital-associated neonatal isolates represented four additional genetic clusters. CONCLUSIONS: E. cloacae infections in this context represent several different transmission networks, operating at the community/hospital and host strain/plasmid levels. Wide sampling frames and high-resolution typing methods are needed to describe the complex molecular epidemiology of E. cloacae outbreaks, which is not appropriately reflected by routine susceptibility phenotypes. Soap dispensers may represent a reservoir for E. cloacae and bacterial strains and plasmids may persist in hospitals and in the community for long periods, sporadically being involved in outbreaks of disease.
TI  - Characterization of Beta-lactamases in Faecal Enterobacteriaceae Recovered from Healthy Humans in Spain: Focusing on AmpC Polymorphisms.
AB  - The intestinal tract is a huge reservoir of Enterobacteriaceae, some of which are opportunist pathogens. Several genera of these bacteria harbour intrinsic antibiotic resistance genes, such as ampC genes in species of Citrobacter, Enterobacter or Escherichia genera. In this work, beta-lactamases and other resistance mechanisms have been characterized in Enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from healthy human faecal samples, focusing on the ampC beta-lactamase genes. Fifty human faecal samples were obtained, and 70 Enterobacteriaceae bacteria were isolated: 44 Escherichia coli, 4 Citrobacter braakii, 9 Citrobacter freundii, 8 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Proteus mirabilis, 1 Proteus vulgaris, 1 Klebsiella oxytoca, 1 Serratia sp. and 1 Cronobacter sp. A high percentage of resistance to ampicillin was detected (57 %), observing the AmpC phenotype in 22 isolates (31 %) and the ESBL phenotype in 3 isolates. AmpC molecular characterization showed high diversity into bla CMY and bla ACT genes from Citrobacter and Enterobacter species, respectively, and the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis demonstrated low clonality among them. The prevalence of people colonized by strains carrying plasmid-mediated ampC genes obtained in this study was 2 %. The unique plasmid-mediated bla AmpC identified in this study was the bla CMY-2 gene, detected in an E. coli isolate ascribed to the sequence type ST405 which belonged to phylogenetic group D. The hybridization and conjugation experiments demonstrated that the ISEcp1-bla CMY-2-blc structure was carried by a ~78-kb self-transferable IncK plasmid. This study shows a high polymorphism among beta-lactamase genes in Enterobacteriaceae from healthy people microbiota. Extensive AmpC-carrier studies would provide important information and could allow the anticipation of future global health problems.
TI  - Molecular detection of ESBLs production and antibiotic resistance patterns in Gram negative bacilli isolated from urinary tract infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: beta-lactam resistance is more prevalent in Gram negative bacterial isolates worldwide, particularly in developing countries. In order to provide data relating to antibiotic therapy and resistance control, routine monitoring of corresponding antibiotic resistance genes is necessary. AIMS: The aim of this study was the characterization of beta-lactam resistance genes and its plasmid profile in bacteria isolated from urinary tract infection samples. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 298 Gram negative bacteria isolated from 6739 urine specimens were identified by biochemical standard tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the disk diffusion method. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains were also detected by the double-disk synergy test. The presence of blaTEM and blaSHV genes in the strains studied was ascertained by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Of all Gram negative bacteria, Escherichia coli (69.1%) was the most common strain, followed by Klebsiella sp. (12.1%), Enterobacter sp. (8.4%), Proteus sp. (4.4%), Citrobacter (4%) and Pseudomonas sp. (2%). The most antibiotic resistance was shown to tetracycline (95.16%), nalidixic acid (89.78%) and gentamycin (73.20%) antibiotics. Among all the strains tested, 35 isolates (11.75%) expressed ESBL activity. The prevalence of TEM and SHV positivity among these isolates was 34.29%, followed by TEM (31.43%), TEM and SHV negativity (20.0%) and SHV (14.29%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Regular monitoring of antimicrobial drug resistance seems necessary to improve our guidelines in the use of the empirical antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Are community environmental surfaces near hospitals reservoirs for gram-negative  nosocomial pathogens?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital visitors and staff visit neighboring businesses, creating the potential for contamination of surfaces with hospital flora. METHODS: Cultures were obtained from environmental surfaces in hospital lobbies and the surrounding community of 6 hospitals in Brooklyn, NY. As a control, cultures were taken from surfaces >1.5 miles from any hospital. Screening for beta-lactamases was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and select isolates were fingerprinted by the repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-PCR method. RESULTS: Of 493 cultures, most (70%) involved doors from local businesses. Cephalosporin-resistant Citrobacter freundii (n = 3), Escherichia coli (n = 2), and Enterobacter sp (n = 2) were recovered from surfaces near hospitals, but not from control sites. One isolate of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia harbored an integron-associated VIM-2. Acinetobacter baumannii was recovered in 15 samples, including 4.5% of swabs from </=0.5 miles of the hospitals versus 0% from >/=0.6 miles (P = .004). Eleven A baumannii isolates were clonally related by repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-PCR and were also related to a known clinical isolate. CONCLUSIONS: Strains of A baumannii and cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae can be recovered from environmental surfaces surrounding hospitals. Finding these pathogens in the perihospital environment suggests hand cleansing should be emphasized for all people entering and leaving hospitals. The finding of integron-associated VIM-2 in our region is disconcerting, and further vigilance is warranted.
TI  - Isolation and molecular characterization of biofouling bacteria and profiling of  quorum sensing signal molecules from membrane bioreactor activated sludge.
AB  - The formation of biofilm in a membrane bioreactor depends on the production of various signaling molecules like N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs). In the present study, a total of 200 bacterial strains were isolated from membrane bioreactor activated sludge and screened for AHLs production using two biosensor systems, Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 and Agrobacterium tumefaciens A136. A correlation between AHLs production and biofilm formation has been made among screened AHLs producing strains. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed the dominance of Aeromonas and Enterobacter sp. in AHLs production; however few a species of Serratia, Leclercia, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Raoultella and Citrobacter were also identified. The chromatographic characterization of sludge extract showed the presence of a broad range of quorum sensing signal molecules. Further identification of sludge AHLs by thin layer chromatography bioassay and high performance liquid chromatography confirms the presence of C4-HSL, C6-HSL, C8-HSL, 3-oxo-C8-HSL, C10-HSL, C12-HSL, 3-oxo-C12-HSL and C14-HSL. The occurrence of AHLs in sludge extract and dominance of Aeromonas and Enterobacter sp. in activated sludge suggests the key role of these bacterial strains in AHLs production and thereby membrane fouling.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - Culture-independent analysis of endophytic bacterial communities associated with  Brazilian sugarcane.
AB  - Sugarcane is an economically important culture in Brazil. Endophytic bacteria live inside plants, and can provide many benefits to the plant host. We analyzed the bacterial diversity of sugarcane cultivar RB-72454 by cultivation-independent techniques. Total DNA from sugarcane stems from a commercial plantation located in Parana State was extracted. Partial 16S rRNA genes were amplified and sequenced for library construction. Of 152 sequences obtained, 52% were similar to 16S rRNA from Pseudomonas sp, and 35.5% to Enterobacter sp. The genera Pantoea, Serratia, Citrobacter, and Klebsiella were also represented. The endophytic communities in these sugarcane samples were dominated by the families Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonadaceae (class Gammaproteobacteria).
TI  - Pseudocitrobacter gen. nov., a novel genus of the Enterobacteriaceae with two new species Pseudocitrobacter faecalis sp. nov., and Pseudocitrobacter anthropi sp. nov, isolated from fecal samples from hospitalized patients in Pakistan.
AB  - Four isolates of Gram-negative facultatively anaerobic bacteria, three of them producing NDM-1 carbapenemase, were isolated from hospitalized patients and outpatients attending two military hospitals in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, and studied for their taxonomic position. Initially the strains were phenotypically identified as Citrobacter species. Comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences then showed that the four strains shared >97%, but in no case >98.3%, 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities to members of the genera Citrobacter, Kluyvera, Pantoea, Enterobacter and Raoultella, but always formed a separate cluster in respective phylogenetic trees. Based on multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) including partial recN, rpoA, thdF and rpoB gene sequence and respective amino acid sequence analysis it turned out that the strains also here always formed separate clusters. Based on further comparative analyses including DNA-DNA hybridizations, genomic fingerprint analysis using rep- and RAPD-PCRs and physiological tests, it is proposed to classify these four strains into the novel genus Pseudocitrobacter gen. nov. with a new species Pseudocitrobacter faecalis sp. nov. with strain 25 CIT(T) (=CCM 8479(T)=LMG 27751(T)) and Pseudocitrobacter anthropi sp. nov. with strain C138(T) (=CCM 8478(T)=LMG 27750(T)), as the type strains, respectively.
TI  - Mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions of gyrA and parC in Enterobacteriaceae isolates from Brazil.
AB  - Mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDR) in chromosomal gyrA and parC genes and fluoroquinolone susceptibility profiles were investigated in quinolone-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolated from community and hospitalized patients in the Brazilian Southeast region. A total of 112 nalidixic acid-resistant enterobacterial isolates collected from 2000 to 2005 were investigated for mutations in the topoisomerases genes gyrA and parC by amplifying and sequencing the QRDR regions. Susceptibility to fluoroquinolones was tested by the agar dilution method. Amongst the 112 enterobacterial isolates, 81 (72.3%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin and 5 (4.5%) showed reduced susceptibility. Twenty-six (23.2%) were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Several alterations were detected in gyrA and parC genes. Escherichia coli isolates (47.7%) showed double mutations in the gyrA gene and a single one in the parC gene. Two unusual aminoacid substitutions are reported, an Asp87-Asn in a Citrobacter freundii isolate with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and a Glu84-Ala in one E. coli isolate. Only a parC gene mutation was found in fluoroquinolone-susceptible Enterobacter aerogenes. None of the isolates susceptible to ciprofloxacin presented mutations in topoisomerase genes. This comprehensive analysis of QRDRs in gyrA and parC genes, covering commonly isolated Enterobacteriaceae in Brazil is the largest reported up to now.
TI  - Determination of antimicrobial and heavy metal resistance profiles of some bacteria isolated from aquatic amphibian and reptile species.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to determine the level of antibiotic resistance  patterns and distribution of heavy metal resistance of bacterial isolates from aquatic animals (Lissotriton vulgaris, Pelophylax ridibundus, Emys orbicularis, Mauremys rivulata, and Natrix natrix) in Turkey (Kavak Delta). A total of 153 bacteria have been successfully isolated from cloaca and oral samples of the aquatic amphibians and reptilians which were found, namely, Aeromonas sp. (n = 29), Plesiomonas sp. (n = 7), Vibrio sp. (n = 12), Citrobacter sp. (n = 12), Enterobacter sp. (n = 11), Escherichia sp. (n = 22), Klebsiella sp. (n = 22), Edwardsiella sp. (n = 6), Hafnia sp. (n = 1), Proteus sp. (n = 19), Providencia sp. (n = 8), and Pseudomonas sp. (n = 4). In terms of antibiotic and heavy metal susceptibility testing, each isolate was tested against 12 antibiotics and 4 metals. There was a high incidence of resistance to cefoxitin (46.40 %), ampicillin (44.44 %), erythromycin (35.29 %), and a low incidence of resistance to gentamicin (6.53 %), kanamycin (8.49 %), chloramphenicol (9.15 %), and cefotaxime (10.45 %). The multiple antibiotic resistance index of each bacterial species indicated that bacteria from raised amphibians and reptiles have been exposed to tested antibiotics, with results ranging from 0 to 0.58. Most isolates showed tolerance to different concentrations of heavy metals, and minimal inhibition concentrations ranged from100 to >3,200 mug/mL. According to these results, a significant occurrence of bacteria in the internal organs of reptiles and amphibians, with a high incidence of resistance against antibiotics and heavy metals, may risk aquatic animals and the public health. These data appoint the importance of epidemiological surveillance and microbiological monitoring and reinforce the need to implement environment protection programs for amphibian and reptile species.
TI  - Resistance and inactivation kinetics of bacterial strains isolated from the non-chlorinated and chlorinated effluents of a WWTP.
AB  - The microbiological quality of water from a wastewater treatment plant that uses  sodium hypochlorite as a disinfectant was assessed. Mesophilic aerobic bacteria were not removed efficiently. This fact allowed for the isolation of several bacterial strains from the effluents. Molecular identification indicated that the strains were related to Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli (three strains), Enterobacter cloacae, Kluyvera cryocrescens (three strains), Kluyvera intermedia, Citrobacter freundii (two strains), Bacillus sp. and Enterobacter sp. The first five strains, which were isolated from the non-chlorinated effluent, were used to test resistance to chlorine disinfection using three sets of variables: disinfectant concentration (8, 20 and 30 mg.L(-1)), contact time (0, 15 and 30 min) and water temperature (20, 25 and 30 degrees C). The results demonstrated that the strains have independent responses to experimental conditions and that the most efficient treatment was an 8 mg.L(-1) dose of disinfectant at a temperature of 20 degrees C for 30 min. The other eight strains, which were isolated from the chlorinated effluent, were used to analyze inactivation kinetics using the disinfectant at a dose of 15 mg.L(-1) with various retention times (0, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 min). The results indicated that during the inactivation process, there was no relationship between removal percentage and retention time and that the strains have no common response to the treatments.
TI  - Surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in Indian.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. METHODS: Urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (UTI)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. RESULTS: From wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during April 2011 to September 2012. Two Gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), and nine Gram-negative bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. Both S. aureus and E. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. Particularly, all Gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for UTI. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiograms of 11 UTI-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and S. aureus. Moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis is a matter of concern.
TI  - Enterobacterial detection and Escherichia coli antimicrobial resistance in parrots seized from the illegal wildlife trade.
AB  - Enteric bacteria are considered important potential pathogens in avian clinical medicine, causing either primary or opportunistic infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of enterobacteria in the intestinal microbiota of psittacine birds and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of the Escherichia coli isolates cultured. Fecal samples were collected from 300 parrots captured from the illegal wildlife trade in Goias, Brazil and were processed using conventional bacteriological procedures. A total of 508 isolates were obtained from 300 fecal samples: 172 E. coli (33.9% of isolates; 57.3% of individuals); 153 Enterobacter spp. (30.1% of isolates; 51.0% of individuals); 89 Klebsiella spp. (17.7% of isolates; 29.7% of individuals); 59 Citrobacter spp. (11.6% of isolates; 19.7% of individuals), 21 Proteus vulgaris (4.2% of isolates; 7.0% of individuals), 5 Providencia alcalifaciens (0.98% of isolates; 1.67% of individuals), 5 Serratia sp. (0.98% of isolates; 1.67% of individuals), 3 Hafnia aivei (0.59% of isolates; 1.00% of individuals), and 1 Salmonella sp. (0.20% of isolates; 0.33% of individuals). Escherichia coli isolates were subsequently tested for susceptibility to the following antibiotics: amoxicillin (70.93% of the isolates were resistant), ampicillin (75.58%), ciprofloxacin (23.25%), chloramphenicol (33.14%), doxycycline (64.53%), enrofloxacin (41.28%), tetracycline (69.19%), and sulfonamide (71.51%). Multi-resistance to three and four groups of antibiotics occurred in 40 samples (23.25%) and 4 samples (2.32%), respectively. These results demonstrate that illegally traded birds are carriers of potentially pathogenic bacteria, including E. coli strains with antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Distribution of chitin/chitosan-like bioflocculant-producing potential in the genus Citrobacter.
AB  - Some strains belonging to the genera Citrobacter and Enterobacter have been reported to produce chitin/chitosan-like bioflocculants (BFs) from acetate. In this study, to investigate the distribution of the BF-producing potential in the genus Citrobacter and to screen stably and highly BF-producing strains, we obtained 36 Citrobacter strains from different culture collection centers, which were distributed among seven species in the genus, and tested for the flocculating activities of their culture supernatants using a kaolin suspension method. As a result, 21 strains belonging to C. freundii (17 strains in 23 strains tested), C. braakii (two in two), C. youngae (one in one), and C. werkmanii (one in two) showed flocculating activity, but this ability was limited to cells grown on acetate. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of the hydrolysates from the BFs of five selected strains indicated that they consisted of glucosamine and/or N-acetylglucosamine, such as the chitin/chitosan-like BF (BF04) produced by Citrobacter sp. TKF04 (Fujita et al. J Biosci Bioeng 89: 40-46, 2000). Gel filtration chromatography using a high-performance liquid chromatography system revealed that the molecular weight ranges of these BFs varied, but the average sizes were all above 1.66 x 10(6)Da.
TI  - De-escalation of antimicrobial therapy for bacteraemia due to difficult-to-treat  Gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the status and clinical outcome of de-escalating antimicrobial therapy for bacteraemia due to hospital-acquired, Gram-negative bacilli that are difficult to treat. METHODS: Among 1,610 patients presenting with positive blood cultures collected at our medical centre over a 6-year period, 133 were infected with Serratia, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Citrobacter or Enterobacter sp. (SPACES). We examined the appropriateness of an empiric initial administration of antimicrobials based on in vitro sensitivity, and the success and outcomes of a pathogen-directed de-escalation of therapy. The treatment was considered to be successfully de-escalated when the antimicrobial spectrum was narrowed according to a spectrum ranking or when >/= 2 antimicrobials prescribed initially were lowered to one agent. Outcome measures included persistent, recurrent and metastatic infections, infection-related deaths and cost of antimicrobials. RESULTS: The treatment was initially appropriate in 79 of 133 patients (59 %), of whom 49 (62 %) were candidates for and 28 (57 %) underwent treatment de-escalation. No treatment failure was observed among these 28 patients, while 2 of 11 patients (18 %) whose treatment was not de-escalated died (p = 0.13). The median cost of antimicrobials was <euro>250/patient lower in the de-escalated than in the non-de-escalated group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial therapy for bacteraemia due to hard-to-treat SPACES was de-escalated in 57 % of candidates, based on the in vitro sensitivity, with no deaths and significantly lower costs of antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Biohydrogen production by dark fermentation of glycerol using Enterobacter and Citrobacter Sp.
AB  - Glycerol is an attractive substrate for biohydrogen production because, in theory, it can produce 3 mol of hydrogen per mol of glycerol. Moreover, glycerol is produced in substantial amounts as a byproduct of producing biodiesel, the demand for which has increased in recent years. Therefore, hydrogen production from glycerol was studied by dark fermentation using three strains of bacteria: namely, Enterobacter spH1, Enterobacter spH2, and Citrobacter freundii H3 and a mixture thereof (1:1:1). It was found that, when an initial concentration of 20 g/L of glycerol was used, all three strains and their mixture produced substantial amounts of hydrogen ranging from 2400 to 3500 mL/L, being highest for C. freundii H3 (3547 mL/L) and Enterobacter spH1 (3506 mL/L). The main nongaseous fermentation products were ethanol and acetate, albeit in different ratios. For Enterobacter spH1, Enterobacter spH2, C. freundii H3, and the mixture (1:1:1), the ethanol yields (in mol EtOH/mol glycerol consumed) were 0.96, 0.67, 0.31, and 0.66, respectively. Compared to the individual strains, the mixture (1:1:1) did not show a significantly higher hydrogen level, indicating that there was no synergistic effect. Enterobacter spH1 was selected for further investigation because of its higher yield of hydrogen and ethanol.
TI  - Coastal seawater bacteria harbor a large reservoir of plasmid-mediated quinolone  resistance determinants in Jiaozhou Bay, China.
AB  - Diversity and prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants were investigated in environmental bacteria isolated from surface seawater of Jiaozhou Bay, China. Five qnr gene alleles were identified in 34 isolates by PCR amplification, including qnrA3 gene in a Shewanella algae isolate, qnrB9 gene in a Citrobacter freundii isolate, qnrD gene in 22 Proteus vulgaris isolates, qnrS1 gene in 1 Enterobacter sp. and 4 Klebsiella spp. isolates, and qnrS2 gene in 1 Pseudomonas sp. and 4 Pseudoalteromonas sp. isolates. The qnrC, aac(6')-Ib-cr, and qepA genes could not be detected in this study. The 22 qnrD-positive Proteus vulgaris isolates could be differentiated into four genotypes based on ERIC-PCR assay. The qnrS1 and qnrD genes could be transferred to Escherichia coli J53 Azi(R) or E. coli TOP10 recipient strains using conjugation or transformation methods. Among the 34 qnr-positive isolates, 30 had a single point mutation in the QRDRs of GyrA protein (Ala67Ser, Ser83Ile, or Ser83Thr), indicating that cooperation of chromosome- and plasmid-mediated resistance contributed to the spread and evolution of quinolone resistance in this coastal bay. Eighty-five percent of the isolates were also found to be resistant to ampicillin, and bla(CMY), bla(OXY), bla(SHV), and bla(TEM) genes were detected in five isolates that also harbored the qnrB9 or qnrS1 gene. Our current study is the first identification of qnrS2 gene in Pseudoalteromonas and Pseudomonas strains, and qnrD gene in Proteus vulgaris strains. High prevalence of diverse qnr genes in Jiaozhou Bay indicates that coastal seawater may serve as an important reservoir, natural source, and dissemination vehicle of quinolone resistance determinants.
TI  - Rectal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli in community settings in Madagascar.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extended-spectrum ss-lactamase-producing Enterobacteria (ESBL-PE) emerged at the end of the 1980s, causing nosocomial outbreaks and/or hyperendemic situations in hospitals and long-term care facilities. In recent years, community-acquired infections due to ESBL-PE have spread worldwide, especially across developing countries including Madagascar. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of intestinal carriage of ESBL-PE in the community of Antananarivo. METHODS: Non-hospitalized patients were recruited in three health centers in different socio economic settings. Fresh stool collected were immediately plated on Drigalski agar containing 3 mg/liter of ceftriaxone. Gram-negative bacilli species were identified and ESBL production was tested by a double disk diffusion (cefotaxime and ceftazidime +/- clavulanate) assay. Characterization of ESBLs were perfomed by PCR and direct sequencing. Molecular epidemiology was analysed by Rep-PCR and ERIC-PCR. RESULTS: 484 patients were screened (sex ratio = 1.03, median age 28 years). 53 ESBL-PE were isolated from 49 patients (carrier rate 10.1%). The isolates included Escherichia coli (31), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14), Enterobacter cloacae (3), Citrobacter freundii (3), Kluyvera spp. (1) and Pantoae sp. (1). In multivariate analysis, only the socioeconomic status of the head of household was independently associated with ESBL-PE carriage, poverty being the predominant risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of carriage of ESBL in the community of Antananarivo is one of the highest reported worldwide. This alarming spread of resistance genes should be stopped urgently by improving hygiene and streamlining the distribution and consumption of antibiotics.
TI  - Occurrence of yeasts, pseudomonads and enteric bacteria in the oral cavity of patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of yeasts, pseudomonads and  enteric bacteria in the oral cavity of patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) for treatment of head and neck cancer. Fifty patients receiving RT were examined before, during and 30 days after RT. Saliva, mucosa, and biofilm samples were collected and microorganisms were detected by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The most prevalent yeasts in patients submitted to RT were Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, C. krusei, C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis. Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Klebsiella, Proteus, and Pseudomonas were the most frequently cultivated bacteria. Before RT, targeted bacteria were cultivated from 22.2% of edentulous patients and 16.6% of dentate patients; 30 days after RT, these microorganisms were recovered from 77.8% edentulous and 46.8% dentate patients. By PCR, these microorganisms were detected from all edentulous patients, 78.1% of dentate patients. The presence of Gram-negative enteric roads and fungi was particularly frequent in patients presenting mucositis level III or IV. Modifications in the oral environment due to RT treatment seem to facilitate the colonization of oral cavity by members of family Enterobacteriaceae, genera Enterococcus and Candida.
TI  - The influence of environmental bacteria in freshwater stingray wound-healing.
AB  - Invasion by bacteria can influence the course of healing of wounds acquired in aquatic environment. In this study, the bacteria present in Potamotrygon motoro stingray mucus and in the Alto Parana river water were identified, and their ability to induce tissue injury and resist antibiotics was determined. Biochemical identification analysis showed that 97% of all bacterial isolates were Gram negative, Aeromonas spp., Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii being the species most prevalent. Gelatinase and caseinase were produced by Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas sobria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. Erythrocyte hemolysis assay showed that A. sobria, A. hydrophila and to a lesser extent, other Gram-negative bacteria produced hemolysin. It was also observed that molecules released in culture by these bacteria were toxic to human epithelial cells. Antibiogram results showed that 68% of all bacterial isolates were resistant to at least one type of antibiotic, mainly B-lactams. Finally, it was demonstrated that although P. motoro venom was toxic to epithelial cells it did not influence bacterial proliferation. In summary, the results obtained in this work indicate that during the accident, the mucus of P. motoro and the environmental water may transfer into the wound pathogenic multi-resistant bacteria with the potential to cause severe secondary infections.
TI  - Analysis of the DNA region mediating increased thermotolerance at 58 degrees C in Cronobacter sp. and other enterobacterial strains.
AB  - Cronobacter spp. are opportunistic pathogens associated with serious infections in neonates. The increased stress tolerance, including thermoresistance, of some Cronobacter strains can promote their survival in production facilities and thus raise the possibility of contamination of dried infant milk formula, which has been identified as a potential source of infection. In this study, we characterized a DNA region which is present in some Cronobacter strains and which contributes to their prolonged survival at 58 degrees C. The 18 kbp long region containing 22 open reading frames was sequenced in Cronobacter sakazakii ATCC 29544. The major feature of the region contained a cluster of conserved genes, most of them having significant homologies with bacterial proteins involved in some type of stress response, including heat, oxidation and acid stress. The same thermoresistance DNA region was detected in strains belonging to the genera Cronobacter, Enterobacter, Citrobacter and Escherichia and its presence positively correlated with increased thermotolerance.
TI  - Bacterial species associated with sound and Botrytis-infected grapes from a Greek vineyard.
AB  - Grape bacterial microbiota plays central roles in the quality of grapes and wine, yet its diversity remains poorly described. In the present study, bacterial species associated with sound and Botrytis-infected grapes of two cultivars originating from the same vineyard were assessed. Isolates were identified by PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and sequence analysis of partial 16S rRNA gene. Comparable counts were recorded between Botrytis-infected and sound grape samples. In all cases, the majority of isolates belonged to different species of Enterobacteriaceae. The dominant species in the vineyard was Klebsiella oxytoca that was found in different combinations with Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Erwinia sp., Pantoea dispersa, Tatumella ptyseos or other species. In fermenting musts, those populations declined while other species evolved, like Lactobacillus plantarum and Enterobacter ludwigii. Populations in botrytised samples persisted longer during spontaneous fermentations. Present study suggests that bacterial diversity on grapes may be wider than previously described.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of bacteria from the gut of Bombyx mori that degrade cellulose, xylan, pectin and starch and their impact on digestion.
AB  - Bombyx mori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) have been domesticated and widely used for silk production. It feeds on mulberry leaves. Mulberry leaves are mainly composed of pectin, xylan, cellulose and starch. Some of the digestive enzymes that degrade these carbohydrates might be produced by gut bacteria. Eleven isolates were obtained from the digestive tract of B. mori, including the Gram positive Bacillus circulans and Gram negative Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia liquefaciens, Enterobacter sp., Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. aeruginosa, Aeromonas sp., and Erwinia sp.. Three of these isolates, P. vulgaris, K. pneumoniae, C. freundii, were cellulolytic and xylanolytic, P. fluorescens and Erwinia sp., were pectinolytic and K. pneumoniae degraded starch. Aeromonas sp. was able to utilize the CMcellulose and xylan. S. liquefaciens was able to utilize three polysaccharides including CMcellulose, xylan and pectin. B. circulans was able to utilize all four polysaccharides with different efficacy. The gut of B. mori has an alkaline pH and all of the isolated bacterial strains were found to grow and degrade polysaccharides at alkaline pH. The number of cellulolytic bacteria increases with each instar.
TI  - Phytoremediation of mercury in pristine and crude oil contaminated soils: Contributions of rhizobacteria and their host plants to mercury removal.
AB  - The rhizospheric soils of three tested legume crops: broad beans (Vicia faba), beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) and pea (Pisum sativum), and two nonlegume crops: cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and tomato, (Lycopersicon esculentum) contained considerable numbers (the magnitude of 10(5)g(-1) soil) of bacteria with the combined potential for hydrocarbon-utilization and mercury-resistance. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA coding genes of rhizobacteria associated with broad beans revealed that they were affiliated to Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Exiquobacterium aurantiacum, Pseudomonas veronii, Micrococcus luteus, Brevibacillus brevis, Arthrobacter sp. and Flavobacterium psychrophilum. These rhizobacteria were also diazotrophic, i.e. capable of N(2) fixation, which makes them self-sufficient regarding their nitrogen nutrition and thus suitable remediation agents in nitrogen-poor soils, such as the oily desert soil. The crude oil attenuation potential of the individual rhizobacteria was inhibited by HgCl(2), but about 50% or more of this potential was still maintained in the presence of up to 40 mgl(-1) HgCl(2). Rhizobacteria-free plants removed amounts of mercury from the surrounding media almost equivalent to those removed by the rhizospheric bacterial consortia in the absence of the plants. It was concluded that both the collector plants and their rhizospheric bacterial consortia contributed equivalently to mercury removal from soil.
TI  - Reconstruction of the violacein biosynthetic pathway from Duganella sp. B2 in different heterologous hosts.
AB  - Violacein is a bacteria-originated indolocarbazole pigment with potential applications due to its various bioactivities such as anti-tumor, antiviral, and antifungal activities. However, stable mass production of this pigment is difficult due to its low productivities and the instability of wild-type violacein-producing strains. In order to establish a stable and efficient production system for violacein, the violacein synthesis pathway from a new species of Duganella sp. B2 was reconstructed in different bacterial strains including Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes by using different vectors. The gene cluster that encodes five enzymes involved in the violacein biosynthetic pathway was first isolated from Duganella sp. B2, and three recombinant expression vectors were constructed using the T7 promoter or the alkane-responsive promoter PalkB. Our results showed that violacein could be stably synthesized in E. coli, C. freundii, and E. aerogenes. Interestingly, we found that there were great differences between the different recombinant strains, not only in the protein expression profiles pertaining to violacein biosynthesis but also in the productivity and composition of crude violacein. Among the host strains tested, the crude violacein production by the recombinant C. freundii strain reached 1.68 g L(-1) in shake flask cultures, which was 4-fold higher than the highest production previously reported in flask culture by other groups. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the efficient production of violacein by genetically engineered strains.
TI  - Origin and diversity of metabolically active gut bacteria from laboratory-bred larvae of Manduca sexta (Sphingidae, Lepidoptera, Insecta).
AB  - Cultivation-independent analyses based on genetic profiling of partial bacterial  16S rRNA genes by PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR-SSCP of the 16S rRNA itself, and stable isotope probing (SIP), followed by RT-PCR-SSCP, were applied to characterize the diversity of metabolically active bacteria in the larval gut of Manduca sexta bred on tobacco leaves under greenhouse conditions. For SIP, hatching larvae were fed with leaves from tobacco plants grown in a (13)CO(2)-enriched atmosphere. Dominant SSCP bands were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. Only one major gut colonizer, an Enterococcus relative, was detected; it occurred in the heavy RNA fraction, demonstrating its metabolic activity, and it originated from eggs, where its metabolic activity was also indicated by rRNA-based SSCP profiles. In contrast, a Citrobacter sedlakii relative was detected on eggs by DNA-SSCP, but rRNA-SSCP and SIP-rRNA-SSCP were negative, suggesting that these bacterial cells were inactive. A Burkholderia relative was dominant and metabolically active on the tobacco leaves but inactive inside the gut, where it was also quantitatively reduced, as suggested by lower band intensities in the DNA-based SSCP profiles. SIP-RNA-SSCP detected another metabolically active gut bacterium (Enterobacter sp.) and more bacteria in the light RNA fraction, indicating low or no metabolic activity of the latter inside the gut. We conclude that the larval gut supported only a low diversity of metabolically active bacteria.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria community SFC-2 used for fermentation of air-dried crop straws].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria community SFC-2 in fermented crop straw. METHODS: Total 13 isolates were obtained from spontaneous fermented rice straw by plating, paper diffusion and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis. All these strains were used to determine the antibacterial activity of SFC-2. RESULTS: (1) Phylogenetic analysis of the 13 strains based on 16S rDNA gene sequence data indicated that 9 strains belong to Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacterfreundii, Klebsiella terrigena and Citrobacter sp., which were all common pathogens or opportunistic pathogens. (2) Indicating bacteria selected from the pathogens were used to detect antibacterial activity of SFC-2 cell-free culture supernatant. The results showed that: SFC-2 community had stronger antibacterial activity than isolated strains from SFC-2 community or man-made communities against indicating bacteria. (3) Antibacterial activities of seven different cell-free culture supernatants, which were extracted at intervals from the culture of SFC-2 community during 14-48 hours, were no obvious difference, but the content of organic acids were obvious differences during 14-48 hours; the antibacterial substances were stable after heating and sensitive partly to protease K.
TI  - [Intestinal enterobacteria of the hibernating Apis mellifera mellifera L. bees].
AB  - Dynamics of enterobacteria of normal intestinal microflora was studied in Apis mellifera mellifera L. bees hibernating under snow in the Western Urals. The cell numbers (N) of the predominant species Klebsiella oxytoca increased from 10-10(6) CFU/bee in November 2004 to 10(4)-10(7) CFU/bee in March 2005; its frequency of occurrence (P) increased from 92 to 100%. Increase of Providencia rettgeri (11.2004: N up to 10(6), P 25%; 03.2005: N 10(2)-10(6), P 80%) was accompanied by the substitution of Morganella morganii (11.2004: N up to 10(6), P 25%) with Proteus vulgaris (03.2005: N up to 10(5), P 8%). By spring, Hafnia alvei and Citrobacter sp., which are pathogenic to bees, disappeared (11.2004: N up to 10(5), P 13 and 10%, respectively). Endophytic species Pantoea agglomerans, Leclecria sp., and other representatives of the "Enterobacter agglomerans" group were present in November and after the first emergence in spring (N up to 10(5); November: P 15%; April: P 23%). In April, the number of enterobacteria decreased to 10(5), and P. rettgeri became the predominant species (P 54%) instead of K. oxytoca (P 43%).
TI  - Prevalence of bacterial contamination with antibiotic-resistant and enterotoxigenic fecal coliforms in treated drinking water.
AB  - Pollution indicator bacteria such as coliforms, fecal coliforms, and fecal streptococci were enumerated using a multiple-tube fermentation method in 100 treated drinking-water samples from 20 locations in residential, commercial, and industrial areas of a tropical city during summer. Thirty-four percent of the samples were bacteriologically nonpotable. Maximum coliform-contaminated (27%) samples were derived from industrial areas, while samples contaminated with fecal coliform (23%) and fecal streptococci (20%) originated from commercial areas. Coliforms identified as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp., and Citrobacter sp. were present in 29%, 26%, 24%, and 15% of samples, respectively. Fecal coliforms were examined for antibiotic susceptibility with disc diffusion method. All test isolates exhibited multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) for kanamycin, nalidixic acid, tetracycline, and trimethoprim. Escherichia coli isolates were examined for enterotoxigenicity using the suckling mice bioassay and 60% of the isolates displayed enterotoxigenicity. Data indicate that drinking water contaminated with antibiotic-resistant enterotoxigenic fecal bacteria may be responsible for presence of waterborne diarrheal diseases attributed to therapeutic agents used by urban populations in the tropics.
TI  - Carbohydrate and ethane release with Erwinia carotovora subspecies betavasculorum--induced necrosis.
AB  - Erwinia carotovora subspecies betavasculorum, also known as E. betavasculorum and Pectobacterium betavasculorum, is a soil bacterium that has the capacity to cause root rot necrosis of sugarbeets. The qualitatively different pathogenicity exhibited by the virulent E. carotovora strain and two avirulent strains, a Citrobacter sp. and an Enterobacter cloacae, was examined using digital analysis of photographic evidence of necrosis as well as for carbohydrate, ethane, and ethylene release compared with uninoculated potato tuber slices. Visual scoring of necrosis was superior to digital analysis of photographs. The release of carbohydrates and ethane from potato tuber slices inoculated with the soft rot necrosis-causing Erwinia was significantly greater than that of potato tuber slices that had not been inoculated or that had been inoculated with the nonpathogenic E. cloacae and Citrobacter sp. strains. Interestingly, ethylene production from potato slices left uninoculated or inoculated with the nonpathogenic Citrobacter strain was 5- to 10-fold higher than with potato slices inoculated with the pathogenic Erwinia strain. These findings suggest that (1) carbohydrate release might be a useful measure of the degree of pathogenesis, or relative virulence; and that (2) bacterial suppression of ethylene formation may be a critical step in root rot disease formation.
TI  - Diverse endophytic nitrogen-fixing bacteria isolated from wild rice Oryza rufipogon and description of Phytobacter diazotrophicus gen. nov. sp. nov.
AB  - Twenty-three nitrogen-fixing bacteria were isolated from surface-sterilized stems and roots of wild rice Oryza rufipogon. Four clusters were defined among these bacteria by SDS-PAGE protein patterns and further confirmed by IS-PCR finger-printing analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the representative strains LS 8 and LS 18 of cluster II formed a monophyletic group sharing 94.0-97.3% similarities with defined enterobacterial species within the genera Salmonella, Citrobacter, Pantoea, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter. DNA-DNA hybridization, physiological, biochemical tests, and cell morphology also revealed that these strains could be differentiated from the related enterobacterial species. Based upon these results, we propose Phytobacter diazotrophicus gen. nov., sp. nov. to the bacterial group represented by strains LS 8 and LS 18. The type strain is LS 8(T) (=DSM 17806(T) = LMG 23328(T) = CGMCC 1.5339(T)). The DNA G+C content of strain LS 8(T) is 58.6 +/- 0.5 mol%.
TI  - Multiple antimicrobial resistance in Enterobacteriaceae isolates from pristine freshwater.
AB  - A freshwater enterobacterial population (N = 111) was studied for antimicrobial and mercury resistance patterns, and for its possible association with biotic and abiotic factors in that environment. Conventional biochemical tests identified Klebsiella sp, Morganella sp, Serratia sp, Escherichia sp, Enterobacter sp, Edwarsiella sp, Proteus sp, Citrobacter sp, Providencia sp, and Kluyvera sp. There was no correlation between antimicrobial resistance patterns of isolates and bacterial genera, but resistance patterns varied among water samples and between seasons. Resistance to multiple antimicrobials was common (61%). The percentage of bacteria resistant to at least one antimicrobial differed between the rainy (100%) and dry seasons (89%). Resistance to beta-lactams and chloramphenicol was the most frequent and resistance to amikacin, gentamicin and kanamycin was less frequent. The main water variables examined (abiotic factors pH and temperature; biotic factor chlorophyll a concentration) did not influence antimicrobial resistance. Significant impact on freshwater enterobacteria, as evidenced by antimicrobial-multiple resistance and by the presence of bla(TEM) gene, may point to the fact that it has an important role in horizontal spread of resistance.
TI  - Predictors of in-hospital mortality for bloodstream infections caused by Enterobacter species or Citrobacter freundii.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of in-hospital mortality among patients with bacteremia caused by Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, or Citrobacter freundii. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: 1300-bed tertiary academic medical center. PATIENTS: One hundred twenty-four patients who had bloodstream infections caused by E. cloacae (3), E. aerogenes (71), or C. freundii (50) between 1998 and 2004. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data from patients with bloodstream infections caused by Enterobacter sp or C. freundii were retrospectively segregated according to hospital survival (98 survivors, 26 nonsurvivors). Multiple patient characteristics and processes of care were evaluated to identify factors contributing to in-hospital mortality. Multiple logistic regression was performed based on univariate comparisons to determine independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. Among the 124 cases of bacteremia, the crude in-hospital mortality rate was 21% (26 cases). Univariate analysis revealed that survivors were more likely to receive an aminoglycoside as part of their empiric antimicrobial regimen (40% [39/98]) compared with nonsurvivors (19% [5/26], p=0.05). Other factors related to antimicrobial therapy including choice and number of agents used did not differ between survivors and nonsurvivors (p>0.05). Vasopressor use (31% [30/98] vs 62% [16/26]), care in an intensive care unit (19% [19/98] vs 54% [14/26]), and acute renal failure (13% [13/98] vs 31% [8/26]) occurred more frequently in nonsurvivors (p<0.05). Multiple logistic regression identified resistance to second- or third-generation cephalosporins (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 5.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.66-10.0, p=0.013), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance (adjusted OR 5.44, 95% CI 2.53-11.7, p=0.027), and mechanical ventilation (adjusted OR 12.2, 95% CI 5.99-24.5, p<0.001) as independent determinants of mortality. CONCLUSION: Among patients with Enterobacter sp or C. freundii bloodstream infections, those with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistant or second or third-generation cephalosporin-resistant strains or those who required mechanical ventilation had an increased risk of mortality.
TI  - Occurrence and diversity of integrons and beta-lactamase genes among ampicillin-resistant isolates from estuarine waters.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence and molecular diversity of beta-lactamase genes and integrons among Gram-negative ampicillin-resistant bacteria from Ria de Aveiro. Ampicillin-resistant isolates were selected and subjected to genotyping using REP-PCR. Representatives from each REP pattern were affiliated with the following taxa by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene: Aeromonas caviae, A. hydrophila, A. media, A. molluscorum, A. veronii, A. salmonicida, Aeromonas sp., Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas sp., Escherichia coli, Escherichia sp., Shigella sonnei, Shigella sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, R. planticola, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii and Enterobacter sp. Isolates affiliated with genera Escherichia or Shigella were identified as Escherichia coli using phenotypic-based tests. PCR was used to assess beta-lactamase encoding sequences (bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(CARB), bla(CTX-M), bla(IMP), bla(VIM), bla(CphA/IMIS), bla(OXA-A), bla(OXA-B), bla(OXA-C)), class 1 and class 2 integrases, and integron variable regions. Sequence analysis of PCR products was performed. beta-Lactamase genes were detected in 77.8% of the Enterobacteriaceae and in 10.5% of the Aeromonas. The most frequently detected gene was bla(TEM), followed by bla(SHV,)bla(OXA-B), bla(CphA/IMIS) and bla(CARB). Retrieved sequences shared high homology with previously described beta-lactamases. The intI1 gene was present in 29.6% of the Enterobacteriaceae and in 21% of the Aeromonas isolates. The intI2 gene was present in 4 isolates. A total of 13 cassettes included in 12 different cassette arrays were identified. The most frequently found resistance gene cassettes were aadA variants. Previous investigations based on cultivation-independent approaches revealed higher molecular diversity among beta-lactamase-encoding sequences in this estuary. This fact reinforces the hypothesis that cultivation-dependent approaches may underestimate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental samples and may introduce bias in the recovery of their molecular variants.
TI  - Confirmation of E. coli among other thermotolerant coliform bacteria in paper mill effluents, wood chips screening rejects and paper sludges.
AB  - Paper sludges are solid wastes material generated from the paper production, which have been characterized for their chemical contents. Some are rich in wood fiber and are a good carbon source, for example the primary and de-inking paper sludges. Others are made rich in nitrogen and phosphorus by pressing the activated sludge, resulting from the biological water treatments, with the primary sludge, yielding the combined paper sludge. Still, in the absence of sanitary effluents very few studies have addressed the characterization of their coliform microflora. Therefore, this study investigated the thermotolerant coliform population of one paper mill effluent and two paper mill sludges and wood chips screening rejects using chromogenic media. For the first series of analyses, the medium used was Colilert broth and positive tubes were selected to isolate bacteria in pure culture on MacConkey agar. In a second series of analyses, double selective media, based on ss-galactosidase and ss-glucuronidase activities, were used to isolate bacteria. First, the presence of thermotolerant coliforms was detected in low numbers in most water effluents, but showed that the entrance of the thermotolerant coliforms was early in the industrial process. Also, large numbers of thermotolerant coliforms, i.e., 7,000,000 MPN/g sludge (dry weight; d.w.), were found in combined sludges. From this first series of isolations, bacteria were purified on MacConkey medium and identified as Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter sp, E. sakazakii, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis, K. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Pantoea sp, Raoultella terrigena, R. planticola. Second, the presence of thermotolerant coliforms was measured at more than 3,700-6,000 MPN/g (d.w) sludge, whereas E. coli was detected from 730 to more than 3,300 MPN/g (d.w.) sludge. The presence of thermotolerant coliform bacteria and E. coli was sometimes detected from wood chips screening rejects in large quantities. Also, indigenous E. coli were able to multiply into the combined sludge, and inoculated E. coli isolates were often able to multiply in wood chips and combined sludge media. In this second series of isolations, API20E and Biolog identified most isolates as E. coli, but others remained unidentified. The sequences of the 16S rDNA confirmed that most isolates were likely E. coli, few Burkholderia spp, but 10% of the isolates remained unidentified. This study points out that the coliform bacteria are introduced by the wood chips in the water effluents, where they can survive throught the primary clarifier and regrow in combined sludges.
TI  - Mechanical transmission of pathogenic organisms: the role of cockroaches.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Cockroaches (Diploptera punctata) are basically tropical insects and will do their best to find a home that is both warm and moist. Their involvement in the transmission of tropical diseases is poorly investigated in Africa. METHODS: A study on the bacterial, fungal and parasitic profile of cockroaches trapped in and around houses in Ekpoma was carried out using standard microbiological techniques. RESULTS: Of a total of 234 cockroaches trapped from different sites (toilets, parlours, kitchens and bedrooms) in houses with pit latrines and water system, the bacterial, fungal and parasitic isolates were identical irrespective of the site, these included: E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serretia marcescens, S. aureus, S. feacalis, S. epidermidis, Aeromonas sp, Candida sp, Rhizopus sp, Aspergillus sp, Mucor sp, cysts of E. hystolitica, oocysts of C. parvum, C. cayetenensis and Isospora belli, cysts of Balantidium coli, ova of Ascaris lumbricoides, Anchylostoma deodunalae, Enterobius vermicularis, ova Trichuris trichura, larva of Strongyloides stercoralis. Cockroaches trapped in the toilets of houses with pit latrines had a mean bacterial and parasites count of 12.3 x 10(10) org/ml and 98 parasites/ml respectively, while those trapped in the houses with water system had a mean bacterial and parasitic count of 89.5 x 10(7) org/ml and 31 parasites/ml respectively. A bacterial count of 78.9 x 10(7) org/ml was recorded from cockroaches trapped from the kitchens of houses with pit latrines. On the other hand a mean bacterial and parasitic count of 23.7 x 10(6) org/ml and 19 parasites/ml were recorded from kitchens of houses with water system. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Cockroaches represent an important reservoir for infectious pathogens, therefore, control of cockroaches will substantially minimise the spread of infectious diseases in our environment.
TI  - Temporal association of entomopathogenic nematodes (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae  and Heterorhabditidae) and bacteria.
AB  - Galleria mellonella L. larvae were infected with three species (seven strains) of Steinernema spp. or three species (three strains) of Heterorhabditis spp. Infected larvae were incubated at 22, 27, and 32 degrees C. Larvae were dorsally dissected every 6h over a 48-h period. Hemolymph was collected and streaked on tryptic soy agar plates. Several non-symbiotic bacterial species were identified from infected insect cadavers: Enterobacter gergoviae, Vibrio spp., Pseudomonas fluorescens type C, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia proteomaculans. At 18-24 h incubation, the nematode-associated symbiont occurred almost exclusively. Bacterial associates generally appeared outside the 18-24 h window. Infective juveniles of Steinernema feltiae (Filipjev) (27), Steinernema riobrave Cabanillas, Poinar, and Raulston (Oscar), or Steinernema carpocapsae (Weiser) (Kapow) were left untreated, or surface sterilized using thimerosal, then pipetted under sterile conditions onto tryptic soy agar plates. Several additional species of associated bacteria were identified using this method compared with the less extensive range of species isolated from infected G. mellonella. There was no difference in bacterial species identified from non-sterile or surface sterilized nematodes, suggesting that the bacteria identified originated from either inside the nematode or between second and third stage juvenile cuticles. Infective juveniles of S. feltiae (Cowles), S. carpocapsae (Cowles), and H. bacteriophora Poinar (Cowles) were isolated from field samples. Nematodes were surface-sterilized using sodium hypochlorite, mixed with G. mellonella hemolymph, and pipetted onto Biolog BUG (with blood) agar. Only the relevant symbionts were isolated from the limited number of samples available. The nematodes were then cultured in the laboratory for 14 months (sub-cultured in G. mellonella 7-times). Other Enterobacteriaceae could then be isolated from the steinernematid nematodes including S. marcescens, Salmonella sp., and E. gergoviae, indicating the ability of the nematodes to associate with other bacteria in laboratory culture.
TI  - Molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  - The complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. However, studies on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. To clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16S rDNA sequences from the DNA isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16S rDNA libraries were constructed with the amplicons of PCR conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. Nine independent libraries were produced by the application of three sets of primers (set A, set B, and set C) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. Approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. The library clone with set A universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. Thus, set A primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. On the first day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, and Streptococcus mitis were present. The largest taxonomic group was L. lactis. On the third day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, S. mitis, and Streptococcus salivarius were present. On the sixth day of the life of the infant, Citrobacter, Clostridium difficile, Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter cloacae, and E. coli were present. The largest taxonomic group was E. coli. These results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after the third day.
TI  - Enteric fever-like illness caused by infection with citrobacter amalonaticus.
AB  - 'Enteric fever' is a potentially fatal, severe systemic disease, which is encountered worldwide. Traditionally, enteric fever refers to a bacteremic illness caused by members of certain Salmonella serotypes, notably: Salmonella typhi, a Gram-negative bacterium, and to a lesser extent, Salmonella paratyphi A, B and C. In addition, other non-salmonella organisms may produce a syndrome clinically indistinguishable from "enteric fever". Brucella sp., Campylobacter sp., Edwardsiella tarda, Enterobacter Cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia alcalifaciens, Pseudomonas sp., Serratia marcescens, Francisella sp. and Yersinia pp have been identified in enteric fever This is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first case of Citrobacter to be reported presenting as enteric fever in a normal host in Thailand.
TI  - Microbiological quality of sous and tamarind, traditional drinks consumed in Jordan.
AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the microbiological quality of sous (a drink prepared by extracting dried roots of Glycyrrhiza glabra) and tamarind (a drink prepared by infusing Tamarindus indica dried pulp), traditional drinks consumed in Jordan. Twenty-one samples of sous and 44 samples of tamarind were collected from the local market in Amman, Jordan. Water is the major component of the drinks. Sous drink is characterized by having an alkaline pH (range, 6.6 to 9.9; mean, 8.6), whereas tamarind drink has an acidic pH (range, 1.8 to 3.7; mean, 2.8). The drinks are not processed for safety before serving, and at some vendors drinks are not properly refrigerated. The mean counts for aerobic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria, and yeasts in sous drink samples were 5.9, 5.0, and 3.8 log CFU/ml, respectively; those in tamarind drink samples were 4.0, <1, and 5.8 log CFU/ml, respectively. The lactic acid bacteria isolated were Enterococcus raffinosus, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus durans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus buchneri. The yeast isolates in sous drink were from the genera Candida, Filobasidium, Hanseniaspora, Lodderomyces, Pichia, and Williopsis, and those in tamarind drink were from Arthroascus, Brettanomyces, Candida, Debaromyces, Filobasidiella, Hanseniaspora, Klavispora, Lodderomyces, Pichia, Saccharomycodes, Trichosporon, and Zygosaccharomyces. Enterobacteriaceae were detected in two sous samples and were identified as Enterobacter sakazakii and Erwinia sp., and in two tamarind samples and were identified as Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Salmonella was detected in one sous and one tamarind sample. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was detected in only one sous sample. These findings highlight the importance of application of hygienic practices throughout preparation and vending of drinks, starting with raw ingredients and continuing through preparation, storage, display, and serving.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance in isolates obtained in german intensive care units.
AB  - Screening of 703 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, obtained from 34 German intensive care units (ICUs), revealed qnr-positive, integron-containing isolates of Enterobacter sp. and Citrobacter freundii from four patients in 2 German ICUs. This is one of the first reports of qnr-positive strains obtained from patients in Europe.
TI  - Extended spectrum beta-lactamase mediated resistance in urinary tract isolates of family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) hydrolyse expanded spectrum cephalosporins like ceftazidime, cefotaxime and monobactam aztreonam. ESBL producing bacteria may not be detectable in the routine disk diffusion susceptibility tests leading to inappropriate use of antibiotics and treatment failures. As information on ESBL producers causing urinary tract infection (UTI) is not available from our country, the occurrence of ESBL producing strains causing UTI was studied as also the differences between the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of ESBL and non-ESBL producers. METHODS: Urinary isolates (233) were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by Stoke's method and ESBL production by double disk diffusion method (ceftazidime and clavulanic acid). The clinical and demographic profile of the patients was noted. RESULTS: Sixty two of the 233 isolates tested (26.6%) were ESBL producers. Approximately 38.5 per cent of Klebsiellae, 24.7 per cent of Escherichia coli, 24 per cent of Enterobacter aerogenes, 33.3 per cent of Proteus sp. and the only Citrobacter strain produced ESBL. Recent surgery was found to be a significant (P < 0.01) risk factor for acquisition of ESBLs. Approximately 30 per cent of the ESBL producers appeared falsely sensitive or moderately sensitive to cefotaxime/ceftazidime in routine susceptibility testing. There was no difference between the ESBL producers and non-producers in the susceptibility to non-beta lactam agents except for gentamicin. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: A high percentage of urinary tract isolates produced ESBL. Since they are likely to be missed in routine disk diffusion susceptibility tests, all microbiology laboratories should look for ESBL production routinely to avoid treatment failures.
TI  - BUT-1: a new member in the chromosomal inducible class C beta-lactamases family from a clinical isolate of Buttiauxella sp.
AB  - An atypical Enterobacteriaceae strain with a beta-lactam susceptibility pattern of inducible cephalosporinase was isolated in Tenon Hospital (Paris, France) from a patient's skull wound infection. Identifications by the API-50CHE biochemical system and 16S rRNA gene sequencing concluded that it was a member of the Buttiauxella genus. The bla gene was cloned and sequenced. The deduced translated product was a 383-amino acid protein (BUT-1) with 75-78% identity with the chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamases of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli. The isoelectric point of 9.0 and the kinetic constants of BUT-1 were comparable with results described for other Ambler class C enzymes. bla(BUT-1) and the associated ampR transcriptional regulator gene were divergently transcribed from a common intercistronic region, a genetic organization already described for other inducible class C beta-lactamases. The deduced amino acid sequence of AmpR shared 85% and 81% identity with AmpR from E. cloacae and C. freundii respectively.
TI  - [Total and fecal coliforms, some enterobacteria staphylococcus sp. and moulds in  salads for hot dogs sold in Maracay, Venezuela].
AB  - Fast food sold on the streets are good vehicle to transmit gastrointestinal diseases to consumers because they are highly manipulated. The vegetables are a good media for pathogens growth. Raw vegetables salads for hot dog sold in Maracay were studied. Total and fecal Coliforms and Staphylococcus sp. were quantified by the Most Probable Number Technique, Coliforms and Staphylococcus isolated were partially identified. Also the mould population was quantified and identified. Microbial growth was correlated with pH and acidity measurements. MPN/g of Total Coliforms was 1.44 x 10(5) and 4.57 x 10(4) for fecal Coliforms. E. coli was no detected. 87 isolated from the Coliforms were partially identified as Citrobacter freundii variety 1 (45.09% of the isolated), C. freundii variety II (21.57%), Enterobacter aerogenes variety I (17.65%) and E. aerogenes variety II (15.69%); Staphylococcus sp. 3.93 x 10(6) MPN/g and all of its isolated (52) were coagulase negative. The mould population was 4.5 x 10(4) ufc/g, Penicillium sp., Aspergillus, sp., Fusarium sp. were partially identified. The salads presented a pH of 5.92 and an acidity of 0.78 ml of NaOH.
TI  - Potential microbiological hazards in the production of refined paper products for food applications.
AB  - This study sought to investigate the significance of raw materials (starch-based  glues, raw material papers) at different microbiologically critical stages in the manufacturing process of refined paper products. The study examined the occurrence of microorganisms in the process and in end-product samples. Microbiological surveys verified that the production and use of pasteurized starch-based glue was the most important factor threatening the process hygiene and product safety. Subsequently, the production and use of starch-based glue was changed, and a follow-up programme targeting the microbiological quality of glue was developed as part of a hygiene and safety management system. A total of 33 spore-forming bacterial and 15 enterobacterial isolates were ribotyped, and 22 and 10 different ribogroups (ribotypes), respectively, were generated. These isolates from starch-based glue, raw material paper and end products were atypical and, thus, in many cases physiological, chemotaxonomic (FAME) and molecular (partial 16S rDNA) results did not correspond. The most common spore-forming bacteria (55% of the isolates) were Paenibacillus sp. and within this genus several new species were also proposed. The most common enterobacteria (87%) were Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii belonging to bacteria in hazard group 2, or species closely related to them. It was demonstrated that the same spore-forming bacteria (ribotypes) were present in both the glue samples and the end products (45% of isolates). All RiboPrint patterns were saved at the VTT identification library for future use.
TI  - Characterization of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in rendered animal products.
AB  - Antibiotics are used in food animal production to treat diseases and also to improve performance. Antibiotics are not used on all farms, and antibiotic resistance is occasionally found on farms that do not use antibiotics. Rendered animal protein products are often included in poultry feeds and could potentially serve as a source of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. One hundred sixty-five rendered animal protein products from cattle, poultry, and fish were aseptically collected from poultry feed mills. Fifty-five percent of the poultry meal samples had detectable levels of gram-negative bacteria ranging from 40 to 10,440 colony-forming units/g of sample. Poultry meal and meat and bone meal had the greatest number of samples with bacteria resistant to five or more antibiotics. A high percentage of feed samples (85%) contained bacteria resistant to amoxicillin, ampicillin, clavulanic acid, or cephalothin, whereas few samples contained bacteria resistant to ciprofloxacin, kanamycin, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter cloacae were the most commonly isolated antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Isolation for Salmonella was also performed, with 14% of the meat and bone meal samples containing Salmonella sp. Only one of the meat and bone meal isolates, Salmonella livingstone, was resistant to five or more antibiotics. Many of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria contained integrons, genetic elements that mediate multiple drug resistance.
TI  - Evaluation of culture media for enrichment and isolation of Shigella sonnei and S. flexneri.
AB  - The performance of Gram-negative (GN) broth with (10 microg/ml) and without novobiocin, Shigella broth (SB) with 0.5 and 3.0 microg/ml novobiocin, all incubated at 37 degrees C (SB with 3.0 microg/ml novobiocin also at 42 degrees C) and buffered brilliant green bile glucose (EE) broth with 1.0 microg/ml novobiocin incubated at 37 and 42 degrees C were evaluated for resuscitation and growth of Shigella sonnei and S. flexneri (eight strains; unstressed, chill-stressed and acid-stressed) and non-shigellae (11 strains). GN broth with or without novobiocin supported significantly less growth of Shigella sp. No significant differences in growth of shigellae were obtained between the other culture media. Performance depended more on the Shigella strain used. None of the tested media were significantly superior for suppressing the competitive flora. Electivity and selectivity of MacConkey agar (MAC), tergitol-7 agar (T7), desoxycholate citrate agar (DCA), xylose lysine desoxycholate agar (XLD), Salmonella Shigella agar and Hektoen enteric agar (HEA) were determined by ecometric testing. HEA confirmed to be a high selective medium for both non-shigellae and stressed Shigella sp. Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp., Citrobacter sp.. Salmonella sp. and the Escherichia strains can mask the presence of shigellae. In vitro competition experiments and experiments with artificially contaminated foods showed higher resistance of S. sonnei than S. flexneri towards the stress imposed by the food matrix and its indigenous flora. Reliable detection, however, of shigellae in foods with the current enrichment and isolation media was not achieved.
TI  - Clinical and microbiologic findings in dogs with bronchoscopically diagnosed tracheal collapse: 37 cases (1990-1995).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of bacteria in bronchoscopically diagnosed tracheal collapse in dogs by evaluating qualitative results of bacteriologic cultures. DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: 37 dogs with tracheal collapse. PROCEDURE: Clinical records for dogs with tracheal collapse confirmed with bronchoscopy were reviewed. A protected catheter brush was used to obtain samples for bacteriologic culture from the large airways. RESULTS: Results of bacterial culture were negative for 5 of 29 dogs. For 24 dogs, 1 (n = 10), 2 (6), or > or = 3 (8) species of bacteria were isolated. Pseudomonas spp were isolated most frequently (17/29), and a single Pseudomonas sp grew in 7 samples. Other bacteria included Enterobacter spp (4/29), Citrobacter spp (3/29), and Moraxella spp, Klebsiella spp, Bordetella spp, or Acinetobacter spp (2/29 dogs each). Anaerobic and aerobic cultures yielded positive results in samples from 2 dogs. Cytologic results were available for 13 dogs with positive results of bacteriologic culture; epithelial cells were reported most commonly. Five samples had a small number of neutrophils; bacteria were identified cytologically in 2 of 5 samples that contained neutrophils. Bacteria were also seen in 2 samples that lacked inflammatory cells. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Bacteria are commonly isolated from samples obtained via airway brushing in dogs with tracheal collapse; however, in the absence of cytologic confirmation of inflammation or infection, an association between bacteria and clinical signs of tracheal collapse cannot be established.
TI  - Microbial decolourisation of pulp and paper mill effluent in presence of nitrogen and phosphorus by activated sludge process.
AB  - The effect of pH, nutrient and aeration was studied on the removal of colour and  reduction of BOD, COD and heavy metals with addition of readily available source of nitrogen and phosphorus in concentration of 1.0 g/L. Recalcitrant compound was effectively degraded by active microbial consortia. The isolated bacteria were identified as Pseudomonas putida (S1), Citrobacter sp. (S4) and Enterobacter sp. (S5). These organisms not only decolourised effluent upto 97% but reduced BOD, COD, phenolics and sulfide upto 96.63, 96.80, 96.92 and 96.67% respectively within 24 hrs of aeration and the heavy metals were removed upto 82-99.80%. The TSS and TDS were sharply reduced due to degradation. The absorption maxima was also decreased to 90%. However, in control without the microbial consortium no noticeable change was produced.
TI  - Cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of CHROMagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  - The algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on CHROMagar Orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (IND), lysine decarboxylase (LDC), and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, IND positive (IND(+)), Escherichia coli; metallic blue, IND(+), LDC(+), and ODC negative (ODC(-)), Klebsiella oxytoca; IND(+), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Citrobacter diversus; IND(+) or IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(-), Citrobacter freundii; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(+), Enterobacter aerogenes; IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Enterobacter cloacae; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(-), Klebsiella pneumoniae; diffuse brown and IND(+), Morganella morganii; IND(-), Proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, Serratia marcescens; bluish green and IND(+), Proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, Salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. The accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. During an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. A total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on CHROMagar Orientation medium. For 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. The cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. The results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. In addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Detection and distribution of insertion sequence 1 (IS1)-containing bacteria in the freshwater environment(1).
AB  - The distribution of insertion sequence 1 (IS1)-containing bacteria was investigated in Windermere (Cumbria, UK), a freshwater body impacted by treated sewage discharge and run-off from the surrounding catchment. Culturable IS1-containing bacteria were recovered from the water column at three depths in Windermere North Basin (WNB) and South Basin (WSB), and from sediment at both sites (at the sediment surface in WSB and to a depth of 12-13 cm in WNB). Polymerase chain reaction amplification of IS1 and the Escherichia coli/Shigella sp. specific gene uidA, from community DNA from shallow sediments, extended the detection limit beyond that of culture at both sites. This detection was extended further into deep sediment extracted from WNB as IS1 and uidA were detected in sub-samples to a depth of 4.7 and 2.3 m, respectively. Analysis of a representative subset of 90 IS1-carrying isolates recovered from water and sediment at both sites demonstrated 21 heterogeneous IS1 profiles with estimated copy numbers ranging from 1 to 16. Identification of the host bacteria showed that the element was confined mainly to Enterobacter spp. However, this study showed IS1 to be present in Citrobacter freundii for the first time. Plasmids were carried by 75.3% of enterobacterial isolates and four plasmids (2.6%) carried IS1. DNA sequence analysis of five IS1 clones demonstrated that IS1 isoforms from this study were similar (>89% nucleotide identity) to known IS1 isoforms. Two isoforms of IS1 from a single Enterobacter cloacae isolate differed by 6.7% at the nucleotide level suggesting that they had been acquired independently.
TI  - [The resistance of recent clinical isolates against isepamycin, other aminoglycosides and injectable beta-lactams].
AB  - Clinical isolates collected from clinical facilities across Japan in 1998 were tested against five aminoglycosides and three beta-lactams. The resistance of 50 strains each of methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus sp. (P. mirabilis 25 strains and P. vulgaris 25 strains) to the aminoglycosides isepamicin (ISP), amikacin (AMK), gentamicin, tobramycin and dibekacin, and to the beta-lactams imipenem, ceftazidime and piperacillin (all three known to be effective against P. aeruginosa) were investigated using a micro liquid dilution method with the following results: 1. ISP was effective against all strains except for 14% of MRSA, 2% of Proteus sp., and 4% of P. aeruginosa. 2. Six strains of MRSA were resistant to all eight drugs; however, in these cases ISP exhibited a relatively low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) compared to the other compounds. 3. Four strains of MRSA were resistant to all drugs except ISP. MRSA was the only isolate to demonstrate a resistance to seven or more drugs. 4. Twenty-one strains of MRSA and 1 strain of P. aeruginosa were resistant to six drugs; however, all of these were susceptible to both ISP and AMK. 5. Against all strains tested, ISP generally exhibited a lower MIC compared to AMK. These results suggest that, even ten years after its entering the market, ISP is still an aminoglycoside having a high anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of clinical isolates.
TI  - Sub-MIC ciprofloxacin effect on fimbrial production by uropathogenic Escherichia  coli strains.
AB  - The urine from 210 patients with acute urinary tract infection (UTI) was examined to study the in vitro effect of ciprofloxacin on fimbriae production by uropathogenic Escherichia coli isolates. Forty-nine bacterial samples of density 10(5) CFU/ml were not considered. From the resulting 161 samples, E. coli was the major strain found, present in 54 samples. Other microoganisms found were: Enterococcus sp. (34 samples), Staphylococcus epidermis (22), yeasts (11), Proteus sp. (11), Pseudomonas sp. (11), Klebsiella sp. (8), Enterobacter sp. (6), Citrobacter sp. (3), and Acinetobacter sp. (1). The uropathogenic E. coli strains found were P-fimbriated, as demonstrated by hemoagglutination activity against human erythrocytes with and without mannose, SDS-PAGE of fimbrial proteins and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). All E. coli strains found were exposed in vitro to sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin (1/8 MIC). Our results showed that: 1) P-fimbriated E. coli is the most prevalent microorganism in acute UTI (34%); 2) exposure to sub-MICs of ciprofloxacin inhibits fimbrial production in 79% of E. coli strains; 3) the pattern of SDS-PAGE fimbrial proteins is modified after exposure; in particular, the most affected synthesis involves the protein at 18 kD known as P-fimbriae.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical break points: evaluation of the usefulness of cefozopran based on MIC].
AB  - Drug sensitivity of clinically isolated bacteria to cefozopran (CZOP), which is a new cephem antibiotic, was investigated, and the usefulness of the drug was evaluated from the viewpoint of bacteriological and clinical (pneumonia) break points. The following results were obtained. 1. According to bacteriological break points, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus spp. showed low sensitivity to cefozopran (CZOP). However, the sensitivity of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), E. coli, and Klebsiella spp., which are often isolated as pathogens of common infections, was 100%, that of Enterobacter spp., Serratia sp., and Citrobacter sp. was 90% or higher, and that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 80% or higher; the values were comparable to or better than those for ceftazidime (CAZ). These results suggest a expanded antibacterial spectrum and enhanced antibacterial potency of CZOP. 2. The estimated response rate of pneumonia to CZOP was 87.5% in outpatients and 51.9% in inpatients. Therefore, CZOP is considered to be one of the first choices especially in outpatient empiric therapy.
TI  - The bacteriology of neonatal septicaemia in Ile-Ife, Nigeria.
AB  - The incidence of septicaemia among neonates categorized as being at high risk was 55 per cent in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Gram-positive organisms, specifically Staphylococcus aureus, were predominant (33.8 per cent) among bacteria cultured from proven cases of septicaemia. Other coagulase-negative staphylococci also contributed 21 per cent, with Staphylococcus epidermidis occurring in 5 per cent of the isolates. Listeria monocytogenes was cultured from 8.4 per cent of septic neonates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured from 3 per cent, Klebsiella pneumoniae from 14 per cent, and Escherichia coli from 7 per cent. Other Gram-negative bacilli cultured were Enterobacter aerogenes (5 per cent), Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella sp., and Proteus sp. (2 per cent each). The bacterial isolates were relatively resistant to antibiotics traditionally employed to treat cases of septicaemia. The study shows a high prevalence of neonatal bacterial sepsis at the centre and the emerging role of Listeria monocytogenes in the aetiology of neonatal sepsis. It highlights the preponderance of multiple antibiotic resistant organisms among these neonates early in life which is of epidemiological importance in the control of the infectious agents.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of G1: a novel antimicrobial compound.
AB  - G1 (1-[5-bromofur-2-il]-2-bromo-2-nitroethene) is a novel antimicrobial compound  developed in Cuba with reported broadspectrum activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, yeasts and fungi. A compound of this nature may have considerable therapeutic potential. We tested the in vitro activity of this novel compound against 3595 organisms using microbroth dilution. The following are MIC50, MIC90 and range respectively for some of the microorganisms tested: E. coli 16, 16, 4 32; Klebsiella sp. 16, 16, 8 32; Citrobacter sp. 16, 16, 8 16; Enterobacter sp. 16, 16, 8-16; Proteus sp. 16, 16, 8-16; Coagulase-negative staphylococci 16, 32, 4-32; Enterococcus sp. 16, 32, 2-32; Staphylococcus aureus 8, 16, 4-16; Streptococcus agalactiae 4, 8, 4 8; Streptococcus pyogenes 4, 8, 0.25-16; Candida albicans 2, 2, 1-4; Candida tropicalis 4, 4, 2-4; Candida sp. 2,4, 1-4. MIC values appear lower for Gram-positive microorganisms and yeasts. G1 appears to be a novel antimicrobial agent with broad spectrum activity against bacterial and fungal pathogens. Defining the activity of this compound against multi-resistant bacteria is a priority.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of an azoreductase gene from Clostridium perfringens and comparison with azoreductase genes from other bacteria.
AB  - A genomic library of Clostridium perfringens ATCC 3626 was constructed in phage lambda gt11 and screened with an antibody against the C. perfringens azoreductase, which catalyzes the reduction of azo dyes to aromatic amines. A positive recombinant phage, containing a 3.8 kb DNA fragment insert was selected and purified. Lytic and lysogenic Escherichia coli cultures infected with the recombinant phage had higher azoreductase activity than cultures infected only with the vector lambda gt11. The 3.8 kb DNA fragment was amplified by PCR and found to hybridize with one band from C. perfringens DNA digested with EcoR1, indicating the presence of a single copy of the azoreductase gene. The fragment also hybridized with DNA from other azoreductase-producing Clostridium species, a Eubacterium sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter amalonaticus and E. coli, but not with DNA from some other species of anaerobic bacteria capable of reducing azo dyes. The data indicate that the sequence of the azoreducatse gene of C. perfringens is conserved in some anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, but not in others, and that different types of azoreductase genes must be found in other anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - [In vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpirome compared to other broad-spectrum beta-lactam drugs against 804 clinical isolates from 9 Brazilian hospitals].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in vitro activity of the fourth-generation cephalosporin cefpirome in comparison to that of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and imipenem in a multicenter study involving nine hospitals from six cities (four States). MATERIAL AND METHOD: A total of 804 isolates from patients hospitalized in either intensive care units or Oncology/Hematology units was evaluated. The isolates were collected between June and November of 1995, i.e. before cefpirome became commercially available in Brazil, and susceptibility tested by broth microdilution following the NCCLS procedures. All isolates resistant to cefpirome were retested by E-test. RESULTS: Against Enterobacteriaceae (n = 344), cefpirome demonstrated an activity 2 to 32-fold higher than that of the third-generation cephalosporins (TGCs) and similar to that of imipenem. The percentages of Enterobacteriaceae susceptible were: 88%, 69% and 96% for cefpirome, TGCs and imipenem, respectively. The cefpirome spectrum was greater or equal than that of imipenem against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Morganella morganii and Serratia marcescens. Against Acinetobacter sp. (n = 77), cefpirome was slightly more active than ceftazidime; however, the percentages of isolates resistant to these compounds were high (84% and 88%, respectively). The activities of cefpirome, ceftazidime and imipenem were very similar against P. aeruginosa isolates (n = 128), with MIC50(mg/ml)/percent susceptible of 8/59%, 8/62% and 4/62% respectively. Against aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the cefpirome activity was 4 to 16-fold higher than that of TGCs but 2 to 8-fold lower than that of imipenem. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that, in Brazil, cefpirome has a spectrum of activity which is higher than that of the TGCs against aerobic gram-negative (Enterobacteriaceae and non-Enterobacteriaceae) and gram-positive bacteria and similar to that of imipenem against some Enterobacteriaceae species and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity to isolated bacteria in pediatric urinary tract infections].
AB  - Of the childhood urinary tract infections, more than 50% are caused by Escherichia coli (E Coli), followed by Proteus mirabilis (P mirabilis), Klebsiella sp, other enterobacteria, enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci. Of E coli isolates, 50 to 60% are resistant to ampicillin (ampi-R), 10% being susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (AMC). For P mirabilis, ampi-R isolates are less frequent and more often susceptible to AMC. Klebsiella sp is resistant to ampicillin, 75% of isolates being susceptible to AMC. In these three species, the susceptibility of isolates to third generation cephalosporins, aminogly-cosides, and ciprofloxacin is still high (> 90%), but 15 to 35% are resistant to cotrimoxazole. In the other enterobacteria (Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, P vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens) the resistance to cefalotin (hence to ampicillin and AMC) is permanent, with an exception: the susceptibility of P vulgaris to AMC. Enterococci are mostly susceptible to ampicillin, and P aeruginosa to ceftazidime, but in both species, the percentage of resistant strains in hospitalised patients is greater than in outpatients. For Staphylococcus aureus, the community-acquired isolates are susceptible to oxacillin and other anti-staphylococcal agents. All the coagulase negative staphylococci isolates are susceptible to vancomycin, but 70% of those from hospitalised patients are resistant to oxacillin, aminoglycosides and cotrimoxazole.
TI  - Coliforms and Salmonella in seawater near to domestic sewage sources in Fortaleza (Ceara, Brazil).
AB  - The bacteriological conditions of the coastal region of Fortaleza (Ceara, Brasil), including the coastal zones of the Ceara and Coco rivers, were examined. The study was conducted during June, September and December 1993, and March 1994. The region was divided into two areas: (i) Direct Influence Area (DIA), consisting of 20 sampling stations located near to discharge zones of the submarine pipeline system, where collections were carried out at the surface, and (ii) Indirect Influence Area (IIA), located near to the coastal zone, including Barra do Ceara, Kartodromo, Volta de Jurema, Mucuripe, Farol and Caca e Pesca beaches, totalling 26 sampling stations. The most probable number (MPN) of both total and fecal coliforms in DIA was positive only in station number 6, near to the sewage discharge exit. The following bacteria were identified: Citrobacter sp., Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli. Kartodromo beach was contaminated throughout the sampling period. Results of total fecal MPN was essentially lower than 3.0 x 10(2) coliforms/100 ml at Caca e Pesca beach. In December, at both DIA and IIA, Salmonella was identified in several samples. In DIA, the spatial distribution for Salmonella suggests that there should be a coastal sea current from east to west along the coastline. In IIA, Salmonella was identified at Kartodromo and Farol beaches throughout the sampling period.
TI  - Bacterial isolates from indigenous weaning foods in rural Ethiopian setting, Jimma Zone, south west Ethiopia.
AB  - A community based bacteriological study of weaning foods was conducted from November 1994 to August 1995 in six peasant associations, Jimma Zone. The households in the study community were found to be in poor sanitary conditions with cattle and pets living in the same room with humans, and the community gets water from unprotected sources. The predominant weaning foods in the study community were cereals. These and other foods given to weaning age children were found to be grossly contaminated, aerobic mesophilic bacterial counts being 10(5) cfu/ml of sample. The most frequent bacterial isolates were Enterobacter sp, Gram positive cocci including Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp., and Escherichia coli in that order. Various factors such as unsafe water, unhygienic handling of food, storage of food at ambient temperature for a long time, poor domestic and personal hygiene may have contributed for the gross contamination of weaning foods in the study community. This calls for educating the community on the relationship between contamination of weaning foods and diarrhoeal diseases, and promoting measures such as reheating of weaning foods which have been kept at ambient temperature for a long time before serving infants and children.
TI  - [The effect of cefepime on ceftazidime, cefotaxime and imipenem resistant strains of Acinetobacter, Xanthomonas, Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium, Sphingobacterium and on producers of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) with resistance transfer].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The new cephalosporins with heterocyclic positively charged substituent at position C3 belong to the 4th generation cephalosporins. It is not evident, whereas these antibiotics are effective against cefotaxime-ceftazidime-resistant bacteria. We investigated the efficiency of the cefepime (Maxipime, BMS) against Acinetobacter sp., X. maltophilia, Pseudomonas sp., Flavobacterium sp., Sphingobacterium sp. and against strains with production of ESBL (Extended Spectrum beta-Lactamases) (Enterobacter sp., Citrobacter sp., Klebsiella sp.). METHODS AND RESULTS: We determined the susceptibility of the 54 strains resistant to 50 mg/l and more of ceftazidime. The majority of the strains (35) are susceptible to cefepime and MIC is the range 1.65-3.15 mg/l of cefepime. 17 strains have MIC = 6.25 mg/l. Two strains (one strain P. aeruginosa a one strain K. pneumoniae) were resistant to cefepime and MIC = 12.5 mg/l. The activity of beta-lactamases was determined by quantitative macroiodometric method in one strain of P. cepacia and two strains of Sphingobacterium multivorum. They hydrolyse actively imipenem (they produce metallo-beta-lactamase) and ceftazidime (they are highly resistant to this antibiotic), but cefepime is more slowly hydrolysed than ceftazidime. CONCLUSIONS: At the present time cefepime is effective against ceftazidime-resistant strains in so-called "problematic" species of bacteria. However, it is important to protect its efficiency in the future, this requires its rational use.
TI  - [Treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in the elderly].
AB  - Sixty outpatients at the age of 65 to 75 years with exacerbated chronic bronchitis were treated with antibiotics: amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (20 patients), cefaclor (20 patients) and ciprofloxacin (20 patients). The treatment course in all the cases was 5 days. Bacteriological tests of the sputum specimens and estimation of the isolate antibiotic susceptibility by the disk diffusion method were applied to all the patients before and after the treatment. 73 per cent of the patients had mixed infection. The microflora mainly included various species of streptococci highly susceptible to the drugs (54 per cent) as well as highly susceptible strains of pneumococci and hemophilic bacilli (33 and 17 per cent respectively). Atypical microflora was detected in 10 per cent of the cases. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were isolated in 2 cases. Acinetobacter sp. slightly susceptible only to ciprofloxacin was isolated in 1 case. Citrobacter sp. slightly susceptible to cefaclor and moderately susceptible to ciprofloxacin was detected in 1 case. Enterobacter sp. moderately susceptible only to ciprofloxacin was isolated in 1 case. A positive factor was moderate susceptibility of Proteus mirabilis to all the three drugs. In 24 patients (the average age of 54.7 years) the pharmacokinetics of ofloxacin administered under 2 different regimens was studied. The drug was used in a single dose of 400 mg once a day (group 1) or in a dose of 200 mg twice a day (group II) followed by estimation of the drug concentration in the blood and sputum. The pathogen eradication was stated in 61.5 and 72.7 per cent of the patients in groups I and II, respectively. By the results of the treatment with the use of the above mentioned antibiotics in the elderly patients fluoroquinolones should be considered preferable from the clinical and pharmacoeconomic viewpoints.
TI  - The detection of verocytotoxins in bacterial cultures from human diarrhoeal samples with monoclonal antibody-based ELISAs.
AB  - Bacterial cultures from 1801 human diarrhoeal faecal specimens were examined for  verocytotoxins I and II by monoclonal antibody-based sandwich ELISAs. Of the 68 ELISA-positive cultures selected from initial screening, 32 were positive by ELISA on repeat or from freshly grown cultures. ELISA-positive pure cultures were obtained from 13 of these, of which seven were confirmed as verocytotoxin positive by cytotoxicity assay. These seven strains were typed as O26 (5) and O146 (2). The six false positive results were from isolates of Enterobacter sp. (1), Citrobacter Freundii (1) and Escherichia coli (4), one each of types O1, O18ac and O98 and an untypable strain. Despite the occurrence of false positive reactions, sandwich ELISA was a useful method for the rapid screening of samples, and detected verocytotoxin-positive E. coli strains, other than O157, from patients with clinical conditions in which they could be implicated.
TI  - [Variation in transfer resistance to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam in strains of Acinetobacter sp., Enterobacter sp. and Citrobacter sp. isolated from the same university hospitals].
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the last decade were in SR documented new problems in resistance to the newer antibiotics that with regard to their structure and antibacterial properties resisted to the known mechanism of bacterial resistance. The emergence of multiple drug resistance to the new betalactams is connected both with frequent application of these drugs in the hospitals and transfer of R plasmids. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied composition and transferability of resistance to newer betalactam antibiotics in strains of Acinetobacter sp., Enterobacter sp, and Citrobacter sp. isolated during one month in patients from two teaching University Hospitals. All strains studied were resistant to cefotaxime (CTX), ceftazidime (CAZ) and aztreonam (ATM) but Acinetobacter strains, although resistant also to CAZ and ATM transferred the resistance to CTX only. Thus, resistance to CAZ and ATM has a chromosomal origin in these strains. A strain of Citrobacter sp., resistant to CTX, CAZ and ATM, produced a ESBL betalactamase detectable in a double-disk diffusion method (Fig. 1). An Enterobacter cloacae strain transfers directly the resistance to all new betalactams indicated. Their hydrolysis by these strains points to their production of new types of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases ESBL). CONCLUSIONS: We strongly recommend to be strictly rational in the use of new betalactams of CTX, CZA or ATM type because it is suspected that, especially in so-called empirical prophylaxis or treatment, they exert a strong selective pressure toward the prevalence of mutants with transferable ESBL-producing nosocomial bacteria resistant to these drugs.
TI  - [Enterobacteria in areas of water along the Crimean coast].
AB  - Characteristic of coliform bacteria in the coastal sea ecosystems is given. A decrease of Escherichia coli indicator value was ascertained and presence of Klebsiella sp. and Citrobacter freundii was revealed, in the sea areas with high level of anthropogenic load. Wide distribution of bacteria of Enterobacter agglomerans kind was determined in the sea substrates and their stability to unfavourable influences was shown.
TI  - [Use of aztreonam for the purpose of preventing postoperative purulent complications].
AB  - The efficacy of the prophylactic use of azthreonam, a monocyclic beta lactam antibiotic, was studied in 20 patients operated for liver diseases. The drug was administered intramuscularly in a dose of 1 g 30 minutes prior to the operation. During the postoperative period the drug was administered in a dose of 1 g 4-5 times a day for 4 to 5 days. The clinical effect in all the patients was good: no elevation of the body temperature above 37.5 degrees C and no suppuration of the operation wound. Adverse reaction to the treatment were not observed. 135 clinical isolates were tested for the susceptibility to azthreonam. The most susceptible gram-negative bacteria were the following: E coli (100 per cent), P. mirabilis (100 per cent), M. morganii (100 per cent), P. rettgeri (100 per cent) and Citrobacter sp. (84 per cent). P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, P. vulgaris and Enterobacter were less susceptible (64, 50, 50 and 47.5 per cent respectively). All the S. aureus isolates were resistant.
TI  - A comparative study of the BBL crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux API20E and API20NE identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  - The BBL Crystal Enteric/Nonfermenter (Crystal, Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems) is a new multi-test identification system for Gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. One hundred and three selected Gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate API20E or API20NE (BioMerieux) reading after overnight incubation. The isolates included in the study, and the number tested, were as follows: Acinetobacter sp, 8; Aeromonas hydrophila, 1; Citrobacter diversus, 1; Citrobacter freundii, 1; Escherichia coli, 13; Enterobacter aerogenes, 10; Enterobacter agglomerans, 2; Enterobacter cloacae, 6; Klebsiella oxytoca, 6; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; Morganella morganii, 2; Proteus mirabilis, 6; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; Salmonella sp, 2; Salmonella typhi, 1; Serratia marcescens, 1; Shigella sonnei, 2; Shigella sp, 2; Vibrio metschnikovii, 1; Xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, Yersinia enterocolitica, 2. The API20E and API20NE systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the Crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. Twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the API systems compared to 3 with the Crystal. Crystal is more convenient than API for routine clinical use because it requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.
TI  - The danger of infections of the hospitalized patients with the microorganisms present in preparations and in the hospital environment.
AB  - Two strains-S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, resistant to antibiotics, were isolated from previously non-opened preparations made by the hospital pharmacy and industrially produced. After application in the surgery ward, two Enterobacter agglomerans strains, resistant to antibiotics were detected in oral mixtures. The resistant bacteria, B. cereus and 4 strains of Ps. aeruginosa, were also found in the purified water. In hospital environment 9 strains of staphylococci, resistant to the tested antibiotics were found. Only one of them was S. aureus (detected on the wall), the others being coagulase-negative staphylococci. Most of them were isolated from the floor, but also from the wall, table and from the air in surgical and ophthalmological wards and in the hospital pharmacy. The most dangerous were three Gram-negative strains resistant to all tested antibiotics. They were isolated from the floor (Enterobacter cloacae), from the wall (Proteus mirabilis) and from the container with oral mixture in infant ward (Ps. malthophilia). Many strains resistant to many antibiotics were detected on the floor of surgical, nephrological and infantile wards as well as from the pharmacies: Enterobacter cloacae (7 strains), Citrobacter freundi, Ps. aeruginosa, Ps. cepacia (2 strains), Ps. maltophilia (2 strains) and Moraxella. Many resistant strains were also present on the walls (E. coli, Ps. mirabilis, Ps. cepacia, Alcaligens, Acinetobacter). The resistant strains were rarely observed on the table, medical equipment and on personnel hands. Klebsiella oxytoca and Ps. paucimobilis were found on the table, Ps. maltophilia on the dropper and on the rim of the container with oral mixture. Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas sp. were isolated from the medicine glass, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas sp. from the personnel hands in the pharmacies.
TI  - Resistance to antibiotics in gram-negative rods from clinical material of hospital and community origin.
AB  - The authors examined the resistance to 13 antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents by the diluting micromethod and the routine disk method in the group of 5375 gram-negative strains of 7 genera which prevailed in clinical material of an hospital (FN Olomouc) and in material of community (OHS Olomouc) provenance during the years 1992 and 1993. In the majority of cases, the resistance was more frequent in the strains isolated from the hospital material. The most remarkable differences were found in A cinetobacter sp. (9-76%), Enterobacter sp. (10-60%) and Citrobacter sp. (18-58%). In other examined species, the differences varied in the ranges 3-40% in E.coli, 2-33% in Klebsiella sp., 0-28% in P. vulgaris, 2-28% in P.mirabilis, 0-16% in M.morganii, and 0-13% in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Clinical bacteriology and empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in the elderly at a national leprosarium].
AB  - Hospital-acquired pneumonia is one of the most important fatal respiratory diseases in the elderly. Prompt and precise empiric therapy is essential for recovery. Fourteen isolates from twelve elderly lepromatous leprosy patients (9 men, 3 women, mean age of 75.8 years) with hospital-acquired pneumonia were studied. Subsequently, empiric therapy with gentamicin and beta-lactams for nosocomial pneumonia in the elderly was examined. Fourteen types of bacteria isolated from expectorated sputum specimens consisted mainly of ten strains of gram-negative bacilli (71%) six of Klebsiella pneumoniae, one each of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, Serratia liquefaciens, and Aeromonas hydrophilia and four strains of gram-positive cocci (29%) two of Staphylococcus sp., one each of Streptococcus sp. and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas sp. were not detected. Resistance rates of the etiologic agents to the antibiotics showed that gentamicin was 7.7%, ceftazidime 0%, and cefmetazole 23.1%. Cephalosporins were superior to penicillins. As a result of empiric therapy, six elderly leprosy patients with nosocomial pneumonia were cured and one improved temporarily. This study shows the necessity of specific empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in a hospital with many elderly patients. The combination of gentamicin and beta-lactams is of value as an initial antibiotic therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in the elderly.
TI  - Phosphatase-mediated heavy metal accumulation by a Citrobacter sp. and related enterobacteria.
AB  - A Citrobacter sp. was reported previously to accumulate heavy metals as cell-bound heavy metal phosphates. Metal uptake is mediated by the activity of a periplasmic acid-type phosphatase that liberates inorganic phosphate to provide the precipitant ligand for heavy metals presented to the cells. Amino acid sequencing of peptide fragments of the purified enzyme revealed significant homology to the phoN product (acid phosphatase) of some other enterobacteria. These organisms, together with Klebsiella pneumoniae, previously reported to produce acid phosphatase, were tested for their ability to remove uranium and lanthanum from challenge solutions supplemented with phosphatase substrate. The coupling of phosphate liberation to metal bioaccumulation was limited to the metal accumulating Citrobacter sp.; therefore the participation of species-specific additional factors in metal bioaccumulation was suggested.
TI  - Evaluation of RapID onE system for identification of 379 strains in the family Enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.
AB  - The ability of the RapID onE system (Innovative Diagnostic Systems, Inc., Norcross, Ga.) to identify 364 strains in the family Enterobacteriaceae and 15 oxidase-negative, gram-negative, nonfermentative rods was evaluated. Kits were inoculated with no. 2 McFarland standard suspensions, and reactions were interpreted after 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees C. Overall, the method correctly identified (to the species level or to the genus level for salmonellas and non-Shigella sonnei Shigella species) 363 strains (95.8%) without additional tests. For four strains (1.0%), additional tests were required to delineate the correct identification from a range of two or more possibilities; these included one Serratia liquefaciens (Serratia marcescens or Serratia liquefaciens), one Serratia rubidaea (Serratia rubidaea or Serratia odorifera), one Salmonella typhi (Leminorella richardii or Salmonella sp.) and one Yersinia enterocolitica (Yersinia frederiksenii, Yersinia intermedia, or Yersinia enterocolitica). Twelve strains (3.2%) were misidentified or yielded codes with no identification; these comprised one Citrobacter amalonaticus (no identification), three Enterobacter hormaechei (not in the RapID onE database; two Enterobacter amnigenus, one Enterobacter sp.), one Serratia liquefaciens (Enterobacter cloacae), one Serratia rubidaea (no identification), four Serratia fonticola (not in RapID onE database; two Enterobacter aerogenes, one Serratia marcescens, one not identified), one Proteus mirabilis (Proteus penneri), and one Proteus vulgaris (Providencia rustigianii). If the seven strains not included in the database had been excluded, correct identification rates would have risen to 97.6% without additional tests and 98.7% with additional tests, with misidentification rates dropping to 1.3%. The RapID onE system is easy to set up and the results are easy to read, and the system provides an accurate, nonautomated commercially available method for the same-day identification of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.
TI  - In vitro brodimoprim activity on nosocomial bacterial strains.
AB  - The activity of brodimoprim, a new diaminopyrimidine, against 385 recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative bacilli was in vitro tested by the disk sensitivity test (DST) of Bauer et al. with disk concentration of 2.5 micrograms and by the agar dilution method. The postantibiotic effect (PAE) and the postantibiotic leukocyte killing enhancement (PALE) were determined on selected pathogens. The MICs were determined with Muller Hinton II agar (BD) and a multipoint inoculator (Denley A 400); thymidine phosphorylase (0.08 U/ml) was added to the test agar. Brodimoprim was very active against S. pyogenes (27), Salmonella sp. (30), methicillin susceptible S. aureus (36) and E. faecalis (34). The geometric means (GM) of MICs ranged from 0.08 to 0.63 and % of resistance from 0.0 to 14.7. Higher MICs (GM from 1.02 to 2.67) were shown against Citrobacter sp. (32), Klebsiella sp. (27), E. coli (36), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (33), Enterobacter sp. (32), Proteus sp. (31) and methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative staphylococci (34); resistant strains ranged from 18.7 to 41.2%. The in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (33) (72.7% of resistance to brodimoprim) was very low. Regression analysis, obtained correlating the results of MICs with those of agar diffusion, shows that the resistant strains have a diameter less than 11 mm, the intermediate ones a diameter of 11-13 mm and susceptible strains a diameter greater than 13 mm. The PAE was determined using the Abbott AVANTAGE system. Strains were exposed to brodimoprim (1/4 x MIC - 4 x MIC range) for 2 or 6 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Multipoint identification of Enterobacteriaceae: report of the British Society for Microbial Technology collaborative study.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of multipoint identification schemes in a multicentre trial. METHODS: Forty two strains of Enterobacteriaceae were distributed to 22 laboratories for identification by routine multipoint methods. Analysis of results enabled inter- and intralaboratory reproducibility of a variety of tests, and the ability of laboratories to identify individual organisms to be determined. RESULTS: Interlaboratory reproducibility of most of the biochemical tests was acceptable. The least reproducible tests, both within and between laboratories, were citrate utilisation, production of urease and beta galactosidase, detection of motility, and decarboxylation of lysine and ornithine. Inconsistent results for these tests were often associated with misidentified strains. Most laboratories performed identifications satisfactorily. Most isolates (72.1%) were identified correctly to species level; 9.6% were incorrectly identified, and 6.4% could not be identified at all. The most difficult organisms to identify were Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei and Aeromonas hydrophila. Strains of Enterobacter, Serratia sp, and Providencia sp were difficult to speciate. Several laboratories could not identify organisms exhibiting at least one atypical biochemical reaction. CONCLUSION: This study emphasises the need for quality control of media and reagents for multipoint identification of Gram negative enteric bacilli.
TI  - Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in Barbados.
AB  - Resistance to third-generation, or extended-spectrum, cephalosporins caused by induction of class I beta-lactamases has been reported rarely from developing countries. Seven isolates of cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative rods were recovered recently from urine, burns and ulcers in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Barbados. The isolates were identified as Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (2), Citrobacter freundii (1), Enterobacter cloacae (1), Morganella morganii (1), Providencia stuartii (1) and Proteus sp. (1). Induction of beta-lactamase by cefoxitin was demonstrated, and minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by agar dilution. beta-lactamases were demonstrated by isoelectric focusing; the presence of chromosomal beta-lactamases was confirmed in at least three of the resistant isolates. The only antibiotics which were uniformly active against these resistant strains were imipenem and ciprofloxacin. These data confirm the existence of resistance to the third-generation cephalosporins in Barbados, and emphasise the necessity for continuous surveillance of resistance patterns in the Caribbean region.
TI  - Analysis of polar lipids from some representative enterobacteria, Plesiomonas and Acinetobacter by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  - Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. The following micro-organisms were tested: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), Escherichia coli (3 strains), Hafnia alvei, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Proteus mirabilis (3 strains), Serratia liquefaciens and Serratia marcescens. Negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). Generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17 and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to PE(32:1), PE(33:1), PE(34:1), PE(34:2), PG(30:2), PG(31:2), PG(32:2), PG(34:1) and PS(33:0). However, quantitative differences were observed. For example, Acinetobacter lacked PE (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, PS(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. Unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. In some cases, unknown peaks appeared to constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). For chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. Using the Pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains analysed. Typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: Ent. cloacae vs Ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (Ent. cloacae vs Ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). Thus FAB-MS represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.
TI  - Mobilization of nonconjugative pBR322-derivative plasmids from laboratory strains of Escherichia coli to bacteria isolated from seawater.
AB  - Mobilization of derivatives of plasmids pBR322 and pBR325 was shown to occur between Escherichia coli K12 strains in LB-broth at 37 degrees C, provided a mobilizer plasmid (F') was present either together with the nonconjugative plasmid or in a second donor strain. Evidence from restriction endonuclease analysis suggested that the mobilization was facilitated by a transposition phenomenon involving the "gamma-delta" sequence of F'. It was shown that mobilization of a derivative of pBR325 from E. coli K12 to bacteria isolated from seawater occurred in incubations in both LB-broth and filtered seawater and that Pseudomonas sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella oxytoca, E. coli, and Citrobacter amalonaticus isolates were recipient-active.
TI  - Epidemiological role of arthropods detectable in health facilities.
AB  - A total of 161 arthropod specimens were collected from 55 sites in a health care  facility during July and September 1990. Of the 116 bacterial isolates obtained from their body surfaces 6% were from parasites (mosquitoes), 59% from eusynanthropic arthropods (Tenebrionid beetles, flies, German cockroaches, wasps), 16% from hemisynanthropic arthropods (ants, spiders) and 19% from occasionally encountered insects (non-biting midges, moths, beetles). Most (88%) of the isolated bacteria were Gram-negative rods of the species E. coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Proteus, Serratia, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter. Gram-positive cocci accounted for 13% of isolates and were primarily represented by coagulase-negative staphylococci. The highest isolation rates were from body surfaces of flies, German cockroaches, non-biting midges (Chironomids) and Tenebrionid beetles. About one third of all isolates were resistant to more than three antimicrobials using a standard disc diffusion assay. The presence of multiple resistance to antibiotics was observed in two thirds of Enterobacter isolates, namely those of Enterobacter cloacae from the body surface of Germany cockroaches, in 13% of Citrobacter spp and in 8% of Klebsiella spp as well as Acinetobacter calcoaceticus strains. Strains of Morganella and Hafnia species were very infrequent but all of them shared resistance to the antibiotics tested. In contrast, strains of Serratia spp were relatively antibiotic-sensitive. The group of isolated Gram-positive organisms was represented by two strains of Staphylococcus hominis and one strain of Enterococcus sp, all of them were multiply-resistant to antimicrobials.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antimicrobial activities of a novel cephalosporin derivative, CP6162, possessing a dihydroxypyridone moiety at the C-3 side chain.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a novel cephalosporin derivative, CP6162, possessing a dihydroxypyridone moiety at the C-3 side chain, was evaluated in vitro and in vivo, with ceftazidime, aztreonam and cefoperazone as the reference antibiotics. CP6162 showed weak or little activity against Gram-positive bacteria, but potent activity against clinical isolates of the Gram-negative species including strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Ps. cepacia, Acinetobacter sp., Xanthomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii, which were resistant to the reference antibiotics. The MICs of CP6162 were only slightly affected by the high producers of beta-lactamases except for cephalosporinase-producing C. freundii. It was, however, affected by the presence of ferric ion. CP6162 showed in-vivo activity paralleling the in-vitro activity, and also showed pharmacokinetic parameters similar to those of ceftazidime in mice and rats.
TI  - Cefotaxime and aminoglycoside treatment of meningitis caused by gram-negative enteric organisms.
AB  - We reviewed cases of Gram-negative enteric bacillary meningitis in infants and children treated with cefotaxime at Texas Children's Hospital from January, 1984, through June, 1989. Seventeen of 20 children had an underlying condition predisposing to the development of meningitis. The etiologic organisms in these 20 children (2 days to 12 years old; median, 12 days old) were Klebsiella sp, 9; Escherichia coli, 4; Enterobacter cloacae, 3; Citrobacter diversus, 2; other, 2. With the exception of one isolate of Acinetobacter, all isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime. In addition to cefotaxime 17 children received an aminoglycoside intravenously. Children with meningitis caused by Klebsiella sp. or non-Klebsiella organisms received cefotaxime for 31 +/- 14 and 37 +/- 17 days, respectively. Aminoglycosides were administered for 16 +/- 10 days in both groups. Five children in each group also received intraventricular doses (1 to 25) of an aminoglycoside (9) or colistimethate (1). The mean durations of positive lumbar, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid or brain abscess cultures were 5.8 +/- 4.7 and 7.2 +/- 5.0 days after start of therapy in the Klebsiella and non-Klebsiella meningitis patients, respectively. Only three children were normal at the time of discharge or follow-up. Gram-negative enteric meningitis remains difficult to treat despite the excellent in vitro activity of cefotaxime against Gram-negative enterics, in part as a result of the predisposing conditions resulting in the development of this infection.
TI  - Hemolysin as a marker for Serratia.
AB  - All Serratia marcescens strains (total of 33) of different sources were hemolytic including clinical strains previously classified as being nonhemolytic. DNA fragments of the two hemolysin genes hybridized with the chromosomal DNA of S. marcescens, S. liquefaciens, S. kiliensis, S. grimesii, S. proteamaculans, S. plymutica, S. rubridaea which were also hemolytic. The restriction pattern of the hemolysin locus differed in each strain. S. ficaria and S. marinorubra expressed a different hemolysin which was much smaller than the S. marcescens hemolysin since it diffused through dialysis membranes. The DNA of the latter strains did not hybridize with the S. marcescens hemolysin DNA probes. Some S. marcescens strains, S. kiliensis and S. liquefaciens also expressed in addition the small hemolysin. No hybridization was found with DNA of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella arerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosus, Listeria sp., Aeromonas sp., Legionella sp. and a Meninococcus sp., indicating that the hemolysin DNA probes are specific for Serratia, or that the hemolysin genes occur rarely in genera other than Serratia.
TI  - Bacteriological study of extracted IUCDs.
TI  - Ticarcillin/clavulanate in the treatment of severe peritonitis.
AB  - A prospective study was performed on 50 consecutive patients with secondary peritonitis. All patients received ticarcillin/clavulanate 5.2 g three times daily as initial antibiotic therapy. In 30 patients a primary perforation was found in the gastro-intestinal tract and 20 had post-operative peritonitis. In two thirds of the patients a diffuse peritonitis was found which affected the whole abdomen. Thirty-six patients underwent one or two laparotomies and 11 patients had more than three laparotomies. Subsequently, 17 patients died. The cause of death was a therapeutic failure as a result of the surgical procedure in ten patients (nine patients with persisting intestinal fistulae, one patient with bleeding), whereas in seven cases antibiotic therapy failed. Micro-organisms found in the latter patients were producers of type 1 beta-lactamase (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter sp., Citrobacter sp., Serratia marcescens) and enterococci. Ticarcillin/clavulanate is characterized by its broad antimicrobial spectrum against anaerobic and aerobic bacteria and seems, therefore, to be well suited for initial chemotherapy in patients with diffuse peritonitis.
TI  - [Study on bacterial infection by the investigation of antimicrobial susceptibility of various clinical isolates. III. Comparison of drug susceptibility between the isolates from the materials of out- and in-patients, and among the isolates from the materials of different hospital units].
AB  - Antimicrobial agents susceptibility of 42, 940 strains of clinical isolates (from 1979 to 1986) were investigated and the data were analyzed on the basis of the sources of isolates; materials from in- and out-patients or from the different hospital units. Bacteria studied were limited to the species of which isolates were 100 or more during 1979 to 1986. The following results were obtained. i) When the antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates from the out-patient-materials were compared with that from the in-patient-materials, the following 13 bacterial species isolated from the former source were found to be more susceptible to antibiotics than that of the latter. These were S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, Citrobacter sp., Klebsiella sp., Serratia sp., P. vulgaris, P. rettgeri, M. morganii, P. aeruginosa, P. putida, S. sonnei and Salmonella sp.. ii) The frequency of isolation and their antibiotic susceptibility of S. aureus, Enterobacter sp. and P. aeruginosa from both the in- and out-patients were comparable through 1979. However, S. aureus isolated from the in-patient-materials tended to show increased antibiotic resistance since 1983. This is probably due to the frequent use of the 3rd generation cephalosporins. iii) Comparison of the antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates from the different hospital units showed that the resistant strains were more frequently isolated in the materials from the urology unit and the susceptible strains were more frequently isolated in the materials from the infectious diseases unit. iv) Antibiotic resistant S. aureus and P. aeruginosa increased abruptly since 1983 in the materials from the surgery and urology unit, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates to aztreonam].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of 9 antibiotics including aztreonam (AZT) against clinically isolated Gram-negative bacteria were determined using MIC-2000 plus system. Bacteria were isolated from clinical materials in Saga Medical School during a period from May 1987 to March 1988. Summarized results were as follows: 1. AZT showed excellent antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp. and Haemophilus influenzae, and MIC80 values of AZT against these organisms were lower than 0.20 microgram/ml. 2. Antibacterial activities of AZT were superior to cephem antibiotics compared against Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. 3. The MIC50 and MIC80 of AZT against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 12.5 micrograms/ml and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. 4. AZT did not show any antibacterial activity against Acinetobacter sp. and Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - In vitro studies of tigemonam: a comparison of the minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MIC vs MBC).
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigemonam, a new oral monobactam, was studied with special attention to minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs). Against 250 clinical isolates, it inhibited 100% of Escherichia sp., Klebsiella sp., Serratia sp., Citrobacter sp., Providencia sp., Proteus sp., Morganella sp., Aeromonas sp., Yersinia sp., Shigella sp., and Haemophilus sp. at 0.5 mg/L or less. With 1 mg/L, 75% of Enterobacter sp. were inhibited; however, three of the 20 strains tested needed more than 16 mg/L. Proteus sp., Morganella sp. and Providencia sp. were more susceptible, with MIC90s of 0.06 mg/L or less. The MBC was equal to or two times higher than the MIC. Increasing the inoculum size from 10(3) to 10(5) colony-forming units had little effect on MIC and MBC; with an inoculum of 10(7) or more, MIC and MBC increase three to eight times. MIC and MBC were a little lower in Mueller-Hinton base, and the presence of serum did not significantly change the MIC or the MBC. Tigemonam exhibits a rapid killing rate, but an increased antibiotic concentration was not accompanied by greater lethal effect, and the lethal rate at MBC was lower in trypticase soy broth (TSB) + 40% serum than in TSB alone.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigemonam against multiresistant nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Tigemonam, an oral monobactam that exhibits beta-lactamase stability similar to that of aztreonam, was tested in vitro against 240 species of Enterobacteriaceae (50 Escherichia coli, 48 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 52 Enterobacter cloacae, 32 Proteus mirabilis, 22 Proteus indole-positive [Providencia sp.], 24 Serratia sp., and 12 Citrobacter sp. All strains were resistant to ampicillin and first-generation cephalosporins. In addition, 77.4% were resistant to amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, 46.8% to cefuroxime, 23.3% to ceftriaxone, 22.2% to aztreonam, 46.9% to cotrimoxazole, and 0.9% to norfloxacin. Tigemonam at a concentration of 4 micrograms/mL or less inhibited 72.7% of the strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.03 or less to more than 512 micrograms/mL. The highest intrinsic activity was observed against Proteus sp. Tigemonam proved to be a bactericidal antibiotic. Cross-resistance was chiefly observed with aztreonam and ceftriaxone. It is concluded that tigemonam should play an important role in the treatment of nosocomial infections that do not require parenteral therapy and in the treatment of multiresistant community-acquired infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigemonam against urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - Tigemonam's in vitro activity was compared with that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, gentamicin, and norfloxacin. Thirty-two strains of Pseudomonas and 960 strains of Enterobacteriaceae were studied using the agar dilution method (including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Salmonella enterica). Tigemonam displayed good activity against Enterobacteriaceae. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were as follows: MIC50S were 0.01 mg/L for P. mirabilis and 0.5 mg/L for S. marcescens, MIC90S were 0.03 mg/L for P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris and 4 mg/L for Citrobacter freundii. Tigemonam inhibited E. coli and P. mirabilis, the most common strains of urinary pathogens. Despite MIC90S of 9.5 and 4 mg/L for Enterobacter and C. freundii, respectively, resistance to tigemonam was observed. Tigemonam was found to be inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with MIC50S and MIC90S higher than 128 mg/L (range, 64 to greater than 128 mg/L). Tigemonam's activity was found to be similar to that of cefotaxime, slightly less than that of norfloxacin and aztreonam, and substantially greater than that of gentamicin. Of all the drugs tested, only norfloxacin and aztreonam possessed activity profiles against P. aeruginosa that were compatible with their clinical usefulness (MIC90, 8 mg/L for norfloxacin; MIC50, 8 mg/L and MIC90, 32 mg/L for aztreonam). Cefotaxime and gentamicin showed no activity on more than 90% of the P. aeruginosa strains tested.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of tigemonam dicholate (SQ 30836) and interaction with beta-lactamases of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - SQ 30836 is an orally absorbed salt of tigemonam, a new monobactam similar to aztreonam in structure and microbiologic properties. When assayed against 400 clinical isolates, tigemonam's activity was similar to that of aztreonam and carumonam. It was highly effective against Enterobacteriaceae but showed poor activity against gram-positive organisms. It inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Shigella, Yersinia, Proteus, Providencia, and Morganella strains at 0.5 micrograms/mL or less, and all Salmonella and Hafnia strains at 1 micrograms/mL or less. Citrobacter, Enterobacter, and Serratia strains were less susceptible (minimum inhibitory concentrations [MIC30] of 2, 32, and 8 micrograms/mL respectively). The activity of the new compound against Enterobacteriaceae is comparable with and often higher than that of third-generation cephalosporins and oral comparison compounds. In contrast to aztreonam, tigemonam had minimal activity against Pseudomonas sp and glucose nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria. Data suggest that poor penetration through the outer membranes of Pseudomonas sp may be responsible for this failure. Tigemonam was stable to hydrolysis by plasmid-mediated and chromosomal beta-lactamases. It was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the Kl enzyme of Klebsiella and by the Proteus vulgaris beta-lactamase. Also, measurement of the IC50 (concentration of inhibitor able to reduce the activity of the enzyme by 59%) showed that tigemonam has less affinity than aztreonam for class I cephalosporinases. However, only levels of beta-lactamase, not hydrolysis rates or affinity, correlated to MICs of the two monobactams for the resistant Enterobacter and Citrobacter strains.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Urinary tract infection.
AB  - Over two years, 9892 mid-stream urine samples from patients attending the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi were cultured. Significant bacterial growth was seen in 23.5% samples. Further identification of these organisms revealed 40% of E. coli, 16% Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 11% Klebsiella aerogenes, 5.0% Enterobacter sp., 13% Proteus sp., 4.0% Serratia liquifaciens, 1.0% Acinetobacter sp., 3.0% Citrobacter sp., 4.0% Enterococci, 0.5% Staphylococcus aureus. Results of sensitivity tests performed with antibiotics Ampicillin, Cotrimoxazole, Nitrofurantoin, Nalidixic acid, Gentamicin, Amikacin, Pipemedic acid, Cefotaxime, Azactam and Carbenicillin did not reveal any distinct pattern.
TI  - [The rapid identification of E. coli by the detection of 3 enzymes].
AB  - 232 isolates of gram-negative, oxidase-negative bacteria, isolated from various samples of different animal species, were tested with help of RAPIDEC coli for the production of beta-glucuronidase, beta-galactosidase and indole. The test correctly identified 164 of 175 E. coli strains (sensitivity 93.7%) and correctly indicated that 57 of 57 isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae (7 Citrobacter sp., 18 Enterobacter sp., 16 Klebsiella sp., 10 Proteus sp., 2 Providencia sp. and 4 Salmonella sp.) were not E. coli (specificity 100%).
TI  - [The rapid identification of Escherichia coli using Bactident E. coli].
AB  - 165 (93.7%) of 175 E. coli strains isolated from various materials of different animal species were correctly identified as E. coli with help of commercially available Bactident E. coli (E. Merck, D-6100 Darmstadt). Further 52 strains of the family of Enterobacteriaceae (2x Providencia sp., 2x Salmonella sp., 7 Citrobacter sp., 9 Proteus sp., 15 Klebsiella sp., 17 Enterobacter sp.) were correctly not identified as E. coli by this test. Bactident E. coli is a suitable test for rapid identification of E. coli in veterinary bacteriology.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin in vitro compared with that of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin, a pseudo-disaccharide aminoglycoside antibiotic, was compared with those of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin using clinical isolates of four Gram-positive and sixteen Gram-negative bacteria. Dactimicin was more active than the reference amino-glycosides against Serratia marcescens, especially gentamicin-resistant Serratia sp., Proteus vulgaris, P. rettgeri and Klebsiella oxytoca, but less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. Dactimicin was equally active as the references excepting netilmicin against Gram-positive bacteria and some Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogens, E. cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Campylobacter jejunii. Dactimicin was active against resistant strains possessing various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes including AAC(3)-1, by which dactimicin was acetylated.
TI  - Survival of coliforms and bacterial pathogens within protozoa during chlorination.
AB  - The susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. Viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of Acanthamoeba castellanii and Tetrahymena pyriformis. Cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. Qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. Protozoa were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. Ingested coliforms Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella sonnei, Legionella gormanii, and Campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. Bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. All bacterial pathogens were greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by T. pyriformis. Escherichia coli ingested by a Cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. The mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within protozoan cells. This study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. This bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. We propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.
TI  - Lipid A precursor from Pseudomonas aeruginosa is completely acylated prior to addition of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate.
AB  - Inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa at the stage of incorporation of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (KDO) caused accumulation of a lipid A precursor which contained all of the fatty acids present on the lipid A of mature LPS. The enzyme CTP:CMP-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase (CMP-KDO synthetase) from P. aeruginosa is inhibited by the KDO analog alpha-C-[1,5-anhydro-8-amino-2,7,8-trideoxy-D-manno-octopyranosyl] carboxylate (I), and I is effectively delivered to P. aeruginosa following attachment by amide linkage to the carboxyl terminus of alanylalanine. Intracellular hydrolysis releases the free inhibitor (I) which then inhibits activation of KDO by CMP-KDO synthetase causing accumulation of lipid A precursor and subsequent growth stasis. The major lipid A precursor species accumulated was purified and found to contain glucosamine, phosphate, C12:O, 2OH-C12:O and 3OH-C10:0 (in ester linkage), and 3OH-C12:0 (in amide linkage) in molar ratios of 1:1:0.5:0.5:1:1. Analysis of precursor by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy yielded a major ion (M - H)- of mass 1616 and fragments which were consistent with the structure of lipid A from P. aeruginosa. In contrast, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae all accumulated underacylated lipid A precursors which only contained 3-OH-C14:0, glucosamine, and phosphate. This difference and species-specific patterns of major and minor precursor species show that early steps in the assembly of lipid A are similar, but not identical in enteric and nonenteric Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Carumonam's in-vitro activity against gram-negative bacteria and its stability to their beta-lactamases.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the novel monobactam carumonam (RO17-2301) was evaluated on 311 gram-negative clinical isolates in comparison to aztreonam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefotetan and ceftriaxone. Carumonam showed an antibacterial potency equal to or higher than any other reference compound; in particular it was the most effective against Proteus indole positive and Klebsiella sp. Its antipseudomonal activity was comparable to that of ceftazidime and it showed, together with aztreonam, the highest activity against the Citrobacter, Enterobacter and Escherichia coli isolates. The minimal inhibitory concentrations performed on permeability altered organisms indicated that carumonam has a penetration rate comparable to aztreonam and higher than cefotetan and ceftriaxone. Carumonam demonstrated excellent stability to chromosomal and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and that correlated with its antibacterial activity against the producing strains and inoculum size effect.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - [Effect of norfloxacin on bacterial flora in human feces].
AB  - Norfloxacin (NFLX), a synthetic oral antibacterial agent of quinolone carboxylic  acid, was given orally for 5 full days at a dose of 200 mg, three times daily after each meal to healthy normal men with ages between 22 and 25 years weighing 53.0 to 84.0 kg (average 67.0 kg). The actual regimen followed was that the drug was administered twice after lunch and supper on the first day of dosing, and once after breakfast on the last day of dosing. On the 5th day before the start of dosing, on the first, 3rd and 5th days (last dosing day) of dosing, and on the 3rd, 5th, 10th and 20th days after the end of dosing, effects of the drug on the fecal flora were examined and its fecal levels were determined. Susceptibilities against NFLX and nalidixic acid (NA) of various fecal isolates from 7 men were determined. Adverse effects and influences on clinical laboratory tests were also examined. The results obtained are summarized below. 1. Following the drug administration, a transient decrease or disappearance of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp. and Enterobacter sp. of Enterobacteriaceae was noted. The 3 strains other than E. coli were isolated from increasing number of cases after the end of dosing. No constant trend was observed in the isolation of Proteus sp. Organisms belong to Enterobacteriaceae were isolated only in 4 and 2 cases after 3 and 5 days of the start of dosing, respectively, but then gradually increased to the predose level. Among other Gram-negative bacteria, no constant trend was noted in the isolation frequency of Plesiomonas sp. Pseudomonas sp. was isolated from 6 and 5 cases on the 3rd day after dosing and on the 3rd day after the end of dosing, respectively; the frequency of isolation increased after dosing. Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus sp. were isolated with a reduced frequency on the 3rd day of dosing. However, the number of isolates increased in all cases both on the 5th day of dosing and on the 3rd day after the end of dosing, and then decreased. No change was noticed in the number of isolates of Enterococcus sp., and no constant trend was observed for Micrococcus sp. and YLO. The average count of the whole aerobic bacteria did not change. Some strains decreased significantly after the start of dosing. 2. Among anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides were isolated on every test day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical bacterial isolates to aztreonam].
AB  - In vitro activities of 7 antimicrobial agents against organisms (474 strains) isolated from patients with various infections in Ehime University Hospital from May to July 1986 were investigated. Summarized results are as follows: 1. Aztreonam (AZT) showed potent activities against Escherichia coli, Citrobacter sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae. 2. Antimicrobial activities of AZT were especially superior against Proteus sp. to the third generation cephem antibiotics. 3. Enterobacter sp. seemed more susceptible to AZT than to cephem antibiotics, but minimum inhibitory concentrations of AZT against may isolates of Enterobacter sp. were in wide ranges.
TI  - Bacterial survey of well water--Tehran, Iran.
AB  - One hundred twenty-one wells throughout the city of Tehran were monitored during  the four seasons of the year for the presence of bacterial indicators of fecal pollution. None of the sites monitored was connected to Tehran's main water distribution system but represented drinking water sources for small communities, individual factories, hospitals, etc. Only 17 samples showed no indication of fecal bacterial contamination throughout the study. The remaining sites were positive for at least one of the following at some season of the year: Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Citrobacter sp., Klebsiella-Enterobacter group, Clostridium perfringens, or Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - Occurrence of multiple antibiotic resistance and R-plasmids in gram-negative bacteria isolated from faecally contaminated fresh-water streams in Hong Kong.
AB  - The bacterial populations of six freshwater streams in populated areas of the Hong Kong New Territories were studied. There is considerable faecal contamination of these streams, with coliform counts as high as 10(5) c.f.u./ml and the contaminating organisms show a high prevalence of antibiotic resistance and multiple resistance. With direct plating of water samples onto antibiotic-containing media, an average of 49% of the gram-negative bacteria were ampicillin-resistant, 3% chloramphenicol-resistant and 1% gentamicin-resistant. At individual sites resistance to these drugs was as high as 98%, 8% and 3% respectively. More than 70% of strains were resistant to two or more antibiotics, 29% to five or more and 2% to eight or more. A total of 98 patterns of antibiotic resistance were detected with no one pattern predominating. Twenty-eight gram-negative bacterial species were identified as stream contaminants. Escherichia coli was the commonest bacterial species isolated and other frequent isolates were Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella sp. and Citrobacter sp., but no enteric pathogens were detected. The greatest prevalence of resistance and multiple resistance was associated with the heaviest contamination by E. coli. Analysis of selected stream isolates revealed multiple plasmid bands arranged in many different patterns, but multiple antibiotic resistances were shown to be commonly mediated by single transferable plasmids. Faecally-contaminated freshwater streams in Hong Kong may be reservoirs of antibiotic resistance plasmids for clinically-important bacteria.
TI  - A comparative study of the sensitivity of bacteria of various origin to ofloxacin.
AB  - The sensitivity of 6 antimicrobials (chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin, cephalothin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ofloxacin) was tested on 174 bacteria isolated from three sources: 60 from wounds, 84 from urine and 30 from bronchial excretions. Hospital-borne bacteria were compared to those of non-hospital origin for their susceptibility. Consecutively, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24 strains), Escherichia coli (58), Klebsiella sp. (13), Enterobacter sp. (3), Citrobacter sp. (3), Enterococcus sp. (25) and Staphylococcus sp. (48) were tested. With the exception of 7.1% of bacteria (Enterococcus) isolated from urine, 96.6% of all strains tested were sensitive to ofloxacin.
TI  - In vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. A-56620 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, Staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. A-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. Difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than A-56620. Both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC 0.015 micrograms/ml) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MK less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). Both agents were more active against streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. They inhibited Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. These agents show overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.
TI  - Premarket evaluation of IDS RapID SS/u system for identification of urine isolates.
AB  - A total of 170 fresh clinical urine isolates were tested with a premarket configuration of the RapID SS/u system (Innovative Diagnostic Systems, Inc., Atlanta, Ga.), a qualitative micromethod for the identification of selected organisms commonly isolated from urine specimens. Results were compared with those obtained with conventional methods of identifying gram-positive isolates and with the AutoMicrobic system (Vitek Systems, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.), utilizing Gram-Negative Identification cards for the identification of gram-negative rods. Organisms representing 12 taxa were included in the study. Of the 170 isolates, 163 (95.9%) were correctly identified. A total of 144 strains (84.7%) were correctly identified without additional testing, whereas 19 isolates (11.2%) required further testing. Seven isolates (4.1%) were incorrectly identified. The SS/u system required minimal hands-on time inoculate and interpret reactions. Discrepancies most often occurred with regard to misinterpretation of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter sp. as Citrobacter sp. The IDS RapID SS/u system may indeed prove valuable for the rapid manual identification of urine isolates.
TI  - [Treatment of urinary infection with cephadroxyl (Pharmachem)--microbiological and clinical research].
AB  - The bacteria isolated from the urine of renal patients were tested for sensitivity towards cephadroxyl (Pharmachem) and other beta-lactam antibiotics--altogether 654 examinations were made. It was established that the gram-positive bacteria (excluding the Enterococcus) are sensitive towards cephadroxyl. From the Gram negative bacteria E. Coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp., P. mirabilis, Citrobacter sp. showed the greatest sensitivity towards cephadroxyl, while the indole positive Proteus were with low sensitivity and P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp., Serratia were resistant towards cephadroxyl. 30 patients with persistent mainly secondary urinary infection were treated with cephadroxyl. The clinical symptoms disappeared in 63.3% of the patients and another 26.7% of them showed considerable improvement. Bacteriological sterility of the urine was achieved in 61.29% of the patients. The side effects were mild and rare, only in single cases.
TI  - [Pyogenic hepatic abscess].
AB  - Ten patients, 6 men and 4 women, with a mean age of 53 years, having pyogenic liver abscess, were studied to review the principal features of the clinical and bacteriological diagnosis. In 9 cases the abscess was located in the right hepatic lobe. Bacteriological diagnosis was made in 6 cases: the etiology was nonmicrobian in 3 and two microorganisms were found in the other 3 cases. The isolated pathogens were: Escherichia coli (3 cases), Staphylococcus sp (3 cases), Enterobacter agglomerans (1 case), Citrobacter sp (1 case), Streptococcus sp (1 case). The basic clinical pattern included fever in 9 patients, pain in upper right side of the abdomen in 8, jaundice in 5 and respiratory symptoms in 5. In 2 cases the diagnosis was confirmed by ultrasonography, in 2 by scintigraphy and in 3 both methods were used. Surgical drainage was practiced in 7 patients, with favorable course in 6. Three patients were not operated; 2 died and the third was cured with medical treatment. The importance of the clinical suspicion even with few data is pointed out, specially prolonged fever with painful syndrome in upper right side of the abdomen. The aid of the diagnosis imaging is valuable for verification. The precise bacteriological diagnosis by culture of the material obtained in surgery or by percutaneous drainage of the abscess allows the selection of the most suitable antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Gram-negative septicemia in American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis).
AB  - Six species of bacteria (family Enterobacteriaceae) not commonly reported as associated with disease in American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) were documented, suggesting that Aeromonas is not the only bacterium responsible for septicemia in crocodilians. These included Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, Proteus sp., Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, and Klebsiella oxytoca. Clinical signs of disease included intensive basking, anorexia, lethargy, flaccid limb paralysis, stomatitis, and dermatitis. Our data indicated that early treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics was preferable to waiting for sensitivity results.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247, two orally administered cephalosporin metabolites.
AB  - The activity of two iminomethoxy aminothiazoly cephalosporins, Ro 15-8074 and Ro  19-5247, was compared with that of other beta-lactams against a total of 491 bacterial strains. Both were highly active (MIC for 90% of the strains tested [MIC 90], less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml) against the majority of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae, being at least 16-fold more active than cephalexin and 8-fold more active than cefuroxime. There was no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and poor activity against Morganella morganii (in the case of Ro 15-8074), Enterobacter sp., and Citrobacter sp. Staphylococcus aureus was moderately susceptible to Ro 19-5247 (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml), but Ro 15-8074 was eightfold less active. The protein binding of the two compounds at 5 micrograms/ml was 9.1% for Ro 15-8074 and 69.9% for Ro 19-5247. The major target site for the two cephalosporins was PBP 3.
TI  - [In vitro activity of carumonam (RO 17-2301) on hospital bacteria].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of carumonam (RO 17-2301), a new synthetic antibacterial agent of the monobactam group, were evaluated by agar dilution for 399 hospital isolates. RO 17-2301 was inactive against Gram positive and anaerobic bacteria. Most Enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by concentrations less than 1 microgram/ml, with mode MICs approximating 0.03 micrograms/ml except for Providencia (0.016), Citrobacter (0.06), Serratia (0.06) and Enterobacter (0.12). A few strains, most of which were Enterobacter or Citrobacter, had high MICs (greater than 8 micrograms/ml). RO 17-2301 was less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mode MIC 2 micrograms/ml) and Acinetobacter (mode MIC 8-16 micrograms/ml). Haemophilus influenzae sp. were sensitive to RO 17-2301 (mode MIC 0.12-0.25), regardless of beta-lactamase production status; MICs ranged from 0.06 to 0.25 micrograms/ml for Meningococci, and from 0.008 to 0.06 for Gonococci except for a few strains that had higher MICs (0.25 to 0.5 and even 4 micrograms/ml). In vitro activity of RO 17-2301 on Gram negative bacteria proved similar to that of third-generation cephalosporins; cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae are resistant to RO 17-2301.
TI  - [In vitro activity of a new 3d-generation cephalosporin, cefodizime, on hospital  bacteria].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefodizime were evaluated by agar dilution for 746 bacterial strains isolated in two hospitals. For enterobacteriaceae MICs ranged from 0.008 micrograms/ml to more than 128 micrograms/ml (mode MIC: 0.25); mode MICs varied across species, ranging from 0.016 micrograms/ml for Proteus mirabilis to 1 microgram/ml for Citrobacter; MICs ranged from 0.12 to 8 for most Enterobacter and from 1 to 64 for Serratia. The rare cefotaxime-resistant strains, most of which were Citrobacter or Enterobacter, also showed resistance to cefodizime. Cefodizime was noticeably less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter, with MICs ranging from 32 to more than 128. Haemophilus sp. and Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status, as well as Neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC less than or equal to 0.008-0.016). Cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococci (MIC: 2 to 16 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. Enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant. Whereas the other Streptococci and Pneumococci had low MICs (0.03-0.12). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes, with lower values for Clostridium (0.008 to 1) than for Bacteroids (8 to 128 mu g/ml). Our results show that cefodizime has the same properties as other third-generation cephalosporins: cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains also exhibit resistance to cefodizime.
TI  - [Effect of cefminox on bacterial flora in human adult feces].
AB  - Cefminox (CMNX), a new cephamycin, was administered by one shot intravenous injection twice daily with a dose of 1,000 mg each time for 5 days to seven healthy male volunteers whose ages ranged from 21 to 28 years (mean: 25 years) and body weights were from 60 to 92 kg mean: 72 kg). The effect of the drug on fecal bacterial flora was investigated and the concentrations of the drug in feces were measured on 5th day before the treatment, on 0, 3rd, and 5th day (the final day of the treatment) during the treatment, and on 3rd, 5th, and 10th day after the treatment. Antibiotic susceptibility tests of CMNX, cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefotaxime (CTX) against several strains of organisms isolated from feces of the seven volunteers were performed. Clinical adverse reactions and effect on laboratory examinations were also investigated. The results of the study are described as follows. Among Enterobacteriaceae, populations of E. coli, Klebsiella sp. and Citrobacter sp. temporarily disappeared during the treatment of CMNX. After 5-day-treatment, that of Citrobacter sp. transiently increased and the isolation of Enterobacter sp. increased during treatment and up to 5 days after treatment, while those of Proteus sp., H. alvei, or Serratia sp. did not show a definite change. The mean Enterobacteriaceae population in general was 10(8) to 10(9) cells/g feces, showing almost no variation, on all examination days except 5th day during treatment when these organisms were not isolated from only one subject. No remarkable change was not found in populations of other isolated organisms including Gram-negative bacilli; Aeromonas sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Acinetobacter sp., and Gram-positive bacteria; Staphylococcus sp., Enterococcus sp., Micrococcus sp. and Candida sp. Among anaerobes, the mean population of Bacteroides sp. was 10(10) to 10(11) cells/g feces, showing almost no variation, and C. difficile was not isolated from any subject, however the toxin was detected in samples from 5 of 7 subjects; one subject showed always positive for toxin on all examination days; 1 on 5th day during treatment to 10th day after treatment; 2 on 5th and 10th day after treatment, and 1 only on 10th day after treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  - A total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. The strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli (314), Enterobacter aerogenes (30), E. agglomerans (7), E. cloacae, (39), Citrobacter diversus (9), C. freundii (13), Hafnia alvei (3), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), Klebsiella oxytoca (6), K. ozaenae (5), K. pneumoniae (107), Morganella morganii (3), Moraxella sp. (10), Pasteurella multocida (1), Proteus mirabilis (66), P. vulgaris (4), Providencia rettgeri (12), P. stuartii (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), P. fluorescens (2), P. maltophila (7), Salmonella sp. (1) and Serratia marcescens (17). In vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. Over 99% of E. coli and Enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. All the 118 strains of Klebsiella, 87 strains of Proteus-Providencia and 17 strains of S. marcescens were also susceptible. Aztreonam also showed good activity against P. aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.
TI  - In vitro activity of ciprofloxacin compared with other agents against recent hospital isolates.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin's in vitro activity was tested against 385 hospital isolates originating from three geographically distinct regions. Of all strains tested, only three (1 Acinetobacter sp. and 2 Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were ciprofloxacin resistant. Ciprofloxacin was more active against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter sp., Proteus sp., Shigella sp. than gentamicin, mezlocillin and cefotaxime. It was more active than azlocillin and cefsulodin against P. aeruginosa. It was more active than cloxacillin and cefamandole against staphylococci. It was as active as cefotaxime against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. Ciprofloxacin demonstrated similar activity in broth and solid agar. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of all strains were similar to the minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC's). Ciprofloxacin's MIC was not influenced by increase of the inoculum or addition of human serum and only slightly influenced by anaerobic conditions. Decrease of the medium pH increased the MIC substantially. Ciprofloxacin exhibited a rapid bactericidal effect and had only a minimal post-antibiotic effect. These favorable in vitro characteristics of ciprofloxacin warrant further studies.
TI  - [Effect of S6472 and cefaclor on bacterial flora in adult human feces].
AB  - S6472 is a mixture of cefaclor (CCL) granules with gastric-soluble coating and those with enteric-soluble coating at the ratio (in potency) of 4 to 6. With administration of this formulation, a prolonged blood level of CCL is obtained. S6472 and CCL were administered orally to 19 healthy male volunteers between 20 and 27 years of age (mean: 23 years) weighing between 51 and 80 kg (mean: 64.7 kg). Four subjects were given 2 capsules and 5 subjects were given 4 capsules each containing 187.5 mg of S6472, 30 minutes after breakfast and supper for 5 days. Five subjects were given 1 capsule and 5 subjects were given 2 capsules each containing 250 mg of CCL 30 minutes after breakfast, lunch and supper for 5 days. The number of fecal bacteria was examined 5 days before the start of administration, the day of the start of administration, 3 and 5 days after the start of administration, and 3, 5 and 10 days after the end of administration. Concentration of CCL in feces and susceptibility of isolated fecal bacteria (at the inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml) to CCL were examined. Adverse reactions and the effects on laboratory test values were also checked. In 4 subjects receiving 375 mg of S6472 twice a day, the mean population of E. coli was 10(7)-10(9) cells/g feces on all days of observation. There was no effect on the population of Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp. Enterobacter sp. and other Enterobacteriaceae. The mean population of all Enterobacteriaceae was 10(8)-10(9) cells/g feces on all days of observation. The population of other Gram-negative bacilli did not show a consistent change, either. There was no effect on the population of Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus sp., Enterococcus, sp., Micrococcus sp., and of Candida sp. Among anaerobic bacteria, Bacteroides sp. showed the mean population of 10(10) cells/g feces on all days of examination. C. difficile was isolated from 2 subjects out of 4 at the level of 10(2)-10(3) cells/g feces 5 days after the start of administration and 3 days after the end of administration. However, there was no production of toxin in either of the 2 subjects. In another subject, C. difficile was isolated at 10(2)-10(4) cells/g feces with a toxin titre of 10(-3)-10(-4) 3 and 5 days after the start of administration and 10 days after the end of administration. The total population of anaerobic bacteria was 10(10)-10(11) cells/g feces on all days of examination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In-vitro activity of ofloxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid compared to other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Ofloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. Its activity against 900 bacterial isolates was determined. It inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica at less than or equal to 0.8 mg/l. Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus sp., Neisseria sp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. Although most staphylococcal species, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci were inhibited by 3.1 mg/l, many streptococcal species had higher MIC values, and most Bacteroides species were inhibited at less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. The overall activity of ofloxacin was similar to enoxacin and norfloxacin. Ofloxacin inhibited organisms resistant to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, cephalexin, piperacillin, and gentamicin including Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime. The activity of ofloxacin was lower at an acid pH and in urine, but serum had no effect on MICs or MBCs. Increase in ofloxacin MICs for various bacteria could be achieved by repeated subculture in the presence of ofloxacin.
TI  - [In vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. Results of a multicenter  study].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. MICs were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of Enterobacteriaceae, with mode MICs varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for Proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for Enterobacter. Only a few resistant strains were found, mainly among Enterobacter and Citrobacter. Ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter (mode MICs: 16 micrograms/ml). Haemophilus sp. and Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as Neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC less than 0.008-0.032). Ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. Enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other Streptococci and Pneumococci had low MICs (0.03-0.25). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes (Clostridium: 0.06-2, Bacteroides: 0.5-32). Our data show that its particularly strong activity against Proteus, Haemophilus and Neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other third-generation cephalosporins.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefminox].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies were performed on cefminox (CMNX, MT-141), a new  cephamycin antibiotic, and results were as follows. Antimicrobial activities. MICs of CMNX against various clinical isolates were determined with the inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. Percentages of strains susceptible to 12.5 micrograms/ml or less were 4% for S. aureus, 0% for E. faecalis, 100% for E. coli, 81% for K. pneumoniae, 3% for Enterobacter sp., 18% for S. marcescens, 90% for P. mirabilis, 88% for indole-positive Proteus sp. 100% for S. flexneri, 100% for Salmonella sp., 0% for Citrobacter sp. and 0% for P. aeruginosa. Most of those sensitive strains were inhibited by 0.39-0.78 microgram/ml. These activities were better than those of cefmetazole and cefazolin, but were not as good as those of cefoperazone. Clinical efficacy Three patients with pneumonia, 1 with pneumonia and sepsis, and 1 with urinary tract infection were treated with CMNX daily dose of 1-4 g for 7-31 days. Clinical responses were excellent in 1, good in 3, poor in 2 patients (contained a double case). Bacteriological effects were good for E. coli, K. pneumoniae and S. liquefaciens, poor for P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. C. freundii, A. calcoaceticus and E. faecalis were cultured after treatment. No side effect and no abnormal change of laboratory findings were seen in our cases.
TI  - [Effects of KS-R1 (ampicillin suppository) and ampicillin oral dosing on fecal flora of children].
AB  - A newly developed product, KS-R1 (a suppository containing 250 mg potency of ampicillin (ABPC)), was given to 7 children (5 boys and 2 girls) ranging from 4 years and 5 months to 8 years and 10 months in age, 3 times a day (average daily dose, 62.4 mg/kg) for 5 days. As a control, the same amount of ABPC dry syrup was given orally to 7 children (4 boys and 3 girls) ranging from 2 years and 8 months to 7 years and 7 months in age, 3 times a day (average daily dose, 55.3 mg/kg) for 5 days. The effects of these 2 preparations on the bacterial flora of the feces were investigated, and concentrations of ABPC in the feces and sensitivities of the isolated strains to ABPC were determined. The results were as follows. As for Gram-negative bacilli in the feces from children given KS-R1, there was no change in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp. and Enterobacter sp. which were isolated from many children 3 days after the end of treatment, but they did not show any constant pattern of change in mean number. Other species did not show any pattern of increase in the number of children from whom they were isolated, or in the number of bacteria during the course after the beginning of treatment. The total number of bacteria identified as Enterobacteriaceae was at the level of 10(8) cells/g on any day of examination. Of Gram-negative bacilli other than Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas sp. showed no constant pattern of change in number. On the other hand, of Gram-positive bacteria, there was no constant pattern of change in the number of Staphylococcus aureus, Coagulase-negative Staphylococci began to be isolated from many children 5 days after the beginning of treatment and were isolated from all children 5 days after the end of treatment, but there was no tendency for the mean number to increase. Enterococcus sp. was not isolated from 3 children 3 days after the beginning of treatment, and was decreased in number by one order in 3 out of other 4 children as compared with before-treatment. However, this species was isolated from all children 3 days after the end of treatment, and the mean number of bacteria was similar to that before-treatment although the number of bacteria was different in individual children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Sensitivity to fosfomycin of bacteria isolated at the Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital in 1982 and 1983].
AB  - Susceptibility of 16 056 strains isolated in 1982 and 1983 to fosfomycin (FOS) was tested with Mueller-Hinton medium and discs 50 micrograms FOS + 25 micrograms glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) (cutoff diameter 14 mm). For 3 411 strains, inhibition zone diameters were recorded. Almost all E. coli, Citrobacter, Salmonella and S. aureus were susceptible to FOS as well as 70% of Serratia, E. cloacae, P. mirabilis and 50% of Klebsiella and Enterobacter sp. Only 27% of P. aeruginosa, 20% of indole positive Proteus and 8% of Acinetobacter were sensitive to FOS. E. coli, Citrobacter and S. aureus seem to exhibit the highest susceptibilities to FOS. Sensitivity rates of E. cloacae, Serratia, P. aeruginosa, and especially Klebsiella seemed slightly underestimated by the disk diffusion method, but differentiation between susceptible and resistant strains was facilitated by rating as susceptible those strains with inhibition zone diameters between 12 and 14 mm. This method also seemed to underrate the sensitivity of susceptible Enterobacteriaceae, probably because of inadequate G6P concentrations at this point of the disk.
TI  - [Multicenter study of the antibacterial activity of a new cephalosporin: CM 40874].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of CM were evaluated on 2 548 bacterial strains isolated in 8 hospitals. CM demonstrated high activity on Enterobacteriaceae, the MIC being less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml for 71% of the 1 362 strains tested, less than or equal to 1 for 99.6%, and less than or equal to 4 for 99.9%. Mode MIC varies little among the different groups of Enterobacteriaceae (from 0.06 to 0.12 micrograms/ml), with the exception of Serratia sp. (mode MIC : 0.25) and Klebsiella oxytoca (mode MIC : 0.03). Most of Enterobacter, Serratia, and Citrobacter sp. strains not inhibited by cefotaxime are readily inhibited by CM at the same concentrations than susceptible strains. CM has less activity on P. aeruginosa (MIC 2-32 micrograms/ml) and Acinetobacter sp. (MIC 8-128). Staphylococci (MIC 32) and Enterococci are not susceptible. Variable activity is found against other Streptococci. CM inhibits Haemophilus sp. at MICs of 0.12 to 0.5 micrograms/ml and Gonococci at MICs of 0.03 to 0.5 (whether the strains produce beta-lactamase or not). Meningococci have a mode MIC of 0.03 micrograms/ml (range 0.008 to 0.25). Thus, CM 40874 is a new third generation cephalosporin with high activity on Enterobacteriaceae, including those strains not susceptible to cefotaxime and good activity on Haemophilus sp. and Neisseria sp. This additional activity is probably supported by enhanced resistance to enzymatic inactivation by beta-lactamases.
TI  - [Pathogen distribution in waste water sprinkler irrigation].
AB  - The spray irrigation with pretreated wastewater was investigated on the sewage farm of the Braunschweig Sewage Utilization Association. The emission of airborne bacteria was measured by means of Andersen sampler (AS), Reuter centrifugal sampler (RCS), and sedimentation plates (SP). There was a good correlation of results obtained by parallel measurings of AS and RCS. The RCS was more effective by the factor 11.5 than the AS sampling airborne microorganisms. However, the AS gaves the distribution curve of differently big airborne particulates (Table 1). The medium decrease of bacteria from the sprinkler determined by AS and SP was similar (Fig. 1). With low wind velocity, an aerosol containing enterobacteria was yet detectable at a distance of 60-160 m down-wind from the spray sprinkler. The transport of bacteria as a function of the wind velocity is given in Fig. 2 increasing about 25 m for an increase of the wind velocity of 1 m/sec. During the spray irrigation, the composition of bacteria in the airborne particles is varying continuously. The following order of succession of die-away rates was found: Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Vibrio greater than Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas greater than Enterobacter greater than Citrobacter greater than E. coli greater than Klebsiella greater than gram-positive bacteria (Table 3). Only seldom and under extreme conditions, gram-negative bacteria were detected in a range between 200-300 m beyond of concentrations as they were found also in controls without irrigation. This result substantiates a minimum protective distance of 300 m between sprinkler and human settlements.
TI  - [In vitro activity of ceftizoxime on hospital bacteria. Results of a multicenter  study].
AB  - The susceptibility to ceftizoxime of all bacterial strains isolated from seven university-affiliated hospitals over one month was tested with disk-diffusion technique. Additionally, the MIC of 1937 strains selected at random was evaluated by the agar dilution method. The majority of Enterobacteriaceae are inhibited at a concentration of less than 1 microgram/ml with a mode MIC varying from 0.008 to 0.12 among the various groups. A few Enterobacter and Citrobacter strains are resistant. Little activity was demonstrated by ceftizoxime on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter sp. (mode MIC 32 and 8 micrograms/ml respectively). Haemophilus sp. (MIC 0.01-0.03) and Neisseria (MIC less than 0,008-0,016) are very susceptible to the drug. The MIC of methicillin-sensitive strains of Staphylococcus aureus varies from 1 to 4 micrograms/ml ; Enterococci are less susceptible, whereas other Streptococci and Pneumococci have low MICs (less than 0.008-0.025). The susceptibility of anaerobic pathogens varies widely between species, and within species ; MIC ranges from 0.008 to 32 micrograms/ml for Clostridium sp. and 0.25 to 128 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides sp.
TI  - Inhibitory and bactericidal activities of amifloxacin, a new quinolone carboxylic acid, compared with those of seven other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The activity of amifloxacin, a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound, against 147 strains of microorganisms was studied and was compared with the activities of cinoxacin, trimethoprim, amikacin, and four beta-lactam antimicrobials. The minimal concentration at which 90% of strains were inhibited by amifloxacin was lowest for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp (less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml), followed by Proteus sp (less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml), Enterobacter sp and Citrobacter sp (less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml), Providencia sp (less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia sp, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var anitratus (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). When compared with the ranges of activity of seven reference antimicrobials, the range of amifloxacin activity was lowest for P aeruginosa, Citrobacter sp, Proteus sp, and A calcoaceticus var anitratus and similar to aztreonam's activity against Enterobacter sp. For amikacin-resistant P aeruginosa, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of amifloxacin ranged from 1 to 16 micrograms/ml. The MICs and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of amifloxacin were similar. For all strains tested, microbial susceptibilities to amifloxacin were greater than those to currently available oral antimicrobial drugs, such as cinoxacin and trimethoprim.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftizoxime administered twice daily in hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ceftizoxime administered twice daily were evaluated in 215 hospitalized patients with documented lower respiratory tract infections. The majority of patients received 1 to 2 gm of ceftizoxime intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours; the mean dosage was 2 gm/day, and the mean duration of therapy was 8.9 days. Clinical cure was achieved in 204 (95%) of the 215 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. One hundred and thirty-eight patients were both clinically and bacteriologically evaluable. The clinical response rates, by organism, were: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100% (50/50); Haemophilus influenzae, 96% (25/26); gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, Pseudomonas sp, Klebsiella sp, Citrobacter sp, and Morganella morganii), 86% (32/37); and Staphylococcus aureus, 92% (12/13). In the other 77 patients with clinical symptoms, no pathogen was isolated or insufficient follow-up data were collected to assess bacteriologic response. Adverse reactions, which were infrequent, were similar to those reported in other US trials of the drug. The findings indicate that ceftizoxime, 1 to 2 gm BID, is effective and safe in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized patients. This low-dose regimen can significantly reduce the cost of cephalosporin therapy.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of aztreonam: a synthetic monobactam. A comparative study  with thirteen other antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of aztreoman (SQ 26, 776), a new monocyclic beta-lactam antimicrobial agent, was determined against 1720 bacteria, all clinical isolates, and compared with that of thirteen beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics. Aztreonam inhibited 90% of Citrobacter diversus, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris and Salmonella sp. by less than or equal to 0.4 micrograms ml-1. This activity was superior to moxalactam, piperacillin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, ceftazidime and aminoglycoside antibiotics. Aztreonam was as active as moxalactam against Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Shigella species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to moxalactam, piperacillin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin and ceftazidime were inhibited by aztreonam 50% by 6.3 micrograms ml-1 and 90% by 16 micrograms ml-1. Aztreonam was as active as ceftazidime against Serratia marcescens, all strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms ml-1 and 90% by 1.6 micrograms ml-1. There was no major difference between MBC and MIC values of aztreonam and the effect of inoculum size upon MIC values was observed at 10(7) CFU.
TI  - Direct dilution sampling, quantitation, and microbial assessment of open-system ventilation circuits in intensive care units.
AB  - In a systematic approach, 37 duplicate samples of open system circuits (Bennett MA-1 ventilators) of patients in medical and surgical intensive care units were processed by direct and serial (APHA guidelines) dilutions. The paired difference test on 15 of the in-use circuitry solution samples indicated no difference between the direct and serial dilution methods (P less than 0.001). Seventy-seven additional respiratory therapy circuitry samples from similar intensive care patients were analyzed via a direct dilution method alone and processed microbiologically. The direct dilution procedure was a rapid and accurate means of evaluation of microbial contamination in the range of greater than or equal to 10 to less than or equal to 10(6) CFU/ml. High densities of organisms frequently were found. Sites of contamination included the proximal or patient end of the circuitry (heaviest), the nebulizer trap, and the distal or humidifier portions of the circuitry. The contaminants found were predominantly gram-negative nonfermenters: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. antitratus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas maltophilia, and Flavobacterium meningosepticum. Fermenters were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Enterobacter agglomerans. Infrequently, gram-positive Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. were noted.
TI  - Isolations of aerobic bacteria from wild desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni and O. c. mexicana) in Arizona.
AB  - Nasal, pharyngeal, cervical and vaginal swab specimens were obtained from 74 desert bighorn sheep for the purpose of investigating the normal aerobic bacterial flora of wild sheep. A total of 281 isolates was obtained and identified by standard microbiologic tests. One hundred seven of these isolates were gram positive and included Bacillus sp. (36%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8%), S. aureus (4%), Corynebacterium sp. (diphtheroids, 4%), and Streptococcus sp. (48%). gram negative isolates totaled 174 and included Neisseria sp. (18%), Citrobacter sp. (3%), Enterobacter sp. (2%), Escherichia coli (2%), Proteus sp. (2%) and non-fermentative bacilli (NFB) (73%). Of the NFB isolates, Pseudomonas sp. (25%), Acinetobacter sp. (18%), Moraxella sp. (15%) were identified.
TI  - Studies on well water and possible health risks in Katsina, Nigeria.
AB  - Well water was sampled from all four major wards in Katsina town. All 20 samples  taken showed high coliform counts. Sixty-five per cent contained greater than or equal to 2400 coliforms per 100 ml while the remainder had counts ranging from 79 to 920. Faecal coliforms and non-cholera vibrios were detected in all samples. There was no significant relationship between the coliform counts and the distances of latrines to wells, water table to ground level, slope relationship between wells and latrines, the pH of water and whether the wells were left permanently open or not. Salmonella sp., Enterobacter sp. and Pseudomonas sp. were each isolated from about 10% of the samples, while Proteus sp. was isolated from 40%, Citrobacter sp. 15%, Alcaligenes sp. 5% and an unidentified Gram-negative rod from 5%. Only 2 (10%) of the sampled households, representing 23 (9.6%) of the 239 people exposed to well-water had pipeborne water in addition. It was concluded that well water in Katsina town could be a human health hazard.
TI  - Plasmids encoding trimethoprim resistance in bacterial isolates from man and pigs.
AB  - Trimethoprim (Tp) resistant Gram negative bacteria were isolated from humans and  pigs. The bacterial hosts were characterized by their resistance pattern and biotype. The presence of transferable Tp plasmids was demonstrated in 86% of 59 porcine isolates and 37% of 49 human isolates. The Tp R-plasmids carried a diversity of resistance determinants such as Tc, Cm, Sp, Sm and Su. Incompatibility tests distinguished two major groups, Inc FIV and Inc N. Thirty of 99 Tp R-plasmids isolated from humans were grouped as Inc FIV and eight as Inc N. The results of molecular weight determination of Tp R-plasmids performed by agarose gel electrophoresis were consistent with the existence of two groups--larger R-plasmids (76 to 104 Md) belonging to Inc FIV and lower molecular weight R-plasmids (25 to 35 Md) belonging to Inc N. Results from this study indicate that the Tp R-plasmids isolated in Perth have evolved independently from those described in Europe and the United Kingdom. There is also evidence for their local spread between Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter and Acinetobacter from man and animals.
TI  - [Enterococci and coliforms in yellow sheep cheese].
AB  - The developmental dynamic of enterococci and coliforms was followed up in the entire technologic process and the storage of kashkaval (yellow cheese of ewe milk) under the conditions of modern industrial production. It was found that during the whole industrial cycle up to the steam cooking of curd the amount of enterococci grew and reached its peak value in the cheddarized cheese curd (2.4--30 million per gram), increasing from 10 to 34 times as against its level in the initial milk used. The coliform bacteria also rose in number, and their amount reached maximum values of 10 to 120 mill/g in the processed and dipped curd, after which a slowly advancing reduction set in. Species of the Enterobacter (55.1%), Escherichia (14.1%), Citrobacter (19.2%), and Klebsiella (11.5%) genera were isolated. The steam cooking of cheddarized curd produced an unfavourable effect on enterococci (pasteurization effect of up to 98.3 to 99.9%) and a lethal effect on the coliforms. Enterococci that resisted steaming multiplied in kashkaval and reached their highest level--960 000 up to 39 mill/g--between the 30th and the 60th day of production after which their numbers dropped. Their amount in the ripened product varied from 95000 to 17.8 mill/g, and on the 240th following production--from below 100 to 1.6 mill/g. Coliform bacteria were not found in 0.1 g of the product mass during ripening and storage of kashkaval. Out of the 196 strains that were differentiated as enterococci 30.7 per cent of the fecalis subgroup, and 69.3 per cent--of the Sp. faecium-durans subgroup. After steaming 92.3 per cent of the strains were of the Str. faecium and Str. durans species.
TI  - Hand carriage of aerobic Gram-negative rods by health care personnel.
AB  - A quantitative culture technique (hand washed in a glove containing broth for 30  s) was used to determine the frequency of hand carriage of aerobic Gram-negative rods by various groups of health care workers and 104 control subjects. Overall, 31% of health care workers carried aerobic Gram-negative rods on their hands compared to 59% of control subjects (P < 0.001). Enterobacter agglomerans accounted for 40% of the isolates, and other Enterobacter spp. 7%. Other organisms included Acinetobacter calcoaceticus 21%, Serratia spp. 11%, Klebsiella spp. 10%, Moraxella spp. 3%, Pseudomonas spp. 3%, Proteus spp. 1.5%, Escherichia coli 1%; Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, Aeromonas sp. and an isolate that was not speciated accounted for 0.5% each. We conclude that endemic hand carriage of aerobic Gram-negative rods by health care personnel is common, but significantly less than that of control subjects. Enterobacter agglomerans is found so frequently on the hands of control subjects that it must be considered part of the normal hand flora.
TI  - Reliability of early identifications obtained with Enterobacteriaceae-plus biochemical cards in the automicrobic system.
AB  - The AutoMicrobic system (AMS) is capable of identifying most Enterobacteriaceae within 8 h and many glucose-nonfermenting, gram-negative bacilli after 13 h of incubation. Early preliminary results can be readily obtained from the computer as the tests incubate. Data with 1,023 bacterial isolates were reviewed to determine the relative accuracy of 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and 13-h identifications. All AutoMicrobic system identifications with probability (P) values of less than 0.80 were considered equivocal responses which needed supplementary tests before a final report could be issued. Analysis of our data suggests that early identifications of Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter sp., Yersinia spp., Salmonella spp. (other than Salmonella typhi), Shigella spp. (other than Shigella sonnei), Enterobacter agglomerans, Pseudomonas spp. (other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Pseudomonas maltophilia), Klebsiella spp. (other than Klebsiella pneumoniae or Klebsiella oxytoca), Citrobacter amalonauticus, Serratia liquefaciens, or Vibrio spp. Should be considered nonspecific responses, even when P greater than or equal to 0.80. Other identifications reported after 4 h were 96% accurate. At least half of our isolates (60% of our Enterobacteriaceae) could be identified reliably within 4 h, the remaining isolates required longer incubation.
TI  - In vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. We examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including anaerobic species. It inhibited 90% (MIC90) of strains of Escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, Klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Salmonella and Shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, Citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, Enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and Enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. The MICs of Proteus mirabilis, Morganella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, and Providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 of Serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of Acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the MIC50, the MIC75, and the MIC90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC50 of Pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the MIC90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. Yersinia, Arizona, and Aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was Campylobacter. The activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the MIC90s of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. All Listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. The activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, pH, or inoculum size. There was no major difference between MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration values. Norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
TI  - Pulmonary toxicity of endotoxins: comparison of lipopolysaccharides from various  bacterial species.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides from three gram-negative bacteria isolated from bale cotton and piggery air were analyzed for their chemical composition, and their pulmonary toxicity for guinea pigs, lethal toxicity for mice, and pyrogenicity for rabbits were measured. Lipopolysaccharides from Enterobacter agglomerans and Citrobacter freundii had closely related chemical compositions; both were pyrogenic for rabbits and caused a dose-dependent influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the airways of guinea pigs. The lethal toxicities of these lipopolysaccharides in mice were comparable to that of Salmonella typhimurium lipopolysaccharide, which was used as a reference. Lipopolysaccharide from Agrobacterium sp. was chemically different from those of E. agglomerans and C. freundii, did not induce any influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and was only weakly toxic or pyrogenic. The low biological activity of the agrobacterial lipopolysaccharide may be due to its different chemical composition.
TI  - Poly(adenylic acid) in small amounts, free or covalently linked to substrate, protects RNA from hydrolysis by ribonuclease.
AB  - Short lengths (18 residues) of poly(A), covalently linked to the 3'-termini of Escherichia coli 5 S rRNA, induce powerful inhibitions (38-87%) of the activities of RNAases (ribonucleases) from Citrobacter sp., Enterobacter sp., bovine pancreas, human spleen and human plasma. As the polypurine chain length is extended, enzyme activity declines. Furthermore, poly(A) sequences, present only on a small subpopulation of RNA, and accounting for less than 1% of total RNA, serve to protect all RNA, polyadenylated or not, from enzyme-catalysed degradation. The quantity of 3'-terminal adenylic acid residues, relative to the amount of substrate, determines enzyme activity. The exact distribution of a fixed amount of poly(A) residues on the 3'-termini of substrate molecules is unimportant in this respect. Comparison of the efficacies of inhibition of RNAase activity, by using linked poly(A) and similar quantities of free poly(A), revealed that although the free polypurine inhibits RNAase activity, covalent linkage of poly(A) to RNA is more advantageous to the stability of an RNA substrate. However, the ratio of inhibited activities obtained by using linked or free poly(A) may change considerably with alterations in either substrate concentration or polyadenylic acid segment length.
TI  - Homology of the gene coding for outer membrane lipoprotein within various Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The mRNA for a major outer membrane lipoprotein from Escherichia coli was found to hybridize specifically with one of the EcoRI and one of the HindIII restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of total DNA from nine bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae: E. coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter aerogenes, Edwardsiella tarda, Serratia marcescens, and Erwinia amylovora. However, among the Enterobacteriaceae, DNA from two species of Proteus (P. mirabilis and P. morganii) did not contain any restriction endonuclease fragments that hybridized with the E. coli lipoprotein mRNA. Furthermore, no hybrid bands were detected in four other gram-negative bacteria outside the family Enterobacteriaceae: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp. HO1-N, Caulobacter crescentus, and Myxococcus xanthus. Envelope fractions from all bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae tested above cross-reacted with antiserum against the purified E. coli free-form lipoprotein in the Ouchterlony immunodiffusion test. Both species of Proteus, however, gave considerably weaker precipitation lines, in comparison with the intense lines produced by the other members of the family. All of the above four bacteria outside the family Enterobacteriaceae did not cross-react with anti-E. coli lipoprotein serum. From these results, the rate of evolutionary changes in the lipoprotein gene seems to be closely related to that observed for various soluble enzymes of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Combined activitiy of clavulanic acid and ticarcillin against ticarcillin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - Fifty-one clinical isolates of ticarcillin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli were  tested for susceptibility to combinations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid (BRL 14151), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured by a microdilution method, and minimal bactericidal concentrations for selected strains were measured by the broth dilution method. Ticarcillin MICs were >/=128 mug/ml for all and >/=512 mug/ml for 38 (75%) of the strains. Thirty-nine strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested included Escherichia coli (14), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16), Citrobacter sp. (3), Enterobacter sp. (3), Salmonella enteritidis (1), Serratia marcescens (1), and Proteus mirabilis (1). Ticarcillin MICs for 34 strains (88%) were lowered at least threefold by the addition of 1.0 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. Against 33 strains (85%), the MICs were 64 mug or less per ml in the presence of 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. In contrast, the MICs for seven of eight strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were unaffected by the addition of up to 10 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. Ticarcillin with 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml was bactericidal against ticarcillin-resistant (MIC >/= 2,048 mug/ml) E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter, and P. mirabilis.
TI  - [In vitro examination on antibacterial activities of broad-spectrum antibiotics against gram-negative clinical isolates (author's transl)].
AB  - In vitro studies were undertaken on clinically isolated strains of various bacteria to examine the antibacterial activity of ampicillin (AB-PC), carbenicillin (CB-PC), sulbenicillin (SB-PC) cephalothin (CET), cefazolin (CEZ) and gentamicin (GM). Fifty three % of Escherichia coli strains 53.3% of Citrobacter sp., 80% of Proteus mirabilis, 42.9% of Morganella and 80% of Bacteroides sp. were susceptible (MIC being not higher than 12.5 mug/ml) to AB-PC. The eight other species were not so susceptible to this penicillin. CB-PC and SB-PC were almost as effective as AB-PC against Escherichia coli and Citrobacter sp. They were less active against Klebsiella sp., but more active against Enterobacter sp., Serratia sp., indole-positive Proteus group and Pseudomonas sp. than AB-PC, SB-PC was more effective than CB-PC against Pseudomonas sp. The strains of Pseudomonas sp. which were resistant to higher concentrations of CB-PC and SB-PC were pyocyanine-negative strains. All strains (100%) of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp. and Citrobacter sp. were susceptible to CET and CEZ, while none of Enterobacter sp. , Serratia sp., Proteus vulgaris. Morganella, Rettgerella, Providencia and Pseudomonas sp. were susceptible to these cephalosporins. The MICs of CET and CEZ against Bacteroides sp. were moderately low. Some strains of Providencia and Alkaligenes sp. were resistant of GM but the other 10 species were not resistant to this antibiotic, though it showed comparatively high MICs against Bacteroides sp. When seen from the MIC distribution of each antibiotic, there was a tendency that the strains isolated from the pus were more resistant than those isolated from the other sources (urine, sputum and bile).
TI  - Susceptibility of clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin.
AB  - The susceptibility of 4,929 unselected clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin was determined by the single-disk method, using a computer-associated electronic zone analyzer to obtain, record, and process measurements of sizes of zones of inhibition. Both cefoxitin and cephalothin were effective against most gram-positive strains, including Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, micrococci, and all streptococci except enterococci. The three strains of Listeria monocytogenes tested were susceptible to cephalothin but resistant to cefoxitin. There was little difference between the cefoxitin and cephalothin susceptibility of Salmonellae, Citrobacter sp., Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas sp. Cefoxitin was more effective then cephalothin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Serratia sp., indole-positive Proteus sp., Providence sp., Flavobacter sp., Herellea vaginicola, and Mima polymorpha. Cefoxitin also appeared to exhibit enhanced activity, as compared with cephalothin, against Bacteroides sp. Thus cefoxitin appears to have a very broad antibacterial spectrum which is greater than that of cephalothin, especially against gram-negative strains.
