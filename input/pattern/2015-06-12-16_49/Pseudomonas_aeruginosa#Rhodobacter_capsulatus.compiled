TI  - Control of lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis by FtsH-mediated proteolysis of LpxC is conserved in enterobacteria but not in all gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Despite the essential function of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in Gram-negative bacteria, it is largely unknown how the exact amount of this molecule in the outer membrane is controlled. The first committed step in LPS biosynthesis is catalyzed by the LpxC enzyme. In Escherichia coli, the cellular concentration of LpxC is adjusted by the only essential protease in this organism, the membrane-anchored metalloprotease FtsH. Turnover of E. coli LpxC requires a length- and sequence-specific C-terminal degradation signal. LpxC proteins from Salmonella, Yersinia, and Vibrio species carry similar C-terminal ends and, like the E. coli enzyme, were degraded by FtsH. Although LpxC proteins are highly conserved in Gram-negative bacteria, there are striking differences in their C termini. The Aquifex aeolicus enzyme, which is devoid of the C-terminal extension, was stable in E. coli, whereas LpxC from the alphaproteobacteria Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Rhodobacter capsulatus was degraded by the Lon protease. Proteolysis of the A. tumefaciens protein required the C-terminal end of LpxC. High stability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa LpxC in E. coli and P. aeruginosa suggested that Pseudomonas uses a proteolysis-independent strategy to control its LPS content. The differences in LpxC turnover along with previously reported differences in susceptibility against antimicrobial compounds have important implications for the potential of LpxC as a drug target.
TI  - A new system for heterologous expression of membrane proteins: Rhodospirillum rubrum.
AB  - Heterologous expression of membrane proteins has met with only limited success. This work presents a new host/vector system for the production of heterologous membrane proteins based on a mutant of the facultatively phototrophic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum. Under certain growth conditions, R. rubrum forms an intracytoplasmic membrane (ICM) that houses the photosynthetic apparatus, the structural proteins of which are encoded by puhA and pufBALM. The mutant R. rubrum H2, which was constructed by allelic exchange deleting puhA and pufBALM, does not form ICM. This strain was used as a host for a plasmid expressing the Pseudomonas aeruginosa membrane protein MscL from the Rhodobacter capsulatus puc promoter. ICM was formed in the H2 strain producing MscL but not in the vector control strain. These results suggest that a heterologous membrane protein stimulates ICM formation in R. rubrum and indicate that the capacity to form an ICM that can accommodate heterologous proteins makes R. rubrum a host that will be useful for membrane protein production. P. aeruginosa MscL, which forms inclusion bodies when produced in Escherichia coli, was expressed in R. rubrum H2 and purified from membranes with a yield of 22.8-23.4 mg/L culture (5.53-5.60 mg/g cell paste). Additionally Streptomyces lividans KcsA and P. aeruginosa CycB were produced and purified from R. rubrum H2 with yields of 13.7-14.4 mg/L culture (2.19-2.55 mg/g cell paste) and 6.6-7.4 mg/L culture (1.1-1.2mg/g cell paste), respectively.
TI  - Characterization of the interaction of Rhodobacter capsulatus cytochrome c peroxidase with charge reversal mutants of cytochrome c(2).
AB  - Steady-state kinetics for the reaction of Rhodobacter capsulatus bacterial cytochrome c peroxidase (BCCP) with its substrate cytochrome c(2) were investigated. The Rb. capsulatus BCCP is dependent on calcium for activation as previously shown for the Pseudomonas aeruginosa BCCP and Paracoccus denitrificans enzymes. Furthermore, the activity shows a bell-shaped pH dependence with optimum at pH 7.0. Enzyme activity is greatest at low ionic strength and drops off steeply as ionic strength increases, resulting in an apparent interaction domain charge product of -13. All cytochromes c(2) show an asymmetric distribution of surface charge, with a concentration of 14 positive charges near the exposed heme edge of Rb. capsulatus c(2) which potentially may interact with approximately 6 negative charges, localized near the edge of the high-potential heme of the Rb. capsulatus BCCP. To test this proposal, we constructed charge reversal mutants of the 14 positively charged residues located on the front face of Rb. capsulatus cytochrome c(2) and examined their effect on steady-state kinetics with BCCP. Mutated residues in Rb. capsulatus cytochrome c(2) that showed the greatest effects on binding and enzyme activity are K12E, K14E, K54E, K84E, K93E, and K99E, which is consistent with the site of electron transfer being located at the heme edge. We conclude that a combination of long-range, nonspecific electrostatic interactions as well as localized salt bridges between, e.g., cytochrome c(2) K12, K14, K54, and K99 with BCCP D194, D241, and D6, account for the observed kinetics.
TI  - Characterization of cytochrome c-556 from the purple phototrophic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus as a cytochrome-c peroxidase.
AB  - A cytochrome c-556 was purified from Rhodobacter capsulatus and the complete amino acid sequence was determined. It contains 328 amino acid residues and two typical heme-binding sites at cysteine residues 54 and 57 and at residues 200 and 203. It is homologous to the family of bacterial cytochrome c peroxidases (BCCP) with 69% identity to Paracoccus denitrificans BCCP and 60% identity to Pseudomonas aeruginosa BCCP for which there is a three-dimensional structure. There is lesser similarity to the mauG gene products from methylotrophic bacteria which are thought to be involved in biosynthesis of the quinone cofactor of methylamine dehydrogenase. Translated genes from Escherichia coli and Helicobacter pylori are also related to the bacterial cytochrome c peroxidases. The divergence of this family of proteins is reflected in the fact that the reported sixth heme ligands are not conserved, except in Pseudomonas, Rhodobacter and Paracoccus. This suggests that homologs of BCCP may fold differently and/or may not have the same enzymatic activity as the prototypic protein from Ps. aeruginosa. We found that the Rb. capsulatus BCCP is active with both Rb. capsulatus cytochrome c2 and with horse cytochrome c as substrates (Km values 60 microm and 6 microm, respectively). The turnover number was 40 s(-1) and the Km for peroxide was 33 microm. We have thus confirmed that the Rb. capsulatus protein is a cytochrome c peroxidase.
TI  - The ccoNOQP gene cluster codes for a cb-type cytochrome oxidase that functions in aerobic respiration of Rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  - The genes for a new type of a haem-copper cytochrome oxidase were cloned from Rhodobacter capsulatus strain 37b4, using the Bradyrhizobium japonicum fixNOQP gene region as a hybridizing probe. Four genes, probably organized in an operon (ccoNOQP), were identified; their products share extensive amino acid sequence similarity with the FixN, O, Q and P proteins that have recently been shown to be the subunits of a cb-type oxidase. CcoN is a b-type cytochrome, CcoO and CcoP are membrane-bound mono- and dihaem c-type cytochromes and CcoQ is a small membrane protein of unknown function. Genes for a similar oxidase are also present in other non-rhizobial bacterial species such as Azotobacter vinelandii, Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as revealed by polymerase chain reaction analysis. A ccoN mutant was constructed whose phenotype, in combination with the structural information on the gene products, provides evidence that the CcoNOQP oxidase is a cytochrome c oxidase of the cb type, which supports aerobic respiration in R. capsulatus and which is probably identical to the cbb3-type oxidase that was recently purified from a different strain of the same species. Mutant analysis also showed that this oxidase has no influence on photosynthetic growth and nitrogen-fixation activity.
TI  - The IHF proteins of Rhodobacter capsulatus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The binding properties of the two IHF consensus sequences present in the promoter region of the hydrogenase structural operon, hupSL, of Rhodobacter capsulatus were studied by gel retardation assays using the heterodimeric IHF-like proteins isolated from R capsulatus, from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and from Escherichia coli. The three IHF proteins bound preferentially to the IHF consensus proximal to hupS. The three-dimensional structure of R capsulatus IHF was modeled using a computer-based amino acid replacement strategy and the known coordinates of crystallized HU protein (HBS) from Bacillus stearothermophilus. Double-stranded DNA and the interaction of IHF and DNA were then modeled using the molecular modeling package Quanta 3.3, and taking into account foot-printing data obtained with IHF-DNA complexes and the fact that the replacement of Arg8 by Cys8 in the alpha subunit, the product of himA, renders R capsulatus IHF ineffective in the activation of hydrogenase synthesis. In this model, IHF is shown to interact with DNA bent by 140 degrees, and Arg8 of HimA capable of interacting with the phosphate-ribose backbone of DNA in the flanking region of the IHF binding site.
TI  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa contains an IHF-like protein that binds to the algD promoter.
AB  - An IHF-like protein has been purified from a Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain isolated from a cystic fibrosis patient, by the rapid purification method described for the isolation of IHF from Rhodobacter capsulatus. The IHF of P. aeruginosa is an alpha beta heterodimer (subunits of 10 and 11 kDa) similar to IHF from Escherichia coli and from R. capsulatus; the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the isolated subunits share a high degree of identity with their homologs from E. coli. P. aeruginosa IHF is able to bind to the promoter of the hydrogenase structural genes (hupSL) of R. capsulatus as do the other two IHF proteins. It is also demonstrated by gel retardation assays that P. aeruginosa IHF forms a stable complex with the algD promoter in vitro, an indication that the protein is involved in the regulation of algD gene expression in P. aeruginosa.
