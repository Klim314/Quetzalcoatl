TI  == isolation and characterization of an agaro-oligosaccharide (ao)-hydrolyzing bacterium from the gut microflora of chinese individuals.
AB  == agarose (ap) from red algae has a long history as food ingredients in east asia.  agaro-oligosaccharides (ao) derived from ap have shown potential prebiotic effects. however, the human gut microbes responsible for the degradation of ao and ap have not yet been fully investigated. here, we reported that ao and ap can be degraded and utilized at various rates by fecal microbiota obtained from different individuals. bacteroides uniformis l8 isolated from human feces showed  a pronounced ability to degrade ao and generate d-galactose as its final end product. pcr-dgge analysis showed b. uniformis to be common in the fecal samples, but only b. uniformis l8 had the ability to degrade ao. a synergistic strain, here classified as escherichia coli b2, was also identified because it could utilize the d-galactose as the growth substrate. the cross-feeding interaction between b. uniformis l8 and e. coli b2 led to exhaustion of the ao supply. bifidobacterium infantis and bifidobacterium adolescentis can utilize one of the  intermediates of ao hydrolysis, agarotriose. growth curves indicated that ao was  the substrate that most favorably sustained the growth of b. uniformis l8. in contrast, kappa-carrageenan oligosaccharides (kco), guluronic acid oligosaccharides (go), and mannuronic acid oligosaccharides (mo) were found to be unusable to b. uniformis l8. current results indicate that b. uniformis l8 is a special degrader of ao in the gut microbiota. because b. uniformis can mitigate high-fat-diet-induced metabolic disorders, further study is required to determine the potential applications of ao.

TI  == disrupted intestinal microbiota and intestinal inflammation in children with cystic fibrosis and its restoration with lactobacillus gg: a randomised clinical  trial.
AB  == background & aims: intestinal inflammation is a hallmark of cystic fibrosis (cf). administration of probiotics can reduce intestinal inflammation and the incidence of pulmonary exacerbations. we investigated the composition of intestinal microbiota in children with cf and analyzed its relationship with intestinal inflammation. we also investigated the microflora structure before and after lactobacillus gg (lgg) administration in children with cf with and without antibiotic treatment. methods: the intestinal microbiota were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). intestinal inflammation was assessed by measuring fecal calprotectin (clp) and rectal nitric oxide (rno) production in children with cf as compared with healthy controls. we  then carried out a small double-blind randomized clinical trial with lgg. results: twenty-two children with cf children were enrolled in the study (median  age, 7 years; range, 2-9 years). fecal clp and rno levels were higher in children with cf than in healthy controls (184+/-146 microg/g vs. 52+/-46 microg/g; 18+/-15 vs. 2.6+/-1.2 micromol/l no2 (-), respectively; p<0.01). compared with healthy controls, children with cf had significantly different intestinal microbial core structures. the levels of eubacterium rectale, bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium catenulatum, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were reduced in children with cf. a similar but more extreme pattern was observed in children with cf who were taking antibiotics. lgg administration reduced fecal clp and partially restored intestinal microbiota. there was a significant correlation between reduced microbial richness and intestinal inflammation. conclusions: cf causes qualitative and quantitative changes in intestinal microbiota, which may represent a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of cf. administration of probiotics restored gut microbiota, supporting the efficacy of probiotics in reducing intestinal inflammation and pulmonary exacerbations. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct 01961661.

TI  == ethnic diversity of gut microbiota: species characterization of bacteroides fragilis group and genus bifidobacterium in healthy belgian adults, and comparison with data from japanese subjects.
AB  == the composition of the human gut microbiota is related to host health, and it is  thought that dietary habits may play a role in shaping this composition. here, we examined the population size and prevalence of six predominant bacterial genera and the species compositions of genus bifidobacterium (g-bifid) and bacteroides fragilis group (g-bfra) in 42 healthy belgian adults by quantitative pcr (qpcr) over a period of one month. the population sizes and prevalence of these bacteria were basically stable throughout the study period. the predominant g-bifid species were bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium longum ss. longum,  and the predominant g-bfra species were bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides uniformis, and bacteroides ovatus. the belgian gut microbiota data were then compared with gut microbiota data from 46 japanese subjects collected according to the same protocol (matsuki et al., appl. environ. microbiol. 70, 167-173, 2004). the population size and prevalence of bifidobacterium catenulatum group were significantly lower in the belgian gut microbiota than in the japanese gut microbiota (p < 0.001); however, the population size and prevalence of g-bifid did not differ. this species-level qpcr analysis will be helpful for investigating the diversity of gut microbiota among ethnic groups.

TI  == intestinal bacteroides species associated with coeliac disease.
AB  == aims: to characterise the predominant species of bacterial populations associated with duodenal biopsies of paediatric patients with active and treated coeliac disease. methods: 20 biopsy specimens from patients with active coeliac disease,  12 from patients with treated coeliac disease, and eight from age-matched controls were evaluated for comparative purposes. bacteroides, bifidobacterium and lactic acid bacteria (lab) populations were analysed by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis using group-specific primers. results: bacteroides diversity was higher in biopsy specimens from controls than in those from patients with active and treated coeliac disease. bacteroides distasonis, bacteroides fragilis/bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides ovatus were more abundant in controls than in patients with coeliac disease (p<0.05). bacteroides vulgatus was more frequently detected in controls than in patients with treated coeliac disease (p<0.01). bacteroides dorei was more common in patients with active coeliac disease than in those with treated coeliac disease and control children (p<0.01). bifidobacterium diversity was higher in patients with coeliac disease than in controls. bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis were more prevalent in patients with active coeliac disease than in patients with treated coeliac disease and control children. a higher lab diversity was found in patients with treated coeliac disease and controls than in patients with active coeliac disease. weissella spp and lactobacillus fermentum were more frequently detected  in patients with treated coeliac disease than in controls and patients with active coeliac disease. conclusions: bacteroides, bifidobacterium and lab populations in the duodenum of spanish children with typical coeliac disease (active and treated) and controls differ in diversity and species composition; this could contribute to features of the disease.

TI  == comparison of the fecal microflora in rural japanese and urban canadians.
AB  == the fecal microflora of nine rural healthy japanese and eight urban healthy canadians was examined. the two populations ate typical japanese and western diets, respectively. the numbers of eubacteria (p less than 0.01), bifidobacteria (p less than 0.05), bacilli (p less than 0.01), lactobacilli and veillonellae and the frequency of occurrence of bifidobacteria were higher in the japanese than in the canadians. higher numbers of bacteroides and lecithinase-negative clostridia  were found in the canadians. twenty-three genera and over 75 species or biovars were isolated from the feces of japanese and 18 genera and over 66 species or biovars from the canadians. the numbers of bacteroides vulgatus (p less than 0.05), clostridium coccides (p less than 0.001), and c. tertium (p less than 0.05) and the incidence of b. uniformis (p less than 0.01), c. innocuum (p less than 0.05), and bacillus spp. (p less than 0.01) were significantly lower in the  japanese than in the canadians. in contrast, the numbers of eubacterium aerofaciens (p less than 0.001), and the incidence of bifidobacterium adolescentis biovar b (p less than 0.01) and bacillus subtilis (p less than 0.01) were significantly higher in the japanese than in the canadians. these findings suggest that significant reductions in anaerobic gram-positive bacilli and increased numbers of bacteroides and clostridia in the feces were induced by the  intake of a western diet.
