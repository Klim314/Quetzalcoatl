TI  == tyrosine aminotransferase catalyzes the final step of methionine recycling in klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == an aminotransferase which catalyzes the final step in methionine recycling from methylthioadenosine, the conversion of alpha-ketomethiobutyrate to methionine, has been purified from klebsiella pneumoniae and characterized. the enzyme was found to be a homodimer of 45-kda subunits, and it catalyzed methionine formation primarily using aromatic amino acids and glutamate as the amino donors. histidine, leucine, asparagine, and arginine were also functional amino donors but to a lesser extent. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme was determined and found to be almost identical to the n-terminal sequence of both the escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium tyrosine aminotransferases (tyrb  gene products). the structural gene for the tyrosine aminotransferase was cloned  from k. pneumoniae and expressed in e. coli. the deduced amino acid sequence displayed 83, 80, 38, and 34% identity to the tyrosine aminotransferases from e.  coli, s. typhimurium, paracoccus denitrificans, and rhizobium meliloti, respectively, but it showed less than 13% identity to any characterized eukaryotic tyrosine aminotransferase. structural motifs around key invariant residues placed the k. pneumoniae enzyme within the ia subfamily of aminotransferases. kinetic analysis of the aminotransferase showed that reactions of an aromatic amino acid with alpha-ketomethiobutyrate and of glutamate with alpha-ketomethiobutyrate proceed as favorably as the well-known reactions of tyrosine with alpha-ketoglutarate and tyrosine with oxaloacetate normally associated with tyrosine aminotransferases. the aminotransferase was inhibited by the aminooxy compounds canaline and carboxymethoxylamine but not by substrate analogues, such as nitrotyrosine or nitrophenylalanine.

TI  == mutants defective in the energy-conserving nadh dehydrogenase of salmonella typhimurium identified by a decrease in energy-dependent proteolysis after carbon starvation.
AB  == nadh dehydrogenase is the first component of the respiratory chain. it transfers  electrons from nadh to ubiquinone and concomitantly establishes a proton motive force across the membrane. salmonella typhimurium mutants defective in this enzyme were isolated in a screen for strains with increased expression of beta-galactosidase from a hema-lacz protein fusion. this unexpected phenotype results from stabilization of the hybrid protein during carbon starvation and is  apparently due to an energy requirement for proteolytic attack. sequence analysis of dna fragments cloned from an insertion mutant indicates that s. typhimurium has a large cluster of genes encoding the energy-conserving nadh dehydrogenase, similar to one recently described in paracoccus denitrificans. these findings establish the potential for genetic analysis of a complex enzyme whose function,  especially in proton efflux, is poorly understood.
