TI  == hydrogen production from glucose by anaerobes.
AB  == various anaerobes were cultivated in media containing glucose. when 100 ml of thioglycollate medium containing 2.0% (w/v) glucose was used, clostridium butyricum atcc 859, nbrc 3315, and nbrc 13949 evolved 227-243 ml of biogas containing about 180 ml of hydrogen in 1 day. although some strains had some resistance against oxygen, c. butyricum atcc 859 and 860 did not have it. c. butyricum nbrc 3315 and enterobacter aerogenes nbrc 13534 produced hydrogen in the presence of glucose or pyruvic acid, and e. aerogenes nbrc 13534 produced hydrogen by not only glucose and pyruvic acid but also dextrin, sucrose, maltose, galactose, fructose, mannose, and mannitol. when a medium containing 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract and 2.0% (w/v) glucose was used, e. aerogenes nbrc 13534 evolved more biogas and hydrogen than c. butyricum nbrc 3315 in the absence of reducing agent.

TI  == continuous hydrogen production from organic waste.
AB  == the antibiotic effects of lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus paracasei, on hydrogen production were investigated using glucose as the substrate for the batch experiments. the effects of lactic acid bacteria on hydrogen fermentation depended on ph and the inhibition of hydrogen-producing bacteria was prevented by keeping the ph over 5.0. then, a continuous hydrogen production experiment was conducted by using bean curd manufacturing waste as an actual organic waste at ph 5.5 at 35 degrees c. the increase of the substrate concentration and the addition of nitrogen gave precedence to acetic and butyric acids production in the metabolic pathway and suppressed propionic acid production. as the result, continuous hydrogen production from municipal organic waste was enabled.
