TI  == molecular characterization of lactobacillus plantarum dmdl 9010, a strain with efficient nitrite degradation capacity.
AB  == nitrites commonly found in food, especially in fermented vegetables, are potential carcinogens. therefore, limiting nitrites in food is critically important for food safety. a lactobacillus strain (lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010) was previously isolated from fermented vegetables by our group, and is not yet fully characterized. a number of phenotypical and genotypical approaches were employed to characterize lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010. its nitrite degradation capacity was compared with four other lactobacillus strains, including lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus 719, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricu 1.83, streptococcus thermophilus 1.204, and lactobacillus plantarum 8140, on mrs medium. compared to these four lactobacillus strains, lactobacillus  sp. dmdl 9010 had a significantly higher nitrite degradation capacity (p<0.001).  based on 16s rdna sequencing and sequence comparison, lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010 was identified as either lactobacillus plantarum or lactobacillus pentosus. to further identify this strain, the flanking regions (922 bp and 806 bp upstream and downstream, respectively) of the l-lactate dehydrogenase 1 (l-ldh1) gene were amplified and sequenced. lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010 had 98.92 and 76.98% sequence identity in the upstream region with l. plantarum wcfs1 and l. pentosus  ig1, respectively, suggesting that lactobacillu sp. dmdl 9010 is an l. plantarum  strain. it was therefore named l. plantarum dmdl 9010. our study provides a platform for genetic engineering of l. plantarum dmdl 9010, in order to further improve its nitrite degradation capacity.

TI  == local probiotic therapy for vaginal candida albicans infections.
AB  == the high rate of vaginal candida albicans recurrence is attributed to azole resistance rates as high as 15 %. the aim of this study was to determine the clinical and microbiological efficacy of standard azole therapy for treatment of  vaginal c. albicans infection alone and in combination with local probiotic as well as the effects on vaginal microbiota. this study included 436 women with vaginal candidiasis randomly assigned to two treatment groups. the first group, with 207 patients (12 dropouts), was administered 150 mg fluconazole and a single vaginal globule of fenticonazole (600 mg) on the same day. the second group of 209 patients (8 dropouts) followed the same treatment schedule; however, ten applications of a vaginal probiotic containing lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus, and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus were  also administered beginning the fifth day after azole treatment. microbiological  analysis of the therapy efficacy in the first treatment group showed c. albicans  resistance in over 30 % of patients. clinical complaints persisted after treatment administration in 79.7 % (n = 165) of women in this group. clinical complaints in the second group decreased to 31.1 % (n = 65) and microbiological efficacy also improved among investigated parameters, from 93.7 % (n = 193) to 95.2 % (n = 198). the local application of probiotics after administration of combined azoles for treatment of vaginal c. albicans infections increases therapy efficacy and could prevent relapse.

TI  == new lactic acid bacterial strains from traditional mongolian fermented milk products have altered adhesion to porcine gastric mucin depending on the carbon source.
AB  == attachment of lactic acid bacteria to the mucosal surface of the gastrointestinal tract is a major property of probiotics. here, we examined the ability of 21 lactic acid bacterial strains isolated from traditional fermented milk products in mongolia to adhere to porcine gastric mucin in vitro. higher attachment was observed with lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains 6-8 and 8-1 than with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (positive control). lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris strain 7-1 adhered to mucin as effectively as did strain gg. heat inactivation decreased the adhesive ability of strains 6-8 and 8-1 but did not affect strain 7-1. the adhesion of strains 6-8, 7-1 and 8-1 was significantly inhibited when the cells were pretreated with periodate and trypsin, indicating that proteinaceous and carbohydrate-like cell surface compounds are involved in the adhesion of these strains. the adhesion of strain 7-1 was affected by the type of carbohydrate present in the growth medium, being higher with fructose than with lactose, galactose or xylose as the carbon source. the sugar content of 7-1 cells grown on various carbohydrates was negatively correlated with its adhesive ability. we provide new probiotic candidate strains and new information  regarding carbohydrate preference that influences lactic acid bacterial adhesion  to mucin.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the probiotic and functional potential of lactobacillus strains isolated from fermented food and human intestine.
AB  == this study aims to evaluate the functional and probiotic characteristics of eight indigenous lactobacillus strains in vitro. the selected lactobacilli include strains of lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. all strains tolerated both ph 2 for 3 h and 1% bile salt for 24 h. the strains cicc 23174 and cgmcc 1.557 were the most adhesive strains producing the highest quantity of eps. although a wide variation in the ability of the eight strains to deplete cholesterol and nitrite, antagonize pathogens, scavenge free radical, and stimulate innate immune response were observed, the strains cicc 23174 and cgmcc 1.557 showed the widest range of these useful traits. taken together, the strains cicc 23174 and cgmcc 1.557 exhibited the best probiotic properties with the potential for use in the production of probiotic fermented foods.

TI  == co-culture fermentation of peanut-soy milk for the development of a novel functional beverage.
AB  == most of the commercial probiotic products are dairy-based, and the development of non-dairy probiotic products could be an alternative for new functional products. the peanut-soy milk (psm(1)) was inoculated with six different lactic acid bacteria (lab), including probiotic strains and yeasts and fermentation was accomplished for 24h at 37 degrees c and afterwards, another 24h at +/-4 degrees  c. the pediococcus acidilactici (ufla bffcx 27.1), lactococcus lactis (cct 0360), lactobacillus rhamnosus (lr 32) probiotic lab, and the lactobacillus delbrueckii  subsp. bulgaricus (lb 340) yogurt starter culture reached cell concentrations of  about 8.3log cfu/ml during fermentation. however, these strains were not able to  acidify the substrate when inoculated as pure culture. the lactobacillus acidophilus (laca 4) probiotic produced significant amounts of lactic acid (3.35  g/l) and rapidly lowered the ph (4.6). saccharomyces cerevisiae (ufla yffbm 18.03) did not completely consume the available sugars in psm and consequently produced low amounts of ethanol (0.24 g/l). in pure culture, s. cerevisiae (ufla  yffbm 18.03), l. rhamnosus (lr 32), l. acidophilus (laca 4), and p. acidilactici  (ufla bffcx 27.1) promoted the increase of total amino acids (48.02%, 47.32%, 46.21% and, 44.07%, respectively). however, when in co-cultured, the strains consumed the free amino acids favoring their growth, and reaching the population  of 8log cfu/ml in psm. lactic acid production increased, and 12 h was required to reach a ph value of 4.3. in general, the strains were more efficient in the use of available carbohydrates and release of metabolites in co-cultured than in single culture fermentations. an average of 58% and 78% of available carbohydrates was consumed when single and co-cultures were evaluated, respectively. higher lactic acid contents were found in a binary culture of p. acidilactici (ufla bffcx 27.1) and l. acidophilus (laca 4), and by co-culture of  p. acidilactici (ufla bffcx 27.1), l. acidophilus (laca 4) and s. cerevisiae (ufla yffbm 18.03) (9.03 and 8.51 g/l, respectively). the final content of ethanol was 0.03% (v/v) or less, which classified the final beverage as non-alcoholic.

TI  == diversity and functional characterization of lactobacillus spp. isolated throughout the ripening of a hard cheese.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study the lactobacillus spp. intra- and inter- species diversity in a piedmont hard cheese made of raw milk without thermal treatment and without addition of industrial starter, and to perform a first screening for potential functional properties. a total of 586 isolates were collected during the cheese production and identified by means of molecular methods: three hundred and four were identified as lactobacillus rhamnosus, two hundred and forty as lactobacillus helveticus, twenty six as lactobacillus fermentum, eleven as lactobacillus delbrueckii, three as lactobacillus pontis, and two as lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus reuteri, respectively. a high  genetic heterogeneity was detected by using the repetitive bacterial dna element  fingerprinting (rep-pcr) with the use of (gtg)5 primer resulting in eight clusters of l. helveticus and sixteen clusters in the case of l. rhamnosus. most  of isolates showed a high auto-aggregation property, low hydrophobicity values, and a general low survival to simulated digestion process. however, sixteen isolates showed promising functional characteristics.

TI  == evaluation of probiotic survivability in yogurt exposed to cold chain interruption.
AB  == in this research, the survival of probiotic microorganisms in yogurts stored at room temperature (cold chain interruption conditions) was studied. milk inoculated with yogurt bacteria (mixed culture of streptococcus thermophilus and  lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus) and a single probiotic culture (l. acidophilus la-5 or bifidobacterium lactis bb- 12 or l. rhamnosus hn001 or l. paracasei lpc-37) were incubated till ph of 4.5 was reached. probiotic yogurts were stored at two different temperatures including cold (control) and room temperatures (5 and 20 degrees c, respectively). changes in ph decrease, titratable acidity increase and redox potential increase as well as the viability of probiotics per 6 h intervals during an assumptive interrupted cold storage (24 h) were monitored. the survival of probiotics was strongly dependent on the storage temperature and remarkable viability loss occurred in room temperature compared to refrigerated storage. in addition, the survivability was dependent on probiotic strain. among our experimental strains, b. lactis bb-12 showed the less resistance to be stored at 20 degrees c (24 h) and referring to the recommended minimum numbers of 10(7) cfu ml(-) (1), l. rhamnosus hn001 was the most suitable  probiotic strain to be used in probiotic yogurts especially in countries having high possibility of cold chain interruption during storage.

TI  == [phenotypic and genotypic characterization of probiotic bacterial strains used in medicinal products].
AB  == introduction: the optimization of quality testing strategy of products containing probiotics might allow to general improvement of its safer use in humans. the goal of the study was the evaluation of quality expressed by identity, colony forming unit (cfu) and antibiotic sensitivity ofprobiotics used in medicinal products available in poland using the appropriate and validated procedures. methods: the medicinal products containing l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and b. animalis subsp. lactis, l. helveticus, and l. gasseri were tested for species identity performed with validated rep-pcr (boxa 1r) method. the antimicrobial susceptibility of working seeds and strains isolated to 26 antibiotics were tested by disk diffusion and e-test methods using relevant references as recommended by eucast. the numbers of probiotic strains, expressed as cfu count per package, was done using plating plunge method. results: all strains tested, except b. lactis, were found to be resistant to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, nalidixic acid, metronidazole, and colistin. b. lactis was resistant to aminoglycosides. l. rhamnosus strains were found to be resistant to vancomycin, (mic > 256 microg/ml) similarly to atcc strains (l. rhamnosus gg 53103 and 244). the sensitivity to other antibiotics was strain specific. the rep-pcr method was found species and strain specific. all products  tested fulfilled declared countent as measured by cfu count/package. conclusions: quality of medicinal products containing probiotics was found undoubted and confirmed. the optimized strategy of quality monitoring of probiotics used in medicinal products can be used in dietary supplements and foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses.

TI  == molecular analysis and clinical significance of lactobacillus spp. recovered from clinical specimens presumptively associated with disease.
AB  == lactobacillus spp. are part of the normal human flora and are generally assumed to be nonpathogenic. we determined the genotypic identification of >100 lactobacillus isolates from clinical specimens in the context of presumed pathogenic potential (e.g., recovered as the single/predominant isolate from a sterile site or at >/=10(5) cfu/ml from urine). this study assessed the clinical  significance and the frequency of occurrence of each lactobacillus sp. we identified 16 species of lactobacillus by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, 10 of  which could not be associated with disease. while lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus paracasei were associated with infections, l. gasseri was also a common colonizing/contaminating species. lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus johnsonii, and lactobacillus delbrueckii were  associated with at least one infection. species commonly used in probiotic products (e.g., l. rhamnosus and l. casei) were identical, by 16s rrna gene sequencing, to our isolates associated with disease. human isolates of lactobacillus spp. have differing site associations and levels of clinical significance. knowing the niche and pathogenic potential of each lactobacillus sp. can be of importance to both clinical microbiology and the food and probiotic supplement industry.

TI  == effect of prebiotic carbohydrates on growth, bile survival and cholesterol uptake abilities of dairy-related bacteria.
AB  == background: three strains of lactic acid bacteria and one probiotic bifidobacterium strain sourced from milk origin were considered to select for the best synbiotic-like combination for cholesterol uptake ability. for that purpose, fermentative characteristics, bile salt hydrolase activity, bile survival and cholesterol removal were assessed in the presence of different carbohydrates. results: carbohydrate fermentability was highly variable among the different strains, and lactulose was the only prebiotic to favour growth of all strains, whereas pectin led to low population regardless of the strain. bile survival of bacteria could be improved by the preferred carbon source and was related to their bile salt hydrolase activities. all together, our results showed that the most advantageous synbiotic-like combinations to achieve cholesterol uptake abilities were lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus lb 340 with raffinose, streptococcus thermophilus ta040 or lactobacillus rhamnosus lbre-lsas with lactulose, and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb12 with mannitol. conclusion: the suggested synbiotics may represent new promising functional dairy additives.

TI  == utilization of major fucosylated and sialylated human milk oligosaccharides by isolated human gut microbes.
AB  == human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) are not digested in the proximal intestine. in distal intestine, hmos collectively modify the microbiota, but the response of individual bacteria to individual components of the hmos is not well defined. here, each of 25 major isolates of the human intestinal microbiota was fed individual major fucosylated and sialylated hmos in anaerobic culture. this allowed for an assessment of the influence of specific hmos on the growth and metabolic products of individual microbiota bacteria. most bifidobacteria spp. and bacteroides spp. grew, induced alpha-l-fucosidase activity, and produced abundant lactate or short-chain fatty acids (scfas) when fed 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-fl), 3-fl, and lactodifucotetraose (ldft). lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc7830, enterococcus faecalis atcc19433, and streptococcus thermophilus atcc19258 exhibited slight growth, ph reduction, and lactate production when supplemented with 2'-fl or 3-fl, but not ldft. supplementation with 3'-sialyllactose (3'-sl) and 6'-sl promoted moderate growth of bifidobacterium longum jcm7007, 7009, 7010, 7011, 1272, 11347, atcc15708, bacteroides vulgatus atcc8482, and b. thetaiotaomicron atcc29148; accordingly, these bacteria exhibited greater neuraminidase activity and produced copious lactate, scfa, or both. lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc7830 also consumed 6'-sl. in contrast, clostridium spp., l. rhamnosus atcc53103, e. faecalis atcc29200, staphylococcus spp., enterobacter spp., and escherichia coli k12 did not consume milk oligosaccharides nor produce appreciable acidic fermentation products. specific bifidobacteria and bacteroides differentially digest specific individual hmos, with the major fucosylated milk oligosaccharides most strongly stimulating key species of mutualist symbionts. this suggests strategies for treating dysbiosis of the microbiota and associated inflammatory disorders.

TI  == diversity and dynamic of lactic acid bacteria strains during aging of a long ripened hard cheese produced from raw milk and undefined natural starter.
AB  == the aim of this study was to explore diversity and dynamic of indigenous lab strains associated with a long ripened hard cheese produced from raw milk and undefined natural starter such as pdo grana padano cheese. samples of milk, curd, natural whey culture and cheeses (2nd, 6th, 9th and 13th months of ripening) were collected from 6 cheese factories in northern italy. dna was extracted from each  sample and from 194 lab isolates. trna(ala)-23s rdna-rflp was applied to identify isolates. strain diversity was assessed by (gtg)5 rep-pcr and rapd(p1)-pcr. finally, culture-independent lh-pcr (v1-v2 16s-rdna), was considered to explore structure and dynamic of the microbiota. grana padano lab were represented mainly by lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus helveticus and pediococcus acidilactici, while the structure and dynamic of microbiota at different localities was specific. the strength of this work is to have focused the study on isolates coming from more than one cheese factories rather than a high number of isolates  from one unique production. we provided a valuable insight into inter and intraspecies diversity of typical lab strains during ripening of traditional pdo  grana padano, contributing to the understanding of specific microbial ecosystem of this cheese.

TI  == the expression of adhesin ef-tu in response to mucin and its role in lactobacillus adhesion and competitive inhibition of enteropathogens to mucin.
AB  == aims: to analyse the expression of ef-tu in lactobacillus strains with response to mucin exposure and its role in interfering with adhesion of enteropathogens to mucin. methods and results: the lactobacillus strains were analysed for their ability to adhere to immobilized mucin in microtiter plates. lactobacillus delbrueckii m and lactobacillus plantarum cs24.2 showed statistically significant adhesion to mucin, which was similar to lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, the best binding probiotic strain. lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lact. delbrueckii m, lact.  plantarum cs23 and lact. plantarum cs24.2 were able to effectively antagonize the adhesion of escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhi to mucin. in the presence of lactobacillus adhesin - ef-tu, the adhesion of lact. delbrueckii  m and the strains of lact. plantarum to mucin was significantly inhibited. similarly, ef-tu also reduced the adhesion of enteropathogens to mucin. furthermore, the relative fold change in gene expression analysis showed significant up-regulation of ef-tu gene in the strains of lact. plantarum and lact. delbrueckii m when exposed to mucin for 3 h. conclusions: the study shows the significant role of ef-tu in lactobacilli adhesion and enteropathogens inhibition. significance and impact of the study: the study suggests ef-tu as an  important factor linked to the lactobacillus adhesion as well as enteropathogen inhibition. lactobacillus plantarum cs23 and lact. plantarum cs24.2 can be used as potential probiotic strains.

TI  == oral administration of lactobacillus delbrueckii subspecies bulgaricus oll1073r-1 suppresses inflammation by decreasing interleukin-6 responses in a murine model of atopic dermatitis.
AB  == the oral intake of lactobacillus spp. can provide beneficial effects to the host  by modulating the immune response. atopic dermatitis (ad) is an allergic inflammatory disease mediated by various immune responses. in this study, we examined the effect of a lactobacillus strain, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus oll1073r-1 (oll1073r-1), on ad development in a murine model of ad that was developed by the topical application of mite antigen in nc/nga mice. the oral intake of heat-killed oll1073r-1 cells inhibited both the development of dermatitis and the elevation of an acute inflammation marker, serum amyloid a. another bacterial strain, lactobacillus rhamnosus oll2984, exerted no inhibitory  effects on dermatitis. the oral intake of heat-killed oll1073r-1 cells also attenuated secretion of il-6 from lymph node cells in response to mite antigen and reduced il-6 levels in inflamed tissues, such as auricles. production of ifn-gamma or il-4 was not influenced by oll1073r-1 intake. we also found that inhibition of il-6 signaling by gp130-fc (a fusion protein consisting of the extracellular portion of glycoprotein 130 fused to the fc region of human igg1) markedly decreased the severity of dermatitis in nc/nga mice. moreover, secretion of il-6 by lymph node cells was augmented in nc/nga mice compared with that in balb/c mice. these results indicate that il-6 plays an essential role in the development of dermatitis in the nc/nga mouse model of ad, and that oll1073r-1 inhibits dermatitis, at least in part, by suppressing the il-6 response.

TI  == assessment of the in vitro inhibitory activity of specific probiotic bacteria against different escherichia coli strains.
AB  == background: lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are often associated with health-promoting effects. these live microorganisms, defined as probiotics, are commonly consumed as part of fermented foods, such as yoghurt and fermented milks, or as dietary supplements. escherichia coli is a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms. as a part of the normal gut microbiota, this microorganism colonizes the gastrointestinal tract of animals and humans within a few hours after birth. all  e. coli strains can produce a wide variety of biogenic amines responsible for potentially harmful systemic intoxications. enterohemorrhagic e. coli serotype o157:h7 is a pathotype of diarrhoeagenic strains with a large virulence plasmid po157 able to produce 1 or more shiga toxins. methods: the overall aim of this study was to determine the inhibitory effects of different strains of probiotics  on e. coli serotypes, including e. coli o157:h7 (cq9485). in particular, the antagonistic activity of 4 bifidobacterium strains (probiotical spa, italy) and 16 lactic acid bacteria, more specifically 14 lactobacillus spp. and 2 streptococcus spp., was assessed against selected e. coli biotypes (atcc 8739, atcc 10536, atcc 35218, and atcc 25922). the diarrhoeagenic serotype o157:h7 was  also tested. results: the experimental data collected demonstrated an in vitro significant inhibitory effect of 6 lactobacillus strains, namely l. rhamnosus lr04, l. rhamnosus lr06, l. plantarum lp01, l. plantarum lp02, l. pentosus lps01, and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii ldd01, and 2 bifidobacterium strains, b. breve br03 and b. breve b632. the inhibiting extent was slightly different among  these strains, with l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii ldd01 showing the highest activity on e. coli o157:h7. conclusions: most of the probiotics studied are able to antagonize the growth of the 5 strains of e. coli tested, including the o157:h7 biotype, well known for their characteristic to produce a wide variety of biogenic amines considered responsible for dangerous systemic intoxications.

TI  == the innovative potential of lactobacillus rhamnosus lr06, lactobacillus pentosus  lps01, lactobacillus plantarum lp01, and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii ldd01 to restore the "gastric barrier effect" in patients chronically treated with ppi: a pilot study.
AB  == background: gastroesophageal reflux disease is a very widespread condition. in europe, it is estimated that about 175 million people suffer from this disease and have to chronically take drugs to increase gastric ph. the proton pump inhibitors (ppis) such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, and esomeprazole are the most widely used drug typology in this regard. however, the inhibition of normal gastric acid secretion has important side effects, the most important being bacterial overgrowth in the stomach and duodenum with a concentration of >10(5) viable cells/ml. as a major consequence of this, many harmful or even pathogenic  bacteria contained in some foods could survive the gastric transit and colonize either the stomach itself, the duodenum, or the gut, where they could establish acute and even chronic infections with unavoidable consequences for the host's health. in other words, the "gastric barrier effect" is strongly reduced or even  disrupted. to date, there are no real strategies to deal with this widespread, although still relatively little known, problem. the aim of this study was to confirm the gastric bacterial overgrowth in long-term ppi consumers and to assess the efficacy of some probiotic bacteria, belonging to both genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium, in the reduction of gastric and duodenal bacterial overgrowth, therefore partially restoring the gastric barrier effect against foodborne pathogenic bacteria. methods: for this purpose, probiotics with a strong demonstrated inhibitory activity on gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, were tested in a human intervention trial involving a total of  30 subjects treated with ppis for either 3 to 12 consecutive months (short-term)  or >12 consecutive months (long-term). an additional 10 subjects not taking ppis  were enrolled and used as a control group representing the general population. four selected probiotics probiotical spa (novara, italy), namely lactobacillus rhamnosus lr06 (dsm 21981), lactobacillus pentosus lps01 (dsm 21980), lactobacillus plantarum lp01 (lmg p-21021), and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.  delbrueckii ldd01 (dsm 22106) were administered for 10 days to 10 subjects treated with ppis for >12 months (group b). in the 60 mg formulation, n-acetylcysteine was included as well in light of its well-known mechanical effects on bacterial biofilms. gastroscopies were performed at the beginning of the study (d0) in all the groups (a, b, c, and d) and after 10 days (d10) in group b only; that is, at the end of probiotics intake. the total viable cells and total lactobacillus were quantified in gastric juice and duodenal brushing material from all subjects. the results were compared among all the groups and with the control subjects (group d) to confirm the bacterial overgrowth. a comparison was made also between d0 and d10 in group b to quantify the efficacy of the 4 probiotics administered for 10 days. fecal samples were collected from all groups at d0, including subjects not treated with ppis, and in group b only at d10. specific bacterial classes, namely enterococci, total coliforms, e. coli, molds, and yeasts were quantified in all fecal specimens. results: the results collected confirmed the strong bacterial overgrowth in the stomach and duodenum of people treated with ppis compared with subjects with a normal intragastric acidity. it is also worth noting that the bacterial cell counts in subjects who underwent a long-term treatment with a ppi were greater than the results from subjects taking these drugs for 3 to 12 months. the intake of 4 specific probiotic strains with a marked antagonistic activity towards 5 e. coli bacteria, including the enterohaemorrhagic o157:h7 strain, and an effective amount of n-acetylcysteine (nac) was able to significantly reduce bacterial overgrowth in long-term ppi-treated subjects. total lactobacilli represented the major percentage of bacterial counts, thus demonstrating the ability of such bacteria to colonize the stomach and the duodenum, at least temporarily, and to consequently restore the gastric barrier effect. a significant decrease in fecal  enterococci, total coliforms, e. coli, molds, and yeasts in subjects treated with ppis was recorded at the end of probiotics supplementation (d10) compared with baseline (d0) in group b. this is a further confirmation of the barrier effect also exerted at the stomach level. conclusions: ppis are the most widely sold and used drugs in the world. however, the chronic use of these pharmacological molecules exposes the subject to the risk of foodborne infections as most pathogens are able to survive the gastric transit in a condition of significantly decreased acidity.

TI  == dietary sugar utilisation by putative oral probiotics.
AB  == probiotic consumption and repeated probiotic intake have shown promising results  as adjunct therapies in prevention and alleviation of some chronic disease conditions in the gastrointestinal tract. recent evidence suggests that probiotics may also be beneficial in preventing oral diseases. an efficient probiotic candidate in the mouth, however, should not impose any risk to oral tissues, such as acid demineralisation of tooth enamel because of sugar fermentation. the aim of the present in vitro study was to evaluate the utilisation of some sugars and sugar alcohols by yogurt starter lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains and to assess the influence of these carbohydrate sources on cell surface properties. for comparsion, a commercially available probiotic, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, was used. the results showed that lactose, glucose and fructose were readily metabolised by all strains tested. however, strain-specific metabolic patterns were observed when other sugars and sugar alcohols were used as sole carbohydrate source in the growth medium. surface properties of the bacteria such as hydrophobicity and surface-associated proteins appeared to vary with the carbohydrate content of the growth medium. based on these results it can be concluded that among the l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains probiotic candidate strains are available that warrant further studies due to their inability to ferment sugars with pronounced cariogenic properties.

TI  == anti-diabetic effects of lactic acid bacteria in normal and type 2 diabetic mice.
AB  == the antidiabetic effects of lactic acid bacteria were investigated using mice. in experiment 1, normal icr mice were loaded with sucrose or starch with or without  viable lactobacillus rhamnosus gg cells. gg significantly inhibited postprandial  blood glucose levels when administered with sucrose or starch. in experiment 2, kk-a(y) mice, a model of genetic type 2 diabetes, were given a basal diet containing viable gg cells or viable lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus  cells for 6 weeks. viable gg cells significantly inhibited fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose in a glucose tolerance test and hba1c. such effects were not shown by viable l. bulgaricus cells. in experiment 3, the kk-a(y) mice were given a basal diet containing viable gg cells or heat-treated gg cells for 3 weeks. the viable gg cells significantly suppressed fasting blood glucose and impaired glucose tolerance, but the heat-treated gg showed no effects. these results demonstrated that gg decreased the postprandial blood glucose in icr mice, and that the antidiabetic activity of lactic acid bacteria on the kk-a(y) mice differed depending on the bacterial strain and whether the bacterium is viable when it arrives in the intestine. in the present study, we conclude that the antidiabetic activity may result from continuous inhibition of the postprandial blood glucose through suppression of glucose absorption from the intestine. these findings indicate that specific strains of lactic acid bacterium can be expected to be beneficial for the management of type 2 diabetes.

AB  == aims: to assess the ability of vaginal lactobacilli to form biofilm under different culture conditions and to determine the relationship between their growth and the capability of biofilm formation by selected strains. methods and results: fifteen lactobacillus strains from human vagina were tested for biofilm  formation by crystal violet staining. only lactobacillus rhamnosus centro de referencia para lactobacilos culture collection (crl) 1332, lact. reuteri crl 1324 and lact. delbrueckii crl 1510 were able to grow and form biofilm in culture media without tween 80. however, lact. gasseri crl 1263 (a non-biofilm-forming strain) did not grow in these media. scanning electron microscopy showed that lact. rhamnosus crl 1332 and lact. reuteri crl 1324 formed a highly structured biofilm, but only lact. reuteri crl 1324 showed a high amount of extracellular material in medium without tween. conclusions: biofilm formation was significantly influenced by the strain, culture medium, inoculum concentration, microbial growth and chemical nature of the support used for the assay. significance and impacts of the study: the results allow the selection of biofilm-forming vaginal lactobacillus strains and the conditions and factors that affect this phenomenon.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of microflora from ovine cheese.
AB  == strains identified in ovine cheese and bryndza by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis belonged to ten species of non-enterococcal lactic acid bacteria and included lactobacillus casei/lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus and pediococcus acidilactici. the susceptibility toward antibiotics was determined in lactobacilli, lactococci and pediococci and also in escherichia coli for comparison. analysis of l. fermentum and pediococci revealed the presence of non-wild-type epidemiological cut-offs in streptomycin, clindamycin or gentamicin. e. coli were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin and  florfenicol. no extended spectrum beta-lactamases were detected.

TI  == regulation of tlr4, p38 mapkinase, ikappab and mirnas by inactivated strains of lactobacilli in human dendritic cells.
AB  == strain specific properties of probiotics in providing supportive health effects in the immune system and the gastrointestinal tract have been widely investigated in vivo and in vitro. however, the underlying responsible mechanism is poorly described. by unravelling the probiotic-induced responses in a complex network of interacting signalling pathways, we investigated the effect of heat-inactivated lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg) and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus  (l.del) on the expression of tlr4 and signalling factors such as p38 mapk and i?b at transcription level in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (dcs). our findings demonstrated that even inactivated probiotic strains can affect tlr4 expression in a down-regulatory direction as with lipopolysaccharides after 12 hours. lgg significantly down-regulated expression of p38 while i?b expression was significantly reduced in l.del-treated dcs. moreover, we found these lactobacillus strains could even modify the immune response at post-transcriptional level by modifying mirnas expression. based on our results lgg induced a significant down-regulatory effect on mir-146a expression which is  known as a novel fine negative regulator of immune response targeting nfkappab. on the other hand, mir-155 was up-regulated by lgg which is consistent with down-regulation of p38 and in lgg-treated dcs. these findings provide genetic and epigenetic explanations for the responsible underlying mechanisms by which probiotics influence immune response by targeting dcs.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == manufacture of fior di latte cheese by incorporation of probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == this work aimed to select heat-resistant probiotic lactobacilli to be added to fior di latte (high-moisture cow milk mozzarella) cheese. first, 18 probiotic strains belonging to lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus reuteri were screened. resistance to heating (65 or  55 degrees c for 10 min) varied markedly between strains. adaptation at 42 degrees c for 10 min increased the heat resistance at 55 degrees c for 10 min of  all probiotic lactobacilli. heat-adapted l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 227.4 min) and l. paracasei bgp1 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 40.8 min) showed the highest survival  under heat conditions that mimicked the stretching of the curd and were used for  the manufacture of fior di latte cheese. two technology options were chosen: chemical (addition of lactic acid to milk) or biological (streptococcus thermophilus as starter culture) acidification with or without addition of probiotics. as determined by random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr and 16s rrna gene analyses, the cell density of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 in chemically or biologically acidified fior di latte cheese was approximately 8.0 log(10)cfu/g. microbiological, compositional, biochemical, and  sensory analyses (panel test by 30 untrained judges) showed that the use of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 enhanced flavor formation and shelf-life of fior di latte cheeses.

TI  == microchip electrophoresis of bacteria using lipid-based liquid crystalline nanoparticles.
AB  == the aggregation and adhesion of bacterial cells is a serious disadvantage for electrophoretic separations of bacteria. in this study, lipid-based liquid crystalline nanoparticles were used as a pseudostationary phase to minimise the bacterial aggregation and adsorption to the inner walls of microchannels. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus rhamnosus were selected as analytes and were separated by microchip electrophoresis (mce) with laser-induced fluorescence (lif) detection using 4.5 mm tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (tris)-4.5 mm boric acid-0.1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetate (edta) (tbe) containing poly(ethylene oxide) (peo) and lipid-based nanoparticles as the running buffer. the mechanism of lipid-based nanoparticles affecting bacterial adhesion and aggregation was discussed and supported by zeta potential experiments. under the optimal conditions, the three  species of bacteria were identified with patterned peaks. this proposed mce method using lipid-based nanoparticles as running buffer additives was also used  to analyse a real yogurt sample, and valuable bacterial information was obtained  by the electropherograms.

TI  == effect of kynurenic acid on the viability of probiotics in vitro.
AB  == probiotics are bacteria that are commercially available as dietary supplements. one of the important properties of probiotics is their ability to survive in the  intestine. recent evidence has identified kynurenic acid (kyna) as a bactericidal constituent of intestinal fluid. these data led us to study the influence of kyna on the viability of selected probiotics. we found that kyna supported the growth  of bacteria in the probiotics acidolac (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium) and lakcid forte (lactobacillus rhamnosus) or retarded the growth of bacteria from the acidolac, biogaia (lactobacillus reuteri protectis),  dicoflor (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg), lacium (lactobacillus plantarum) and trilac (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis) probiotics depending on its concentration. kyna did not affect the viability of bacteria from the probiotic linex (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12). our results suggest a potential role of kyna in the regulation of bacterial growth in the digestive system.

TI  == potential beneficial properties of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from smoked salmon.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the probiotic properties of strains isolated from smoked salmon and previously identified as bacteriocin producers. methods and results: strains  lactobacillus curvatus et06, et30 and et31, lactobacillus fermentum et35, lactobacillus delbrueckii et32, pediococcus acidilactici et34 and enterococcus faecium et05, et12 and et88 survived conditions simulating the gastrointestinal tract (git) and produced bacteriocins active against several strains of listeria  monocytogenes, but presented very low activity against other lactic acid bacteria (lab). cell-free supernatants containing bacteriocins, added to 3-h-old cultures  of l. monocytogenes 603, suppressed growth over 12 h. auto-aggregation was strain-specific, and values ranged from 7.2% for et35 to 12.1% for et05. various  degrees of co-aggregation with l. monocytogenes 603, lactobacillus sakei atcc 15521 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 19443 were observed. adherence of the bacteriocinogenic strains to caco-2 cells was within the range reported for lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, a well-known probiotic. the highest levels of hydrophobicity were recorded for lact. curvatus (61.9-64.6%), lact. fermentum (78.9%), lact. delbrueckii (43.7%) and ped. acidilactici (51.3%), which are higher than the one recorded for lact. rhamnosus gg (53.3%). these strains were highly sensitive to several antibiotics and affected by several drugs from different generic groups in a strain-dependent manner. conclusions: smoked salmon is a rich source of probiotic lab. all strains survived conditions simulating the git and produced bacteriocins active against various pathogens. adherence to caco-2 cells was within the range reported for lact. rhamnosus gg, a well-known probiotic. in addition, the high hydrophobicity readings recorded define the strains as good probiotics.

TI  == immune-stimulating effects of lactic acid bacteria in vivo and in vitro.
AB  == the health-promoting effects of lactic acid bacteria (lab) are well recognised, making them a popular functional food ingredient. commercially available probiotic products are often promoted as capable of improving immune defences also in healthy subjects. however, while strain-specific differences exist in the effects of lab, conventional yoghurt bacteria have proved beneficial as well. for comparing the immunological effects of conventional and probiotic lab, young healthy women received either a commercially available probiotic fermented milk product or a conventional yoghurt for four weeks. both treatments showed comparable effects resulting in a stronger immunological reaction to stimuli (natural cytotoxicity against cancer cells, mitogen-induced t-lymphocyte activation and stimulated cytokine production). to study the mechanisms behind these effects, conventional (lactobacillus delbrueckii) and probiotic (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg), lab were compared in vitro at the cellular level. interestingly, l. rhamnosus gg was more potent in inducing maturation of dendritic cells (dc) that play a substantial role in directing the immune response to stimuli. in turn, l. delbrueckii provoked a higher secretion of proinflammatory cytokines as well as il-10. these effects were, however, observed only after direct incubation of dc and lab, not when both were separated by a layer of enterocyte-like caco-2 cells. lab also induced cytokine secretion in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a similar manner and this effect was reduced in a caco-2 cell model, suggesting a modulating influence of gut epithelial cells. while both conventional and probiotic strains modulate the immune response, specific properties may offer therapeutic options in the treatment of certain diseases.

TI  == enhancing the biotransformation of isoflavones in soymilk supplemented with lactose using probiotic bacteria during extended fermentation.
AB  == soymilk (sm) lacks lactose; hence supplementation of sm with lactose is likely to enhance the growth of probiotic bacteria and biotransformation of isoflavone glycosides to isoflavone aglycones. in this study, 11 strains of probiotic bacteria including lactobacillus rhamnosus, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, howaru l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium lactis type bi-07, b. longum, howaru b. bifidum, and b lactis type bi-04 were inoculated individually or as mixed cultures into sm and soymilk  supplemented with lactose (sml). a total of 2% of lactose was added to 1 l of sm  with the aim of improving the growth of probiotic organisms and promoting the biotransformation of isoflavone isomers to bioactive isoflavone aglycomes. samples of sm were incubated at 37 degrees c and 10 ml aliquots of sm were taken  at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h to monitor the growth of probiotic bacteria and changes in isoflavone contents using high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). results  indicated that sml fermented with probiotics had higher viable counts by >2.4 log cfu/ml than that in sm at the end of the 72 h fermentation period. mixed cultures grew at different rates and in general lactobacilius spp. had >1.02 log cfu/ml more cells than bifidobacterium spp. at the end of the fermentation period. the total aglycone content in sm at 72 h of fermentation was 0.924 mg/100 ml, whereas that in sml was 1.623 mg/100 ml. addition of lactose not only improved the growth of probiotic bacteria in sm but also enhanced the biotransformation of isoflavone glucosides to the more bioactive isoflavone aglycones. mixed cultures did not improve the biotransformation of bioactive isoflavones when compared to single cultures.

TI  == probiotic attributes of lactobacillus strains isolated from food and of human origin.
AB  == lactobacilli isolated from various sources were identified on the basis of 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic region amplification and subsequent sequencing of the smaller intergenic region. an in vitro analysis of probiotic properties including binding, ability to tolerate different concentrations of bile, survival in acidic buffer and antimicrobial activity of four different isolates and two standard strains (lactobacillus plantarum american type culture collection (atcc) 8014 and l. rhamnosus gg (lgg)) was carried out. the ability of each isolate to stimulate caco-2 cells, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) and thp-1 cells resulting in immunomodulation of these cells was analysed. isolates l. rhamnosus cs25 and l. delbrueckii m and standard strain atcc 8014 showed broad antimicrobial activity, and isolates cs25 (percentage of survival 6.9 % at ph 2.5, 5.1 % at ph 2.0) and l. plantarum cs23 (5.7 % at ph 2.5, 4.9 % at ph 2.0) have shown good tolerance to acidic ph. isolate cs23 showed a good survival (14 %) after 2 h incubation in de man, rogosa and sharpe (mrs) medium containing 3 %  bile salts. isolates cs23, cs25 and l. fermentum ast1 could stimulate caco-2 cells, human pbmc and thp-1 cells for a strong and varied immunomodulatory response in these cells. though lgg showed poor antimicrobial activity as well as bile and acid tolerance, it was found to be the best binding strain tested. child faecal isolate cs23 from the present study showed high binding ability (seventeen bacteria/caco-2), high tolerance to acidic ph and bile salts and significant immunomodulation; therefore it is a good potential probiotic candidate.

TI  == live and lyophilized lactobacillus species elicit differential immunomodulatory effects on immune cells.
AB  == to study the mechanism of action of the lactobacilli, splenocytes were incubated  with lactobacilli. we compared the ability of live and lyophilized lactobacillus  casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus to modulate the production of interleukin 12p40 (il-12p40), tumor necrosis factor alpha and il-10 by splenocytes from c57bl/6 and balb/c mice. blocking contact between lactobacilli and immune cells abrogated all cytokine production. toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) was partially responsible, but not tlr4 or tlr9, for  the induction of cytokine production in splenocytes. all cytokine production declined to basal levels when bacterial phagocytosis was inhibited. this shows that lactobacilli stimulation of cytokine production in splenocytes requires the  process of phagocytosis and engagement of tlr2, but not tlr4 or tlr9.

AB  == in this review, we are listing lactobacillus phages that have been reported in peer-reviewed articles published since 1960. putative phages that are defective or have not been shown to be infectious, such as phage-like particles, are not discussed. our literature searches led to the identification of 231 lactobacillus phages, 186 of which have been observed by electron microscopy, with 109 belonging to the siphoviridae family, 76 to the myoviridae family, and 1 to the podoviridae family. model phages infecting lb delbrueckii, casei, rhamnosus, plantarum, and gasseri are highlighted, as well as prophages of lactobacillus hosts. to date, nine complete lactobacillus phage genomes are available for comparisons and evolution studies. features such as phage receptors and endolysins are also reviewed, as well as phage-derived genetic tools. lactobacillus phage research has progressed significantly over the past decade but a thorough understanding of their biology is still lacking. because of the risks they represent and the knowledge gaps that need to be filled, the outlook for research on lactobacillus phages is bright.

TI  == acid production by oral strains of candida albicans and lactobacilli.
AB  == both candida albicans and lactobacilli are common colonizers of carious lesions in children and adolescents. the purpose of this study is to compare the velocity of acid production between c. albicans and several lactobacillus species at different ph levels and concentrations of glucose. washed, pure resting-cell suspensions were obtained by culturing a total of 28 oral isolates comprising the species c. albicans, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus paracasei paracasei,  lactobacillus paracasei tolerans and lactobacillus delbrueckii lactis. acid production from glucose was determined at a constant ph of 7.0, 5.5, 5.0 and 4.0  by repeated titrations with naoh in an automated ph-stat system. acid formation rates of yeast and lactobacilli proved to be similar at both neutral and low ph,  while in a moderately acidic environment c. albicans produced less acid than the  lactobacilli. ion chromatographic analysis of the cell-free medium after titration revealed pyruvate to be the predominant organic acid anion secreted by  c. albicans. the proportion of organic acids to overall acid production by the yeast was below 10% at neutral conditions, in contrast to 42-66% at ph 4.0. compared to lactobacilli, yeast required a concentration of glucose that was about 50 times higher to allow acid production at half the maximum speed. considering the clinical data in the literature about the frequency and proportions of microorganisms present in early childhood caries lesions, the contribution of oral lactobacilli as well as c. albicans to overall microbial acid formation appears to be important.

TI  == effects of copper supplement on growth and viability of strains used as starters  and adjunct cultures for emmental cheese manufacture.
AB  == aims: to determine the effects of supplemented copper (cu2+) on growth and viability of strains used as starters and adjunct cultures for emmental cheese manufacture. methods and results: thirteen strains belonging to lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus or propionibacterium freudenreichii species were exposed to various  copper concentrations in the proper growth medium at relevant growth temperatures, and the effects of supplemented copper on bacterial growth and cell viability were determined by optical density and ph measurements, also by platings. among the species considered, l. delbrueckii was the most copper resistant and s. thermophilus the most sensitive to copper. anaerobic conditions  increased this sensitivity significantly. there was also a considerable amount of variation in copper resistance at strain level. conclusions: copper resistance is both a species- and strain-dependent property and may reflect variability in copper-binding capacities by cell wall components among species and strains. in addition, the chemical state of copper may be involved. significance and impact of the study: this study revealed that copper resistance is a highly variable property among starter and adjunct strains, and this variability should be considered when strains are selected for emmental cheese manufacture.

TI  == diversity and dynamics of lactobacilli populations during ripening of rdo camembert cheese.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of lactobacillus populations in traditional raw milk camembert cheese were monitored throughout the manufacturing process in 3 dairies. culture-dependent analysis was carried out on isolates grown on acidified de man - rogosa - sharpe agar and lactobacillus anaerobic de man rogosa sharpe agar supplemented with vancomycin and bromocresol green media. the isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction - temperature gradient gel  electrophoresis (pcr-tgge) and (or) species-specific pcr and (or) sequencing, and lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum isolates were characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). milk and cheese were subjected to culture-independent analysis by pcr-tgge. presumed lactobacilli were detected by  plate counts throughout the ripening process. however, molecular analysis of total dna and dna of isolates failed to detect lactobacillus spp. in certain cases. the dominant species in the 3 dairies was l. paracasei. pfge analysis revealed 21 different profiles among 39 l. paracasei isolates. lactobacillus plantarum was the second most isolated species, but it occurred nearly exclusively in one dairy. the other species isolated were lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, a lactobacillus psittaci/delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus/gallinarum/crispatus group, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus kefiri, and lactobacillus perolens. lactobacilli diversity  at the strain level was high. dynamics varied among dairies, and each cheese exhibited a specific picture of species and strains.

AB  == soy beverage and cows' milk yogurts were produced with steptococcus thermophilus  (atcc 4356) and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (im 025). the drop in ph during fermentation was faster in the soy beverage than in cows' milk, but the final ph values were similar. yogurts were prepared with a yogurt starter in conjunction with either the probiotic bacteria lactobacillus johnsonii ncc533 (la-1), lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103 (gg) or human derived bifidobacteria.  the presence of the probiotic bacteria did not affect the growth of the yogurt strains. approximately 2 log increases in both l. rhamnosus gg and l. johnsonii la-1 were observed when each was added with the yogurt strains in both cows' milk and the soy beverage. two of the five bifidobacteria strains grew well in the cows' milk and soy beverage during fermentation with the yogurt bacteria. high pressure liquid chromatography (hplc) analyses showed that the probiotic bacteria and the bifidobacteria were using different sugars to support their growth, depending on whether the bacteria were growing in cows' milk or soy beverage.

TI  == effect on components of the intestinal microflora and plasma neuropeptide levels  of feeding lactobacillus delbrueckii, bifidobacterium lactis, and inulin to adult and elderly rats.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the effects of the mixture of lactobacillus  delbrueckii subsp. rhamnosus strain gg, bifidobacterium lactis bb12, and inulin on intestinal populations of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and enterobacteria in  adult and elderly rats fed the same (in quality and quantity) diet. the portal plasma levels of two neuropeptides, neuropeptide y (npy) and peptide yy (pyy), were also evaluated to assess the physiological consequences of the synbiotic treatment for the gastrointestinal (gi) tracts of rats of different ages. adult (n = 24) and elderly (n = 24) male rats were fed the ain-93 m maintenance diet. after 2 weeks of adaptation, the diet of 12 rats of each age group was supplemented with 8% inulin and with strains gg and bb12 to provide 2.2 x 10(9) cfu of each strain g(-1) of the diet. blood and different regions of the gi tract were sampled from all rats after 21 days of the treatment. treatment with the mixture of strain gg, strain bb12, and inulin induced significantly different changes in the numbers of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and enterobacteria of the stomach, small intestine, cecum, and colon microflora. moreover, the gg, bb12, and inulin mixture increased the concentrations of npy and pyy for adult rats. for the elderly animals, the pyy concentration was not changed, while the npy concentration was decreased by treatment with the gg, bb12, and inulin mixture. the results of the present study indicate that the physiological status of the gi tract, and not just diet, has a major role in the regulation of important groups  of the gi bacteria community, since even the outcome of the dietary modification  with synbiotics depends on the ages of the animals.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr analysis of fecal lactobacillus species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  == the developing intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants is considered to play  an important role in the priming of the infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. generally, bifidobacterium and lactobacillus predominate the microbiota of breast-fed infants. in intervention trials it has been shown that lactobacilli can exert beneficial effects on, for example, diarrhea and atopy. however, the lactobacillus species distribution in breast-fed or formula-fed infants has not yet been determined in great detail. for accurate enumeration of different lactobacilli, duplex 5' nuclease assays, targeted on rrna intergenic spacer regions, were developed for lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the  designed and validated assays were used to determine the amounts of different lactobacillus species in fecal samples of infants receiving a standard formula (sf) or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides in a 9:1 ratio (osf). a breast-fed group (bf) was studied in parallel as a reference. during the 6-week intervention period a significant increase was shown in total percentage of fecal lactobacilli in the bf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.1% +/- 1.5%) and the osf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.4% +/- 1.4%). the lactobacillus species distribution in the osf group was comparable to breast-fed  infants, with relatively high levels of l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, and l. casei. the sf-fed infants, on the other hand, contained more l. delbrueckii and less l. paracasei compared to breast-fed infants and osf-fed infants. an infant milk formula containing a specific mixture of prebiotics is able to induce a microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of bf infants.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth  indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised  rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g  after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal.  it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

TI  == lactobacilli in the intestinal microbiota of swedish infants.
AB  == lactobacillus colonisation was examined in 112 swedish infants. faecal samples obtained at 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks and at 6, 12 and 18 months of age were cultivated quantitatively on rogosa agar. lactobacilli were speciated by pcr and typed to the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd). lactobacilli reached a peak at 6 months when 45% of the infants were colonised. l. rhamnosus and l. gasseri were the most common species in this period. colonisation by lactobacilli in general (p < 0.01) and l. rhamnosus in particular (p < 0.05) was  more common in breast-fed than in weaned infants at 6 months of age. lactobacillus isolation reached a nadir of 17% by 12 months (p < 0.0001), but increased to 31% by 18 months of age p < 0.05). the food-related species l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii dominated in this second phase. a single strain persisted for at least 3 weeks in 17% of the infants during the first 6 months, most commonly l. rhamnosus. lactobacillus population counts in colonised infants increased from 10(6.4) cfu/g at 1 week to  10(8.8) cfu/g at 6 months, and then dropped to 10(5.4) cfu/g faeces at 12 months  of age. lactobacillus colonisation was not significantly related to delivery mode, or to presence of siblings or pets in the household. our results suggest that certain lactobacillus species, especially l. rhamnosus, thrive in the intestinal flora of breast-fed infants. after weaning they are replaced by other  lactobacillus species of types found in food.

AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == quantitative analysis of diverse lactobacillus species present in advanced dental caries.
AB  == our previous analysis of 65 advanced dental caries lesions by traditional culture techniques indicated that lactobacilli were numerous in the advancing front of the progressive lesion. production of organic acids by lactobacilli is considered to be important in causing decalcification of the dentinal matrix. the present study was undertaken to define more precisely the diversity of lactobacilli found in this environment and to quantify the major species and phylotypes relative to  total load of lactobacilli by real-time pcr. pooled dna was amplified by pcr with lactobacillus genus-specific primers for subsequent cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. based on 16s ribosomal dna sequence comparisons, 18 different phylotypes of lactobacilli were detected, including strong representation of both novel and gastrointestinal phylotypes. specific pcr primers were designed for nine prominent species, including lactobacillus gasseri, l. ultunensis, l. salivarius, l. rhamnosus, l. casei, l. crispatus, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, and l. gallinarum. more than three different species were identified as being present in most of the dentine samples, confirming the widespread distribution and numerical importance of various lactobacillus spp. in carious dentine. quantification by real-time pcr revealed various proportions of  the nine species colonizing carious dentine, with higher mean loads of l. gasseri and l. ultunensis than of the other prevalent species. the findings provide a basis for further characterization of the pathogenicity of lactobacillus spp. in  the context of extension of the carious lesion.

TI  == influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  == intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. the stimulus of the mucosal immunity is  not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. in previous works we have demonstrated that some lactic acid bacteria (lab), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis on the iga secreting cells associated to bronchus. as shown before, oral immunostimulation with lab induced an increase of the iga* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. in this study it is also showed that the lab assayed, with exception of l. acidophilus, were able to enhance iga+ cells at bronchial level,  being also this effect dose dependent. the increment induced by some lab in the number of iga+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be  very important to prevent bronchus diseases.

AB  == a group of new insertion sequence (is) elements, isldl2, isldl3, and isldl4, from lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis atcc 15808 was isolated, characterized, and used for strain identification together with isldl1, recently characterized as an l. delbrueckii is element belonging to the isl3 family. isldl2 was 1367 bp  in size and had a 24 bp ir and an 8 bp dr. the single orf of isldl2 encoded a protein of 392 aa similar to transposases of the is256 family. isldl3 had a single orf encoding a protein of 343 aa similar to transposases of the is30 family. finally, isldl4 had a single orf encoding a protein of 406 aa and displayed homology to the transposases of the is110 family. isldl4 was only slight different from isl4 (accession no. ay040213). isldl1, isldl2, and isldl4 were present in all of the 10 l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis and subsp. delbrueckii strains tested, as well as in three of the 11 l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains tested. isldl3 was present only in four closely related strains of l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis. these is elements were not observed in lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, or lactobacillus  plantarum. a cluster of is elements, isldl1, isldl2, isldl3, isldl4, and isl6, was observed in l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis strain atcc 15808. within this cluster, isldl4 was inserted into isldl1 between the left ir and the start codon  of orf455, encoding a putative transposase. most of the integration sites of the  is elements were strain-specific. we have observed that is elements can migrate from one strain to another as integral parts of bacterial dna by using phage ll-h as a vehicle. we demonstrate for the first time that inverse pcr and vectorette pcr methods with primers based on sequences of the is elements could be used for  identification of l. delbrueckii strains.

TI  == interactions of lactic acid bacteria with human intestinal epithelial cells: effects on cytokine production.
AB  == as a participant in the mucosal immune response, the intestinal epithelial cell must respond to a variety of stimuli, including lactic acid bacteria (lab) consumed in the diet. the objective of this study was to compare the abilities of several strains of lab to modulate cytokine secretion by human intestinal epithelial cell (iec) line ht-29. certain strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and lactobacillus acidophilus suppressed the production of the chemokine rantes by stimulated ht-29 iec, although the magnitude of this suppression varied depending on the nature of the bacterial growth medium. similarly, specific strains showed growth condition-dependent suppression of ht-29 interleukin-8 (il-8) production. strain-dependent effects were also seen for the suppression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta) production. the binding of several of  these bacterial strains to the ht-29 cell line was also examined. different strains were found to have differing abilities to interact with iec, with l. rhamnosus r0011 being the strain that generally had the most extensive effects on ht-29 cytokine production and also bound to ht-29 iec most effectively. modulation of iec cytokine production has the potential to profoundly affect the  mucosal microenvironment, influencing the immune response to pathogens and other  ingested antigens.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy products inhibit genotoxic effect of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in sos-chromotest.
AB  == antigenotoxic activity against 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-nqo) of lactic acid bacteria isolated from commercial dairy products was studied using sos-chromotest. the supernatants from bacteria-genotoxin co-incubations in general exhibited a strong suppression on sos-induction produced by 4-nqo on the  tester organism escherichia coli pq37 (sfia::lacz). high genotoxicity inhibition  (>75%) was found for 31/67 of the examined bacteria and the maximum values of some strains within the species were as follows: lactobacillus casei, 99.1%; l. plantarum, 93.3%; l. rhamnosus, 93.4%; l. acidophilus, 90.9%; l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, 85.7% and bifidobacterium bifidum, 89.6%; strains with low antigenotoxicity (5-60%) were evidenced in both l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, whereas some inactive strains were found only in l. casei and  l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. cell exposure to 100 degrees c for 15 min prevented antigenotoxicity and no effect was evidenced for cell-free spent media. the active strains survived at 0.1 mm 4-nqo exposure and generally presented some relevant functional properties, such as tolerance to bile (0.5%) or acid environment (ph 2.0) and adherence to caco-2 enterocytes. antigenotoxicity was always associated with modification of the 4-nqo absorbance profile.

TI  == gut mucosal immunostimulation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. the interaction of lab with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the lab. we studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of lab such as lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. plantarum, lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus. we determined if the lab assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. we demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of iga producing cells associated to the lamina  propria of small intestine. this effect was dose dependent. the increase in iga+  producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the cd4+ t cell number, indicating that some lab assayed only induced clonal expansion of b cells triggered to produce iga. most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. cd8+ t cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of l. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. this fact would mean that lab are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. we demonstrated the importance in the selection of lab to be used as gut mucosal  adjuvant. the different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune  response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the lab can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. the immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.

TI  == molecular discrimination of lactobacilli used as starter and probiotic cultures by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus helveticus, l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and l. casei related taxa which are widely used as starter or probiotic cultures can be identified by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). the genetic discrimination of the related species belonging to  these groups was first obtained by pcr amplifications by using group-specific or  species-specific 16s rdna primers. the numerical analysis of the ardra patterns obtained by using cfoi, hinfi, tru9i, and scrfi was an efficient typing tool for  identification of species of the l. acidophilus and l. casei complex. ardra by using cfoi was a reliable method for differentiation of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis. finally, strains atcc 393 and atcc 15820 exhibited unique ardra patterns with cfoi and tru9i restriction enzymes as  compared with the other strains of l. casei, l. paracasei, and l. rhamnosus.

TI  == rapid identification of 11 human intestinal lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr assays using group- and species-specific primers derived from the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna.
AB  == rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex pcr was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex pcr assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna  gene of members of the genus lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). the established two-step multiplex pcr assays were applied  to the identification of 84 lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the pcr results were consistent with the results from the dna-dna hybridization assay. these results suggest that the multiplex pcr system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.

AB  == a total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. for detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. lactobacillus sake lb790, listeria monocytogenes li6, staphylococcus aureus st44 and escherichia coli nrrl b-3704 were used as indicator organisms. strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against clostridium perfringens 4ttk, clostridium botulinum type a. 7948,  bacillus cereus nrrl b-3711, micrococcus luteus nrrl b-4376 and yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following:  19 lactobacillus plantarum, 4 l. curvatus, 4 pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 p. acidilactici, 2 l. pentosus, 2 l. sake, 1 l. delbrueckii, 1 l. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified lactobacillus spp. p. pentosaceus 416, p. acidilactici 413, 419 and  446, l. curvatus 348, l. plantarum 452 and 495, and lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.

TI  == x-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase gene (pepx) is part of the glnra operon in lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  == a peptidase gene expressing x-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (pepx) activity was cloned from lactobacillus rhamnosus 1/6 by using the chromogenic substrate l-glycyl-l-prolyl-beta-naphthylamide for screening of a genomic library in escherichia coli. the nucleotide sequence of a 3.5-kb hindiii fragment expressing the peptidase activity revealed one complete open reading frame (orf) of 2,391 nucleotides. the 797-amino-acid protein encoded by this orf was shown to be 40, 39, and 36% identical with pepxs from lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and lactococcus lactis, respectively. by northern analysis with a pepx-specific probe, transcripts of 4.5 and 7.0 kb were detected, indicating that pepx is part of a polycistronic operon in l. rhamnosus. cloning and sequencing of the upstream region of pepx revealed the presence of two orfs of 360 and 1,338 bp that were shown to be able to encode proteins with high homology to glnr and glna proteins, respectively. by multiple primer extension analyses, the only functional promoter in the pepx region was located 25 nucleotides upstream of glnr. northern analysis with glna- and pepx-specific probes indicated that transcription from glnr promoter results in a 2.0-kb dicistronic glnr-glna transcript and also in a longer read-through polycistronic transcript of 7.0 kb that was detected with both probes in samples from cells in exponential growth phase. the glna gene was disrupted by a single-crossover recombinant event using  a nonreplicative plasmid carrying an internal part of glna. in the disruption mutant, glnra-specific transcription was derepressed 10-fold compared to the wild type, but the 7.0-kb transcript was no longer detectable with either the glna- or pepx-specific probe, demonstrating that pepx is indeed part of glnra operon in l. rhamnosus. reverse transcription-pcr analysis further supported this operon structure. an extended stem-loop structure was identified immediately upstream of pepx in the glna-pepx intergenic region, a sequence that showed homology to a 23s-5s intergenic spacer and to several other l. rhamnosus-related entries in data banks.

TI  == screening of probiotic activities of forty-seven strains of lactobacillus spp. by in vitro techniques and evaluation of the colonization ability of five selected strains in humans.
AB  == the probiotic potential of 47 selected strains of lactobacillus spp. was investigated. the strains were examined for resistance to ph 2.5 and 0.3% oxgall, adhesion to caco-2 cells, and antimicrobial activities against enteric pathogenic bacteria in model systems. from the results obtained in vitro, five strains, lactobacillus rhamnosus 19070-2, l. reuteri dsm 12246, l. rhamnosus lgg, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis chcc 2329, and l. casei subsp. alactus chcc 3137, were  selected for in vivo studies. the daily consumption by 12 healthy volunteers of two doses of 10(10) freeze-dried bacteria of the selected strains for 18 days was followed by a washout period of 17 days. fecal samples were taken at days 0 and 18 and during the washout period at days 5 and 11. lactobacillus isolates were initially identified by api 50chl and internal transcribed spacer pcr, and their  identities were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis in combination with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. among the tested strains, l. rhamnosus 19070-2, l. reuteri dsm 12246, and l. rhamnosus lgg were identified most frequently in fecal samples; they were found in 10, 8, and 7 of the 12 samples tested during the intervention period, respectively, whereas reisolations were less frequent in the washout period. the bacteria were reisolated in concentrations from 10(5) to  10(8) cells/g of feces. survival and reisolation of the bacteria in vivo appeared to be linked to ph tolerance, adhesion, and antimicrobial properties in vitro.

AB  == unheated and heat-treated homogenates were separately prepared from candidate probiotic bacteria, including lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus. we compared the phytohemagglutinin-induced proliferation of mononuclear cells in the presence of homogenates and in the presence of a control containing no homogenate by assessing thymidine incorporation in cell cultures. all homogenates suppressed proliferation, whether the enzymatic activity was inactivated or not inactivated by heating. when the proliferation assays were repeated with cytoplasmic and cell wall extracts derived from the homogenate of l. rhamnosus gg, the cytoplasmic extract but not the cell wall extract was suppressive. these findings indicate that candidate probiotic bacteria possess a heat-stable antiproliferative component(s). these bacteria may be used to generate microbiologically nonviable yet immunologically  active probiotic food products that are easier to store and have a longer shelf life.

TI  == study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. antigens administered orally can interact with m cells of peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. we have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance  the gut inflammatory immune response. the aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. we studied iga+ and igm+ b cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and cd4+ t cells and iga anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by  oral administration of lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lb.  acidophilus, lb. plantarum, lb. rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus  salivarius ssp. thermophilus. the increase in the iga+ b cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the iga cycle by interaction with m cells from peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. the igm+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from igm+ to iga+. the increase in the cd4+ cells suggests interaction of peyer's patches and  enhancement of the b- and t-cell migration. the anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. we demonstrated that lb. casei and lb. plantarum were able to interact with peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in iga-, cd4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase  in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. although lb. rhamnosus and strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. lactococcus lactis and lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of iga+ cells entering the iga cycle but not cd4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated b lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. we did not determine specific antibodies against lc. lactis or lb. bulgaricus.

TI  == preliminary characterization of microflora of comte cheese.
AB  == the evolution of the microflora of three comte cheeses made in duplicate with raw milk from three different sources was followed during ripening. the same starter  was used with each type of milk. the comparison of the cheeses did not reveal any significant difference in the development of the microflora. starter lactic acid  bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus), which are added at the beginning of manufacture, decreased quickly in the first stages of ripening supporting the hypothesis of cell autolysis. other microorganisms, i.e.  homofermentative and heterofermentative lactobacilli (lact. delbrueckii ssp. lactis, lact. paracasei ssp. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. fermentum), pediococci, enterococci and propionibacteria grew in cheese from small numbers in fresh curd. the characterization of strep. thermophilus by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that wild strains were also able to grow in the curd. the  values for the genome size of 11 strep. thermophilus strains determined in this investigation were in the range of 1.8-2.3 mbp. the potential role of starter and raw milk microflora in cheese flavour development was considered.
