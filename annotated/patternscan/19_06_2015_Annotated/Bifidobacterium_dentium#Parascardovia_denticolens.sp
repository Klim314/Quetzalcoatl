TI  == occurrence of bifidobacteriaceae in human hypochlorhydria stomach.
AB  == background: the human stomach, when healthy, is not a suitable host for microorganisms, but in pathological conditions such as gastritis, when gastric acid secretion is impaired, microbial overgrowth can be observed. apart from helicobacter pylori, the composition of microbiota, resident or exogenously introduced during neutral/high ph conditions, has not been investigated thoroughly. thus, it is possible that bifidobacteriaceae, important autochthonous and beneficial bacteria of human gastrointestinal microbiota, could over-colonize the stomach of hypochlorhydria patients suffering from autoimmune atrophic gastritis (aag) or omeprazole-treated (ome) gastritis. this prompted us to characterize the bifidobacteriaceae in such patients' gastric microbiota and to study its abnormal colonization. methods: samples of gastric juices, and antrum and corpus mucosa from 23 hypochlorhydria patients (13 aag and 10 ome) and from 10 control volunteers with base-line normochlorhydria, were cultivated in brain heart infusion (bhi) and selective bifidobacterium-tryptone-phytone-yeast extract (bif-tpy) media. the isolates were characterized by the fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase (f6ppk) test, electrophoresis of cellular proteins, the fermentation test, guanine-cytosine% dna content, and dna-dna hybridization. negative f6ppk isolates were characterized by order-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: a total of 125 isolates, assigned to the bifidobacteriaceae family on the basis of their morphology, were obtained from aag and ome patients, but not from normal subjects. of these isolates, 55 were assigned to the bifidobacteriaceae family on the basis of their fructose-6-phosphoketolase (ppk) activity, ppk being the key taxonomic enzyme of  this family. the remaining 70 isolates, which were ppk-negative, were attributed  to the actinomycetales order following specific primer pcr analysis. we observed  a significantly higher abundance of bifidobacteriaceae (bifidobacterium dentium,  scardovia inopinata, and parascardovia denticolens) in ome group than the aag group. furthermore, the actinomycetales distribution was homogeneous for both hypochlorhydria patient groups. conclusions: this study suggests that the bifidobacteriaceae species, typically found in the oral cavity, readily colonizes the hypochlorhydria stomach of ome patients. the clinical relevance and the mechanism underlying this bifidobacteriaceae presence in ome gastritis requires further functional studies.

TI  == the isolation of bifidobacteria from occlusal carious lesions in children and adults.
AB  == the aim of this study was to enumerate and identify bifidobacteria from occlusal  carious lesions in permanent and deciduous teeth. samples of infected dentine were obtained from 24 active occlusal lesions in deciduous teeth and from 15 occlusal lesions in permanent teeth. plaque samples from sound occlusal surfaces  of 12 caries-free adults and 12 children were also obtained. the bifidobacterial  strains were isolated in mupirocin-containing selective media, gram-stained and subcultured for identification. total bacterial counts were determined using fastidious anaerobic agar, and isolates were identified using genus-specific pcr  primers and were confirmed by 16s rrna sequencing. bifidobacteria were isolated from 13 of the 15 occlusal lesions in the adults and formed 5.09 +/- 2.11% of the total cultivable flora. in the children, bifidobacteria were isolated from 16 of  the 24 occlusal lesions and formed 7.4 +/- 2.6% of the total flora. no bifidobacteria were isolated from the occlusal surfaces of caries-free adults or  children. a total of 424 bifidobacteria were identified and these were bifidobacteriumdentium, parascardovia denticolens, scardoviainopicata, bifidobacterium longum, scardovia genomosp. c1 and bifidobacterium breve. b. dentium was present in 14 out of the 16 bifidobacteria-positive samples from the  lesions on the deciduous teeth and in 7 out of the 13 positive lesions in adults  (p = 0.04). the present data suggest that bifidobacteria may play a role in the progression of occlusal caries lesions in both children and adults.

TI  == association between bifidobacteriaceae and the clinical severity of root caries lesions.
AB  == background/aims: the isolation of members of the family bifidobacteriaceae (bifids) from oral samples has been sporadic and a recent cloning study has suggested that they are not detectable in root caries lesions. methods: to better understand the presence of bifids in root caries we obtained clinical samples (15 of each) from sound exposed root surfaces, leathery remineralizing root lesions,  and soft active root lesions. we investigated each for the presence of bifids using a mupirocin-containing selective medium and identified the isolates using 16s recombinant rna sequencing. results: the proportion of bifids, as a percentage of the total anaerobic count, was significantly related to the clinical status of the sites sampled, being 7.88 +/- 1.93 in the infected dentine from soft lesions, 1.61 +/- 0.91 in leathery lesions, and 0.05 +/- 0.39 in plaque from sound exposed root surfaces. bifids were isolated from all soft lesions, 13  of 15 leathery lesions, and five of the plaque samples. bifidobacterium dentium was isolated from four of the plaque samples, from 13 samples from leathery lesions, and from 12 of the 15 samples of infected dentine from the soft active lesions. parascardovia denticolens and scardovia genomospecies c1 were each isolated from samples associated with all three clinical conditions whereas scardovia inopicata and bifidobacterium subtile were both isolated from the infected dentine of the leathery and soft lesions. bifidobacterium breve was isolated from the infected dentine of soft root caries lesions. conclusion: bifids may be routinely isolated from root caries lesions using appropriate cultural methods.

TI  == isolation and identification of bifidobacteriaceae from human saliva.
AB  == bifidobacteriaceae were isolated from saliva and infected dentine by using a mupirocin-based selective medium. of the saliva samples, 94% harbored bifids. the mean concentration (+/- the standard error) was 4.46 (+/-0.12) log(10)(cfu per ml + 1), and the predominant isolates were bifidobacterium dentium, b. longum, scardovia inopinata, parascardovia denticolens, and alloscardovia omnicolens.

TI  == occurrence of the family bifidobacteriaceae in human dental caries and plaque.
AB  == despite the constant presence of members of bifidobacteriaceae in the human oral  cavity, few studies of their occurrence in this habitat have been made. the presence and the distribution in human plaque and dental caries of bifidobacterium dentium, scardovia inopinata and parascardovia denticolens, all belonging to the family bifidobacteriaceae, were studied. the identification to species level was based on morphological and growth type features, fermentation tests, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the soluble proteins and dna-dna homology. the three species, isolated on propionic acid trypticase phytone yeast  extract medium, were present in 13 out of 19 and in 11 out of 15 subjects examined for dental caries and plaque, respectively. s. inopinata was the species most frequently isolated in dental caries, whereas b. dentium was more numerous in dental plaque. the prevalence of p. denticolens was similar in the two habitats. in conclusion, the prevalence of bifidobacteria species (b. dentium, p. denticolens, s. inopinata) in relation to non-bifidobacteria isolates was significantly different in caries versus plaque samples (p<0.0001; chi2 test).
