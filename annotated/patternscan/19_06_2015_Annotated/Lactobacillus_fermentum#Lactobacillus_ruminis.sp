TI  == characterization of tetracycline resistance lactobacilli isolated from swine intestines at western area of taiwan.
AB  == to investigate the frequency of tetracycline resistance (tet-r) lactobacilli in pig intestines, a total of 256 pig colons were analyzed and found to contain typical colonies of tet-r lactic acid bacteria in every sample, ranging from 3.2  x 10(3) to 6.6 x 10(5) cfu/cm(2). from these samples, a total of 159 isolates of  tet-r lactobacilli were obtained and identified as belonging to 11 species, including lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus ruminis, lactobacillus kefiri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus coryniformis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus letivazi. based on the efsa (2008) breakpoints, all isolates, after mic analysis, were qualified as tet-r, from which the significant high tet-r mic(50) and mic(90) values indicated an ecological distribution of tet-r lactobacilli mostly with high resistance potency in pig colons. pcr-detection identified 5 tet genes in these isolates, the most predominant one being tet (w), followed by tet (m), (l), (k), and (q). their detection rates were 82.0%, 22.5%, 14.4%, 8.1% and 0.9%, respectively. noteworthily, isolates of the same species carrying identical tet gene(s) usually had a wide different mic values. furthermore, strain-subtyping of these isolates  by rep-pcr demonstrated a notable genotypic biodiversity % (average = 62%).

TI  == [analysis of the probiotic bifidobacterium and lactobacillus community in child intestinal flora].
AB  == to investigate the distribution of child intestinal flora and the composition of  its key probiotics community, study on intestinal flora of 21 chinese children (age 2 - 5) was conducted, which included bacteria isolation and counting, 16s rdna sequencing and homology analysis. for identification of the key probiotics such as bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in children feces at the species level, the specific primers im26/im3 and l159/l677 for pcr amplification of partial 16s  rdna were used. the results show that the composition of child intestinal flora is was relatively stable and almost same to the intestinal flora of the youth (age 20 - 25). culture-based approaches show that the key probiotic community in  feces at the species level was highly different in composition and numbers from individual to individual. b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum, which are detected  at levels of 10(7) cfu/g (wet) in samples and the detection rates are 90.48% and  85.71% respectively, are believed to be major bifidobacterial species in child intestinal microbiota. in addition, b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. infantis and  b. thermacidophium have also been found. l. mucosae, l. fermentum, l. salivarius, l. ruminis, l. gasseri and l. plantarum are isolated from the stools. l. mucosae  (3.68 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 71.43%) and l. fermentum (3.97 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 52.38%) are two dominant species of lactobacillus. study on chinese child intestinal flora, especially on the compositions and numbers of key probiotics in the feces will be very helpful to the development of effective probiotics in future.

TI  == the identification of vaginal lactobacillus species and the demographic and microbiologic characteristics of women colonized by these species.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus has been reported to be the predominant vaginal species. vaginal lactobacilli isolated from 215 sexually active women were identified using whole-chromosomal dna probes to 20 american type culture collection lactobacillus strains. most women were colonized by l. crispatus (32%), followed by l. jensenii (23%), a previously undescribed species designated l. 1086v (15%), l. gasseri (5%), l. fermentum (0.3%), l. oris (0.3%), l. reuteri  (0.3%), l. ruminis (0.3%), and l. vaginalis (0.3%). h2o2 was produced by 95% of l. crispatus and 94% of l. jensenii isolates, compared with only 9% of l. 1086v.  colonization by l. crispatus or l. jensenii was positively associated with being  white (p<.001), age >/=20 years (p=.05), barrier contraceptive usage (p=.008), and lower frequency of bacterial vaginosis (p<.001) and gonorrhea (p=.03). l. crispatus and l. jensenii, not l. acidophilus, are the most common species of vaginal lactobacilli.

TI  == [lactic bacteria in the digestive tract of poultry].
AB  == lactic bacteria predominate in the microflora of the digestive tract of chicken and turkey. they are represented mainly by lactobacillus acidophilus, l. salivarius, l. fermentum and l. buchneri. streptococcus faecium is always isolated. l. ruminis, l. vitulinus, l. delbrueckii, l. coryniformis and l. viridescens were found in this ecological niche for the first time. s. faecium and s. faecalis prevail in the digestive tract of geese and ducks, while lactobacilli are detected in a lesser amount and are represented mainly by l. plantarum. l. salivarius cells isolated from the digestive tract of poultry are highly polymorphous. most of the lactic acid bacteria found in the digestive tract of poultry can grow at 45-50 degrees c whatever is the species they belong  to.

TI  == a phylogenetic analysis of lactobacilli, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc  mesenteroides.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. brevis, l. plantarum, l.  ruminis, l. casei, l. bifermentans, l. viridescens, l. fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16 s ribosomal rnas. all lactobacillus species investigated together with p. pentosaceus and l. mesenteroides form a phylogenetically coherent and ancient group. l. acidophilus and l. helveticus is  the only closely related pair of species; all other species are only remotely related among each other, indicating that they are well-defined species. lactobacillus, together with streptococcus and bacillus, constitute a super-cluster within the 'clostridium' sub-branch of gram-positive eubacteria showing a low guanine plus cytosine content of their deoxyribonucleic acid.
