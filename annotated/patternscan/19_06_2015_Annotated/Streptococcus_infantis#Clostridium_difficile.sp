TI  == effects of probiotics and antibiotics on the intestinal homeostasis in a computer controlled model of the large intestine.
AB  == background: antibiotic associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection are frequent complications of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. probiotic bacteria are used as therapeutic and preventive agents in these disorders, but the exact functional mechanisms and the mode of action are poorly understood. the effects of clindamycin and the probiotic mixture vsl#3 (containing the 8 bacterial strains streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) consecutively or in combination were investigated and compared to controls without therapy using a standardized human fecal microbiota in a computer-controlled in vitro model of large intestine. microbial metabolites (short chain fatty acids, lactate, branched chain fatty acids, and ammonia) and the intestinal microbiota were analyzed. results: compared to controls and combination therapy, short chain fatty acids and lactate, but also ammonia and branched chain fatty acids, were increased under probiotic therapy. the metabolic pattern under combined therapy with antibiotics and probiotics had the most beneficial and consistent effect on intestinal metabolic profiles. the intestinal microbiota showed a decrease in several indigenous bacterial groups under antibiotic therapy, there was no significant recovery of these groups when the antibiotic therapy was followed by administration of probiotics. simultaneous application of anti- and probiotics had a stabilizing effect on the intestinal microbiota with increased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. conclusions: administration of vsl#3 parallel with the clindamycin therapy had a beneficial and stabilizing effect on the intestinal metabolic homeostasis by decreasing toxic metabolites and protecting the endogenic microbiota from destruction. probiotics could be a reasonable strategy in prevention of antibiotic associated  disturbances of the intestinal homeostasis and disorders.

TI  == identification and screening for antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species isolated from healthy infant faeces.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile of 109 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from 32 healthy korean infants was measured. the ability  to show similar activity against escherichia coli o157:h7 and staphylococcus aureus was also looked for. twelve of the 109 lab showed activity against c. difficile and 19 strains were active against e. coli o157:h7, but none against s. aureus. four strains had antimicrobial activity against both c. difficile and e.  coli o157:h7. of the 12 strains that had activity against c. difficile, four strains were excluded as streptococcus species, while the other eight were identified using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays using group-specific primers designed from the nucleotide sequences of the 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer (its) regions of the bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species. based on the sequencing results, the eight strains screened were identified as bifidobacterium infantis and lactobacillus salivarius.

TI  == the intestinal microflora of infants: composition of fecal flora in breast-fed and bottle-fed infants.
AB  == the fecal flora of 35 breast-fed and 35 bottle-fed babies was determined. bifidobacteria were the predominant fecal bacteria in both groups. conversely, the counts of most of the other bacteria, such as bacteroides, eubacteria, peptococci, veillonella, clostridia, enterobacteria, streptococci, and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. the frequencies of occurrence of lecithinase positive clostridia, clostridia-others, pseudomonas and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. twenty-one genera and 103 species or biovars of microorganisms were isolated from the feces of the breast-fed group and 20 genera and 97 species or biovars from the bottle-fed group. the organism that showed the highest number and the highest frequency of occurrence in both groups was bifidobacterium breve. bifidobacterium infantis, which was formerly the most prevalent bifidobacterium species in baby feces, was  never isolated in this study. further, the counts and incidences of clostridium paraputrificum, c. perfringens, and bacillus subtilis, the counts of c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, streptococcus bovis, s. faecalis, and s. faecium and the incidences of c. difficile, c. tertium, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bottle-fed infants were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed infants.
