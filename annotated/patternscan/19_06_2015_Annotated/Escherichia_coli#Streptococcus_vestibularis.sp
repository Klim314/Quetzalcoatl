TI  == evaluation of an ethidium monoazide-enhanced 16s rdna real-time polymerase chain  reaction assay for bacterial screening of platelet concentrates and comparison with automated culture.
AB  == background: culture-based systems are currently the preferred means for bacterial screening of platelet (plt) concentrates. alternative bacterial detection techniques based on nucleic acid amplification have also been developed but these have yet to be fully evaluated. in this study we evaluate a novel 16s rdna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay and compare its performance with automated  culture. study design and methods: a total of 2050 time-expired, 176 fresh, and 400 initial-reactive plt packs were tested by real-time pcr using broadly reactive 16s primers and a "universal" probe (taqman, invitrogen). plts were also tested using a microbial detection system (bact/alert, biomerieux) under aerobic  and anaerobic conditions. results: seven of 2050 (0.34%) time-expired plts were found repeat reactive by pcr on the initial nucleic acid extract but none of these was confirmed positive on testing frozen second aliquots. bact/alert testing also failed to confirm any time-expired plts positive on repeat testing,  although 0.24% were reactive on the first test. three of the 400 "initial-reactive" plt packs were found by both pcr and bact/alert to be contaminated (escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, and streptococcus vestibularis identified) and 14 additional packs were confirmed positive by bact/alert only. in 13 of these cases the contaminating organisms were identified as anaerobic skin or oral commensals and the remaining pack was contaminated with streptococcus pneumoniae. conclusion: these results demonstrate that the 16s pcr  assay is less sensitive than bact/alert and inappropriate for early testing of concentrates. however, rapid pcr assays such as this may be suitable for a strategy of late or prerelease testing.

TI  == distribution of proteins similar to iiimanh and iiimanl of the streptococcus salivarius phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system among oral and nonoral bacteria.
AB  == in streptococcus salivarius, the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep):mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system, which concomitantly transports and phosphorylates mannose, glucose, fructose, and 2-deoxyglucose, is composed of the general energy-coupling proteins ei and hpr, the specific membrane-bound iiiman, and two  forms of a protein called iiiman, with molecular weights of 38,900 (iiimanh) and  35,200 (iiimanl), that are found in the cytoplasm as well as associated with the  membrane. several lines of evidence suggest that iiimanh and/or iiimanl are involved in the control of sugar metabolism. to determine whether other bacteria  possess these proteins, we tested for their presence in 28 oral streptococcus strains, 3 nonoral streptococcus strains, 2 lactococcus strains, 2 enterococcus strains, 2 bacillus strains, 1 lactobacillus strain, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. three approaches were used to determine whether the iiiman proteins were present in these bacteria: (i) western blot (immunoblot) analysis of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, using anti-iiimanh and anti-iiimanh rabbit  polyclonal antibodies; (ii) analysis of pep-dependent phosphoproteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and (iii) inhibition by anti-iiiman antibodies of the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose (a mannose analog) by crude cellular extracts. only the species s. salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis possessed the two forms of iiiman. fifteen other streptococcal species possessed one protein with a molecular weight between 35,200 and 38,900 that cross-reacted with both antibodies. in the case of 9 species, a protein possessing the same electrophoretic mobility was phosphorylated at the expense of pep. no such phosphoprotein, however, could be detected in the other six species. a iii(man)-like protein with a molecular weight of 35,500 was also detected in lactobacillus casei by western blot experiments as well as by pep-dependent phosphoprotein analysis, and a protein with a molecular weight of 38,900 that cross-reacted with anti-iii(man) antibodies was detected in lactococcus lactis. in several cases, the involvement  of these putative iii(man) proteins in the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose was substantiated by the inhibition of phosphorylation activity of anti-iii(man) antibodies. no proteins cross-reacting with anti-iii(man) antibodies were detected in enterococci, bacilli, and e. coli. in s. aureus, a membrane protein with a molecular weight of 50,000 reacted strongly with the antibodies. this protein, however, was not phosphorylated at the expense of pep.
