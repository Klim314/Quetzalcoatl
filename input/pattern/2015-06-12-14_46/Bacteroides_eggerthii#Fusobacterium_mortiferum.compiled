TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Bacteroides and other genera of Gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  - A numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of Bacteroides, Polyphyromonas, Prevotella [not Prevotella (Labroue, 1976)] and Fusobacterium. Isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. Computation of similarity coefficients was followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. At the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) Bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) Fusobacterium mortiferum, F. necrogenes, F. necrophorum, F. nucleatum and F. varium; (3) B. caccae, B. distasonis, B. eggerthii, B. fragilis, B. merdae, B. ovatus, B stercoris, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformus and B. vulgatus; (4) B. splanchnicus; (5) Porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) B. bivius (Prevotella bivia); (7) B. disiens (P. disiens); (8) B. intermedius (P. intermedia);and (9) B. melaninogenicus (P. melaninogenica). Single isolates of B. ruminicola (P. ruminicola), B. denticola (P. denticola) and B. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.
TI  - Beta-lactamase production and susceptibilities to amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ticarcillin, ticarcillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, imipenem, and metronidazole of 320 non-Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides isolates and 129 fusobacteria from 28 U.S. centers.
AB  - beta-Lactamase production (nitrocefin disk method) and agar dilution susceptibility of amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ticarcillin, ticarcillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, imipenem, and metronidazole were determined for 320 Bacteroides species (not Bacteroides fragilis group) and 129 fusobacteria from 28 U.S. centers. Overall, 64.7% of Bacteroides species and 41.1% of fusobacteria were beta-lactamase positive. Among the Bacteroides species, positivity rates were highest for B. bivius (85.0%), followed by B. splanchnicus (83.3%), B. eggerthii (77.8%), and B. oralis (77.1%); 54.5% of black-pigmented Bacteroides species were beta-lactamase positive. Among the fusobacteria, Fusobacterium mortiferum showed the highest rate of beta-lactamase positivity (76.9%). MICs of amoxicillin (128 micrograms/ml) and ticarcillin (64 micrograms/ml) for 90% of all beta-lactamase-positive strains were reduced to 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively, with the addition of clavulanate. MICs of amoxicillin and ticarcillin for 90% of all beta-lactamase-negative strains were 1 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively, and greater than or equal to 98.4% of the strains were susceptible to the beta-lactams tested. Of the beta-lactamase-producing strains, 45.9% were susceptible to amoxicillin at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml and 93.4% were susceptible to ticarcillin at less than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml; the addition of clavulanate raised the rates to 90.4 and 100%, respectively. All strains were susceptible to cefoxitin, imipenem, and metronidazole. The activity of amoxicillin against 29 beta-lactamase-producing strains (10 Bacteroides species and 19 fusobacteria) was not enhanced by the addition of clavulanate; however, 82.7% of these strains were susceptible to amoxicillin, and all were susceptible to ticarcillin. Although beta-lactamase positivity is on the increase in non-B. fragilis group Bacteroides species and fusobacteria, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ticarcillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, and metronidazole should be suitable for the treatment of infections with these strains. The addition of clavulanate does not appreciably improve the efficacy of ticarcillin against these organisms.
