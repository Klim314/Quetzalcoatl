TI  == establishment of a sensitive system for analysis of human vaginal microbiota on the basis of rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr.
AB  == ten specific primer sets, for lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus crispatus, atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, chlamydia trachomatis/muridarum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, and bifidobacterium angulatum, were developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: lactobacilli such as l. crispatus, l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. certain bacterial vaginosis (bv)-related bacteria, such as g. vaginalis, a. vaginae, m. curtisii, and prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. especially in one subject, both g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic bv patient. these results suggest that the rt-qpcr system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections.

TI  == comparison of lower genital tract microbiota in hiv-infected and uninfected women from rwanda and the us.
AB  == introduction: previous studies have shown that alterations of the bacterial microbiota in the lower female genital tract influence susceptibility to hiv infection and shedding. we assessed geographic differences in types of genital microbiota between hiv-infected and uninfected women from rwanda and the united states. methods: genera of lower genital tract bacterial microbiota were identified by high-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna gene from 46 us women (36 hiv-infected, 10 hiv-uninfected) and 40 rwandan women (18 hiv-infected, 22 hiv-uninfected) with similar proportions of low (0-3) nugent scores. species of lactobacillus were identified by assembling sequences along with reference sequences into phylogenetic trees. prevalence of genera and lactobacillus species were compared using fisher's exact tests. results: overall the seven most prevalent genera were lactobacillus (74%), prevotella (56%), gardnerella (55%), atopobium (42%), sneathia (37%), megasphaera (30%), and parvimonas (26%), observed at similar prevalences comparing rwandan to us women, except for megasphaera (20% vs. 39%, p = 0.06). additionally, rwandan women had higher frequencies of mycoplasma (23% vs. 7%, p = 0.06) and eggerthella (13% vs. 0%, p = 0.02), and lower frequencies of lachnobacterium (8% vs. 35%, p<0.01) and allisonella (5% vs. 30%, p<0.01), compared with us women. the prevalence of mycoplasma was highest (p<0.05) in hiv-infected rwandan women (39%), compared to  hiv-infected us women (6%), hiv-uninfected rwandan (9%) and us (10%) women. the most prevalent lactobacillus species in both rwandan and us women was l. iners (58% vs. 76%, p = 0.11), followed by l. crispatus (28% vs. 30%, p = 0.82), l. jensenii (20% vs. 24%, p = 0.80), l. gasseri (20% vs. 11%, p = 0.37) and l. vaginalis (20% vs. 7%, p = 0.10). discussion: we found similar prevalence of most major bacterial genera and lactobacillus species in rwandan and us women. further work will be needed to establish whether observed differences differentially impact lower genital tract health or susceptibility to genital infections.

TI  == inhibitory effects of seaweed extracts on the growth of the vaginal bacterium gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == of 44 species of seaweed screened for potential anti-gardnerella vaginalis activity, 27 (61.4%) showed antimicrobial activity by the agar disk-diffusion method. among them, the strongest activities against the pathogen were exhibited  by chlorophyta, with ulva pertusa producing an 11.3-mm zone of inhibition at 5 mg disk(-)(1). the mic values of u. pertusa extracts against both g. vaginalis kctc  5096 and kctc 5097, the main cause of vaginosis, were 312 mug ml(-)(1), while the mic values against both candida albicans kctc 7270 and kctc 7965, the main cause  of candidiasis, were 2.5 mg ml(-)(1). against lactobacillus gasseri kctc 3173 and lactobacillus jensenii kctc 5194, members of the normal vaginal microflora, no inhibitory effect was seen even at 10 mg ml(-)(1). to identify the primary active compounds, a u. pertusa powder was successively fractionated according to polarity, and the main active agents against g. vaginalis kctc 5096 were determined to be nitrogenous compounds (156 mug ml(-)(1) of the mic value). according to these results, it was suggested that extracts of the seaweed u. pertusa are valuable for the development of natural therapeutic agents for treating women with bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == the composition and stability of the vaginal microbiota of normal pregnant women  is different from that of non-pregnant women.
AB  == background: this study was undertaken to characterize the vaginal microbiota throughout normal human pregnancy using sequence-based techniques. we compared the vaginal microbial composition of non-pregnant patients with a group of pregnant women who delivered at term. results: a retrospective case-control longitudinal study was designed and included non-pregnant women (n = 32) and pregnant women who delivered at term (38 to 42 weeks) without complications (n =  22). serial samples of vaginal fluid were collected from both non-pregnant and pregnant patients. a 16s rrna gene sequence-based survey was conducted using pyrosequencing to characterize the structure and stability of the vaginal microbiota. linear mixed effects models and generalized estimating equations were used to identify the phylotypes whose relative abundance was different between the two study groups. the vaginal microbiota of normal pregnant women was different from that of non-pregnant women (higher abundance of lactobacillus vaginalis, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii and lower abundance of 22 other phylotypes in pregnant women). bacterial community state type (cst) iv-b or cst iv-a characterized by high relative abundance of species of genus atopobium as well as the presence of prevotella, sneathia, gardnerella, ruminococcaceae, parvimonas, mobiluncus and other taxa previously shown to be associated with bacterial vaginosis were less frequent in normal pregnancy. the stability of the  vaginal microbiota of pregnant women was higher than that of non-pregnant women;  however, during normal pregnancy, bacterial communities shift almost exclusively  from one cst dominated by lactobacillus spp. to another cst dominated by lactobacillus spp. conclusion: we report the first longitudinal study of the vaginal microbiota in normal pregnancy. differences in the composition and stability of the microbial community between pregnant and non-pregnant women were observed. lactobacillus spp. were the predominant members of the microbial community in normal pregnancy. these results can serve as the basis to study the  relationship between the vaginal microbiome and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

TI  == comparison of the vaginal microbiota diversity of women with and without human papillomavirus infection: a cross-sectional study.
AB  == background: the female genital tract is an important bacterial habitat of the human body, and vaginal microbiota plays a crucial role in vaginal health. the alteration of vaginal microbiota affects millions of women annually, and is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes, including human papillomavirus  (hpv) infection. however, previous studies have primarily focused on the association between bacterial vaginosis and hpv infection. little is known about  the composition of vaginal microbial communities involved in hpv acquisition. the present study was performed to investigate whether hpv infection was associated with the diversity and composition of vaginal microbiota. methods: a total of 70  healthy women (32 hpv-negative and 38 hpv-positive) with normal cervical cytology were enrolled in this study. culture-independent polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to measure the diversity and composition of vaginal microbiota of all subjects. results: we found significantly greater biological diversity in the vaginal microbiota of hpv-positive women (p < 0.001). lactobacillus, including l. gallinarum, l. iners  and l. gasseri, was the predominant genus and was detected in all women. no significant difference between hpv-positive and hpv-negative women was found for  the frequency of detection of l. gallinarum (p = 0.775) or l. iners (p = 0.717),  but l. gasseri was found at a significantly higher frequency in hpv-positive women (p = 0.005). gardnerella vaginalis was also found at a significantly higher frequency in hpv-positive women (p = 0.031). dendrograms revealed that vaginal microbiota from the two groups had different profiles. conclusions: our study is  the first systematic evaluation of an association between vaginal microbiota and  hpv infection, and we have demonstrated that compared with hpv-negative women, the bacterial diversity of hpv-positive women is more complex and the composition of vaginal microbiota is different.

TI  == association between trichomonas vaginalis and vaginal bacterial community composition among reproductive-age women.
AB  == objectives: some vaginal bacterial communities are thought to prevent infection by sexually transmitted organisms. prior work demonstrated that the vaginal microbiota of reproductive-age women cluster into 5 types of bacterial communities; 4 dominated by lactobacillus species (l. iners, l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. jensenii) and 1 (termed community state type (cst) iv) lacking significant numbers of lactobacilli and characterized by higher proportions of atopobium, prevotella, parvimonas, sneathia, gardnerella, mobiluncus, and other taxa. we sought to evaluate the relationship between vaginal bacterial composition and trichomonas vaginalis. methods: self-collected vaginal swabs were obtained cross-sectionally from 394 women equally representing 4 ethnic/racial groups. t. vaginalis screening was performed using pcr targeting the 18s rrna and beta-tubulin genes. vaginal bacterial composition was characterized by pyrosequencing of barcoded 16s rrna genes. a panel of 11 microsatellite markers was used to genotype t. vaginalis. the association between vaginal microbiota and t. vaginalis was evaluated by exact logistic regression. results: t. vaginalis was detected in 2.8% of participants (11/394). of the 11 t. vaginalis-positive cases, 8 (72%) were categorized as cst-iv, 2 (18%) as communities dominated by l. iners, and 1 (9%) as l. crispatus-dominated (p = 0.05). cst-iv microbiota were associated with an 8-fold increased odds of detecting t. vaginalis compared with  women in the l. crispatus-dominated state (or: 8.26, 95% ci: 1.07-372.65). seven  of the 11 t. vaginalis isolates were assigned to 2 genotypes. conclusion: t. vaginalis was associated with vaginal microbiota consisting of low proportions of lactobacilli and high proportions of mycoplasma, parvimonas, sneathia, and other  anaerobes.

TI  == characteristics of lactobacillus and gardnerella vaginalis from women with or without bacterial vaginosis and their relationships in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == the objectives of the present study were to evaluate in vitro the production of antagonistic compounds against gardnerella vaginalis by lactobacillus strains isolated from women with or without bacterial vaginosis (bv), and to select one of the better lactobacillus producers of such a substance to be tested in vivo using a gnotobiotic animal model challenged with one of the more sensitive g. vaginalis isolates. a total of 24 isolates from women with and without bv were identified as g. vaginalis. a higher frequency (p<0.05) of this bacterium was observed in women with bv (56.7%) when compared to healthy women (17.6%). a total of 86 strains of lactobacillus were obtained from healthy women and women with bv. lactobacillus strains were more frequently present (p<0.05) in healthy women  (97.5%) than in women with bv (76.7%). lactobacillus crispatus was the predominating strain in both healthy women and women with bv. lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus vaginalis were isolated with an intermediate frequency in the two groups. in vitro antagonism assays were performed using as indicators 17 reference strains and the g. vaginalis strains isolated from women with bv and from healthy women.  lactobacillus isolated from healthy women showed the higher antagonistic activity against all the indicator strains when compared with isolates from women with bv. concerning the indicator strains, g. vaginalis found in women with bv was more resistant to the antagonism, particularly when lactobacillus isolates from women  with bv were used as producer strains. a high vaginal population level of g. vaginalis was obtained by intravaginal inoculation of germ-free mice, and this colonization was accompanied by vaginal histopathological lesions. a tenfold decrease in vaginal population level of g. vaginalis and a reduction of histological lesions were observed when the pathogenic challenge was performed in mice previously monoassociated with an l. johnsonii strain. concluding, results of the present study suggest that progression of g. vaginalis-associated bv depends in part on a simultaneous presence of lactobacillus populations with a low antagonistic capacity and of a g. vaginalis strain with a high resistance to  this antagonism. the results could also explain why g. vaginalis is frequently found in the vaginal ecosystem of healthy women.

TI  == detection of bacterial 16s ribosomal rna genes for forensic identification of vaginal fluid.
AB  == to preliminarily evaluate the applicability of bacterial dna as a marker for the  forensic identification of vaginal fluid, we developed and performed pcr-based detection of 16s ribosomal rna genes of lactobacillus spp. dominating the vagina  and of bacterial vaginosis-related bacteria from dna extracted from body fluids and stains. as a result, 16s ribosomal rna genes of lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii and atopobium vaginae were specifically detected in vaginal fluid and female urine samples. bacterial genes detected in female urine  might have originated from contaminated vaginal fluid. in addition, those of lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus gasseri and gardnerella vaginalis were also detected in non-vaginal body fluids such as semen. because bacterial genes were successfully amplified in dna samples extracted by using the general procedure for animal tissues without any optional treatments, dna samples prepared for the  identification of vaginal fluid can also be used for personal identification. in  conclusion, 16s ribosomal rna genes of l. crispatus, l. jensenii and a. vaginae could be effective markers for forensic identification of vaginal fluid.

TI  == strong correspondence in bacterial loads between the vagina and rectum of pregnant women.
AB  == we sampled the vagina and rectum in 71 pregnant women and bacterial loads of lactobacillus crispatus, l. jensenii, l. gasseri, l. iners, gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae were determined by culture and quantitative pcr (qpcr). culture and qpcr results differed substantially with regard to the evaluation of  vaginal and rectal occurrence of the six species tested. the vaginal-rectal prevalence of l. crispatus, l. jensenii, l. gasseri, l. iners, g. vaginalis and a. vaginae as established by culture vs. pcr was 32.3 vs. 91.5%, 32.3 vs. 77.4%,  28.1 vs. 91.5%, 12.6 vs. 68.5%, 12.6 vs. 74.6% and 5.6 vs. 69.0%, respectively. using qpcr, a significant positive correlation was found between vaginal and rectal loads of l. crispatus (p < 0.0001), l. jensenii (p < 0.0001), l. gasseri (p = 0.005), l. iners (p = 0.003) and a. vaginae (p = 0.002). in summary, significant correlations between quantities of vaginal and rectal lactobacilli and of atopobium vaginae were established by means of qpcr, indicating strong correspondence of vaginal and rectal microflora, not only in the occurrence of certain species in both niches, but also of cell densities per bacterial species.

TI  == individual and co-operative roles of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide in the killing activity of enteric strain lactobacillus johnsonii ncc933 and vaginal strain lactobacillus gasseri ks120.1 against enteric, uropathogenic and vaginosis-associated pathogens.
AB  == the mechanism underlying the killing activity of lactobacillus strains against bacterial pathogens appears to be multifactorial. here, we investigate the respective contributions of hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid in killing bacterial pathogens associated with the human vagina, urinary tract or intestine  by two hydrogen peroxide-producing strains. in co-culture, the human intestinal strain lactobacillus johnsonii ncc933 and human vaginal strain lactobacillus gasseri ks120.1 strains killed enteric salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344, vaginal gardnerella vaginalis dsm 4944 and urinary tract escherichia coli cft073 pathogens. the cell-free culture supernatants (cfcss) produced the same reduction in sl1344, dsm 4944 and cft073 viability, whereas isolated bacteria had no effect. the killing activity of cfcss was heat-stable. in the presence of dulbecco's modified eagle's minimum essential medium inhibiting the lactic acid-dependent killing activity, cfcss were less effective at killing of the pathogens. catalase-treated cfcss displayed a strong decreased activity. tested alone, hydrogen peroxide triggered a concentration-dependent killing activity against all three pathogens. lactic acid alone developed a killing activity only  at concentrations higher than that present in cfcss. in the presence of lactic acid at a concentration present in lactobacillus cfcss, hydrogen peroxide displayed enhanced killing activity. collectively, these results demonstrate that for hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus strains, the main metabolites of lactobacillus, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, act co-operatively to kill enteric, vaginosis-associated and uropathogenic pathogens.

TI  == comparison of main lactobacillus species between healthy women and women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: the normal microbial flora of the vagina plays an important role in preventing genital and urinary tract infections in women. thus an accurate understanding of the composition and ecology of the ecosystem is important to understanding the etiology of these diseases. this study aimed to compare the characteristics of main lactobacillus species between healthy women and women with bacterial vaginosis (bv) by quantitative culture and pcr methods. main lactobacillus species include l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. jensenii and l. iners. methods: a total of 150 women attending gynecology outpatient clinic of beijing friendship hospital, were diagnosed as having bv because three or more of the following criteria were met (standard of amsel's composite criteria): homogeneous discharge, elevated vaginal ph (ph > 4.5), production of amines, and presence of  "clue" cells. those with less than three of the criteria were considered as healthy. simultaneously, smears were made of vaginal fluid and gram stained, then were assessed qualitatively as normal (grade i), intermediate (grade ii), or consistent with bv (grade iii). gardnerella vaginalis were identified by using vitek 2 compact and pcr methods. lactobacillus species were identified by pcr methods. gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacilli colony counts were determined by  calculating the most number of colonies of each species in the appropriate plates (colonies between 10 and 300), corrected by the dilution of the sample in the plates, and multiplied by 10 (to account for plating 100 microl), in order to get colony forming units per milliliter of vaginal secretion. results: bv was diagnosed in 31% (46/150) patients using the composite criteria, the remainder being regarded as healthy. the majority of patients with bv had a smear assessed  as grade iii (91%, 42/46) and minority of them had a smear assessed as grade ii (9%, 4/46). the majority of healthy women had a smear assessed as grade i (64%, 67/104). smears assessed as grade ii were found (36%, 37/104) among patients diagnosed as healthy, with less than three of the composite criteria. l. crispatus was cultured from 94% of healthy women and 83% of women with bv, with the former colonies count average value of 10(6) and the latter of 10(3). l. gasseri, l. iners, and l. jensenii were cultured from 85%, 68% and 43% of healthy women; and 28%, 89% and 44% of bv women, respectively. conclusions: the quantities of four lactobacillus species except l. jensenii had a significant difference between healthy women and women with bv. our results provide support for the negative association between l. iners and l. gasseri. although l. crispatus were existent both in healthy and bv positive women's vagina, the numbers of l. crispatus were significantly different for the dominant number in healthy women. smears of vaginal fluid and gram stain play an important guiding role in bacteria culture.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == quantitative determination by real-time pcr of four vaginal lactobacillus species, gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae indicates an inverse relationship between l. gasseri and l. iners.
AB  == background: most studies of the vaginal microflora have been based on culture or  on qualitative molecular techniques. here we applied existing real-time pcr formats for lactobacillus crispatus, l. gasseri and gardnerella vaginalis and developed new formats for atopobium vaginae, l. iners and l. jensenii to obtain a quantitative non culture-based determination of these species in 71 vaginal samples from 32 pregnant and 28 non-pregnant women aged between 18 and 45 years.  results: the 71 vaginal microflora samples of these women were categorized, using the ison and hay criteria, as refined by verhelst et al. (2005), as follows: grade ia: 8 samples, grade iab: 10, grade ib: 13, grade i-like: 10, grade ii: 11, grade iii: 12 and grade iv: 7.l. crispatus was found in all but 5 samples and was the most frequent lactobacillus species detected. a significantly lower concentration of l. crispatus was found in grades ii (p < 0.0001) and iii (p = 0.002) compared to grade i. l. jensenii was found in all grades but showed higher concentration in grade iab than in grade ia (p = 0.024). a. vaginae and g. vaginalis were present in high concentrations in grade iii, with log10 median concentrations (log10 mc), respectively of 9.0 and 9.2 cells/ml. twenty (38.5%) of the 52 g. vaginalis positive samples were also positive for a. vaginae. in grade ii we found almost no l. iners (log10 mc: 0/ml) but a high concentration of l. gasseri (log10 mc: 8.7/ml). by contrast, in grade iii we found a high concentration of l. iners (log10 mc: 8.3/ml) and a low concentration of l. gasseri (log10 mc: 0/ml). these results show a negative association between l. gasseri and l. iners (r = -0.397, p = 0.001) and between l. gasseri and a. vaginae (r = -0.408, p < 0.0001). conclusion: in our study we found a clear negative association between l. iners and l. gasseri and between a. vaginae and l. gasseri. our results do not provide support for the generally held proposition that grade ii is an intermediate stage between grades i and iii, because l. gasseri, abundant in grade ii is not predominant in grade iii, whereas l. iners,  abundant in grade iii is present only in low numbers in grade ii samples.

TI  == lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginal microbiota of healthy women inhibit prevotella bivia and gardnerella vaginalis in coculture and cell culture.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate how human vaginal isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus crispatus inhibit the vaginosis-associated pathogens gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia. results show that all the strains in coculture condition reduced the viability of g. vaginalis and p. bivia, but with differing  degrees of efficacy. the treatment of g. vaginalis- and p. bivia-infected cultured human cervix epithelial hela cells with l. gasseri strain ks120.1 culture or cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) results in the killing of the pathogens that are adhering to the cells. the mechanism of the killing activity is not attributable to low ph and the presence of lactic acid alone, but rather to the presence of hydrogen peroxide and proteolytic enzyme-resistant compound(s) present in the cfcss. in addition, coculture of g. vaginalis or p. bivia with l.  gasseri ks120.1 culture or ks120.1 bacteria results in inhibition of the adhesion of the pathogens onto hela cells.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of atopobium vaginae.
AB  == background: previous studies have indicated that a recently described anaerobic bacterium, atopobium vaginae is associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv). thus far the four isolates of this fastidious micro-organism were found to be highly resistant to metronidazole and susceptible for clindamycin, two antibiotics preferred for the treatment of bv. methods: nine strains of atopobium vaginae, four strains of gardnerella vaginalis, two strains of lactobacillus iners and one strain each of bifidobacterium breve, b. longum, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l.  jensenii were tested against 15 antimicrobial agents using the etest. results: all nine strains of a. vaginae were highly resistant to nalidixic acid and colistin while being inhibited by low concentrations of clindamycin (range: < 0.016 microg/ml), rifampicin (< 0.002 microg/ml), azithromycin (< 0.016-0.32 microg/ml), penicillin (0.008-0.25 microg/ml), ampicillin (< 0.016-0.94 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (0.023-0.25 microg/ml) and linezolid (0.016-0.125 microg/ml). we found a variable susceptibility for metronidazole, ranging from 2  to more than 256 microg/ml. the four g. vaginalis strains were also susceptible for clindamycin (< 0.016-0.047 microg/ml) and three strains were susceptible to less than 1 microg/ml of metronidazole. all lactobacilli were resistant to metronidazole (> 256 microg/ml) but susceptible to clindamycin (0.023-0.125 microg/ml). conclusion: clindamycin has higher activity against g. vaginalis and  a. vaginae than metronidazole, but not all a. vaginae isolates are metronidazole  resistant, as seemed to be a straightforward conclusion from previous studies on  a more limited number of strains.

AB  == background: the microbiological diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is usually made  using nugent's criteria, a useful but rather laborious scoring system based on counting bacterial cell types on gram stained slides of vaginal smears. ison and  hay have simplified the score system to three categories and added a fourth category for microflora with a predominance of the streptococcus cell type. because in the nugent system several cell types are not taken into account for a  final score, we carried out a detailed assessment of the composition of the vaginal microflora in relation to standard gram stain in order the improve the diagnostic value of the gram stain. to this purpose we compared gram stain based  categorization of vaginal smears with i) species specific pcr for the detection of gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae and with ii) tdna-pcr for the identification of most cultivable species. results: a total of 515 samples were obtained from 197 pregnant women, of which 403 (78.3%) were categorized as grade  i microflora, 46 (8.9%) as grade ii, 22 (4.3%) as grade iii and 8 (1.6%) as grade iv, according to the criteria of ison and hay. another 36 samples (7.0%) were assigned to the new category 'grade i-like', because of the presence of diphtheroid bacilli cell types. we found that 52.7% of the grade i-like samples contained bifidobacterium spp. while l. crispatus was present in only 2.8% of the samples and g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were virtually absent; in addition, the species diversity of this category was similar to that of grade ii specimens.based on the presence of different lactobacillus cell types, grade i specimens were further characterized as grade ia (40.2%), grade iab (14.9%) and grade ib (44.9%). we found that this classification was supported by the finding  that l. crispatus was cultured from respectively 87.0% and 76.7% of grade ia and  iab specimens while this species was present in only 13.3% of grade ib specimens, a category in which l. gasseri and l. iners were predominant. conclusion: further refinement of gram stain based grading of vaginal smears is possible by distinguishing additional classes within grade i smears (ia, iab and ib) and by adding a separate category, designated grade i-like. a strong correlation was found between grade ia and the presence of l. crispatus and between grade i-like  and the presence of bifidobacteria. this refinement of gram stain based scoring of vaginal smears may be helpful to improve the interpretation of the clinical data in future studies, such as the understanding of response to treatment and recurrence of bacterial vaginosis in some women, and the relationship between bacterial vaginosis and preterm birth.

TI  == characterization of vaginal microflora of healthy, nonpregnant women by chaperonin-60 sequence-based methods.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to use a novel method that was based on  the application of chaperonin-60 sequencing to describe the vaginal microflora of 16 healthy women. study design: asymptomatic women consented for vaginal swabs to be collected at the time of a clinical pelvic examination. total genomic dna was  isolated from the vaginal swabs. degenerate, universal polymerase chain reaction  primers were used to amplify an approximately 555 base pair region of the universal chaperonin-60 gene, which is found in all eubacteria and eukaryotes, from the total genomic dna and libraries of cloned polymerase chain reaction products were constructed. library clones were sequenced, and the resulting sequences were assigned to taxonomic groups on the basis of similarity to reference sequence data. presence of chlamydophila psittaci sequences in the samples was confirmed by species-specific polymerase chain reaction. results: sixteen of the 23 women who were enrolled had normal flora by nugent's score of <4 and had adequate polymerase chain reaction product for assessment. vaginal flora libraries were dominated by a variety of sequences with similarity to lactobacillus spp l. crispatus, l. iners, l. gasseri, l. jensenii, and l. buchneri. other sequences that were identified included representatives of gardnerella spp, sequences with similarity to porphyromonas spp and megasphaera spp and sequences identical to c psittaci. conclusion: culture-independent, chaperonin-60 sequence-based molecular methods can lead to the identification of  greater diversity within defined taxa compared with those that are identified by  standard culture-based methods and to the identification of novel organisms that  were not previously associated with vaginal flora.

TI  == characterization and selection of vaginal lactobacillus strains for the preparation of vaginal tablets.
AB  == aims: to characterize and select lactobacillus strains for properties that would  make them a good alternative to the use of antibiotics to treat human vaginal infections. methods and results: ten lactobacillus strains belonging to four different lactobacillus species were analysed for properties relating to mucosal  colonization or microbial antagonism (adhesion to human epithelial cells, hydrogen peroxide production, antimicrobial activity towards gardnerella vaginalis and candida albicans and coaggregation with pathogens). the involvement of electrostatic interactions and the influence of bacterial metabolic state in the binding of lactobacilli to the cell surface were also studied. adherence to epithelial cells varied greatly among the lactobacillus species and among different strains belonging to the same lactobacillus species. the reduction in surface negative electric charge promoted the binding of several lactobacillus strains to the cell membrane whereas lyophilization reduced the adhesion capacity of many isolates. the antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli culture supernatant  fluids was not directly related to the production of h2o2. conclusions: three strains (lactobacillus brevis cd2, lact. salivarius fv2 and lact. gasseri mb335)  showed optimal properties and were, therefore, selected for the preparation of vaginal tablets. the selected strains adhered to epithelial cells displacing vaginal pathogens; they produced high levels of h2o2, coaggregated with pathogens and inhibited the growth of g. vaginalis. significance and impact of the study: the dosage formulation developed in this study appears to be a good candidate for the probiotic prophylaxis and treatment of human vaginal infections.

TI  == acid production by vaginal flora in vitro is consistent with the rate and extent  of vaginal acidification.
AB  == perinatally, and between menarche and menopause, increased levels of estrogen cause large amounts of glycogen to be deposited in the vaginal epithelium. during these times, the anaerobic metabolism of the glycogen, by the epithelial cells themselves and/or by vaginal flora, causes the vagina to become acidic (ph approximately 4). this study was designed to test whether the characteristics of  acid production by vaginal flora in vitro can account for vaginal acidity. eight  vaginal lactobacillus isolates from four species-l. gasseri, l. vaginalis, l. crispatus, and l. jensenii-acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic ph (3.2 to 4.8) that matches the range seen in the lactobacillus-dominated human vagina (ph 3.6 to 4.5 in most women) (b. andersch, l. forssman, k. lincoln, and p. torstensson, gynecol. obstet. investig. 21:19-25, 1986; l. cohen, br. j. vener. dis. 45:241-246, 1969; j. paavonen, scand. j. infect. dis. suppl. 40:31-35, 1983; c. tevi-benissan, l. belec, m. levy, v. schneider-fauveau, a. si mohamed, m.-c. hallouin, m. matta, and g. gresenguet, clin. diagn. lab. immunol. 4:367-374, 1997). during exponential growth, all of these lactobacillus species acidified their growth medium at rates on the order of 10(6) protons/bacterium/s. such rates, combined with an estimate of the total number of lactobacilli in the vagina, suggest that vaginal lactobacilli could reacidify the vagina at the rate  observed postcoitally following neutralization by the male ejaculate (w. h. masters and v. e. johnson, human sexual response, p. 93, 1966). during bacterial  vaginosis (bv), there is a loss of vaginal acidity, and the vaginal ph rises to >4.5. this correlates with a loss of lactobacilli and an overgrowth of diverse bacteria. three bv-associated bacteria, gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia,  and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic ph (4.7 to 6.0) consistent with the characteristic elevated vaginal ph associated with bv. together, these observations are consistent with vaginal flora, rather than epithelial cells, playing a primary role in creating the acidity of the vagina.

TI  == composition of the lactobacillus acidophilus complex isolated from vaginal flora.
AB  == one hundred and fifty human vaginal samples containing a diversity of pathogens or nonpathogens (gardnerella vaginalis, streptococcus sp., staphylococcus sp., candida albicans. mycoplasma sp.) were examined for their content in lactobacilli of the lactobacillus acidophilus complex. although all samples contained lactobacilli, strains of the l. acidophilus complex were present in only twenty-nine cases. isolates were further characterized and compared with type strains or reference strains in an attempt to differentiate by phenotypic means the genospecies of the l. acidophilus complex. data regarding specific activities of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) and of phospho-beta-galactosidase (p-beta-gal) provided no specific information at the species level within the l. acidophilus complex. dna-relatedness differentiates this genospecies. most lactobacilli isolated from the vaginal flora of symptomatic women were genotypically close to  l. gasseri cip 102991t by the technique of dna/dna hybridization.
