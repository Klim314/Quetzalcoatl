TI  == in vitro and in vivo effects of beneficial vaginal lactobacilli on pathogens responsible for urogenital tract infections.
AB  == the aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of beneficial human vaginal lactobacilli (lb) on urogenital pathogens through in vitro and in vivo experiments. co-aggregative and antimicrobial properties between five vaginal lb  strains and urogenital pathogens or potential pathogens (streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans strains) were assayed. also, associative cultures of lb strains and s. agalactiae were performed and bacterial growth, ph, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) were determined at different times. based on the results obtained, the in vivo studies were assayed  in mice with lactobacillus gasseri crl 1509 or lactobacillus salivarius crl 1328  inoculated intravaginally (i.v.) and then challenged i.v. with s. agalactiae. results were analysed by anova (repeated measures and general linear models). most of the lb strains increased the percentage of aggregation of s. agalactiae strains. only one strain (lactobacillus reuteri crl 1324) positively affected the aggregation of s. aureus and none increased the aggregation of c. albicans. the inhibition of the growth of s. agalactiae strains by production of organic acids  by lactobacilli was evidenced. the lb-s. agalactiae co-cultures showed a significant inhibition of the pathogen after 4 h and 8 h of incubation. parallel  increases in lactic acid and h2o2 levels were observed. however, in the experimental murine model, no significant differences were obtained in the number of streptococci recovered from the vaginal tract of control mice and those inoculated with lb. in conclusion, vaginal lb exhibited in vitro co-aggregative and antimicrobial effects on s. agalactiae strains, suggesting that they could be promising candidates for protection against s. agalactiae challenge. however, as  these effects were not evidenced in the murine model used, further animal studies under different experimental conditions should be conducted to evaluate the preventive effect of lb against challenge with s. agalactiae.

TI  == characterization of some potentially probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from iranian native chickens.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to isolate, identify and characterize new  lab strains with high probiotic potentials from iranian (isfahan) indigenous chickens. from 90 isolated labs, 11 isolates had high growth rate under different stress conditions, including acid (ph 2.5), bile (0.5% oxgall), salt (6-15%) and  temperatures 15 and 45 degrees c, and their aggregation time was less than 120 min. based on the molecular identification using 16s rdna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, the isolates belonged to two lactobacillus salivarius and  l. reuteri species. the isolates showed different tolerance to 16 clinically and  veterinary relevant antibiotics, and most of them were resistant to or semi-tolerant of 7-15 different studied antibiotics. the es11, es12, es3 and es13 strains with resistance to or semi-tolerance of 15, 14 and 13 different antibiotics, respectively, were the most tolerant strains. the selected isolates  showed a wide range of antimicrobial activity against 7 different pathogenic strains. all the isolates exhibited antagonistic activity against e. coli, enterococcus hirae, salmonella enterica and staphylococcus aureus. the isolates es6 and es11 with high antagonistic activity and resistance against 6 of the studied pathogens were the most powerful antagonistic isolates. the values and types of adhesion to the caco-2 cell cultures were significantly different (0-40  bacteria/caco-2 cell), and the maximum adhesion was observed for the isolates es6 and es13 with 35 and 40 bacteria adhesion/cell, respectively. finally, based on all the experiments, 7 strains, including es1, es6, es7, es11, es12 and es13, were selected for the further in vivo assays and possible use in the poultry industry.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == in vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of chinese crested and yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. thirty seven isolates were identified as lactobacillus or enterococcus. out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (lab) and belonged to the species lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other lab isolates were enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%).  strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (ph 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. all isolates produced low rates of  hydrogen peroxide. based on these results, two lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == functional properties of free and encapsulated lactobacillus reuteri dpc16 during and after passage through a simulated gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri dpc16 is a probiotic bacterium that has strong antimicrobial activities on pathogens, mainly due to its ability to produce reuterin, an antimicrobial compound. the objective of this study was to examine the ability of an encapsulation technique to protect the functional properties of cells of l. reuteri dpc16 during passage through a simulated gi tract. the functional properties of the cells were studied before and after passage through  the tract. an alginate-skim milk encapsulation system was used to deliver the probiotic bacterium through the simulated gi tract, allowing for the release of the cells into the simulated colonic fluid. the cells were then isolated and cultured. the recovered cells showed no diminution in functional properties, including their growth kinetics, ability to adhere to epithelial cells and ability to inhibit the adhesion of e. coli to epithelial cells. the bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of the recovered cells against some pathogens were significantly greater (p < 0.05) than those of the original cells. production of reuterin by the recovered cells was significantly greater than that of the original cells when cultured in mrs medium in the absence of its metabolic precursor, glycerol. the results demonstrate significant consequences for the application of the encapsulation technique to protect and/or enhance the functional properties of the probiotic cells.

TI  == adhesion forces and coaggregation between vaginal staphylococci and lactobacilli.
AB  == urogenital infections are the most common ailments afflicting women. they are treated with dated antimicrobials whose efficacy is diminishing. the process of infection involves pathogen adhesion and displacement of indigenous lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus jensenii. an alternative therapeutic approach to antimicrobial therapy is to reestablish lactobacilli in this microbiome through probiotic administration. we hypothesized that lactobacilli displaying strong adhesion forces with pathogens would facilitate coaggregation between the two strains, ultimately explaining the elimination of pathogens seen in vivo. using atomic force microscopy, we found that adhesion forces between lactobacilli and three virulent toxic shock syndrome toxin 1-producing staphylococcus aureus strains, were significantly stronger (2.2-6.4 nn) than between staphylococcal pairs (2.2-3.4 nn), especially for the probiotic lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 (4.0-6.4 nn) after 120 s of bond-strengthening. moreover, stronger adhesion forces resulted in significantly larger coaggregates. adhesion between the bacteria occurred instantly upon contact and matured within one to two minutes, demonstrating the potential for rapid anti-pathogen effects using a probiotic. coaggregation is one of the recognized mechanisms through which lactobacilli can  exert their probiotic effects to create a hostile micro-environment around a pathogen. with antimicrobial options fading, it therewith becomes increasingly important to identify lactobacilli that bind strongly with pathogens.

TI  == lactobacillus reuteri protects epidermal keratinocytes from staphylococcus aureus-induced cell death by competitive exclusion.
AB  == recent studies have suggested that the topical application of probiotic bacteria  can improve skin health or combat disease. we have utilized a primary human keratinocyte culture model to investigate whether probiotic bacteria can inhibit  staphylococcus aureus infection. evaluation of the candidate probiotics lactobacillus reuteri atcc 55730, lactobacillus rhamnosus ac413, and lactobacillus salivarius ucc118 demonstrated that both l. reuteri and l. rhamnosus, but not l. salivarius, reduced s. aureus-induced keratinocyte cell death in both undifferentiated and differentiated keratinocytes. keratinocyte survival was significantly higher if the probiotic was applied prior to (p < 0.01) or simultaneously with (p < 0.01) infection with s. aureus but not when added after infection had commenced (p > 0.05). the protective effect of l. reuteri was not dependent on the elaboration of inhibitory substances such as lactic acid. l. reuteri inhibited adherence of s. aureus to keratinocytes by competitive exclusion (p = 0.026). l. salivarius ucc118, however, did not inhibit s. aureus from adhering to keratinocytes (p > 0.05) and did not protect keratinocyte viability. s. aureus utilizes the alpha5beta1 integrin to adhere to  keratinocytes, and blocking of this integrin resulted in a protective effect similar to that observed with probiotics (p = 0.03). this suggests that the protective mechanism for l. reuteri-mediated protection of keratinocytes was by competitive exclusion of the pathogen from its binding sites on the cells. our results suggest that use of a topical probiotic prophylactically could inhibit the colonization of skin by s. aureus and thus aid in the prevention of infection.

TI  == lactobacillus species shift in distal esophagus of high-fat-diet-fed rats.
AB  == aim: to analyze the microbiota shift in the distal esophagus of sprague-dawley rats fed a high-fat diet. methods: twenty sprague-dawley rats were divided into high-fat diet and normal control groups of 10 rats each. the composition of microbiota in the mucosa from the distal esophagus was analyzed based on selective culture. a variety of lactobacillus species were identified by molecular biological techniques. bacterial dna from lactobacillus colonies was extracted, and 16s rdna was amplified by pcr using bacterial universal primers. the amplified 16s rdna products were separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). every single band was purified from the gel and sent to be sequenced. results: based on mucosal bacterial culturing in the distal esophagus, staphylococcus aureus was absent, and total anaerobes and lactobacillus species were decreased significantly in the high-fat diet group compared with the normal control group (p < 0.01). detailed dgge analysis on the  composition of lactobacillus species in the distal esophagus revealed that lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri (l. gasseri) and lactobacillus reuteri (l. reuteri) comprised the lactobacillus species in the high-fat diet group, while the composition of lactobacillus species in the normal control group consisted of l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii and l. reuteri. conclusion: high-fat diet led to a mucosal microflora shift in the distal esophagus in rats,  especially the composition of lactobacillus species.

TI  == identification and biological activity of potential probiotic bacterium isolated  from the stomach mucus of breast-fed lamb.
AB  == the lactic acid bacterium e isolated from the stomach mucus of breast-fed lamb was identified by sequencing of 16s rdna fragment and species-specific pcr as lactobacillus reuteri. its potential antimicrobial activity and ability to modulate immune system in vitro and in vivo was determined. the growth inhibition of potential pathogens decreased from staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica ser. minnesota to escherichia coli. the lowest inhibition activity was observed in the case of candida albicans. the ability of  l. reuteri e to modulate biological activities of human and mouse mononuclear cells was estimated in vitro and in vivo, respectively. the production of il-1beta by monocytes in vitro was significantly induced by l. reuteri e (relative activity 2.47). the ability to modulate biological activities of mononuclear cells by living l. reuteri e cells in vitro in comparison to disintegrated l. reuteri e cells in vivo differed. for example lysozyme activity  in vitro was inhibited while in vivo was stimulated (relative activities 0.30 and 1.83, respectively). the peroxidase activity in vitro was stimulated while in vivo was inhibited (relative activities 1.53 and 0.17, respectively). obtained results indicate that l. reuteri e is potential candidate to be used in probiotic preparations for animals and/or human.

TI  == lactobacillus reuteri-produced cyclic dipeptides quench agr-mediated expression of toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 in staphylococci.
AB  == the production of the staphylococcal exotoxin toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (tsst-1) by staphylococcus aureus has been associated with essentially all cases  of menstruation-associated toxic shock syndrome (tss). in this work, we show that the human vaginal isolate lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 produces small signaling molecules that are able to interfere with the staphylococcal quorum-sensing system agr, a key regulator of virulence genes, and repress the expression of tsst-1 in s. aureus mn8, a prototype of menstrual tss s. aureus strains. quantitative real-time pcr data showed that transcription from the ptst promoter, as well as the p2 and p3 promoters of the agr system from all four agr subgroups  of s. aureus, was strongly inhibited in response to growth with l. reuteri rc-14  cultural supernatant. alterations in the transcriptional levels of two other virulence-associated regulators sara and saers were also observed, indicating a potential overall influence of l. reuteri rc-14 signals on the production of virulence factors in s. aureus. s. aureus promoter-lux reporter strains were used to screen biochemically fractionated l. reuteri rc-14 supernatant, and the cyclic dipeptides cyclo(l-phe-l-pro) and cyclo(l-tyr-l-pro) were identified as the signaling molecules. the results from this work contribute to a better understanding of interspecies cell-to-cell communication between lactobacillus and staphylococcus, and provide a unique mechanism by which endogenous or probiotic strains may attenuate virulence factor production by bacterial pathogens.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  == this study assessed potential probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. five lactobacillus isolates identified as lactobacillus reuteri  f03, lactobacillus paracasei f08, lactobacillus rhamnosus f14, lactobacillus plantarum c06, and lactobacillus acidophilus c11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. all the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to caco-2 cells, particularly, strain l. plantarum c06 and l. reuteri f03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain l. rhamnosus gg. the strains l. paracasei f08 and l. acidophilus c11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. all the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both gram-positive (bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (escherichia coli and salmonella enterica) pathogens. moreover, the strains l. reuteri f03, l. paracasei f08, and l. plantarum c06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/ml after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees c. the viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/ml after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees c. in the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. technologically interesting lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.

TI  == characterization of lactobacillus spp. isolated from the feces of breast-feeding  piglets.
AB  == lactobacillus spp., referred to as ij-1 and ij-2, were isolated from the feces of breast-feeding piglets and analyzed for probiotic properties. according to the analyses of 16s rdna sequence, lactobacillus sp. ij-1 showed greater than 99% homology with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 20016(t), and lactobacillus sp. ij-2 had  greater than 99% homology with the l. gasseri atcc 33323(t) and l. johnsonii atcc 33200(t). the ph changes in the culture media of lactobacillus sp. ij-1 and lactobacillus sp. ij-2 were from 6.5 to 4.2 and 4.6, respectively. their respective resistance against artificial gastric acid and artificial bile acid led to survival rates of nearly 186+/-44% and 13+/-5%. neither strain produced the carcinogenic enzyme beta-glucuronidase. both strains inhibited the growth of  pathogenic microorganisms, such as listeria monocytogenes atcc 19111, salmonella  enterica kctc 12401, salmonella enteritidis atcc 13076, staphylococcus aureus kctc 3881, and bacillus cereus 3711, within 24 h of growth.

TI  == lactobacillus isolates from weaned piglets' mucosa with inhibitory activity against common porcine pathogens.
AB  == twelve lactobacilli isolates from mucosa of 3-5-week-old weaned pigs were found to exert good antimicrobial activity against common porcine pathogens (s. aureus, b. cereus, e. coli, c. perfringens). two of them produced in addition to lactic acid also considerable amounts of acetic acid, and 6 of them produced hydrogen peroxide and metabolites other than organic acids. isolates 4/26 and 2/25 (identified as l. crispatus or l. amylovorus) were inhibitory against most strains of s. aureus, b. cereus and e. coli, and especially the strain 4/26 survived well in simulated gastric and intestinal juice. diarrhea-causing e. coli o8k88h9 ent(+) was successfully inhibited by the growing culture as well as by the catalase-treated and neutralized supernatant of l. reuteri 12/26. mucin degradation and multiple resistance to antibiotics were not observed.

TI  == specific bifidobacterium strains isolated from elderly subjects inhibit growth of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == cell-free, ph-controlled supernatants of thirty-eight bifidobacterium strains isolated from healthy elderly subjects were subjected to antimicrobial activity assay. bioluminescent indicator strains staphylococcus aureus rn4220, escherichia coli k-12, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 14028 were used as targets of antimicrobial activity. the effect of nutrient depletion on the inhibition was eliminated with spent-culture controls. three out of thirty-eight  bifidobacterium strains were capable of inhibiting the growth of s. aureus. the inhibition was equal to 23.2+/-19.1% to 50.4+/-26.7% of the inhibition caused by  50 iu/ml nisin. reuterin-producing positive strain lactobacillus reuteri sd2112 was capable of 86.0+/-24.6% inhibition, but bifidobacterium lactis bb-12, a known probiotic strain, showed no inhibition. none of the strains was capable of inhibiting the growth of e. coli or s. enterica. the observed inhibition by bifidobacteria was related to hydrogen peroxide formation and possible production of heat-stable proteinaceous compounds. the results suggest that production of antimicrobial substances other than organic acids is not common among bifidobacterium strains typical of elderly subjects. however, specific strains were identified which showed considerable inhibitory activity against s. aureus.

AB  == one strain of lactobacillus salivarius, two strains of lactobacillus reuteri and  lactobacillus amylovorus, and two strains of bifidobacterium thermacidophilum with antagonistic effect against clostridium perfringens were isolated from porcine gastrointestinal tract. isolates were assayed for their ability to survive in synthetic gastric juice at ph 2.5 and were examined for their ability  to grow on agar plate containing porcine bile extract. there was a large variation in the survival of the isolates in gastric juice and growth in the medium containing 0.3% (w/v) bile. l. salivarius g11 and l. amylovorus s6 adhered to the ht-29 epithelial cell line. cell-free supernatant of l. amylovorus s6 showed higher antagonistic activity as effective as the antibiotics such as neomycin, chlortetracycline, and oxytetracycline against bacterial pathogens including c. perfringens, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio cholerae, edwardsiella tarda, and aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida.

TI  == antagonistic activity against pathogenic bacteria by human vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  == this study attempted to isolate lactobacilli strains from healthy vaginal ecosystem to search for a new effective antibacterial probiotic strain. the strains were identified and characterized for their probiotic properties including bile salt and acid tolerance, growth at acidic ph, their ability to utilize protein, starch, and lipid, the production of hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocin as well as their antibiotic resistance patterns. the antibacterial activity of the culture supernatant of these strains were tested against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae. salmonella typhi, and salmonella typhimurium. none of the strains inhibited the growth of gram-negative bacteria. contrastly, the culture supernatant of strain l 22, identified as lactobacillus reuteri, significantly inhibited all of the clinical  isolates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). the antibacterial effect of the selected strain l 22 was further investigated. in the presence of l 22, the bacterial growth was assessed in vitro by viable bacterial counting. the numbers  of viable cells were significantly lower in l 22-containing broth than those in the control by 6h. this finding clearly demonstrates that strain l 22 can produce an anti-mrsa effect. the antibacterial ability of the strain l 22 was fundamentally attributed to their bacteriocin production which can cause both cell inhibition and cell death.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the soy isoflavone genistein.
AB  == genistein, a radioprotective soy isoflavone and protein kinase inhibitor, blocks  the invasion of pathogenic bacteria in mammalian epithelial cells. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the direct effect of genistein on the survival and growth of the probiotic lactobacillus reuteri and selected opportunistic bacteria in vitro as a prelude to in vivo use for managing postirradiation sepsis. we evaluated the opportunistic bacterial enteropathogens escherichia coli, shigella  sonnei, and staphylococcus aureus as well as klebsiella pneumoniae and the non-pathogenic organism, bacillus anthracis (sterne). the latter two bacteria are found in the environment and may be of concern in irradiated individuals. a standard in vitro test was employed to evaluate the direct effect of genistein on the bacteria. this test involved determining bacterial colony forming unit (cfu)  counts at a single concentration of genistein. in the cfu assays, significant reductions in cfus were found for s. aureus and b. anthracis when cultured in the presence of 100 mum genistein. however, l. reuteri, e. coli, s. sonnei, and k. pneumoniae were not altered by in vitro culturing in the presence of 100 mum genistein. these results demonstrate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of genistein. furthermore, the use of genistein in combination with probiotics may augment the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapies currently used in the management of infections, including those induced by ionizing irradiation.

TI  == staphylococcus aureus adheres to human intestinal mucus but can be displaced by certain lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == there is increasing evidence that staphylococcus aureus may colonize the intestinal tract, especially among hospitalized patients. as staph. aureus has been found to be associated with certain gastrointestinal diseases, it has become important to study whether this bacterium can colonize the intestinal tract and if so, whether it is possible to prevent colonization. adhesion is the first step in colonization; this study shows that staph. aureus adheres to mucus from resected human intestinal tissue. certain lactic acid bacteria (lab), mainly commercial probiotics, were able to reduce adhesion and viability of adherent staph. aureus. in displacement assays the amount of adherent staph. aureus in human intestinal mucus was reduced 39-44% by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii. moreover, adherent lactobacillus reuteri, lc. lactis and p. freudenreichii reduced viability of adherent staph. aureus by 27-36%, depending on the strain, after 2 h incubation. this was probably due to the production of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide and possibly in the case of l. reuteri to the production of reuterin. this study shows for the first time that staph. aureus can adhere to human intestinal mucus and adherent bacteria can be displaced and killed by certain lab strains via in situ production of antimicrobial substances.

TI  == inhibition of expression of a staphylococcal superantigen-like protein by a soluble factor from lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 has previously been shown to inhibit staphylococcus aureus infection in a rat surgical-implant model. to investigate the basis for this, communication events between the two bacterial species were examined. l. reuteri rc-14 and staph. aureus newman were grown in a co-culture apparatus that  physically separates the two species, while allowing the passage of soluble compounds. using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2d-e), protein expression changes in staph. aureus were analysed in response to co-culture with medium alone, l. reuteri rc-14, and a lactobacillus strain that did not inhibit staph. aureus infection in the rat model. it was observed that one protein in particular, identified as staphylococcal superantigen-like protein 11 (ssl11), showed a dramatic decrease in expression in response to growth with l. reuteri rc-14. genetic reporters that placed both gfp and lux under the transcriptional control of the ssl11 promoter confirmed the 2d-e results. interestingly, using similar reporter gene experiments, it was observed that the staph. aureus p3 promoter from the staphylococcal accessory gene regulator (agr) locus also showed a decrease in expression in response to growth in the presence of l. reuteri rc-14. it was further demonstrated that l. reuteri rc-14 supernatant contained small unidentified molecules that were able to repress the ssl11 and p3 promoters, but the repression of ssl11 occurred independently of the agr system.  these results suggest that l. reuteri rc-14 has the potential to alter the virulence of staph. aureus via secretion of cell-cell signalling molecules.

AB  == ninety-seven lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from slaughterhouse porcine blood in order to select autochthonous lab strains for use as biopreservatives of this by-product. they were identified by 16s rdna sequencing; and their inhibition capacity was determined against four bacterial species frequently found in contaminated blood, i.e. staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas fluorescens and bacillus spp. the taxonomic study showed an unexpected low diversity of lab in blood, i.e. only 8 different species were found, from which just 4, i.e. enterococcus raffinosus, lactobacillus murinus, lactobacillus reuteri and lactococcus garvieae, amounted to more than 90% of all  isolates. inhibition tests in solid culture media proved that s. aureus and bacillus spp. were inhibited by most lab strains obtained from porcine blood. e.  coli was the indicator less affected by the isolated lab species. several isolates efficiently inhibited the growth of all tested indicators.

TI  == characterization of reutericyclin produced by lactobacillus reuteri lth2584.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri lth2584 exhibits antimicrobial activity that can be attributed neither to bacteriocins nor to the production of reuterin or organic acids. we have purified the active compound, named reutericyclin, to homogeneity  and characterized its antimicrobial activity. reutericyclin exhibited a broad inhibitory spectrum including lactobacillus spp., bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria innocua. it did not affect the growth of gram-negative bacteria; however, the growth of lipopolysaccharide mutant strains of escherichia coli was inhibited. reutericyclin exhibited a bactericidal mode of action against lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, staphylococcus aureus, and b. subtilis and triggered the lysis  of cells of l. sanfranciscensis in a dose-dependent manner. germination of spores of b. subtilis was inhibited, but the spores remained unaffected under conditions that do not permit germination. the fatty acid supply of the growth media had a strong effect on reutericyclin production and its distribution between producer cells and the culture supernatant. reutericyclin was purified from cell extracts  and culture supernatant of l. reuteri lth2584 cultures grown in mmrs by solvent extraction, gel filtration, rp-c(8) chromatography, and anion-exchange chromatography, followed by rechromatography by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. reutericyclin was characterized as a negatively charged, highly hydrophobic molecule with a molecular mass of 349 da. structural characterization (a. holtzel, m. g. ganzle, g. j. nicholson, w. p. hammes, and g. jung, angew. chem. int. ed. 39:2766-2768, 2000) revealed that reutericyclin is a  novel tetramic acid derivative. the inhibitory activity of culture supernatant of l. reuteri lth2584 corresponded to that of purified as well as synthetic reutericyclin.

TI  == antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
AB  == forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.

TI  == molecular characterization of a plasmid-borne (ptc82) chloramphenicol resistance  determinant (cat-tc) from lactobacillus reuteri g4.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri g4 contains a 7.0-kb plasmid (ptc82) encoding resistance to chloramphenicol (cm). determination of the nucleotide sequence of the genetic determinant (cat-tc) encoding resistance to cm on ptc82 revealed an open reading  frame for a 238-amino-acid cm acetyltransferase (cat) monomer. this structural cat gene, 714 bp in length, was highly related (ca. 95% nucleotide and ca. 81% amino acid identity) to the 648-bp cat gene from staphylococcus aureus plasmid pc194. a total of 6 bp transversions and 4 bp deletions was observed along the whole dna sequence of cat-tc compared to that of cat-pc194. to determine the activity of the putative cat-tc gene, recombinant plasmid puc8217 containing the  cat determinant from ptc82 was subjected to a maxicell analysis. the observed molecular mass of the synthesized protein, based on electrophoretic mobility, was in reasonable agreement with the 27.3 kda predicted from the dna sequence. this is the first reported nucleotide sequence of a cm-resistance determinant from l.  reuteri and also the first evidence of adding lactobacillus to the list of versatile bacterial genera which naturally acquire the cat-pc194 gene in the microbial ecological system.

TI  == molecular characterization of a plasmid-borne (pgt633) erythromycin resistance determinant (ermgt) from lactobacillus reuteri 100-63.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri 100-63 contains a 9.8 kb plasmid (pgt633) encoding resistance to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (mls) type b antibiotics. the restriction endonucleases acci, bamhi, bcli, ecori, ecorv, hhai, hindii, hpai, kpni, sali, and sspi were employed to establish a physical map of pgt633. next, genetic transfer experiments were conducted to establish the host range of  pgt633. the results revealed that pgt633 replicated autonomously and encoded constitutive resistance to erythromycin in a variety of bacterial hosts, including bacillus subtilis bd170, streptococcus sanguis dl1, staphylococcus aureus rn4220, and enterococcus faecalis 19433, as well as several lactobacillus  spp. a 2.2 kb bamhi fragment of pgt633 containing the genetic determinant (ermgt) encoding resistance to erythromycin was cloned into escherichia coli. determination of the nucleotide sequence of ermgt revealed a methylase gene 731 bp in length that was highly related (ca. 81% nucleotide and ca. 78% amino acid identity) to the ermc gene from s. aureus plasmid pe194. the leader sequences of  ermgt and ermc were identical except for a single base change at nt 51.

TI  == characterization of gram-positive broad host-range plasmids carrying a thermophilic replicon.
AB  == the cryptic plasmid pbc1 (1.6 kb) isolated from bacillus coagulans zu1961 was genetically marked with the genes for chloramphenicol and ampicillin resistance (cmr and apr) from the escherichia coli plasmid pjh101. the recombinant vector obtained (pcp49, 7.0 kb) replicated and expressed cmr in b. subtilis and cmr and  apr in e. coli. different shuttle vectors for gram+ bacteria were also constructed by inserting pbc1 into the staphylococcus aureus plasmid pc194. the smallest of these, plm6 (2.8 kb), containing essentially pbc1 and the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene from pc194, replicated in b. subtilis at  a copy number of 60. by electroporation, these plasmids were introduced and stably maintained in b. subtilis, b. amyloliquefaciens, s. aureus, s. carnosus and lactobacillus reuteri.
