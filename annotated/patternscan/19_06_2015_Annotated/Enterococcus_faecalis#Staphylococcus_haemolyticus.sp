TI  == decade-long use of the antimicrobial peptide combination tyrothricin does not pose a major risk of acquired resistance with gram-positive bacteria and candida  spp.
AB  == tyrothricin, an antimicrobial peptide combination produced by bacillus brevis consisting of gramicidins and tyrocidins commands broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria and some yeasts in vitro. the polypeptide and its  components have been used therapeutically for about 60 years in the local treatment of infected skin and infected oro-pharyngeal mucous membranes. though older studies suggest that resistance development of originally susceptible microorganisms towards tyrothricin is a rare event, data concerning recent state  of resistance are lacking. in the present in vitro study the susceptibility to tyrothricin of clinical isolates of bacterial and yeast origin from superficial swabs of the skin and mucous membranes of outpatients and inpatients obtained from clinical material in the second half of the year 2003 was determined. using  a microdilution assay, the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic and mic90, defined as the concentration that inhibits at least 90 percent of the tested strains) of 20 strains each of staphylococcus aureus of the variety mssa (susceptible to methicillin), staphylococcus aureus of the variety mrsa (methicillin resistant), staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium spec., candida albicans and candida parapsilosis was determined. all of the tested gram-positive bacteria turned out  to be highly susceptible to tyrothricin with mics </= 4mg/l. the tested yeast strains were susceptible to the polypeptide antibiotic as well, but (with mics of 16 mg/l and 32 mg/l, respectively) to a lesser extent. no acquired resistance of  the tested strains was determined, indicating that the risk of resistance development against topically applied tyrothricin is only marginal, if there is any at all. thus, long-term-, i.e. decade-long use of topically applied tyrothricin and its components in the local treatment of infected skin does not pose a major risk with respect to acquired resistance of originally susceptible gram-positive bacteria and yeasts, not even in the case of staphylococcus aureus, both with mssa and mrsa strains. the broad anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activity of tyrothricin combined with its lacking risk for resistance development make the antimicrobial peptide a valuable addition to our therapeutic armamentarium in the treatment of infected skin.

TI  == drug resistance and molecular epidemiology of aerobic bacteria isolated from puerperal infections in bangladesh.
AB  == puerperal infection is a common complication during postnatal period in developing countries. bacterial species, drug resistance, and genetic characteristics were investigated for a total of 470 isolates from puerperal infections in bangladesh for a 2-year period (2010-2012). the most common species was escherichia coli (n=98), followed by enterococcus faecalis (n=54), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=33), proteus mirabilis (n=32), staphylococcus aureus (n=27), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=22), and enterobacter cloacae (n=21). s.  aureus and acinetobacter baumannii were isolated at a higher frequency from wound infections after cesarean section, while e. coli, e. cloacae, and k. pneumoniae were isolated from community-acquired endometritis and urinary tract infections.  resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was frequent for enterobacteriacae, and was mainly mediated by blactx-m-1 group beta-lactamases. the ctx-m gene in e. coli from the four phylogroups was identified as blactx-m-15, and phylogroup b2 isolates with blactx-m-15 were classified into st131 with o25b allele, harboring  aac(6')-ib-cr and various virulence factors. carbapenemase genes blandm-1 and blandm-7 were identified in one isolate each of phylogroup a e. coli. methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates had type iv or v sccmec, including isolates of st361 (cc672), which is related to an emerging st672 clone in the indian subcontinent. this study revealed the recent epidemiological status of aerobic bacteria causing puerperal infections in bangladesh, providing useful information to improve clinical practice and infection control.

TI  == [pathogens of prostatitis and their drug resistance: an epidemiological survey].
AB  == objective: to investigate the epidemiological features of the pathogens responsible for prostatitis in the changshu area, and offer some evidence for the clinical treatment of prostatitis. methods: this study included 2 306 cases of prostatitis that were all clinically confirmed and subjected to pathogenic examinations in 3 hospitals of changshu area from 2008 to 2012. neisseria gonorrhoeae, mycoplasma urealyticum and chlamydia trachomatis were detected by nucleic acid amplification abi 7500, the bacterial data analyzed by vitek-2 compact, the drug-resistance to antibacterial agents determined using the whonet  5.6 software, and the enumeration data processed by chi-square test and curvilinear regression analysis using spss 19.0. results: the main pathogens responsible for prostatitis were found to be staphylococcus haemolyticus (30%), staphylococcus epidermidis (12%), enterococcus faecalis (9%), escherichia coli (6%), staphylococcus warneri and staphylococcus aureus (3%), mycoplasma urealyticum (8%), chlamydia trachomatis (5%) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (6%). statistically significant increases were observed in the detection rates of escherichia coli (chi2 = 17.56, p<0.05), mycoplasma urealyticum (chi2 = 8.73, p<0.05), chlamydia trachomatis (chi2 = 8.73, p<0.05) and enterococcus (chi2 = 8.22, p<0.05), but not in other pathogens. the resistance rates of gram-positive  bacteria to erythromycin and benzylpenicillin g were both above 45%, but with no  significant difference between the two, those of oxacillin (chi2 = 10.06, p<0.05) and cefoxitin (chi2 = 9.89, p<0.05) were markedly increased, but those of quinolones, gentamycin and clindamycin remained low, except rifampicin (chi2 = 11.09, p<0.05). the resistance rates of gram-negative bacteria to cefazolin and ampicillin were relatively high (mean 57.3%), and those to ceftriaxone (chi2 = 11.26, p<0.05) and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (chi2 =11.00, p< 0.05) significantly high; those to amikacin, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem remained at low levels with no significant changes. however, the resistance rates of mycoplasma urealyticum to ciprofloxacin (chi2 = 11.18, p<0.05) and azithromycin (chi2 = 9.89, p<0.05) were remarkably increased. conclusion: gram-positive bacteria are the major pathogens responsible for prostatitis, but escherichia coli, enterococcus and sexually transmitted disease  pathogens are found to be involved in recent years. quinolones and aminoglycosides are generally accepted as the main agents for the treatment of gram-positive bacterial infection. however, rational medication for prostatitis should be based on the results of pathogen isolation and drug sensitivity tests in a specific area.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == in vitro efficacy of various topical antimicrobial agents in different time periods from contamination to application against 6 multidrug-resistant bacterial strains isolated from burn patients.
AB  == aim: in vitro efficacy evaluation of eleven topical antimicrobials against multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria isolated from burn wounds of our patients. material and methods: growth of six mdr bacterial strains: pseudomonas aeruginosa (2 strains), staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli in burn-wound models was evaluated 24-h after application of the tested agents. four different wound models were created to investigate the role of time elapsed between inoculation of bacteria and application of the agents on their antimicrobial activity and efficacy. results:  the efficacy against all the 6 bacteria in freshly contaminated wounds was excellent in majority of the tested agents. the longer was the time interval between inoculation and application of the topical antimicrobial agents, the higher failure of the agents was observed. conclusions: topical antimicrobials play an important role in treatment of burn wounds, but they should be used according to their efficacy against bacterial strains present in patients' wounds. in cases where topical agents have been applied after 24 h, when formation of mature biofilm in the wound could be expected, it would probably not be possible to kill all the bacteria using topical antimicrobial therapy only.

TI  == comparison of antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation and conjugative transfer of staphylococcus and enterococcus isolates from international space station and  antarctic research station concordia.
AB  == the international space station (iss) and the antarctic research station concordia are confined and isolated habitats in extreme and hostile environments. the human and habitat microflora can alter due to the special environmental conditions resulting in microbial contamination and health risk for the crew. in  this study, 29 isolates from the iss and 55 from the antarctic research station concordia belonging to the genera staphylococcus and enterococcus were investigated. resistance to one or more antibiotics was detected in 75.8 % of the iss and in 43.6 % of the concordia strains. the corresponding resistance genes were identified by polymerase chain reaction in 86 % of the resistant iss strains and in 18.2 % of the resistant concordia strains. plasmids are present in 86.2 %  of the iss and in 78.2 % of the concordia strains. eight enterococcus faecalis strains (iss) harbor plasmids of about 130 kb. relaxase and/or transfer genes encoded on plasmids from gram-positive bacteria like pip501, pre25, psk41, pgo1 and pt181 were detected in 86.2 % of the iss and in 52.7 % of the concordia strains. most psk41-homologous transfer genes were detected in iss isolates belonging to coagulase-negative staphylococci. we demonstrated through mating experiments that staphylococcus haemolyticus f2 (iss) and the concordia strain staphylococcus hominis subsp. hominis g2 can transfer resistance genes to e. faecalis and staphylococcus aureus, respectively. biofilm formation was observed  in 83 % of the iss and in 92.7 % of the concordia strains. in conclusion, the iss isolates were shown to encode more resistance genes and possess a higher gene transfer capacity due to the presence of three vir signature genes, virb1, virb4  and vird4 than the concordia isolates.

TI  == acute gastrointestinal dilation in laboratory rhesus monkeys in the korea national primate research center.
AB  == acute gastrointestinal dilation is a medical condition in which the stomach and intestine become overstretched by excessive gas content. in laboratory monkeys, cases of bloating involving gastrointestinal dilation are rarely seen, and the cause thereof is not clearly defined. two rhesus monkeys in the korea national primate research center were found to suffer from acute gastrointestinal dilation. one of the monkeys showed severe gastric bloating after recovering from general anesthesia with isoflurane, where after it died suddenly. during necropsy, severe congestion of the lung was observed. the other monkey showed gastrointestinal dilation and died after treatment. during necropsy, severe dilation of the large intestine was observed. severe congestion was detected in small and large intestines. histopathologically, erythrocytes were found to fill  the alveoli and alveolar capillaries of the lung. in stomach, epithelial cells were found to be sloughed from the mucosal layer, and erythrocytes were found to  fill the blood vessels of the submucosal and mucosal layers. in small and large intestines, epithelial cells were also found to be sloughed from the mucosal layer, and inflammatory cells were found to have infiltrated in the submucosa (only large intestine) and mucosa. microbiologically, enterococcus faecalis and the pathogenic staphylococcus haemolyticus, which do not form gas in the gastrointestinal tract, were detected in the gastrointestinal contents of both monkeys. these results suggest that the cause of the acute gastrointestinal dilation in these monkeys was not infection by gas-forming bacteria, but rather multiple factors such as diet, anesthesia, and excessive water consumption.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  == the study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. the aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology  (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, pasteurella multocida, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, e. coli haemolyticus, arcanobacterium pyogenes, streptococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. no mycoplasmas were observed. the present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. during diestrus, e. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. vaginal presence of streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (p = 0.005). therefore, streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. among the 12 antibiotics tested, gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (p = 0.038). however, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. in conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during  proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.

TI  == double triplex real-time pcr assay for simultaneous detection of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus hominis, and staphylococcus haemolyticus and determination of their methicillin resistance directly from positive blood culture bottles.
AB  == we developed and validated here a double triplex real-time pcr assay to simultaneously detect and identify staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus hominis, staphylococcus haemolyticus and their methicillin resistance in a single reaction directly from gram-positive cocci-in-clusters (gpcs)-positive blood culture bottles. from august 15, 2009 through february 15, 2010, 238 gpc-positive samples were collected and identified by conventional methods as 11 methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 28 methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), 176 mr coagulase-negative staphylococci (mrcons), 21 mscons and two enterococcus faecalis. the double triplex real-time pcr assay was targeted and detected tuf, nuc and meca genes in the first tube and atle, gap and mvaa genes in the second tube which could be run simultaneously. the detection limit of the assay was found at 10(3) cfu/ml for the atlee gene, 10(4) cfu/ml for the mva gene and 10(5) cfu/ml for gap, nuc, meca and tuf genes based on seeding experiments. all staphylococcus species except two s. epidermidis were correctly identified by the assay. the double triplex real-time  pcr assay quickly and accurately detects s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hominis and s. haemolyticus and their methicillin resistance in a single reaction directly from positive blood culture bottles within 83 min.

TI  == [evolution in the antibiotic susceptibility and resistance].
AB  == over the last decade the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has been a growing problem, especially in some geographic areas, making useless most of the classical antibiotic therapies. the rapid emergence of resistant bacteria is  the result of different factors as the intrinsic microbial complexity, the growing attitude to travel of humans, animals and goods, the use of antibiotics outside hospitals, and the lack of precise therapeutic chooses for high risk group of patients. the antibiotic-resistance becomes certainly a serious problem  when a resistant pathogen, and often multi-resistant today, is present in an infective site. in fact in a recent estimate of the centre for disease control and prevention (cdc) about 90.000 deaths per year in the usa are attributable to  bacterial infections and in particular to resistant pathogens. it appears clear that the clinic relevance of this problem is the decimation of the sensible germs of the normal flora that leads to the upper hand of the only resistant bacteria.  the antibiotic therapy, in fact, select the resistance and each bacteria has developed a particular strategy to survive: mutations of the genetic content or acquisition of resistance genes from the external. among the gram positive bacteria, besides methicillin resistant staphyloccocus aureus, there are other pathogens such as coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis, some species of streptococci and multiresistant corynebacterium. the cons, eg. s. epidermidis, s. hominis and s. haemolyticus, are recognized as new important nosocomial pathogens and are not only responsible of invasive infections but have become in few years resistant to oxacillin (more  than 60%) and multiresistant. the unsuspected fragility of glycopeptides, which for 40 years have been the most important treatment against infections due to gram-positive bacteria, has posed the need for new antimicrobial molecules. among the therapeutic possible options there are linezolid, tygecyline and daptomycin,  but new other molecules are appearing in the clinical use like ceftobiprole and dalbavancin.

TI  == dna microarray for detection of macrolide resistance genes.
AB  == a dna microarray was developed to detect bacterial genes conferring resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics. a database containing 65 nonredundant genes selected from publicly available dna sequences was constructed and used to design 100 oligonucleotide probes that could specifically detect and discriminate all 65 genes. probes were spotted on a glass slide, and the array was reacted with dna templates extracted from 20 reference strains of eight different bacterial species (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis) known to harbor 29 different macrolide resistance genes. hybridization results showed that probes reacted with, and only with, the expected dna templates and allowed discovery of three unexpected genes, including msr(sa) in b. fragilis, an efflux gene that has not yet been described for gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == spectrum and antibiotic resistance of uropathogens isolated from hospital and community patients with urinary tract infections in two large hospitals in kuwait.
AB  == objectives: to determine the spectrum of microbial etiology and antibiotic resistance pattern of the uropathogens that cause urinary tract infections in 2 large teaching hospitals in kuwait over a period of 1 year. materials and methods: the vitek identification card system was used to identify the uropathogens. susceptibility of the isolates against 18 antibiotics was performed by the microbroth dilution method using the vitek automated system. in addition,  gram-positive bacteria were tested in parallel by the disk diffusion technique. results: the six overall most common isolates were: escherichia coli, accounting  for 47% of isolates in both hospitals, followed by candida spp. (10.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (9.6%), streptococcus agalactiae (gbs; 9.5%), enterococcus  faecalis (4.2%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.1%). amikacin provided the widest coverage amongst all the antibiotics tested followed by ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and piperacillin-tazobactam. for the gram-negatives, high resistance (26-63%) to  the beta-lactam antibiotics was noted, especially to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cephalothin and cefuroxime. resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was also high. none of the enterococci was resistant to the glycopeptides, but 38-60% of the staphylococcus haemolyticus were resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin. conclusion: these data show the high level of antimicrobial resistance amongst the uropathogens causing urinary tract  infection in the two hospitals studied.

AB  == pd-140248 is an isomerase inhibitor and topoisomerase ii inhibitor under development by parke-davis and co as a potential treatment for bacterial infection. although no details of active development have been published in the scientific literature since 1996, in september 1999, the company confirmed that pd-140248 is still in active development [338530]. the compound is one of two new pyrrolidinyl naphthyridines (the other compound being pd-131628) with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, including activity against quinolone-resistant bacteria. pd-140248 demonstrates strong in vitro activity, particularly against gram-positive bacteria, such as quinolone-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (s aureus), staphylococcus epidermidis (s epidermidis), staphylococcus haemolyticus (s haemolyticus), methicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant s aureus, streptococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae (s pneumoniae) and enterococcus faecalis (e faecalis). an mic90 value of 0.015 microg/ml was obtained against haemophilus influenzae (h influenzae) and moraxella catarrhalis [160129]. the (3r,1s) enantiomer, pd-140248, demonstrated a 1- to 10-fold enhanced activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms in vitro and in vivo compared to its stereoisomers, and has thus been targeted for further preclinical studies [133377].

TI  == [microbiological external quality assurance program (meqap)--evaluation of results obtained in sanitary epidemiological laboratories in 2002].
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate reliability of identification and determination of sensitivity to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics of some gram positive cocci strains in 34 sanitary-epidemiological stations. all laboratories  engaged in this study received 3 strains: s. aureus (s. aureus sc+ cf+, resistant to methicillin., or s. aureus sc - cf+, sensitive to methicillin), coagulase-negative staphylococci (s. epidermidis or s. haemolyticus or s. saprophyticus) and enterococcus sp. (e. faecalis hlar-positive or e. faecalis hlar-negative or e. faecium or e. gallinarum). all these strains previously were  identified in department of bacteriology of national institute of hygiene. of the 68 staphylococci strains tested, 66 isolates were correctly identified. among the 34 enterococcal strains studied the greatest difficulty in identification was caused by e. gallinarum strain--(8 out of 13 strains were incorrectly recognised). the determination of the sensitivity of the control strains to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents, generally was performed correctly in accordance with to the nccls and national recommendations. some incorrect results of the antibiograms were caused by an erroneous interpretation of the zones of inhibition.

TI  == microarray-based detection of 90 antibiotic resistance genes of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == a disposable microarray was developed for detection of up to 90 antibiotic resistance genes in gram-positive bacteria by hybridization. each antibiotic resistance gene is represented by two specific oligonucleotides chosen from consensus sequences of gene families, except for nine genes for which only one specific oligonucleotide could be developed. a total of 137 oligonucleotides (26  to 33 nucleotides in length with similar physicochemical parameters) were spotted onto the microarray. the microarrays (arraytubes) were hybridized with 36 strains carrying specific antibiotic resistance genes that allowed testing of the sensitivity and specificity of 125 oligonucleotides. among these were well-characterized multidrug-resistant strains of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and lactococcus lactis and an avirulent strain of bacillus  anthracis harboring the broad-host-range resistance plasmid pre25. analysis of two multidrug-resistant field strains allowed the detection of 12 different antibiotic resistance genes in a staphylococcus haemolyticus strain isolated from mastitis milk and 6 resistance genes in a clostridium perfringens strain isolated from a calf. in both cases, the microarray genotyping corresponded to the phenotype of the strains. the arraytube platform presents the advantage of rapidly screening bacteria for the presence of antibiotic resistance genes known  in gram-positive bacteria. this technology has a large potential for applications in basic research, food safety, and surveillance programs for antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == glycopeptide resistance in staphylococcus aureus: is it a real threat?
AB  == following the discovery in 1992 that resistance to vancomycin could be transferred in vitro from a strain of staphylococcus haemolyticus to staphylococcus aureus, the threat that a similar event could happen in vivo has existed. in 1996, the threat became a reality in japan followed by reports of low-level heteroresistant s. aureus from elsewhere in the world. however, the threat has not gone away; indeed it has become more intimidating within the past  2 years with the isolation of higher-level resistance to vancomycin transferred on a plasmid from enterococcus faecalis. the mechanisms of resistance are different in each of the types of s. aureus with reduced susceptibility to the glycopeptides: in one hetero-vancomycin intermediate-susceptible s. aureus (hvisa) and vancomycin intermediate-susceptible s. aureus (visa), cell wall biosynthesis is altered, hindering glycopeptide reaching its target, and in the other vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa) the target is altered. this review attempts to place into context the threat posed to patients by the appearance of  strains of s. aureus more resistant to one of the key therapeutic agents used in  our hospitals. it will do so by raising a number of important questions followed  by the presentation of experimental evidence that may or may not provide answers  that heighten or lower the threat.

TI  == [prevalence of aa(6')-aph(2")ia gene among high-level aminoglycoside resistant enterococci and staphylococci].
AB  == according to new reports the aac (6')-aph (2")ia gene is no longer the only gene  encoding resistance to gentamycin in gram-positive cocci and therefore the current method for predicting synergism aminoglycosides with bacterial cell wall  active agents in this bacteria may need revision. to further our knowledge of aminoglycoside resistance mechanism in gram-positive cocci in gdansk region we tested presence of aac (6')-aph (2")ia gene among 22 enterococcal (e. faecalis) and 41 staphylococcal (s. haemolyticus, s. aureus, s. epidermidis) gentamycin-resistant isolates. presence of aac (6')-aph (2")ia gene varied from 50% (n = 6) in gentamycin-resistant s. epidermidis, 80% (n = 10) in gentamycin resistant s. haemolyticus 88% in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (n = 25). in enterococcus faecalis this gene was noticed only in 59% (n =  22) of gentamycin-resistant isolates. these results suggest that spread of resistance gene among different species is limited and aac (6')-aph (2")ia mediated gentamycin-resistance mechanism is more common among mrsa and staphylococcus haemolyticus.

TI  == [composition of ame encoding gene in gram positive cocci--study on spread of aminoglycoside resistance].
AB  == aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (ames) are major factors which confer aminoglycoside resistance on bacteria. composition of six genes encoding ames (including lately described aph 2"-genes) was investigated by pcr for 16 clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis, 16 clinical isolates of coagulase-positive (s. aureus) and 13 clinical isolates of coagulase negative staphylococci (s. haemolyticus, s. epidermidis) collected in gdansk region (northern poland) in the years 1998-2001. diversity of ame encoding gene profiles (composition) was used to analyze spread of ame encoding gene among and within studied group of cocci. according to presence of particular genes we distinguish eleven different ame encoding gene profiles: seven profiles were unique for particular species while the most common was shared among s. aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci and  enterococci. regarding profile frequency statistical analysis (fstat, amova, cluster analysis upgma) shows: the difference between s. aureus and enterococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci, lack of difference between enterococci and  coagulase-negative staphylococci, higher variability within than between studied  species and presence of multispecies cluster. on the basis of the reports about ability of staphylococci to synthesis enterococcal pheromones, this finding lets  assume that spread of aminoglycoside resistance gene among gram (+) cocci is limited only by the ability of stains to synthesis or induction of synthesis conjugation protein.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

TI  == intestinal microflora in early infancy: composition and development.
AB  == the neonatal intestinal microbiota is a complex ecosystem composed of numerous genera, species and strains of bacteria. this enormous cell mass performs a variety of unique activities that affect both the colonic and systemic physiology. its primary activities include nutritive, metabolic, immunological and protective functions. most studies of infants have been based on faecal samples using the classical plating techniques with culturing on specific media.  the limitations of these methods must be taken into account when evaluating the varying results of the different studies. the establishment of the gut microbial  population is not strictly a succession in the ecological sense; it is rather a complex process influenced by microbial and host interactions and by external and internal factors. the climax intestinal flora is attained in successive stages. the foetal intestine is sterile and bathed in swallowed amniotic fluid. following delivery, multiple different antigens challenge the intestine of the newborn. the maternal intestinal flora is a source of bacteria for the neonatal gut. the bacterial flora is usually heterogeneous during the first few days of life, independently of feeding habits. after the first week of life, a stable bacterial flora is usually established. in full-term infants a diet of breast milk induces  the development of a flora rich in bifidobacterium spp. other obligate anaerobes, such as clostridium spp. and bacteroides spp., are more rarely isolated and also  enterobacteria and enterococci are relatively few. during the corresponding period, formula-fed babies are often colonized by other anaerobes in addition to  bifidobacteria and by facultatively anaerobic bacteria; the development of a "bifidus flora" is unusual. in other studies the presence of a consistent number  of bifidobacteria in infants delivered in large urban hospitals has not been demonstrated, whether the babies were bottle fed or exclusively breastfed. the predominant faecal bacteria were coliforms and bacteroides. according to these studies, environmental factors may be more important than breastfeeding in gut colonization after delivery. environmental factors are indeed extremely important for the intestinal colonization of infants born by caesarean section. in these infants, the establishment of a stable flora characterized by a low incidence of  bacteroides spp. and by the isolation of few other bacteria is consistently delayed. in extremely low-birthweight infants, hospitalization in neonatal intensive care units, characterized by prolonged antibiotic therapy, parenteral nutrition, delayed oral feedings and intubation seems to affect the composition of the intestinal microbiota. the gut is colonized by a small number of bacterial species; lactobacillus and bifidobacteria spp. are seldom, if ever, identified. according to the few studies so far performed, the predominant species are enterococcus faecalis, e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus. hygienic conditions and antimicrobial procedures strongly influence the intestinal colonization pattern.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. a total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa),  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, and peptostreptococcus spp. czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases  in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.

AB  == aims: to test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. methods: the bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 iu/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin b was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees c with five inocula of 14 bacteria. two yeasts  (candida spp) and one aspergillus were also tested. contaminated media were then  inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened  daily by visual inspection. the sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. results: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria  irrespective of the starting inoculums: streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and haemophilus influenzae. for micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal  only (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida kruzei, aspergillus  fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (sd 13.8, range 2-52). in cases of detection by the  blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. conclusions: blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.

TI  == inhibition by yeast killer toxin-like antibodies of oral streptococci adhesion to tooth surfaces in an ex vivo model.
AB  == background: monoclonal (ktmab) and recombinant (ktscfv) anti-idiotypic antibodies, representing the internal image of a yeast killer toxin, proved to be microbicidal in vitro against important eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens such as candida albicans, pneumocystis carinii, mycobacterium tuberculosis, staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant strains. ktmab and ktscfv exerted a strong therapeutic effect in well-established animal models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis. streptococcus mutans is the most important etiologic agent of dental caries that might result from the metabolic end products of dental plaque. effective strategies to reduce the disease potential of dental plaque have considered the possibility of using antibiotics or antibodies against oral streptococci in general and s. mutans in particular. in this study, the activity of ktmab and ktscfv against s. mutans and the inhibition and reduction by ktmab of dental colonization by s. mutans and other oral streptococci in an ex vivo model of human teeth were investigated. materials and  methods: ktscfv and ktmab were used in a conventional colony forming unit (cfu) assay against a serotype c strain of s. mutans, and other oral streptococci (s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius). an ex vivo model of human teeth submerged in saliva was used to establish ktmab potential of inhibiting or reducing the adhesion to dental surfaces by s. mutans and other oral streptococci. results: ktmab and ktscfv kill in vitro s. mutans and other oral streptococci. ktmab inhibit colonization of dental surfaces by s. mutans and oral streptococci in the ex vivo model. conclusions: killer antibodies with antibiotic activity or their engineered derivatives may have a potential in the prevention of dental caries in vivo.

TI  == microbiology of acute otitis externa.
AB  == objective: to isolate and characterize bacteria and fungi from acute otitis externa (aoe) and to obtain susceptibility profiles on each bacterial isolate. study design: prospective core series. methods: specimens were collected from the external canals of subjects with clinically diagnosed acute otitis externa. species-level identification for each bacterial isolate recovered was obtained by combining phenotypic and genotypic data. end point mean inhibitory concentration  (mic) testing was performed using national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) recommended methods. results: in alcon-sponsored clinical studies conducted in 1998 to 2000, microbiology specimens were collected from 2039 subjects (2240 diseased ears) by 101 investigators throughout the united states. a total of 2838 bacteria, 32 yeast, and 17 molds were recovered from 2048 ears clinically diagnosed as acute otitis externa. of the 202 bacterial species recovered, the species most frequently isolated was pseudomonas aeruginosa (38%). the next 10 species most frequently isolated were: staphylococcus epidermidis, 9.1%; staphylococcus aureus, 7.8%; microbacterium otitidis, 6.6%; microbacterium  alconae, 2.9%; staphylococcus caprae, 2.6%; staphylococcus auricularis, 2.0%; enterococcus faecalis, 1.9%; enterobacter cloacae, 1.6%; staphylococcus capitis subsp. ureolyticus,1.4%; and staphylococcus haemolyticus, 1.3%. susceptibility profiles of s. epidermidis isolates revealed the greatest frequency of high-level resistance to selected antibiotics (>/=8 microg/ml): 23%, neomycin-resistant; 11%, oxacillin-resistant; and 12%, ofloxacin-resistant. susceptibility profiles of s. aureus isolates revealed a lower frequency of high-level resistance: 6.3%,  neomycin-resistant; 2.7%, oxacillin-resistant; and 4.5%, ofloxacin-resistant. p.  aeruginosa with high-level resistance to quinolones (>/=128 mcg/ml for ofloxacin) was recovered from only 1 subject. likewise, resistance of p. aeruginosa to aminoglycosides was rare. twenty isolates had neomycin mics >/=64 mcg/ml and 10 isolates had gentamicin mics >/=16 mcg/ml. the coryneform isolates identified as  microbacterium otitidis had an intrinsic lack of susceptibility to quinolones (ofloxacin mics >/=16 mcg/ml) and aminoglycosides (tobramycin mics >/=32 mcg/ml and gentamicin mics >/=8 mcg/ml). conclusions: bacterial infections of the external ear canal are most often caused by p. aeruginosa. however, there are a great number of other gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species that are  recovered from patients with acute otitis externa. because of this diverse etiology, the best topical therapeutic choice for topical therapy is for the most potent, broad-spectrum (especially anti-p. aeruginosa) antibiotic available.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial sensitivity for czop were  also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen  species (1,913 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 178), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse; n = 98), methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse; n = 164), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), enterococcus faecium (n  = 91), enterococcus avium (n = 72), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp; n = 100), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp; n = 29), streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). czop possessed comparable antibacterial activities against mssa and msse to other cephems, and was also effective on mrse but not on mrsa. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. czop, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. an antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (cpr) and higher than other cephems. no antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, just like other drugs. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (ctm), cefepime (cfpm) and cpr, and that against s. agalactiae was also preferable. czop and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against s. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. an antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, ctm and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint mic of czop was 96.5% in mrsa, 93.1% in prsp, 60.0% in  pisp, 40.3% in s. haemolyticus, 22.3% in e. faecalis, and 15.9% in mrse. those resistance ratios were similar to those for cfpm, but e. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. in conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria was observed. the sensitivities of pisp and prsp to czop, however, was suggested to be decreasing.

TI  == proficiency of italian clinical laboratories in detecting reduced glycopeptide susceptibility in enterococcus and staphylococcus spp. using routine laboratory methodologies.
AB  == objective: to assess the ability of 59 clinical microbiology laboratories distributed throughout italy to correctly identify and detect reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides in staphylococci and vana-, vanb- or vanc-mediated glycopeptide resistance in enterococci. methods: eight test strains comprising three staphylococci (s. aureus atcc 29212 and two vancomycin-intermediate s. haemolyticus [11105301, 10030683y]) and five enterococci (e. faecalis atcc 29212, e. faecalis atcc 51299 vanb, e. faecium aib40 vana, e. faecalis v583 vanb and e. gallinarum aib39 vanc1) were distributed to 59 italian clinical microbiology laboratories. each isolate was blind-coded, and laboratories were instructed to identify the strains and test isolates for susceptibility to teicoplanin and vancomycin using their standard methods. results were assessed against consensus test results obtained by a reference laboratory. in addition, to complement data interpretation, laboratories were asked to provide retrospective routine test results from their respective hospitals. results: all 59 laboratories participating in the study completed the  susceptibility testing and provided data for analysis. a total of 53 laboratories provided retrospective routine data. overall, laboratories were able to identify  isolates to the genus level successfully. e. gallinarum and s. haemolyticus posed problems for species identification, with only 40.6 and 71.2%, respectively, of results reported correctly; most incorrect results were reported as 'other species'. for enterococcal test strains, vana phenotypes were detected correctly  by 96.6% of laboratories; vanb by 30.5% (e. faecalis atcc 51299) and 88.1% (e. faecalis v583); and vanc1 by 67.8%. for staphylococcal test strains, 28.8% (s. haemolyticus 11105301) and 23.7% (s. haemolyticus 10030683y) of the laboratories  were able to detect reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. errors in detecting vancomycin resistance in vanb and vanc1 enterococci were made with all methods, most noticeably by disk diffusion users. for staphylococci, most errors in reporting vancomycin-intermediate resistance occurred with disk diffusion and vitek (software version 5.04) users. overall, considerably fewer errors occurred  with the detection of teicoplanin resistance, especially for staphylococci. for 1999, routine results show that 41/1749 (2.4%) of e. faecium, 220/11 180 (2.0%) of e. faecalis, 29/24 927 (0.12%) of s. aureus and 54/22 102 (0.24%) of coagulase-negative staphylococci were reported as resistant to vancomycin. conclusion: italian laboratories are able to identify staphylococci and enterococci adequately, although all methodologies used have problems in identifying e. gallinarum and coagulase-negative staphylococci to the species level. while vana phenotypes were efficiently detected, problems were experienced in detecting vanb and vanc phenotypes. the majority of laboratories were unable to detect reduced vancomycin susceptibility in staphylococci adequately, especially with disk diffusion and older vitek systems. teicoplanin appeared useful as a marker for detecting vancomycin resistance, particularly with disk diffusion. should enterococcal vanb or staphylococcal glycopeptide-intermediate phenotypes become prevalent in italy, it is likely that they would be under-detected. new systems under development, such as vitek2, should improve this situation.

TI  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of gram-positive aerobic clinical  isolates. mics were determined by an agar dilution method on mueller-hinton agar  (nccls/eucast) and on isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/l free calcium (bsac). both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. daptomycin mics for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/l. for 99 of the 100 enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/l. for all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin mics were 0.016- 0.25 mg/l; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/l. for miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including lactobacillus spp., lactococcus spp., leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp. and isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin mics were 0.03-2 mg/l; mics for the seven isolates of listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/l. there was little difference between the results on mueller-hinton agar and  on supplemented isotonic agar the discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented isotonic agar. daptomycin was active (mics < or = 2 mg/l) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of e. faecium and l. monocytogenes (mics = 4 mg/l). our results indicate that daptomycin mics are independent of methicillin and vancomycin mics.

TI  == in vitro activities of rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. in a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), rwj-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)) of 2 microg/ml. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, rwj-54428 was 32  times more active than imipenem, with an mic(90) of 2 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was active against s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (rwj-54428 mic range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). rwj-54428 was eight times more potent than  methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml). for ampicillin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), rwj-54428  had an mic(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was also active against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. the potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; rwj-54428 mics ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. rwj-54428 was more active than penicillin g and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). rwj-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). this survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to rwj-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.

TI  == in vitro activity of monoclonal and recombinant yeast killer toxin-like antibodies against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == background: monoclonal (mabkt) and recombinant single-chain (scfvkt) anti-idiotypic antibodies were produced to represent the internal image of a yeast killer toxin (kt) characterized by a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity, including gram-positive cocci. pathogenic eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms, such as candida albicans, pneumocystis carinii, and a multidrug-resistant strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis, presenting specific, although yet undefined, kt-cell wall receptors (ktr), have proven to be killed in vitro by mabkt and scfvkt. mabkt and scfvkt exert a therapeutic effect in vivo in experimental models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis by mimicking the functional activity of protective antibodies naturally produced in humans against ktr of infecting microorganisms. the swelling tide of concern over increasing bacterial  resistance to antibiotic drugs gives the impetus to develop new therapeutic compounds against microbial threat. thus, the in vitro bactericidal activity of mabkt and scfvkt against gram-positive, drug-resistant cocci of major epidemiological interest was investigated. materials and methods: mabkt and scfvkt generated by hybridoma and dna recombinant technology from the spleen lymphocytes of mice immunized with a kt-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mab kt4) were used in a conventional colony forming unit (cfu) assay to determine, from a qualitative point of view, their bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae strains. these bacterial strains are characterized by different patterns of resistance to antibiotics, including methicillin, vancomycin, and penicillin. results: according to the experimental conditions adopted, no bacterial isolate proved to be resistant to the activity of mabkt and scfvkt. conclusions: scfvkt exerted a microbicidal activity against multidrug resistant bacteria, which may represent the basis for the drug modeling of new antibiotics with broad antibacterial spectra to tackle the emergence of microbial resistance.

TI  == a comparison of antimicrobial resistance rates in gram-positive pathogens isolated in the uk from october 1996 to january 1997 and october 1997 to january  1998.
AB  == rates of resistance for two consecutive years for 28 centres (10 teaching, nine associate teaching and nine district general hospitals) in the uk were compared.  combined rates of resistance for each of the hospital types of staphylococcus aureus to methicillin revealed an increase in the rate of resistance in teaching  hospitals (12.5% year 1, 23.5% year 2), but, for associate teaching and district  general hospitals rates fell (associate teaching 19.1% year 1, 11.9% year 2; district general 16.5% year 1 and 11.3% year 2). using conventional methodology to determine mics, no strain was considered to have reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. among coagulase-negative staphylococci, increased resistance was observed for staphylococcus epidermidis to rifampicin, for staphylococcus haemolyticus to clindamycin, for staphylococcus saprophyticus to penicillin and for staphylococcus spp. to clindamycin, methicillin and rifampicin. for streptococcus pneumoniae an upward trend in low-level resistance to penicillin was observed (18 of the 28 centres), however, for high-level resistance the trend was in the opposite direction (only four centres showed an increase). for enterococcus faecalis there was a trend to a fall in levels of resistance, the only exception being an increase in high-level gentamicin resistance (10.5% year  1, 15.1% year 2, p = 0.0388). for enterococcus faecium rates of resistance were not significantly different except for increases in resistance to nitrofurantoin  and rifampicin.

TI  == stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants.
AB  == aim: to serially characterise aerobic and anaerobic stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants and to correlate colonisation patterns with clinical risk factors. methods: stool specimens from 29 infants of birthweight <1000 g were collected on days 10, 20, and 30 after birth. quantitative aerobic and anaerobic  cultures were performed. results: by day 30, predominant species were enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterbacter  cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus haemolyticus. lactobacillus and bifidobacteria spp were identified in only one infant. in breast milk fed (but not in formula fed) infants, the total number of bacterial species/stool specimen increased significantly with time (2.50 (se 0.34) on day 10; 3.13 (0.38) on day 20; 4.27 (0.45) on day 30) as did quantitative bacterial counts; gram negative species accounted for most of the increase. on day 30, significant inverse correlations were found between days of previous antibiotic treatment and number of bacterial species (r=0.491) and total organisms/g of stool (r=0.482). gestational age, birthweight, maternal antibiotic or steroid treatment, prolonged rupture of the membranes, and mode of delivery did not seem to affect colonisation patterns. conclusions: the gut of extremely low birthweight infants  is colonised by a paucity of bacterial species. breast milking and reduction of antibiotic exposure are critical to increasing fecal microbial diversity.

AB  == the results of the bacteriological investigation of the secretion from the trachea, large bronchi and fauces of 36 newborns (including 27 preterms) with severe pneumonia were analyzed. 20 of them were born of women with complicating somatic, obstetric and gynecologic histories: candidiasis, herpes genitalis, chronic endometritis, adnexitis or chronic pyelonephritis that could be the risk  of the fetus intranatal infection. during the acute period of pneumonia in the newborns within the first 4-8 days of life mainly pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated (51.3 per cent), staphylococcus epidermidis, s. haemolyticus and enterococcus faecalis were less frequent (18.9, 8.1 and 5.4 per cent, respectively). klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus anhaemolyticus and other organisms were extremely rare. on the whole the gramnegative microflora predominated. the study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that the majority of the p. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to amikacin and polymyxin b, the isolates susceptible to ceftazidime were less frequent, 20-25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone and imipenem and practically no isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. the s.epidermidis isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and vancomycin and in rare cases to fusidin and amikacin and resistant to oxacillin. when the treatment course was more than 15 days, the isolates proved to be susceptible to 1/3 of the presently  available antibiotics. because of the host low protective forces, peculiarities of the infection pathways and high frequency of the resistant strains it is valid to include netilmicin, imipenem, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone to the complex therapy of the newborns along with the substitution immunotherapy.

AB  == during a 2-year period, 10 portuguese hospitals located throughout the country studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinically relevant staphylococci and enterococci. of more than 12,000 staphylococcus aureus isolates tested, two main  patterns were found, methicillin-sensitive organisms most of them resistant only  to penicillin but a few to other antimicrobials and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) strains (prevalence 48.2%) resistant to most of the antimicrobials  tested and uniformly susceptible to vancomycin. among coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), 71% of s. epidermidis (approximately 5,000 isolates tested)  and 84% s. haemolyticus (approximately 1,000 isolates tested) were also resistant to methicillin as well as most other antimicrobials except vancomycin. most of the 5,000 enterococcus faecalis isolates tested were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin, in contrast to 650 e. faecium isolates, 70% of which were resistant to ampicillin and 20% to vancomycin and all other antibiotics. a high prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance occurred in both enterococcus species. this survey showed that resistance profiles of staphylococci and enterococci hospital isolates have not changed in the last 5 years in portugal, with the exception of the rise in vancomycin resistance in e. faecium. the high prevalence of methicillin resistance in s. aureus and in the cns remains an issue of medical concern.

AB  == over a period of 5 years we have recovered 32 clinical isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) exhibiting either decreased levels of susceptibility or true resistance to teicoplanin (mics, 16 to 128 micrograms/ml); these isolates make up 0.55% of the total cons isolated by us. twenty-nine of the strains were also methicillin resistant, and all were susceptible to vancomycin.  fourteen of the strains were staphylococcus epidermidis, fourteen were staphylococcus haemolyticus, and four were staphylococcus hominis. in one case, a strain of s. haemolyticus was isolated with a vancomycin-resistant, teicoplanin-resistant enterococcus faecalis strain. all strains were nosocomially acquired and were isolated from 17 different wards. teicoplanin resistance occurred as a sporadic phenomenon, and none of the isolates were epidemiologically related. the isolates were from 30 patients, 13 of whom presented with true infections (43%). five (38%) of the 13 patients with true infections had been previously treated with vancomycin. none of the infected patients were previously treated with teicoplanin. the in vivo development of resistance to teicoplanin among cons strains limits the therapy of infections by  these microorganisms. there is a need for surveillance of nosocomial isolates of  cons to determine resistance to glycopeptides.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

AB  == the significance of grampositive bacteria, especially staphylococci and enterococci, as nosocomial pathogens has increased in the last decade. furthermore, resistance to commonly used antibiotics like beta-lactams has also become more common and even resistance to glycopeptides has been observed. we evaluated the susceptibility of 150 staphylococcal clinical isolates (52 s. epidermidis, 52 s. haemolyticus, 10 s. saprophyticus, 10 s. hominis, 4 s. warneri, 4 s. simulans, 4 s. capitis and 14 s. aureus) and of 50 enterococci (49  e. faecalis, 1 e. faecium) to the glycopeptides, vancomycin and teicoplanin. the  data from the agar dilution test used as reference method were compared with the  results from the e test and the agar disk diffusion test. concerning vancomycin,  no resistance among all the staphylococcal isolates was observed whereas one single enterococcal strain (e. faecium) proved to be resistant. the overall resistance of staphylococcal isolates against teicoplanin was about 10.7% (15 s.  haemolyticus, 1 s. epidermidis) being mainly due to the high proportion of s. haemolyticus strains (52 out of 150) among the staphylococcal isolates. teicoplanin resistance among the enterococci was not detected. for vancomycin, a  very close correlation between the mics from the agar dilution test and the e test was noticed. as concerns teicoplanin, the mics from the e-test were usually  somewhat lower than those obtained by the agar dilution test. no correlation was  found between the mics of resistant and intermediate staphylococcal strains and the results from the teicoplanin agar disk diffusion test. for routine teicoplanin susceptibility testing of staphylococci, the determination of the mic (e.g., by the e test) is much more reliable for detecting resistant strains than  the agar disk diffusion test.

TI  == emergence of bacterial resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin in a university hospital.
AB  == we have continuously monitored the in-vitro activities of imipenem and ciprofloxacin against large numbers of non-fastidious clinical isolates. after eight years of use, 97-100% of enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter baumannii remained susceptible to imipenem, but susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa declined from 100% to 91%. after six years of use, 94%-100% of enterobacteriaceae (except providencia stuartii) remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin but susceptibility of p. stuartii, a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa declined from 100%  to 46%, 66% and 84%, respectively. oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were considered to be resistant to imipenem and all beta-lactams. there were no quinolone-resistant staphylococci observed in 1986, but susceptibilities of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus to ciprofloxacin decreased to 85-93% for oxacillin-susceptible strains and to 7-39% for oxacillin-resistant strains. enterococcus faecalis has remained susceptible to imipenem and the modal mic of ciprofloxacin has remained 1 mg/l; however, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin 2 mg/l decreased from 94% to 64%. imipenem-quinolone cross-resistance was observed for staphylococci but not for p. aeruginosa.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activities of the penem wy-49605 (sun5555) against recent clinical isolates from five u.s. medical centers.
AB  == the in vitro activity of wy-49605 (sun5555) (wy) was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid against 2,958 consecutive clinical isolates from five medical centers and 402 respiratory pathogens from 18 other facilities. most members of the family enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by wy (mic at which 50% of the isolates are inhibited [mic50], < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml). mic90s of > or = 8.0 micrograms/ml were observed for enterobacter cloacae, serratia spp., and proteus mirabilis. wy was the most active drug against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml)  and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic90, 4.0 micrograms/ml). the four drugs were not active against nonenteric gram-negative bacilli, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus haemolyticus. at  2.0 micrograms/ml, wy inhibited 82% of enterococcus faecalis strains and was equal to or superior to the other drugs against streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis.

TI  == [method of dna extraction and meca, fema and pbp2' in multi-drug resistant bacterial strains].
AB  == recently, it has become more important to establish rapid and reliable methods for identifying bacterial species and their drug resistances because of the high  incidence of nosocomial infection caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria. at first, several enzymes were tested to evaluate the efficacy of dna extraction. n-acetylmuramidase, lysozyme and achromopeptidase were most effective to extract  dna from e. faecalis, e. faecium and s. aureus, respectively. after achromopeptidase extraction, the meca gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in clinically isolated mrsa (95 strains), mssa (66), mrse (methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, 37), msse (methicillin-sensitive s. epidermidis, 1), s haemolyticus(5), s.hominis(1) and others (enterococcus, pseudomonas, and streptococcus, total 45). pcr products were analyzed by agarose  gel electrophoresis. the positive rates were 95% (mrsa), 1.5% (mssa), and 97% (mrse). the meca gene was also positive in 2/2 of methicillin-resistant s.haemolyticus and 2/3 of methicillin-sensitive s.haemolyticus and 1/1 of methicillin-resistant s.hominis. the meca gene was not detected in 45 non-staphylococcal strains. meca and fema gene by pcr and pbp 2' by irma were further detected in newly isolated mrsa (20 strains), mssa(20), mrse(14), msse(1) and s.simulans(2). complete correlation between mpipc susceptibility and meca were found. the fema gene was positive in 39/40 of s. aureus, and 0/14 of s.epidermidis, 2/3 of s.simulans. pbp2' were positive in 20/20 of mrsa, 0/20 of mssa, 14/14 of mrse, 0/1 of msse, 1/1 of methicillin-resistant s.simulans, and 0/2 of methicillin-sensitive s.simulans. in conclusion, diagnoses of mrsa by simultaneous detection of meca and fema gene as well as pbp2' are similarly useful because of their specificity and rapidity.

TI  == identification of gram positive cocci isolated from urine.
AB  == a total of 195 strains of gram positive cocci isolated from urine, in pure culture and in counts of > 10(3) colony forming units/ml, during january-september 1992, were speciated using schema recently described by facklam and washington, and kloos and lambe. seventy three (85%) of the 86 enterococci were identified as enterococcus faecalis while 11 (13%) were e. faecium. eighteen (29%) of the 62 staphylococcal isolates were staphylococcus aureus; 20 (45%) of the 44 coagulase negative staphylococci were speciated as staph. haemolyticus. of the 47 strains of beta haemolytic streptococci isolated, 45 (96%) were group b; one was group g and the other group f. our results show the diverse species of gram positive cocci associated with bacteriuria and the need to speciate them in  a diagnostic laboratory. in the context of a larger number of tests required for  the speciation of gram positive cocci, we recommend a simplified scheme which we  found feasible on a routine basis.

TI  == [determination of the susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci to plycopeptides by the e-test method].
AB  == e-test was evaluated by comparison with the reference agar dilution method on 15  enterococci and 15 staphylococci with variable resistance to glycopeptides and isolated from clinical samples: 15 enterococci with 3 glycopeptide-resistant (2 e. facalis and 1 e. faecium), 1 glycopeptide intermediate e. gallinarum and 11 glycopeptide-sensible e. faecalis; 15 staphylococci with 4 teicoplanine-resistant (1 s. aureus, 1 s. epidermidis and 2 s. hominis), 3 teicoplanin-intermediate (1 s. epidermidis, 2 s. haemolyticus) and 8 teicoplanin sensible strains (6 s. aureus, 1 s. epidermidis and 1 s. hominis). repeatability (10 determinations by strain) and exactitude were tested for all strains. our data shows very good results for repeatability and exactitude with the reference method except in the  case of coagulase negative staphylococci and teicoplanin. some technical problems appear in our experience: for staphylococci, a 48 h incubation is necessary to detect teicoplanin-intermediate strains but 24 h is sufficient for enterococci. e-test is expensive, require a strict methodology, but is a good method to detect glycopeptide resistance for staphylococci and enterococci except for coagulase negative staphylococci and teicoplanine.

TI  == residual bacterial contamination on reusable pulse oximetry sensors.
AB  == background: an early study demonstrated that standard cleaning techniques did not adequately disinfect reusable pulse oximetry sensors that had been intentionally  contaminated with high titers of pathogenic microorganisms. this current study evaluated patient-ready sensors being used in hospitals, by testing them for bacterial contamination. methods: reusable pulse oximetry sensors from 15 hospitals throughout the united states were tested. each sensor was deemed by the hospital to be ready for patient use, and it had been prepared for use according  to hospital procedures. patient-contact areas of each sensor were swabbed, and the swabs were analyzed for bacterial contamination using standard testing procedures. this study had two stages, and different sensors were tested in each  stage. in the "bacterial-growth stage," swabs were evaluated for bacterial contamination but organisms were not identified; in the "identification stage," bacterial species were identified. results: forty-four sensors were evaluated, 16 in the bacterial-growth stage and 28 in the identification stage. bacteria were cultured from 29 of the 44 sensors (66%), including 20 that had been cleaned with alcohol or an antibacterial/antiviral agent. among the isolated organisms were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, and klebsiella oxytoca. bacterial contamination was found on sensors from 12 of the 15 participating hospitals. conclusions: these data demonstrate the need to define effective cleaning methods for reusable sensors, and we are currently conducting such studies. the data also suggest that disposable patient-dedicated  sensors may be the most appropriate choice when infection control is of particular concern.

TI  == trends in gram-positive bloodstream organism resistance: a seven-year audit of five glycopeptides and other drugs at a large university hospital.
AB  == gram-positive pathogens (n = 525) isolated from bloodstream infections were tested by a reference broth microdilution method to establish antibiotic susceptibility trends (1985 to 1991). cefazolin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, novobiocin, oxacillin, rifampin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, daptomycin and two investigational glycopeptides (ly264826 and mdl62873) were investigated. strains were selected without bias (first two isolates each month/species; no patient duplicates) as follows: 132 staphylococcus aureus, 129 staphylococcus epidermidis, 72 staphylococcus haemolyticus, 130 enterococcus faecalis and 62 other enterococci. all isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin except for staphylococcus haemolyticus which had a resistant teicoplanin mic90 of 64 micrograms/ml. the susceptibilities to vancomycin and teicoplanin were unchanged over the monitored  period. daptomycin, ly264826 and mdl62873 also demonstrated consistent activity;  mdl62873 being superior with a mic90 of 0.12 micrograms/ml. in 1990-1991 a significantly increased resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed among oxacillin-resistant strains of staphylococci. our data suggest that the emergence of invasive vancomycin-resistant strains in gram-positive isolates remains a rare phenomenon. however, we have experienced an emergence of numerous ciprofloxacin-resistant strains among staphylococci that precludes its empirical  use at our institution.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of cp-99,219, a novel azabicyclo-naphthyridone.
AB  == cp-99,219 is a trifluoronaphthyridone with significant antibacterial activity that includes the family enterobacteriaceae (mics for 90% of the strains tested [mic90s], < or = 0.015 to 0.5 micrograms/ml), moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus  influenzae, and gonococci (mics, < or = 0.015 micrograms/ml). legionella spp. were also cp-99,219 susceptible, with mics of 0.008 to 0.12 micrograms/ml. cp-99,219 demonstrated activity greater than that of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, or enoxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 1 microgram/ml), xanthomonas maltophilia (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), staphylococcus haemolyticus (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 1 microgram/ml), and pneumococci (mic90, 0.12 micrograms/ml). numerous ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates were susceptible to cp-99,219, a new compound showing potential value for further in vivo trials.

TI  == the activity of metal compounds against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of two metal compounds, jm-1397 (oso2[xylyl]2) and jm-2469 (aucl[s2cpet3]). both inhibited methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus at concentrations of 0.5-2 micrograms/ml, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90) of 1 microgram/ml for jm-1397 and 0.5 microgram/ml for jm-2469. similar concentrations inhibited methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus). jm-2469 inhibited group a, b, c, f, and g beta-hemolytic streptococci and viridans group streptococci at 1-8 micrograms/ml (mic90 4 micrograms/ml) but enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium had mics of 8-16 micrograms/ml. jm-1397 had mics for these organisms of greater than 64 micrograms/ml. bacteroides fragilis, other bacteroides, and clostridium species were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.12-4 micrograms/ml (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml). mics of both compounds for enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas spp. were greater than 64 micrograms/ml. these studies show that osmium and gold compounds have potential as topical agents against gram-positive and anaerobic species.

TI  == in vitro activity of decaplanin (m86-1410), a new glycopeptide antibiotic.
AB  == the in vitro activity of decaplanin (formerly m86-1410), a novel glycopeptide antimicrobial agent, was tested against 169 gram-positive bloodstream isolates from patients at the university of iowa hospitals and clinics and 12 selected vancomycin-resistant strains. enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, bacilli, corynebacteria, and listeria were inhibited by decaplanin (mics for 90% of the strains tested [mic90s], 0.12 to 4 micrograms/ml). however, some rarely isolated and selected enterococcus sp. populations had a mic90 of 16 micrograms/ml, and s. haemolyticus strains had a mic90 of 8 micrograms/ml. these in vitro results suggest that decaplanin may be useful against most gram-positive strains, even though some enterococcus species  and coagulase-negative staphylococci were potentially resistant (mics, greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml).

AB  == the in vitro activity of ly264826, a novel glycopeptide antibiotic produced by amycolatopsis orientalis, was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and oxacillin against 311 gram-positive clinical isolates from patients with cancer,  ly264826 had lower mics for 90% of isolates (mic90) than vancomycin for all species tested. it was active against oxacillin-resistant isolates including staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), staphylococcus haemolyticus (mic90, 2.0 micrograms/ml), enterococcus spp. (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), bacillus cereus (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml), and corynebacterium jeikeium (mic90, 0.12 micrograms/ml). for s. aureus, including oxacillin-resistant isolates, the mics of ly264826 were similar to those of teicoplanin. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, however, ly264826 had mics that were 4- to 32-fold lower than those of teicoplanin. against most streptococcal species the activities of ly264826 and teicoplanin were similar. bactericidal activity against staphylococcus spp. and most streptococcus pyogenes isolates was less than or equal to 1 dilution of the mic. one isolate of s. pyogenes and all enterococcus faecalis strains tested were tolerant of ly264826, with mbcs greater than or equal to 32-fold greater than the mics. the addition of 50% human serum resulted  in a significant increase in activity only against staphylococcus epidermidis. variations in ph from 6.4 to 8.4 and in inoculum from 10(3) to 10(7) cfu/ml did not significantly affect the activity of ly264826.

TI  == quality control limits for teicoplanin susceptibility tests and confirmation of disk diffusion interpretive criteria.
AB  == for monitoring the performance of teicoplanin susceptibility tests, the following quality control limits are recommended: staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, mic of  0.12 to 0.5 micrograms/ml; enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, mic of 0.06 to 0.25  micrograms/ml; and s. aureus atcc 25923, zones 15 to 19 mm in diameter (30-micrograms disks). however, some lots of mueller-hinton agar provided unusually large zones of inhibition with both vancomycin and teicoplanin disks, and these lots should be excluded before routine use. teicoplanin and vancomycin  differed only in their activity against oxacillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus haemolyticus, which had decreased susceptibility to teicoplanin but were fully susceptible to vancomycin. for tests with 30-micrograms teicoplanin disks, zones less than or equal to 10 and greater than or equal to 14 mm in diameter represent resistant and susceptible breakpoints, respectively.

TI  == human choriogonadotropin-like material in bacteria of different species: electron microscopy and immunocytochemical studies with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies.
AB  == immunocytochemical studies using antisera to whole human choriogonadotropin (hcg), to its alpha- and beta-subunits and to the cooh-terminal peptide of hcg beta, and two monoclonal antibodies to hcg beta, demonstrated expression of hcg-like material, its individual subunits and/or fragments in nine bacterial strains. seven of these were isolated from patients with cancer and were definitely identified as streptococcus faecalis (three strains), staphylococcus haemolyticus (two strains) and staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli (single strains). the other two strains were cell-wall-deficient (cwd) variants,  one identified as streptococcus bovis, isolated from the blood of a patient with  a fever of unknown origin and a possible brain abscess. the other was a gram-negative diphtheroid isolated from the urine of a pregnant woman, which during the period of study reverted to a gram-positive corynebacterium identified as a 'c. ulcerans' strain and expressed the hcg-like factor only during its phase as gram-negative diphtheroid. electron microscopy of these nine strains (including negative controls of strains of the same species subjected to the same immunocytochemical analyses and under identical cultural conditions) revealed morphological alterations in the bacterial cell walls and cytoplasmic material and/or bizarre forms of reproduction in six of the nine strains expressing hcg-like material including the two cwd variants. collectively, these results provided evidence that (1) hcg-producing bacteria isolated from patients with overt cancer are not a new and unique species as claimed by others, and (2) there is a close resemblance between the bacterial protein and the human trophoblastic  hormone, based on immunochemical recognition of different parts of the hcg molecule.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
