TI  - Spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in mainland of China.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria-induced respiratory infection has been long considered to be the major cause of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Therefore, a clear picture about the distribution and drug-resistance of pathogenic bacteria in the lower airways should be helpful for treatment of the disease. So far, data on this topic among Chinese are lacking. METHODS: A surveillance study was performed in consecutive patients with AECOPD at five areas in China between October 2006 and April 2008. The sputum from these patients was cultured and isolated for bacteria. Agar dilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of levofoxacin and other 15 antibiotics against these strains. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-nine pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated among 884 patients with AECOPD. The predominant bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.3%), Haemophilus influenzae (14.2%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (11.7%), followed by Haemophilus parainfluenzae (9.5%), Acinetobacter baumannii (7.8%), Moraxella catarrhalis (6.4%) and Escherichia coli (3.6%). The majority of bacterial pathogens isolated in this study were susceptible to fuoroquinolones, ceftazidime, cefepime and imipenem. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacilli are the leading pathogens in patients with AECOPD in China. Haemophilus parainfluenzae may be one of the most important pathogens in AECOPD. This study provides evidence for local surveillance of AECOPD pathogens and appropriate choice of antimicrobials in China.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftaroline and comparator agents tested against bacterial isolates causing skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired respiratory tract infections isolated from the Asia-Pacific region and South Africa (2010).
AB  - Ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a cephalosporin with in vitro bactericidal activity against resistant Gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and common Gram-negative organisms, including wild-type Enterobacteriaceae. We evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftaroline and selected comparator agents against bacterial isolates collected from patients with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) and community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTI) in the Asia-Pacific region and South Africa. A total of 2351 isolates, 1100 from SSTI and 1251 from CARTI, were collected from 25 medical centers distributed across 8 countries as part of the 2010 AWARE ceftaroline surveillance program and tested for susceptibility by reference broth microdilution methods. Ceftaroline was very active against S. aureus (MIC50/90, 0.25/1 mug/mL; 93.4% susceptible), including MRSA (MIC50/90, 1/2 mug/mL; 80.6% susceptible). Against beta-hemolytic streptococci, ceftaroline demonstrated greater activity (MIC90, 0.015 mug/mL) than penicillin (MIC90, 0.06 mug/mL). Ceftaroline was also highly active against viridans group streptococci (MIC90, 0.12 mug/mL). Similarly to ceftriaxone, ceftaroline activity against Escherichia coli (MIC50/90, >32/>32 mug/mL) and Klebsiella spp. (MIC50/90, 0.12/>32 mug/mL) was compromised by the high prevalence of isolates with an ESBL phenotype in the region, particularly in China. Ceftaroline was the most potent beta-lactam tested against S. pneumoniae (MIC50/90 of 0.015/0.25 mug/mL; 99.8% susceptible by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [CLSI] criteria), and it was also highly potent against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50/90, </= 0.008/0.03 mug/mL; 100% susceptible by CLSI criteria). Ceftaroline was also active against H. parainfluenzae (MIC50/90, </= 0.008/0.015 mug/mL) and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/mL). In summary, ceftaroline showed potent in vitro activity against a large collection of bacterial isolates (2351) associated with SSTI and CARTI from the Asia-Pacific region and South Africa.
TI  - Evaluation of commercial universal rRNA gene PCR plus sequencing tests for identification of bacteria and fungi associated with infectious endocarditis.
AB  - Two new commercially available universal rRNA gene PCR plus sequencing tests, SepsiTest and universal microbe detection (UMD; Molzym, Bremen, Germany), were evaluated using blood specimens and heart valves from 30 patients with suspected infectious endocarditis (IE). The sensitivity of PCR (85%) was nearly twice as high as that of culture (45%), which in 10/20 IE cases presumably stayed negative as a consequence of growth inhibition of the pathogens by antibiotics. Further, PCR provided the basis for reclassification of 5/10 non-IE cases into IE cases. Culture-negative infections were identified by PCR, including single infections due to streptococci and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Haemophilus parainfluenzae) and mixed infections involving two Gram-positive bacteria or Candida spp. with Gram-positive bacteria. The new commercial tests proved to be of value for the rapid diagnosis of IE, particularly in cases of culture-negative infections. Issues regarding the feasibility of these tests for routine use are discussed.
TI  - Identification of bacterial DNA in noninfectious pleural fluid with a highly sensitive PCR method.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial DNA due to bacterial translocation has been identified in noninfectious ascitic fluid samples. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the possible presence of bacterial DNA in the pleural fluid of patients with pleural effusions of noninfectious origin, using a highly sensitive PCR-based method. METHODS: Pleural fluid samples from 175 patients (average age +/- SD: 69 +/- 14 years) with noninfectious pleural effusion (62 transudates, 113 exudates) were analyzed. Bacterial DNA was detected using nested PCR with amplification of a fragment of the gene r16S, with 2 amplification protocols, i.e. low sensitivity (10 and 40 cycles) and high sensitivity (40 and 40 cycles). RESULTS: With the less sensitive amplification process, only 1 sample was positive (Haemophilus parainfluenzae in a patient with hepatic hydrothorax). With the highly sensitive nested PCR method, bacterial DNA was identified in the pleural fluid, of both transudative and exudative origin, of 75 of the 175 patients (43%). In cases of isolation of a single bacterium, the more frequent were Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica and Streptococcus pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of its origin, bacterial DNA can be identified in almost half of noninfectious pleural effusions by using a highly sensitive PCR-based method. The possible clinical significance or prognostic value of these findings deserves to be evaluated.
TI  - Construction of a novel shuttle vector for use in Haemophilus influenzae and H. parainfluenzae.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae is an important human pathogen. A number of complete genome sequences of various haemophili are available; however, functional studies have been limited by the lack of an effective shuttle vector which functions in all strains. Here, we have constructed a shuttle vector, pEJ6, which transfers genes between Escherichia coli and H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae. The vector contains an origin of replication from pLS88 which is functional in E. coli and H. influenzae. In addition it contains an RP4 mobilisation region. The vector can be introduced by electroporation and conjugation into capsulate and non-typeable H. influenzae and is functional for allelic replacement and mutant complementation. The vector will be useful for investigating gene function in Haemophilus spp.
TI  - [Distribution and drug resistance of the isolated bacteria from children with acute respiratory infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the distribution and drug resistance of the isolated bacteria from children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) in Dalian. METHODS: Between January 2006 and February 2007, 930 children with ARI were enrolled, including 364 with acute upper respiratory infection (AURI), and 566 with acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI). The AURI children, who did not receive antimicrobial agent treatment or received oral antimicrobial agents 1-2 times, had bacterial cultures of pharyngeal swab. The ALRI children, who received intravenous antibacterial agents more than 3 days, had bacterial cultures of sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Isolated bacteria were identified by the ATB system (Bio-Merieux, France). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by means of Kirby-bauer. RESULTS: A total of 404 isolates (43.4%) were identified. Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 22.5%, 12.1% and 7.4% respectively. In the isolates from AURI, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 43.9%, 22.0% and 9.1% respectively; Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Nonfermenters accounted for 4.5%, 8.3% and 3.0% respectively. In the isolates from ALRI, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 12.1%, 7.4% and 6.6% respectively; Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Nonfermenters accounted for 16.9%, 13.2% and 21.8% respectively. The resistant rates of Haemophilus to ampicillin and TMP-SMZ were 29.3% and 32.9% respectively, and to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefalotin, cefaclor, cefuroxime and cefotaxime were 12.1%, 10.0%, 10.0%, 11.4% and 5.7%, respectively. The resistant rate of Haemophilus to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefaclor, tetracycine and TMP-SMZ in the ALRI group were significantly higher than that in the AURI group (P<0.05 or 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In Dalian, Haemophilus was the main isolate of children with ARI. The distribution of bacteria was different between ALRI and AURI. In ALRI, Gram-negative bacilli were in a higher proportion, and the resistant rates of Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefaclor were higher.
TI  - [Infection pathogen analysis of 2388 patients in an open hematology ward from 1993 to 2004].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of infection and pathogens in hematology  ward. METHODS: The data of incidence, pathogen, and outcome of infection of 2388 hospitalized patients in an open hematology ward of Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 1993 to 2004 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The overall incidence of infection was 34.3% according to the person-times of hospitalization, 24.4% for nosocomial infection and 9.9% for community-acquired infection. Most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infection were Gram negative. The most common bacteria in the sputum samples included Enterobacter (27%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus (MRSCoN, 12%), the most common bacteria in the blood samples included Escherichia coli (43%), Enterobacter cloacae (11%), and Klebsiella (11%). Whereas in the community-acquired infection the most common bacteria in the sputum samples were Haemophilus parainfluenzae (15%), MRSCoN (28%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (10%), and the most common bacteria in the blood samples were MRSCoN (28%), E. coli (28%), and Klebsiella (9.4%). Fungi were more often found in nosocomial infection, especially in the sputum samples. 12-year follow up showed that in nosocomial infection Pseudomonas aeruginosa remained the most common bacteria in the sputum samples, whereas E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae became the major bacteria in the blood samples. In community-acquired infection, the proportion of Staphylococcus aureus, that of Klebsiella in blood samples, and that of E. coli in throat swab samples increased in recent years. The incidence of fungi infection had increased in both nosocomial infection and community acquired infection. The mortality of nosocomial infection was 6.1%, higher than that of the community-acquired infection, however, not statistically significant (P = 0.17). There was a trend of decrease in the mortality of community-acquired infection but did not in the nosocomial infection. CONCLUSION: The patients in hematology ward are susceptible to infection, especially nosocomial infection that has a higher mortality rate in comparison with the community-acquired infection, however, not statistically significant. The pathogens of nosocomial infection are most likely G- bacteria, fungi and other bacteria resistant to most antibiotics. The mortality rate of nosocomial infection remains almost unchanged in the 12-year follow up.
TI  - Remarkable conservation of translation initiation factors: IF1/eIF1A and IF2/eIF5B are universally distributed phylogenetic markers.
AB  - Initiation of protein biosynthesis is an essential process occurring in cells throughout the three phylogenetic domains, Bacteria, Archaea, and Eucarya. IF1/eIF1A and IF2/eIF5B, two conserved translation initiation factors are involved in this important step of protein biosynthesis. The essentiality, universal distribution, conservation, and interspecies functional homology of both factors are a unique combination of properties ideal for molecular phylogenetic studies as demonstrated by the extensively compared SSU rRNAs. Here, we assess the use of IF1/eIF1A and IF2/eIF5B in universal and partial phylogenetic studies by comparison of sequence information from species within all three phylogenetic domains and among closely related strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae. We conclude that the amino acid sequence of IF1/eIF1A-IF2/eIF5B is a universal phylogenetic marker and that the nucleotide sequence of the IF2/eIF5B G-domain is more credible than SSU rRNA for the construction of partial phylogenies among closely related species and strains. Because of these two application levels, IF1/eIF1A-IF2/eIF5B is a phylogenetic "dual level" marker.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - A novel heme protein, the Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase from Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi, the causative agent of the genital ulcerative disease known  as chancroid, is unable to synthesize heme, which it acquires from humans, its only known host. Here we provide evidence that the periplasmic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase from this organism is a heme-binding protein, unlike all the other known Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutases from bacterial and eukaryotic species. When the H. ducreyi enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli cells grown in standard LB medium, it contained only limited amounts of heme covalently bound to the polypeptide but was able efficiently to bind exogenously added hemin. Resonance Raman and electronic spectra at neutral pH indicate that H. ducreyi Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase contains a 6-coordinated low spin heme, with two histidines as the most likely axial ligands. By site-directed mutagenesis and analysis of a structural model of the enzyme, we identified as a putative axial ligand a histidine residue (His-64) that is present only in the H. ducreyi enzyme and that was located at the bottom of the dimer interface. The introduction of a histidine residue in the corresponding position of the Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase from Haemophilus parainfluenzae was not sufficient to confer the ability to bind heme, indicating that other residues neighboring His-64 are involved in the formation of the heme-binding pocket. Our results suggest that periplasmic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase plays a role in heme metabolism of H. ducreyi and provide further evidence for the structural flexibility of bacterial enzymes of this class.
TI  - [A consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-negative bacilli].
AB  - The results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare during the period of January 1993 to July 1995, were analyzed for typical Gram-negative bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. During these 3 years, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (FOM) and Citrobacter freundii. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (MINO). While Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (CMZ). However, these annual changes were almost negligible. Generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against Gram-negative bacilli. However, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. On the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST), CMZ, latamoxef (LMOX), gentamicin (GM) and amikacin (AMK) showed good activities against some of the Gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. In conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on tazobactam/piperacillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies on tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC), a combination drug of piperacillin (PIPC) with the new beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam (TAZ), were carried out in the field of pediatrics. 1. After intravenous administration of TAZ/PIPC at a dose of 25 mg/kg to one child, the peak plasma levels of TAZ and PIPC were 24.4 micrograms/ml and 119 micrograms/ml respectively after 5 min. The half-lives of TAZ and PIPC were 0.48 and 0.60 hours respectively. Same as 50 mg/kg to two children, the peak plasma levels of TAZ and PIPC were 17.5, 32.2 micrograms/ml and 92.8, 163 micrograms/ml after 5 min. The half-lives of TAZ and PIPC were 0.37, 0.50 hours and 0.51, 0.59 hours. A ratio of TAZ to PIPC was about 1 to 4 in plasma levels. The cumulative urinary recovery rates of TAZ and PIPC in the first 6 hours after intravenous administration were 15.8, 64.9% and 39.8, 53.4%. 2. The antibacterial activity of TAZ/PIPC against clinically isolated organisms was determined. The MICs of TAZ/PIPC were < or = 0.05 microgram/ml against Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae and > or = 1.56 micrograms/ml against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. 3. The clinical efficacy of TAZ/PIPC could be evaluated in 14 patients with various bacterial infections, and was evaluated as "excellent" in 9 patients and as "good" in 5. The overall clinical efficacy rate in 14 cases was 100% and excellent was 64.3%. Bacteriological efficacy rate was 91.7% (10/11). 4. As a side effect, loose stool was observed in one case, no abnormal laboratory test values were observed. It has been concluded that TAZ/PIPC was a useful drug in the field of pediatrics.
TI  - Cefaclor: a contemporary look at susceptibility of key pathogens from around the  globe.
AB  - The orally administered cephalosporin antibiotic, cefaclor, has been available for clinical use in many countries since 1979. Because widespread antibiotic use is often cited as a factor in the emergence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, we sought to determine the degrees of resistance to cefaclor expressed by key pathogens recently isolated in 10 countries widely distributed around the world. Using the E-test, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined for cefaclor and several comparator antibiotics against approximately 700 fresh clinical isolates of each of six bacterial species. The results demonstrated that > 90% of Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase producing and non-producing), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (beta-lactamase producing and non-producing), Moraxella catarrhalis (> 90% beta-lactamase producing), and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and 85% of Escherichia coli were susceptible to cefaclor at the NCCLS interpretive breakpoints. MIC distributions showed that there has been no change in the activity of cefaclor against penicillin-susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae since 1977.
TI  - Outer membrane protein D15 is conserved among Haemophilus influenzae species and  may represent a universal protective antigen against invasive disease.
AB  - We have cloned and sequenced the d15 gene from two strains of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and two strains of nontypeable H. influenzae (NTHI). The nucleotide and deduced protein sequences of d15 are highly conserved, with only a small variable region identified near the carboxyl terminus of the protein. Analysis of upstream sequences revealed that the H. influenzae d15 gene may be part of a large potential operon of closely spaced open reading frames, including one with significant homology to the Escherichia coli cds gene encoding CDP-diglyceride synthetase. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the d15 gene is also present in H. influenzae types a, c, d, e, and f and in Haemophilus parainfluenzae. A recombinant D15 (rD15) protein was expressed in good quantity in E. coli from the inducible T7 promoter, and monospecific anti-rD15 antibodies were raised. Immunoblot analysis of H. influenzae serotypes a, b, c, d, e, and f, NTHI, and H. parainfluenzae lysates revealed that they all expressed a cross-reactive D15-like protein. Purified rD15 was found to be highly immunogenic in mice, guinea pigs, and rabbits, and passive transfer of anti-rD15 antibodies protected infant rats from challenge with H. influenzae type b or type a in infant rat models of bacteremia. Thus, D15 is a highly conserved antigen that is protective in animal models and it may be a useful component of a universal subunit vaccine against Haemophilus infection and disease.
TI  - Rapid, sensitive, microbial detection by gene amplification using restriction endonuclease target sequences.
AB  - The use of primers synthesized to eight class II restriction endonuclease target  sequences, from Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella infantis, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Proteus vulgaris for single and multiplex PCR identification of the organisms is discussed. Results indicate that the method is sensitive and specific enough to detect single cells and attogram amounts of target DNA. It has also been demonstrated that the primers can be used in whole cell PCR for identification and whole cell PCR product recovery could be enhanced by the addition of gelatin or DMSO to PCR reaction mixtures. Other results have indicated that the method can be used for the definite identification of specific individuals present in mixed cultures or suspensions of organisms. The applicability of the method for detection of a specific strain within a group of closely related organisms has also been investigated and for that sequence/organism the results suggest that the proposed method is indeed very specific and discriminative. It is suggested that as more information becomes available regarding such sequences and their distribution, this approach could form the basis of a widescale, rapid, simple and cheap identification and/or typing system for bacteria.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding the Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase of Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - The sodC gene of Haemophilus ducreyi was cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino  acid sequence of this protein exhibited 71.6% identity and 81.8% similarity to the H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae copper (Cu), zinc (Zn)-superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes. This gene was localized to a 2.2-kb H. ducreyi chromosomal DNA insert in plasmid pHdSOD. SOD activity was expressed in cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli containing the recombinant plasmid pHdSOD and was localized to the periplasmic space. The Cu,Zn-SOD produced by the H. ducreyi sodC gene did not complement the aerobic growth defect of an E. coli SOD-deficient mutant.
TI  - Cefetamet pivoxil: comparable evaluation with other orally available antibiotics  against selected species of respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Cefetamet pivoxil, the prodrug ester of cefetamet, is a new third-generation cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity. The in vitro activity of cefetamet was superior to that of cefaclor, ceftibuten, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, and amoxicillin alone when tested against 403 strains of freshly isolated upper and lower respiratory tract pathogens. Cefetamet killed 100% Haemophilus influenzae and H. parainfluenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, at < or = 0.25 mg/l, Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae at < or = 0.5 mg/l, S. agalactiae at < or = 0.1 mg/l, and streptococci at < or = 2.0 mg/l. Moreover, at < or = 4 mg/l (breaking point), cefetamet was also highly effective against Escherichia coli (94%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (92%), K. oxytoca (91%) and, at 1 mg/l, against Moraxella catarrhalis (90%), including beta-lactamase-producing strains. Furthermore, time-killing analyses at 4 x MIC demonstrated that cefetamet was bactericidal against beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and K. pneumoniae within 6 h and S. pneumoniae within 4 h. Hydrolysis studies confirmed cefetamet's stability to TEM1 and SHV1, the most common enterobacterial beta-lactamases.
TI  - HpaII methyltransferase is mutagenic in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A genetic reversion assay to study C-to-T mutations within CG sites in DNA is described. It was used to demonstrate that the presence of HpaII methyltransferase (MTase) in Escherichia coli causes a substantial increase in C-to-T mutations at CG sites. This is similar to the known mutagenic effects of E. coli MTase Dcm within its own recognition sequence. With this genetic system, a homolog of an E. coli DNA repair gene in Haemophilus parainfluenzae was tested for antimutagenic activity. Unexpectedly, the homolog was found to have little effect on the reversion frequency. The system was also used to show that HpaII and SssI MTases can convert cytosine to uracil in vitro. These studies define 5-methylcytosine as an intrinsic mutagen and further elaborate the mutagenic potential of cytosine MTases.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies of biapenem (L-627) in pediatric field].
AB  - We have carried out bacteriological and clinical studies on L-627. The results are summarized as follows. Treatment with L-627 was made in 14 cases of pediatric bacterial infections including 5 cases of pneumonia and 2 cases each of tonsillitis, urinary tract infection and one case each of colitis, and phlegmon. Results obtained were excellent in 11 cases, good in 2 cases and poor in one case. The bacteriological effect of L-627 was excellent, all causative organisms (Staphylococcus aureus one strain, Streptococcus pyogenes 2 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 3 strains, Escherichia coli 3 strains, Haemophilus influenzae one strain, Haemophilus parainfluenzae one strain) were eradicated. No significant side effects due to the drug were observed in any cases, except 2 cases each of elevated eosinophil counts and elevated platelet counts.
TI  - Binding of human hemoglobin by Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Binding of biotinylated human hemoglobin to Haemophilus influenzae was detected when organisms were grown in heme-deplete, but not heme-replete, conditions. Hemoglobin binding was completely inhibited by a 100-fold excess of unlabelled human hemoglobin or human hemoglobin complexed with human haptoglobin. Binding was only partially inhibited by rat hemoglobin, bovine hemoglobin, human globin, and bovine globin, and not at all by heme, human serum albumin, bovine serum albumin, human transferrin, or myoglobin. Hemoglobin binding was saturable at 16-20 ng of hemoglobin per 10(9) cfu. Binding of human hemoglobin was detected in serotypes a-f and serologically non-typable strains of H. influenzae, as well as Haemophilus haemolyticus but not Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Haemophilus parahaemolyticus, or Escherichia coli.
TI  - Organization and sequence of the HpaII restriction-modification system and adjacent genes.
AB  - We report the organization of the HpaII restriction and modification (R-M) system from Haemophilus parainfluenzae (recognition sequence: 5'...CCGG...3'), the sequence of the gene coding for the HpaII restriction endonuclease, and the sequence of the upstream flanking DNA. The HpaII system comprises two genes, hpaIIM, coding for the methyltransferase (MTase; 358 amino acids (aa), 40.4 kDa: product, Cm5CGG), and hpaIIR, coding for the restriction endonuclease (ENase; 358 aa, 40.9 kDa: product, C'CGG). The genes are adjacent, they have the same orientation, and they occur in the order hpaIIM then hpaIIR. The ENase bears little as sequence similarity to the isoschizomeric R.BsuFI and R.MspI ENases. Upstream of, and partly overlapping hpaIIM is the coding sequence for a 141-aa protein that resembles the very-short-patch-repair endonuclease (Vsr) of Escherichia coli. Upstream of that is the coding sequence for a protein that resembles valyl-tRNA synthetase (ValS).
TI  - Randomized comparative trial with ampicillin/sulbactam versus cefamandole in the  therapy of community acquired pneumonia.
AB  - In a randomized prospective study ampicillin/sulbactam and cefamandole were compared in the therapy of patients hospitalized with community acquired pneumonia. Patients receiving ampicillin/sulbactam (n = 37) and cefamandole (n = 38) were similar with respect to age (mean age 70 vs. 76 years respectively), clinical characteristics, severity of illness and underlying disease. Pathogens isolated from patients in the cefamandole and ampicillin/sulbactam group, respectively, were Streptococcus pneumoniae (7 vs. 7 patients), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (7 vs. 6 patients), Haemophilus influenzae (5 vs. 5 patients), Staphylococcus aureus (5 vs. 4 patients), Escherichia coli (4 vs. 4 patients), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3 vs. 3 patients), Enterobacter spp. (2 vs. 3 patients), Moraxella catarrhalis (1 vs. 2 patients), and organisms of the oral flora (4 vs. 3 patients). The rate of resistance to penicillin was 80%, to clindamycin 76%, to erythromycin 45%, to ampicillin 43%, and to cefazolin 18%. Overall successful treatment rates of 81% for cefamandole and 97% for ampicillin/sulbactam (p = 0.05) were observed. Both cefamandole and ampicillin/sulbactam were shown to be effective agents for therapy of community acquired pneumonia; however ampicillin/sulbactam demonstrated superior overall clinical efficacy.
TI  - Clarification of the structure of the ampicillin-resistance plasmid RSF0885 from  Haemophilus influenzae HR-885 serotype b.
AB  - The nonconjugative ampicillin-resistance plasmid RSF0885 has been reported to be  as small as 2.9 MDa and as large as 4.1 MDa with at least two restriction enzyme maps reported. In addition, the source of the original plasmid has been reported to be Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Characterization of the source strains and sequencing data of the plasmids revealed that H. influenzae serotype b was the original source strain and that IS1-K in the larger plasmid was presumably acquired when the smaller plasmid was maintained in Escherichia coli in S. Falkow's laboratory during the late 1970s.
TI  - [Clinical studies of S-1108 granules in the pediatric field].
AB  - We studied the clinical use of S-1108 granules in the pediatric field. The results are summarized as follows. 1. S-1108 was administered orally at doses ranging 6.85 and 17.6 mg/kg/day t.i.d. to 9 patients, including 5 cases of pharyngitis and 1 case each of lacunar tonsillitis, bronchitis, pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 4 cases and good in 5 cases, hence an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained. 2. Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae (2 strains each) and Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain each) were identified in these cases. Seven of the 8 strains were eliminated upon treatment and the other strain was decreased, hence an eradication rate of 87.5% was obtained. 3. Side effects observed were 1 case each of soft stools and diarrhea. As an abnormal laboratory test result, an increase in GPT level was observed. 4. No refusal of the drug occurred. 5. From the above results, we consider that this drug would be a useful new oral antibiotic for the pediatric field.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of S-1108 in pediatric field].
AB  - Nine pediatric patients with bacterial infections (5 cases of tonsillitis, 3 cases of impetigo and 1 case of UTI) were treated with S-1108, and the efficacy and the safety were evaluated. The clinical responses to S-1108 treatment were excellent in 7 cases and good in 2. The efficacy rate was 100%. Bacteriologically, the causative organisms (Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Escherichia coli) were eradicated. No clinical side effects were observed. Elevation of CK in 2 cases and eosinophilia in 1 case were noted.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefditoren pivoxil in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefditoren pivoxil (CDTR-PI, ME 1207) were performed in children. The results were as follows: 1. A total of 18 patients (19 infections) were treated with CDTR-PI. The doses ranged 2.1-3.2 mg/kg, and it was orally administered 3 times daily, for 4-10 days. Clinical efficacies of CDTR-PI in 18 patients with 19 bacterial infections (3 with tonsillitis, 1 with bronchitis, 7 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 4 with otitis media, 1 with urinary tract infection, 2 with skin and soft tissue infection) were evaluated as excellent in 13 infections and as good in 6 infections with an efficacy rate of 100%. Twelve causative strains of 5 species were found in 11 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2 cases out of 3, Haemophilus influenzae in 4/4, Staphylococcus aureus in 2/2, Haemophilus parainfluenzae in 2/2 and Escherichia coli in 1/1 were eradicated. Two patients had mild diarrhea but did not need specific treatment. Severe adverse reaction was not observed in any of the 18 patients. 2. MICs of CDTR were examined against 4 clinically isolated S. pneumoniae strains. Two strains of S. pneumoniae were relatively resistant to penicillins. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies Peak serum CDTR concentrations in 3 patients were 2.38 micrograms/ml, 0.72 micrograms/ml and 2.25 micrograms/ml at a dose of CDTR-PI 3 mg/kg orally administered at 30-minute after meal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Efficacy of fleroxacin versus amoxicillin in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - In a multicenter study the efficacy and safety of oral fleroxacin at 400 mg once  a day and amoxicillin at 500 mg three times daily for 7 days were compared for the treatment of patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to drug-susceptible bacteria. A total of 194 patients were enrolled, 102 in the fleroxacin group and 92 in the amoxicillin group. Of those enrolled, 22 in the fleroxacin group and 30 (29 for clinical efficacy) in the amoxicillin group were included in the efficacy analysis. All were included in the safety analysis. Clinical success was noted in 21 (95%) of 22 fleroxacin-treated patients and 22 (76%) of 29 amoxicillin-treated patients. Bacteriologic cure was obtained in 21 (95%) of 22 of the fleroxacin group and 18 (60%) of 30 of the amoxicillin group. One Haemophilus parainfluenzae strain persisted with fleroxacin. Persisting organisms with amoxicillin included Haemophilus influenzae (four), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (three), Escherichia coli (two), Streptococcus pneumoniae (one), Neisseria species (one), and Proteus mirabilis (one). Adverse events were reported by 41% of 102 patients receiving fleroxacin and 15% of 92 patients receiving amoxicillin. Insomnia, dizziness, and nausea occurred more frequently with fleroxacin. Fleroxacin may be indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial infection in chronic bronchitis known to be due to Haemophilus species and Moraxella catarrhalis. The 92% incidence of resistance among the S. pneumoniae isolates recovered from all enrolled patients suggests that fleroxacin may not be useful for such infections.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefprozil in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies on cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. Serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and urinary recovery rates of CFPZ were determined upon oral administration of CFPZ after meal at doses of 4 mg/kg granules in a case, 7.5 mg/kg granules in 2 cases and 15 mg/kg granules in one. Peak serum levels of CFPZ were obtained at an hour in 3 cases and at 2 hours in 1 case after administration of the drug with a range of 2.7-8.6 micrograms/ml with half-lives of 0.69-0.95 hours. Urinary recovery rates in the first 6 hours after administration ranged from 59.4-71.3%. 2. MICs of CFPZ against 36 clinical isolates (Staphylococcus aureus 4 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 5, Streptococcus pyogenes 5, Escherichia coli 5, Haemophilus influenzae 12, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 4, and Branhamella catarrhalis 1) were compared with those of cefaclor (CCL) and ampicillin (ABPC). The antibacterial activity of CFPZ was superior to those of CCL against Gram-positive cocci, and to those of ABPC against E. coli, and was equal to those of CCL and inferior to those of ABPC against H. influenzae. 3. Thirty-seven pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases (pharyngitis/tonsillitis 17, bronchitis 7, pneumonia 3, skin and soft tissue infection 2, and urinary tract infection 8) were treated with CFPZ at daily doses of 10-47 mg/kg t.i.d. as a rule. The efficacy rates were 100% clinically and 56% bacteriologically. 4. Side effects or abnormal laboratory test values were not observed except for an increased platelet count in 1 case and elevated GOT, GPT values in 2 cases.
TI  - [Clinical study on cefprozil in pediatrics].
AB  - Clinical efficacy and safety of cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a newly developed oral cephalosporin, were studied in our pediatric department. Clinical effectiveness, bacteriological effectiveness and side effects were studied in 116 pediatric patients with ages ranging 4 months to 11 years. CFPZ was given 4.6-14.1 mg/kg daily in 3 times for 3-10 days. Clinical efficacies were evaluated in 112 patients, and the therapeutic effectiveness were excellent in 1 and good in 6 for 7 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 24 and good in 26 for acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 3, good in 8 and fair in 1 for acute bronchitis, excellent in 21, good in 7, fair in 1 and poor in 1 for acute pneumonia, excellent in 1 acute purulent parotitis, excellent in 2 and good in 7 for acute UTI, good in 1 impetigo, fair in 1 periproctal abscess and good in 1 acute enteritis. The effectiveness rate was 96.4%. Bacteriologically, 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase producing strains), 1 strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase producing strain), 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 4 strains of beta-Streptococcus, 1 strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae (beta-lactamase producing strain) and 1 strain of Salmonella C2 were all disappeared, and of 22 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 strains were disappeared, 1 was decreased and 1 was unknown, of 5 strains of Escherichia coli (3 beta-lactamase producing strains), 4 were disappeared and 1 was decreased, of 29 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (14 beta-lactamase producing strains), 14 were disappeared, 11 were decreased, 3 persisted and 1 was unknown and of 2 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 beta-lactamase producing strain), 1 was disappeared and 1 persisted. The bacteriological eradication rates for Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria were 97.1% and 56.8%, respectively, and the drug was especially effective against Gram-positive bacteria. No side effects nor refusal of ingestion were observed. As abnormalities in laboratory test results, 3 cases of elevation of eosinophil counts and 1 of elevation of platelet counts were observed. In conclusion, CFPZ was considered to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic in pediatric infections.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the HpaI restriction-modification genes.
AB  - The genes from Haemophilus parainfluenzae encoding the HpaI restriction-modification system were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. From the DNA sequence, we predicted the HpaI endonuclease (R.HpaI) to have 254 amino acid residues (Mr 29,630) and the HpaI methyltransferase (M.HpaI) to have 314 amino acid residues (37,390). The R.HpaI and M.HpaI genes overlapped by 16 base pairs on the chromosomal DNA. The genes had the same orientation. The clone, named E. coli HB101-HPA2, overproduced R.HpaI. R.HpaI activity from the clone was 100-fold that from H. parainfluenzae. The amino acid sequence of M.HpaI was compared with those of other type II methyltransferases.
TI  - Antigenic diversity in Haemophilus ducreyi as shown by western blot (immunoblot)  analysis.
AB  - The antigenic diversity within a panel of 63 Haemophilus ducreyi isolates was examined by Western blot (immunoblot) analysis with a pool of 238 well-characterized human antisera. When a serum pool adsorbed on a mixture of Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, and H. parahaemolyticus was used, the immunoprofiles suggested that prominent antigenic proteins involved in the human immune response have apparent molecular masses of 63, 42, 34 to 30, and 28.5 to 28 kDa. Preliminary subcellular localization revealed that these antigens are associated with the cellular membrane. Two subsets of antigens were discriminated by detergent extraction. There was no evidence that the antigen composition is altered by changing the growth conditions. With a serum pool adsorbed on the Haemophilus spp. mixture supplemented with Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Pasteurella ureae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Escherichia coli, antigenic determinants more specific for H. ducreyi were identified. An immunodominant 28.5- to 28-kDa protein was expressed by all H. ducreyi isolates. In the range from 34 to 30 kDa, 56 isolates revealed a dominant protein with variable molecular mass. By using both proteins (28.5 to 28 kDa and 34 to 30 kDa) as immunotypic markers, seven different immunopatterns were identified. Antigenic diversity among isolates from different geographical origins as well as from a single area was observed.
TI  - [A study on in vitro antibacterial activity and clinical usefulness in respiratory tract infections of panipenem/betamipron, a newly synthesized carbapenem antibiotic].
AB  - Panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) is a combination drug of PAPM, a new parenteral carbapenem antibiotic and BP, an amino acid derivative at a weight ratio of 1:1. Its in vitro antibacterial activities against clinically isolated respiratory pathogenic bacteria were determined. It was superior to imipenem (IPM) in the in vitro antibacterial activities against Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli. PAPM had antibacterial activities almost equal to those of IPM against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus spp. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, its antibacterial activity was about 1/4 that of IPM. The clinical usefulness of PAPM/BP was studied by dissolving it in a solution containing lactate and administering the solution by intravenous drip infusion to 12 cases of respiratory tract infections. Out of 11 cases with respiratory tract infections excluding cytomegalovirus pneumonia, the efficacy rate was 90.9%, with 4 cases of excellent and 6 cases of good responses. In terms of its bacteriological efficacies, eradication of pathogenic bacteria including super-infection were observed in 2 out of 4 strains, but 2 strains of P. aeruginosa remained unchanged. Six strains appeared as superinfected bacteria during and after administration of this preparation substituting original pathogens. Side-effects were not observed in the 12 cases, and in laboratory tests, slight transient increases of S-GOT and S-GPT were found in 1 case. In conclusion, PAPM/BP is a very useful parenteral antibiotic against respiratory tract infections and can be one of the drugs of the first choice.
TI  - Copper-zinc superoxide dismutase of Haemophilus influenzae and H. parainfluenzae.
AB  - Copper-zinc superoxide dismutase ([Cu,Zn]-SOD) is widely found in eukaryotes but  has only rarely been identified in bacteria. Here we describe sodC, encoding [Cu,Zn]-SOD in Haemophilus influenzae and H. parainfluenzae, frequent colonists and pathogens of the human respiratory tract. In capsulate H. influenzae, sodC was found in only one division of the bacterial population, and although the protein it encoded was clearly [Cu,Zn]-SOD from its deduced sequence, it lacked enzymatic activity. In H. parainfluenzae, in contrast, active enzyme was synthesized which appeared to be secreted beyond the cytoplasm when the gene was expressed in Escherichia coli minicells. The origin of gene transcription differed between the Haemophilus species, but protein synthesis from cloned genes in vitro was comparable. A C-T transition was found in the H. influenzae sequence compared with the H. parainfluenzae sequence, leading to a histidine, known to be crucial in eukaryotic [Cu,Zn]-SOD for copper ion coordination and so for enzymatic activity, to be changed to tyrosine. This is speculated to be the cause of inactivity of the H. influenzae enzyme. Secreted SODs have only been described in a few bacterial species, and this is the first identification of [Cu,Zn]-SOD in a common human upper respiratory tract colonist. The role of secreted bacterial SODs is unknown, and we speculate that in Haemophilus species the enzyme may confer survival advantage by accelerating dismutation of superoxide of environmental origin to hydrogen peroxide, disruptive to the normal mucociliary clearance process in the host.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefdinir fine granules  in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - The Pharmacokinetics and clinical effectiveness of cefdinir (CFDN, FK482) were examined in pediatric patients. The results are summarized as follows. 1. Plasma concentrations and urinary excretions of CFDN after administration of 5% fine granules were investigated on 4 children at a dose level of 6 mg/kg. Average plasma concentrations peaked at 4 hours after administration at 0.99 micrograms/ml with a half-life of 2.12 hours. The first 24-hour urinary recovery rates of CFDN in 3 children averaged 22.0%. 2. CFDN was given to 24 children (11 with pharyngitis, 3 with tonsillitis, 8 with scarlet fever, 1 with urinary tract infection and 1 with enteritis due to Salmonella); 15 were treated with 5% fine granules and 9 with 10% fine granules at daily doses of about 10 mg/kg in 2 to 3 divided portions. Clinical effects were excellent in 16, good in 7 and not evaluable in 1, with an overall efficacy rate of 100%. 3. Identified causative organisms were 12 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 4 of Haemophilus influenzae, 5 of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 1 of Escherichia coli, and 1 of Salmonella. Bacteriological effects were rated as "eradicated" for 19 strains, "unchanged" for 4 with an eradication rate of 82.6%. 4. No side effects were observed. As for abnormal laboratory test results, a transient decrease of white blood cells was observed in 1 patient. 5. The CFDN fine granule preparations were preferably accepted by the children. 6. The fine granular preparations of CFDN, a new oral antibiotic, were useful for the treatment of bacterial infections in pediatrics.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefdinir 5% fine granules in pediatrics].
AB  - Clinical evaluation in pediatrics on cefdinir (CFDN, FK482) (5% fine granules), a new oral cephem, was performed. 1. CFDN was administered to 112 pediatric patients with ages between 1 month to 13 years with various infections. Dose levels used were 3.0-8.9 mg/kg (mean 5.1 mg/kg) t.i.d. for 3-14 days (mean 6.7 days). The studied patients included 2 patients with scarlet fever, 6 with acute pharyngitis, 6 with acute rhinopharyngitis, 52 with acute purulent tonsillitis, 8 with acute bronchitis, 24 with acute pneumonia, 7 with acute urinary tract infections, 1 with acute vaginitis, and 6 with impetigo. Total doses ranged from 0.6 to 4.05 g. One hundred eleven of the 112 patients were evaluated for clinical efficacy and all the patients were evaluated for safety. 2. Clinical effects were excellent in 51 cases, good in 57, and fair in 3 with an extremely high efficacy rate of 97.3%. Efficacy rates were 100% in scarlet fever, acute pharyngitis, acute purulent tonsillitis, acute bronchitis, acute vaginitis and impetigo, and 83.3%, 95.7%, 85.7% in acute rhinopharyngitis, acute pneumonia, and acute urinary tract infections, respectively. Good clinical effects were observed regardless of diseases. 3. Causative organisms were identified in 79 cases, of which 71 were found to be monobacterial infections and 8 were found to be multi-bacterial infections. In mono-bacterial infections, clinical efficacies were 100% for those caused by Staphylococcus aureus/Streptococcus pyogenes/Streptococcus pneumoniae/beta-Streptococcus except those in A and B groups with an overall efficacy of 100% against Gram-positive cocci (GPC) and they were 89.5%, 100%, 100% for those caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Escherichia coli, respectively, with an overall efficacy of 90.3% in Gram-negative rods (GNR). In multi-bacterial infections also, a clinical efficacy of 100% was obtained. 4. Bacteriological effects were studied for 89 strains in the 79 cases. The eradication rate for a few strains of S. pneumoniae was low, 25%, but it was 100% for S. aureus, with the same results for S. pyogenes, and beta-Streptococcus. The eradication rate on GPC was high 94.1%. Among GNR, 66.7% of E. coli, 50.0% of H. influenzae, and 71.4% of H. parainfluenzae was eradicated. The overall eradication rate for GNR was 55.3%, lower than that for GPC. Microbial substitutions were observed in 13 cases, with Haemophilus sp. replacing other bacteria. 5. Diarrhea and soft stools were noted in 4 and 2 patients, respectively. The severity of these side effects, however, was slight and it was possible to continue the CFDN treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Haemophilus parainfluenzae causing sexually transmitted urethritis. Report of a case and evidence for a beta-lactamase plasmid mobilizable to Escherichia coli by an Inc-W plasmid.
AB  - A multiple antibiotic resistance, beta-lactamase-producing strain of Haemophilus  parainfluenzae was isolated from a patient with sexually transmitted urethritis that was contracted in Northwest Africa. The strain was found to harbor a small (3.2 megadaltons) plasmid encoding for beta-lactamase production, which was successfully mobilized to Escherichia coli in triparental mating experiments by means of a broad host-range Inc-W conjugative plasmid. Since H. parainfluenzae is believed to be a source and reservoir for the spread of beta-lactamase plasmids to other bacterial species, such a plasmid mobilization may suggest a new possible means for resistance plasmid dissemination.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefpirome in the field  of pediatrics].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized below. 1. Antibacterial activities of CPR against clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were superior to those of ceftazidime. 2. Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of CPR at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 2 cases each were determined. Mean peak plasma concentrations of CPR at these dose levels were 33.9, 62.9 and 96.0 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes with plasma half-lives of 1.58, 1.69, and 2.13 hours, respectively. Mean cumulative urinary excretion rates in the first 8 hours after administration were 51.2, 78.0 and 74.9%, respectively. 3. Ten patients with bacterial infections (pneumonia 5 cases, urinary tract infection 5 cases) were treated with CPR at a daily dose of 16-79 mg/kg/day. The overall clinical efficacy and bacteriological eradication rates were both 100%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed except in 1 case of mild pain in blood vessels. Abnormal laboratory test results were also mild, slight elevation of GOT, GPT and thrombocytosis in 1 case and eosinophilia in 1 case.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefpirome in pediatric field].
AB  - We conducted a study on the pharmacokinetics and clinical application of cefpirome (CPR) in children. 1. A single intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg of CPR was given to a two-month-old boy, and the concentration of the drug in the blood was measured. Fifteen minutes after administration, the concentration was 53.3 micrograms/ml, and it gradually decreased thereafter, reaching a level of 5.18 micrograms/ml after 8 hours with a half-life in the plasma of 2.36 hours. 2. A single intravenous injection of 700 mg (50 mg/kg) of CPR and that of cefotaxime (CTX) were given to a girl with suppurative meningitis (3 years old, 14 kg, causative bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae), and concentrations of the drugs in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid after 1 hour were measured. On the second day of illness, the concentration of CTX in the plasma was 39.4 micrograms/ml and the concentration of desacetyl-CTX (D-CTX) was 25.2 micrograms/ml, while concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid were 6.22 micrograms/ml (15.8%) for CTX and 3.94 micrograms/ml (15.6%) for D-CTX. On the third day of illness, concentration of CPR in the plasma was 59.3 micrograms/ml, while its concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid was 7.44 micrograms/ml (12.5%). 3. CPR was intravenously administered in daily dosages of 37.7-75.0 mg/kg in 2-3 portions for periods of 4-15 days to 2 patients with septicemia (causative bacteria, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1 case and Escherichia coli in the other), 1 patient with bronchitis (K. pneumoniae), 9 patients with pneumonia (1 case of Staphylococcus aureus, 3 cases of H. influenzae, 2 cases of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 1 case of K. pneumoniae + Pseudomonas cepacia, 2 cases of H. influenzae + Branhamella catarrhalis), 2 patients with cellulitis (1 case of S. aureus, 1 case, causative agent unknown), 1 patient with suppurative lymphadenitis (causative agent, unknown), 1 patient with staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, 1 patient with renal abscess (causative agent, unknown), and 1 patient with a urinary tract infection (E. coli), for a total of 18 patients, with excellent results in 9 cases and good results in 9 cases, hence an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained. 4. As an accompanying side-effect, eruption was observed in 1 of the 18 patients, but when administration was discontinued, the symptom gradually receded, and it disappeared by the 4th day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Utilization of enterobactin and other exogenous iron sources by Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. paraphrophilus.
AB  - The ability of Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. paraphrophilus to utilize iron complexes, iron-proteins and exogenous microbial siderophores was evaluated. In a plate bioassay, all three species used not only ferric nitrate but also the iron chelates ferric citrate, ferric nitrilotriacetate and ferric 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate. Each Haemophilus species examined also used haemin, haemoglobin and haem-albumin as iron sources although only H. influenzae could acquire iron from transferrin or from haemoglobin complexed with haptoglobin. None of the haemophili obtained iron from ferritin or lactoferrin or from the microbial siderophores aerobactin or desferrioxamine B. However, the phenolate siderophore enterobactin supplied iron to both H. parainfluenzae and H. paraphrophilus, and DNA isolated from both organisms hybridized with a DNA probe prepared from the Escherichia coli ferric enterobactin receptor gene fepA. In addition, a monospecific polyclonal antiserum raised against the E. coli 81 kDa ferric enterobactin receptor (FepA) recognized an iron-repressible outer membrane protein (OMP) in H. parainfluenzae of between 80 and 82 kDa (depending on the strain). This anti-FepA serum did not cross-react with any of the OMPs of H. paraphrophilus or H. influenzae. The OMPs of each Haemophilus species were also probed with antisera raised against the 74 kDa Cir or 74 kDa IutA (aerobactin receptor) proteins of E. coli. Apart from one H. parainfluenzae strain (NCTC 10665), in which an OMP of about 80 kDa cross-reacted with the anti-IutA sera, no cross-reactivity was observed between Cir, IutA and the OMPs of H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae or H. paraphrophilus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antigenic similarities in lipopolysaccharides of Haemophilus and Neisseria and expression of a digalactoside structure also present on human cells.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies raised against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were used to investigate similarities or differences in the lipopolysaccharide antigens of pathogenic and commensal strains of several Gram-negative bacteria indigenous to mucosal surfaces of humans. In immunoblotting experiments, 20 of 36 monoclonal antibodies showed cross-reactions between species of Neisseria and Haemophilus. The common epitopes were present on N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, N. lactamica, H. influenzae including biogroup aegyptius, and occasionally H. parainfluenzae. No other commensal Neisseria or Gram-negative organisms tested reacted with the monoclonal antibodies with one exception; a single strain of pathogenic Escherichia coli was recognised by a N. gonorrhoeae-specific monoclonal antibody. One monoclonal antibody, raised against N. gonorrhoeae lipopolysaccharide, reacted with N. gonorrhoeae (32 of 59 strains), N. meningitidis (9 of 26 strains), H. influenzae (6 of 16 strains). An epitope expressed by H. influenzae and implicated in its virulence was also present on 14 of 59 strains of N. gonorrhoeae and was shown to comprise a digalactoside structure, alpha-galactosyl-1,4-beta-galactose (Gal alpha 1,4Gal beta), also found on human cells.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on norfloxacin in the pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic , bacteriological and clinical studies on norfloxacin (NFLX), a quinolone-carboxylic acid antibacterial agent, were conducted in the pediatric field. 1. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion of NFLX after single dose of 2.2 approximately 5.6 mg/kg (mean 4.4 +/- 1.2 mg/kg) were determined in 13 children with ages between 6 and 11 years. The mean peak serum concentration of the drug was 0.37 +/- 0.20 micrograms/ml at 2 hours after administration. The mean half-life of the drug in serum was 2.8 +/- 0.4 hours and the serum concentration at 8 hours was 0.11 +/- 0.06 micrograms/ml. The mean urinary concentration reached a maximum of 125.2 +2- 166.2 micrograms/ml in pooled urine from 0 to 2 hours and the mean urinary recovery rate in the first 8 hours after administration was 22.1 +/- 6.0%. A dose-response relationship was observed between doses/body weight and peak serum concentrations. 2. The clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and the safety of NFLX were evaluated in 65 pediatric patients with ages between 2 years 10 months and 15 years 7 months with infections. In 62 assessable cases (acute purulent tonsillitis 9 cases, acute pneumonia 3 cases, chronic rhinitis 1 case, urinary tract infections 15 cases, and acute colitis 34 cases), clinical efficacies were excellent in 48 cases, good in 13 cases, and fair in 1 case with an overall efficacy rate of 98.4%. Staphylococcus aureus 1 strain, Staphylococcus epidermidis 1 strain, Escherichia coli 10 strains, Salmonella sp. 5 strains, Morganella morganii 1 strain, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3 strains, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 1 strain and Campylobacter jejuni 12 strains were isolated from the patients as pathogens. Bacteriologically, all of these strains were eradicated except that 3 strains of C. jejuni only decreased. With regard to side effects, dizziness and nausea were observed in 1 case each but they were slight and the continuation of the treatment was possible. No abnormal laboratory test data were observed. From the above results, NFLX was considered to be a useful drug for the treatment of pediatric infections.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the HpaII methylase gene.
AB  - The HpaII restriction-modification system from Haemophilus parainfluenzae recognizes the DNA sequence CCGG. The gene for the HpaII methylase has been cloned into E. coli and its nucleotide sequence has been determined. The DNA of the clones is fully protected against cleavage by the HpaII restriction enzyme in vitro, indicating that the methylase gene is active in E. coli. The clones were isolated in an McrA-strain of E. coli; attempts to isolate them in an McrA+ strain were unsuccessful. The clones do not express detectable HpaII restriction endonuclease activity, suggesting that either the endonuclease gene is not expressed well in E. coli, or that it is not present in its entirety in any of the clones that we have isolated. The derived amino acid sequence of the HpaII methylase shows overall similarity to other cytosine methylases. It bears a particularly close resemblance to the sequences of the HhaI, BsuFI and MspI methylases. When compared with three other methylases that recognize CCGG, the variable region of the HpaII methylase, which is believed to be responsible for sequence specific recognition, shows some similarity to the corresponding regions of the BsuFI and MspI methylases, but is rather dissimilar to that of the SPR methylase.
TI  - [Clinical studies on cefixime in pediatrics].
AB  - Clinical usefulness of cefixime (CFIX), a new oral cephalosporin antibiotic, in pediatric field was investigated. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. The clinical efficacy of CFIX was investigated in a total of 138 children including 49 with upper respiratory tract infections (RTI), 22 with acute bronchitis, 18 with pneumonia, 19 with scarlet fever and 21 with urinary tract infections (UTI). 2. Clinical effectiveness was excellent in 58, good in 60, fair in 14 and poor in 3, with an overall efficacy rate of 87.4%. The efficacy rate classified according to types of infection were 85.7% in upper RTI, 89.5% in acute bronchitis, 94.4% in pneumonia, 78.9% in scarlet fever, and 90.5% in UTI. 3. Out of the suspected causative organisms, 43 strains of a total of 50 strains isolated were eradicated. The bacteriological eradication rate was 86.0%. (Haemophilus influenzae 100%, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 100%, Streptococcus pyogenes 88.5%, Escherichia coli 85.7%). 4. One hundred forty four children were analyzed for side effect. Side effects were observed in 2 children (1.4%) with diarrhea in 1 and anorexia in another. Abnormal laboratory test results were recorded in 4 children (3.3%). The above results suggest that CFIX is a very useful new oral cephalosporin for the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - [Clinical studies of cefteram pivoxil in pediatrics].
AB  - The clinical efficacy and the safety of cefteram pivoxil granule (CFTM-PI, T-2588), a newly prepared drug for pediatric use, were performed. A total of 60 patients with ages between 6 months and 14 years 3 months with pediatric infections were medicated with CFTM-PI at dose levels of 3.2-9.9 mg/kg 3 times daily for 3-11 days. Clinical responses to the drug were excellent in 3 of 3 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 14, good in 5 and poor in 2 of 21 patients with acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 1 and good in 2 of 3 patients with acute bronchitis, excellent in 16 and good in 8 of 24 patients with acute pneumonia, excellent in 3 and good in 1 of 4 patients with acute urinary tract infection and excellent in 2 of 2 patients with acute purulent lymphadenitis, hence the overall clinical efficacy rate was 96.5% in a total of 57 patients. Bacteriological responses to the drug were as follows: Eradicated, 8 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 3 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 19 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive; 7, beta-lactamase negative; 12), 1 strain of Haemophilus parainfluenzae (beta-lactamase positive) and 4 strains of Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase positive; 1, beta-lactamase negative; 3), decreased, 1 strain of S. pyogenes, hence the eradication rate was 97.2%. No side effects were encountered in any of the patients but for 3 who had diarrhoea and 1 who had loose stool, though these changes were slight. As abnormal laboratory test data, elevation of GOT was noted in 1 case, thrombocytosis and elevation of GPT in another. Also, none of the patients refused or complained of difficulty in intaking of the drug via oral route. In conclusion, CFTM-PI appeared to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic against pediatric infections.
TI  - [Clinical studies on cefteram pivoxil granules in pediatrics].
AB  - A newly developed cephalosporin, cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI, T-2588), was evaluated clinically in 40 patients. A pharmacokinetic study was also performed with 8 patients. CFTM-PI was administered as granules. One patient was given CFTM-PI at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg, each of 3 patients was given the drug at a dose of 3 mg/kg and each of 4 patients at a dose of 6 mg/kg. In most cases, serum concentrations of CFTM were determined at 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours after dosing. Urinary concentrations of CFTM were measured for urinary samples collected during periods of 0-2, 2-4, 4-6 and 6-8 hours after dosing. CFTM was assayed using the disk or the cup method using Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 10031 as the test organism. The clinical evaluation was conducted in 40 children including 13 patients of acute tonsillitis, 10 of acute lacunar tonsillitis, 10 of scarlet fever, 2 of acute bronchitis, 2 of pneumonia, and 1 each of pneumonia with enteritis, phlegmon and urinary tract infection. The patients were from 4 months to 13 years old. Daily doses were from 8.7 to 12 mg/kg. After CFTM-PI administration in doses 1.5 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg, peak serum concentrations of CFTM were 0.38 microgram/ml, 0.73-2.25 micrograms/ml and 1.2-2.9 micrograms/ml, respectively, and half-lives were 1.55, 0.95-2.30 and 0.80-2.72 hours, respectively. Urinary excretion rates up to 6 or 8 hours after dosing were 10.8-24.7%. Clinical efficacies of CFTM-PI in 40 patients were "excellent" in 27 children, "good" in 12 children and "fair" in 1 with an efficacy rate of 97.5%. Twenty seven strains of causative organisms, including 15 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 of Escherichia coli, 1 of Salmonella 04, 6 of Haemophilus influenzae, 1 of Haemophilus parainfluenzae and 3 of Branhamella catarrhalis, were isolated. After treatment all strains except 1 strain of B. catarrhalis (unchanged), Salmonella 04 (unknown) and 1 strain of H. parainfluenzae (unknown) were eradicated. Side effects observed clinically were only 1 case of diarrhea. Eosinophilia was observed in 1 case.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefteram pivoxil in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies on cefteram pivoxil(cefteram) a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. Serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and urinary recovery rates of cefteram (CFTM) were determined upon oral administration after meal of cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI) at doses of 3 mg/kg granules in 2 cases and 6 mg/kg granules in 2. Peak serum levels of CFTM were obtained at 3 hours in 2 cases and 4 hours in 2 cases after administration of the drug with a range of 0.74-2.2 micrograms/ml with half-lives of 0.77-3.62 hours. Urinary recovery rates in 8 hours after administration ranged from 9.6-23.0%. 2. MICs of CFTM against 22 clinical isolates (Streptococcus pyogenes 4 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 4, Staphylococcus aureus 2, Branhamella catarrhalis 1, Haemophilus influenzae 8, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 1, and Escherichia coli 2) were compared with those of cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin (CEX), and ampicillin (ABPC). The antibacterial activity of CFTM was superior to those of CCL and CEX, and was superior against Gram-negative rods and equal against Gram-positive cocci to those of ABPC. 3. Twenty-six pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases (scarlet fever 3 cases, tonsillitis 7, epiglottitis 1, bronchitis 5, pneumonia 5, urinary tract infection 3, cervical lymphadenitis 2) were treated with CFTM-PI at daily doses of 9.3-15.3 mg/kg t.i.d. as a rule. The efficacy rates were 100% clinically and 70% bacteriologically. 4. Side effects or abnormal laboratory test values were not observed except for an increased platelet count in 1 case.
TI  - [Clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil dry syrup in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807) dry syrup was administered orally to 31 patients with various infections at daily dose levels between 5.4 and 10.9 mg/kg divided into three doses. 1. The subjects were 3 patients with urinary tract infections, 25 with tonsillitis and 1 patient each with bronchitis, pneumonia, and cervical lymphadenitis. Clinical effects were excellent in 16 cases, good in 14, and fair in 1 (tonsillitis), with an overall efficacy rate of 96.8%. 2. Organisms suspected as pathogens were 32 strains (6 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 of Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 of Enterococcus faecalis, 15 of Haemophilus influenzae, 5 of Haemophilus parainfluenzae and 3 of Escherichia coli). Bacteriologically, eradication of pathogens were observed in 30 strains, decrease in one (H. parainfluenzae), and no change in another (E. faecalis), thus the eradication rate was 93.8%. 3. Side effect was observed in 1 case (slight eruption) but it was possible continue the treatment. Abnormal laboratory test values were observed in 1 case of a slight prolongation of prothrombin time and eosinophilia, but they were not serious. Diarrhea was not observed in any patients. 4. All the medication was done on schedule. No refusal of the drug occurred due to its taste or odor.
TI  - [Clinical and pharmacokinetic study on cefodizime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, in the pediatric infections].
AB  - Cefodizime (THR-221, CDZM), a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in 27 children with various bacterial infections. The episodes of infections included pneumonia (6 cases), bronchopneumonia (11 cases), lung abscess (1 case), acute pharyngitis (2 cases), cervical lymphadenitis (1 case), infected cephalohematoma (1 case), urinary tract infection (1 case), sepsis (2 cases) and purulent meningitis (2 cases). CDZM was effective in all but one, and its efficacy rate was 96.3%. The main etiologic pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Branhamella catarrhalis. The elimination rate was 92.3%. As adverse reactions or abnormalities, diarrhea was encountered in 4 cases. A slight elevation of serum transaminases or eosinophils was observed in 4 cases. The serum half-life was approximately 1.8-1.9 hours in children after intravenous bolus injections. Concentrations of CDZM in cerebrospinal fluids were well above MIC values of CDZM against those organisms responsible for the infections. The data suggest that CDZM is a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with bacterial infections including purulent meningitis.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of sulbactam/ampicillin in the pediatric field].
AB  - The usefulness of sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) in the treatment of pediatric infections was evaluated. 1. Twenty pediatric patients with infection were treated with SBT/ABPC and an intravenous dosage of 27.8-47.4 mg/kg, 3 to 4 times a day. Clinical efficacies in 18 patients excluding 2 patients of Mycoplasma pneumonia (9 cases of pneumonia, 6 urinary tract infection, 1 tonsillitis, 1 maxillary sinusitis and 1 osteomyelitis) were judged to be excellent in 13 patients and good in 5. There was no case of failure. 2. Bacteriological efficacies against 16 strains (1 Staphylococcus aureus, 3 Enterococcus faecalis, 4 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 5 Escherichia coli and 1 Serratia sp.) isolated from 13 of the 18 patients were rated as "eradicated" for 13 strains, "decreased" for 1 and "unchanged" for 2 with an eradication rate of 81.3%. Of 13 strains eradicated, 3 were those with high beta-lactamase productivity. 3. Rash as a side effect developed in 1 patient and eosinophilia and elevated GOT and GPT were observed in 7 patients but none of them were serious. 4. Blood levels of the drug following an intravenous dose of 30 mg/kg were determined in 2 pediatric patients. Blood levels of SBT and ABPC at 30 minutes after intravenous administration were 19.0 and 29.2 micrograms/ml in one patient and 21.0 and 31.6 micrograms/ml in another, respectively, and those at 4 hours were 0.48 and 0.62 microgram/ml in one patient and 0.59 and 0.89 microgram/ml in another, respectively. The half-lives of SBT were 0.67 and 0.70 hour and those of ABPC were 0.64 and 0.69 hour in the 2 patients, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Studies on sulbactam/ampicillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) were carried out in the field of pediatrics. 1. Absorption and excretion Serum levels and urinary excretion of SBT/ABPC were studied in 4 children with ages 6 to 8 years. The mean serum concentration of SBT at 15 minutes following a single intravenous injection of 30 mg/kg of SBT/ABPC was 27.4 +/- 2.2 micrograms/ml and that of ABPC was 42.8 +/- 3.9 micrograms/ml, and their concentrations declined with mean half-lives of 1.06 +/- 0.15 hours and 0.84 +/- 0.05 hour, respectively, and at 6 hours were 0.3 +/- 0.2 microgram/ml and 0.2 +/- 0.1 microgram/ml on the average, respectively. The urinary recovery rates of SBT and ABPC at 6 hours after the injection were 59.0 +/- 22.4% and 58.4 +/- 25.3% on the average, respectively. 2. Clinical study SBT/ABPC was used for the treatment of a total of 36 pediatric patients with ages ranging 2 months to 11 years and it's clinical effectiveness, bacteriological efficacy and adverse effects were evaluated. Clinical efficacies in 5 patients with acute purulent tonsillitis, 26 with acute pneumonia and 1 with acute pyelonephritis were judged to be excellent in 27 cases and good in 5 cases with an overall efficacy ratio of 100.0%. Clinical efficacies in 6 patients whose infections were caused by beta-lactamase producing strains were judged to be excellent in all cases. Bacteriological efficacies of SBT/ABPC were assessed on 1 strain of Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase producing strain), 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 16 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (5 beta-lactamase producing strains and 11 non-beta-lactamase producing strains), 1 non-beta-lactamase strain of Haemophilus parainfluenzae and 2 strains of Escherichia coli (non-beta-lactamase producing strains). All strains except 1 strain of H. influenzae (beta-lactamase producing strain) which decreased in number were eradicated with a bacteriological eradication rate of 95.5%. Only 1 patient complained of diarrhea which was suspected to be related to the drug. No other side effect was reported. Elevations of GOT and GPT were observed in only 1 patient. The above results suggested that SBT/ABPC was a useful drug with preferable safety profile in the treatment for pediatric patients with infectious disease caused by beta-lactamase producing strains as well as those by non-beta-lactamase producing strains.
TI  - [Clinical studies on sulbactam/ampicillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - During 8 months from October 1986 to May 1987, the clinical efficacy of sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) was evaluated in 63 pediatric inpatients with various infections. Clinical efficacies were evaluable in 58 patients among them (consisting of 2 patients with sepsis, 3 with tonsillitis, 12 with bronchitis, 6 with bronchopneumonia, 24 with pneumonia, 1 with phlegmon, 2 with lymphadenitis, 1 with impetigo and 7 with urinary tract infection) and were excellent in 40 patients and good in 17 with an overall efficacy rate of 98.3%. Bacteriological efficacies were assessed in 25 patients and 27 strains of organisms (consisting of 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 Streptococcus pyogenes, 2 beta-Streptococcus, 1 Gram-positive cocci, 5 Escherichia coli, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes, 7 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 1 Branhamella catarrhalis, 1 Proteus mirabilis and 1 Salmonella subgenus I). Bacteriological eradication rates were 88.9% for Gram-positive organisms, 66.7% for Gram-negative organisms and 74.1% overall. No superinfection was observed in any of patients treated. Side effects and clinical laboratory parameter abnormalities observed consisted of diarrhea in 7 (11.1%) of the 63 patients, eosinophilia in 2 (3.3%) of 61 tested, thrombocytosis in 3 (5.5%) of 55, elevation of direct bilirubin in 1 (3.3%) of 30, elevation of total bilirubin in 1 (3.1%) of 32, elevation of GOT in 4 (6.8%) of 59 and elevation of GPT in 1 (1.7%) of 59 patients tested. As an effect on the hemostatic mechanism of this drug, PIVKA II was detected in 1 patient (4.2%) of 24 tested, but findings of other coagulation tests were normal and none of patients showed bleeding tendency or inhibition of platelet aggregation. From the above results, it appears that SBT/ABPC is an efficacious and safe drug in the treatment of bacterial infections of pediatric patients.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of sultamicillin fine granule in pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on sultamicillin (SBTPC) fine granule were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activities of SBTPC against clinically isolated strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Escherichia coli were compared with those of ampicillin (ABPC). SBTPC was superior to ABPC especially against beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae, E. coli, S. aureus, and B. catarrhalis. 2. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates of sulbactam (SBT) and ABPC after administration of SBTPC fine granule at a dose level of 10 mg/kg in 2 cases were determined. Mean half-lives of SBT and ABPC in the serum following oral administration were about 1.33 and 1.61 hours respectively. Mean urinary recovery rates of SBT and ABPC in 6 hours after oral administration at a dose of 10 mg/kg were 58.7% and 49.6% respectively. 3. SBTPC fine granule was administered to 20 pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (pneumonia 8 cases, bronchitis 2, pharyngitis 2, tonsillitis 4, subcutaneous abscess 1 and urinary tract infection 3). The overall clinical efficacy rate was 100% and the overall bacteriological eradication rate was 75%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed except 1 case of loose stool. No abnormal laboratory test values were observed. These results indicate the usefulness of SBTPC fine granule in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - DNA probe technology for rapid detection of Haemophilus influenzae in clinical specimens.
AB  - In a previous study, we reported that a 5-kilobase Haemophilus influenzae DNA fragment involved in penicillin-binding protein expression could be used as a probe for specific detection of H. influenzae strains (F. Malouin and L. E. Bryan, Mol. Cell. Probes 1:221-232, 1987). Here, we report the ability of this probe to detect H. influenzae in clinical specimens. In a bacterial dot experiment, there was strong hybridization of the 32P-labeled probe to nonencapsulated and serotype a through f H. influenzae strains. The detection of H. influenzae in body fluids was then evaluated by using pooled human serum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and sputum as dilution media for H. influenzae, Haemophilus aegyptius, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Escherichia coli cells. At 65 degrees C, the probe hybridized to H. influenzae and H. aegyptius (greater than or equal to 10(5) cells) in all fluids. There was no hybridization with the E. coli negative control, and H. parainfluenzae hybridized when greater than or equal to 10(7) cells were used. Experiments performed at 73 and 80 degrees C permitted elimination of H. parainfluenzae hybridization. The detection of H. influenzae in 232 sputa from patients with respiratory tract infections was very specific (96 to 97%) and sensitive (74 to 100%) when the total time of the procedure was sufficient (6 to 24 h) and when the experiments were performed at 80 degrees C. In addition, the probe detected three of three and four of four H. influenzae-infected cerebrospinal fluids and blood cultures, respectively, and did not react with pneumococcus- or streptococcus-infected cerebrospinal fluids. Finally, by using a small-scale procedure, the probe rapidly detected H. influenzae in cerebrospinal fluid and sputum specimens (4 and 8 h, respectively). These results imply prompt diagnosis of H. influenzae infections caused by nonencapsulated and serotype a through f strains.
TI  - In vitro activities of PD 117,596 and reference antibiotics against 448 clinical  bacterial strains.
AB  - The in vitro activity of PD 117,596, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic, was tested against 448 bacterial isolates (15 genera) by agar dilution (inoculum, 10(4) CFU per spot). The activity of PD 117,596 was compared with that of 15 antibiotics against 327 gram-negative strains and with that of 8 other antibiotics against 121 gram-positive strains. PD 117,596 demonstrated the best activity against Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, and Branhamella catarrhalis (MICs for 90% of the isolates [MIC90S], 0.008 to 0.25 microgram/ml). PD 117,596 (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml) was at least twofold more active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas spp. PD 117,596 and ciprofloxacin were similar in activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Legionella pneumophila, and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 0.002 to 0.125 microgram/ml). PD 117,596 was more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcal groups A, B, C, and G, S. pneumoniae, and enterococci (MIC90S, 0.06 to 0.125 microgram/ml). Against Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, PD 117,596 (MIC90S, 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml) was 4- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and was most active against Corynebacterium spp. PD 117,596 appears to be the most active fluoroquinolone to date, with excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria and enhanced activity against gram-negative aerobic-facultative bacteria.
TI  - [Evaluation of cefuzonam in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefuzonam (L-105, CZON) was studied in pediatric infections. A summary of the results it as follows: For recently isolated Staphylococcus aureus strains, Peak MICs of CZON were distributed between 0.39 and 0.78 micrograms/ml showing a greater susceptibility of S. aureus to CZON than to cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX), and cefmenoxime (CMX). Peak MICs of CZON for Escherichia coli were 0.10-0.20 micrograms/ml, similar to those of CPZ, LMOX, and CMX. Ampicillin (ABPC)-resistant strains were also susceptible to CZON. MICs for Salmonella were similar to those for E. coli. Peak MICs of CZON for Vibrio parahaemolyticus were 0.20-0.39 micrograms/ml. The susceptibility of the bacteria to CZON was far greater than to ABPC, and was similar to CPZ, LMOX, and CMX. With 20 mg/kg drip infusion, serum concentrations reached their peaks at the end of administration with values of 20.6-68.7 micrograms/ml, which decreased to 0.43-1.70 micrograms/ml after 2 hours. Half-lives of CZON in serum were 0.68-1.2 hours. With 50 mg/kg drip infusion, serum concentrations reached their peaks at the end of administration with levels of 69.0-82.0 micrograms/ml, and at after 2 hours 1.85-3.45 micrograms/ml. Thus, an apparent dose response was observed. Half-lives of CZON in serum were 0.63-0.99 hours. Urinary recovery rates in 6 hours were 39.9-80.5%. A total of 44 cases of 10 different types of acute pediatric infections was treated by CZON intravenous drip infusion as the main therapeutic procedure. The efficacy rate was 93.2%, and the compound was effective on purulent infections, acute urinary tract infection, etc. with pathogens such as ABPC-resistant S. aureus, E. coli, and Enterococcus faecalis. Dosage levels per day were 50 to 80 mg/kg in most cases. In infections with S. aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3 strains), E. faecalis (1 strain), Haemophilus parahaemolyticus (1 strain), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (2 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (11 strains), Bordetella pertussis (1 strain), E. coli (3 strains), a total of 30 strains, bacterial elimination was noted with an exception of 1 strain of S. aureus. The compound was used for 4 to 15 days, but side effects observed clinically were only 1 case of diarrhea and 1 case of thrombocytosis.
TI  - Constitutive expression of tetracycline resistance mediated by a Tn10-like element in Haemophilus parainfluenzae results from a mutation in the repressor gene.
AB  - The Tn10-like constitutively expressed tetracycline resistance determinant from a Haemophilus parainfluenzae strain was cloned in Escherichia coli. Toxicity resulting from expression on multicopy plasmids necessitated its being cloned on a low-copy plasmid vector or in cells containing the Tn10-encoded repressor. Constitutive expression of tetracycline resistance was found to result from the synthesis of a truncated inactive repressor molecule. Instead of the 23-kilodalton repressor found in other Tn10-containing strains, this determinant encoded a 14.5-kilodalton molecule. The DNA sequence of the 700-base-pair region spanning the repressor gene and promoter-operator regions of the Haemophilus determinant was identical to that of the same region of Tn10, except for the absence of a single T X A base pair in the repressor gene. This deletion leads to premature termination of the protein. Antisera to the repressor suggested that the repressor was also absent in a second independently isolated H. parainfluenzae strain bearing a Tn10-like constitutive tetracycline resistance determinant.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefuzonam in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefuzonam (L-105, CZON), a new injectable cephalosporin, was used in 12 pediatric patients with infections. The following is a summary of the results: The 12 cases included 3 cases of tonsillitis (pathogen: Haemophilus parainfluenzae in 1 case, Haemophilus influenzae in 2 cases), 4 cases of pneumonia (Staphylococcus aureus in 1 case, pathogen unknown in 3 cases), 2 cases of nephropyelitis (Escherichia coli in 2 cases), 1 case of purulent lymphadenitis (pathogen unknown), 1 case of purulent thyroiditis (mixed infection of Streptococcus milleri, Haemophilus aphrophilus and anaerobes), and 1 case of vulvar abscess (E. coli). Dose levels of CZON were 42.9 approximately 93.3 mg/kg/day divided into 3 or 4 times and the drug was intravenously injected for 6 to 12 days. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 4 cases, good in 5 cases, and poor in 3 cases, with the efficacy rate of 75.0%. The 3 cases with poor efficacy consisted of 1 case each of pneumonia complicated with chronic granulomatosis, purulent thyroiditis associated with piriform recess fistula, and purulent lymphadenitis of armpit developed after surgical operation of congenital heart disease. In the first 2 cases satisfactory efficacy was not obtained by chemotherapy alone, and complete cure was seen after surgical operation. Side effects were not observed clinically. One case each of slight prolongation of prothrombin time and transient elevations of GOT and GPT values were noted but no severe abnormalities were found in laboratory tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam (L-105, CZON), a newly semisynthesized cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics and the following results were obtained. Antibacterial activities of CZON against clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and H. influenzae were compared with those of cefmenoxime (CMX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefoperazone (CPZ), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefazolin (CEZ). CZON was nearly as active as CEZ against S. aureus and S. epidermidis and superior to other antibiotics against other Gram-positive cocci. Against Gram-negative rods, CZON was as active as CMX and superior to other 5 antibiotics compared. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of CZON at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 1, 5 and 4 cases, respectively, were determined. Mean serum concentrations of CZON at these dose levels were 11.0, 43.8 and 111.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 2.4, 10.3 and 30.3 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.17, 0.72 and 1.28 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, with serum half-lives of 1.79, 0.88 and 1.19 hours, respectively. Mean cumulative urinary excretion rates within 6 hours after administration were 47.9, 56.3 and 40.3%, respectively. Thirty-four pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (tonsillitis 2, acute bronchitis 1, pneumonia 14, pyothorax 1, sepsis 1, suppurative lymphadenitis 1, UTI 13 and enteritis 1) were treated with CZON at a daily dose of 40-94 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d.. The overall clinical efficacy rate was 94.1%. No adverse reactions were observed except 2 cases with mild diarrhea. Abnormal laboratory findings were also mild; slight elevation of GOT and GPT in 2, eosinophilia in 1 and thrombocytosis in 1. These results clearly indicate the usefulness of CZON in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - Emergence of beta-lactamase producing anaerobic bacteria in the tonsils during penicillin treatment.
AB  - The emergence of beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the microflora in the oropharyngeal cavity was studied in ten healthy volunteers treated with 1 g phenoxymethylpenicillin b.i.d. for ten days. Beta-lactamase activity in saliva was also investigated. A significant increase in the number of beta-lactamase producing strains of Bacteroides species and Fusobacterium nucleatum was observed. One beta-lactamase producing Staphylococcus aureus strain was recovered in one of the volunteers before the penicillin administration started and three Staphylococcus aureus strains produced beta-lactamase after ten days of antibiotic treatment. Beta-lactamase-production in Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae or Branhamella catarrhalis was not observed before, during or after the antibiotic treatment. Beta-lactamase activity was noted in the broth cultures from one volunteer colonized with a beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli strain. Beta-lactamase activity in saliva was observed in all volunteers, the activity increasing significantly in parallel to the increase of beta-lactamase producing bacterial strains. Beta-lactamase activity in saliva was completely inhibited in vitro by clavulanic acid and p-chloromercurbenzoate and about 70-80 per cent of the activity was inhibited by cefoxitin. The increase of beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the oropharynx as a consequence of penicillin treatment raises doubt as to whether penicillin is the drug of choice in the treatment of tonsillitis caused by group A streptococci when previous treatment has failed.
TI  - Ceftriaxone administered once or twice a day for treatment of bacterial infections of childhood.
AB  - Twenty-six children received a single daily intravenous dose of ceftriaxone, 50 mg/kg, for a variety of bacterial infections including abscess (5), cellulitis (5), periorbital cellulitis (5), bacteremia without focus (4), osteomyelitis (2), pneumonia (2), pyelonephritis (2) and otitis media (1). Organisms isolated from infectious foci were Staphylococcus aureus (9), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), Streptococcus pyogenes (3), Escherichia coli (2); and Haemophilus influenzae type b, nontypable H. influenzae, Group B streptococcus, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and satelliting streptococcus (1 each). Microbiologic cure was achieved in 20 of 22 (91%) infections and clinical cure in 25 of 26 (96%). Fifteen possible adverse reactions occurred in 34 patients evaluable for drug safety; most were mild and self-limited. Neutropenia developed in two patients necessitating discontinuation of ceftriaxone in one, followed by prompt resolution. Seventeen children received ceftriaxone, 75 mg/kg/day, in two divided doses for a similar variety of infections. Bacteriologic and clinical cure rates of 100 and 94%, respectively, were demonstrated. Leukopenia developed in one patient and resolved when ceftriaxone was discontinued. Once a day dosing of ceftriaxone in pediatric patients provides greater ease of administration combined with efficacy equal to that achieved with a divided dosage schedule.
TI  - Transposon Tn10-like tetracycline resistance determinants in Haemophilus parainfluenzae.
AB  - Tetracycline resistance (Tcr) determinants from three different strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae expressed 10-fold higher levels of resistance when mated into Escherichia coli. No plasmid was found in any of the E. coli recipients, even in matings in which a plasmid was identified in the donor Haemophilus sp. The Tcr determinant from Haemophilus sp. caused instability of resident plasmids in the recipient E. coli: all plasmids were lost within 30 generations in antibiotic-free media. However, by serial subculture in antibiotics, stable resident plasmids were obtained which carried the Tcr determinant from Haemophilus sp. and were transferable by conjugation and transformation among E. coli strains. All Haemophilus determinants hybridized with a probe for the Tcr determinant on Tn10, which bears inducible Tcr. However, Haemophilus determinants were constitutively resistant to tetracycline in the Haemophilus donors and in the E. coli recipients. This constitutive expression was recessive to wild-type Tn10 in the same cell, indicating that the constitutive phenotype resulted from the absence of an active repressor. Restrictive enzyme analysis of various E. coli plasmid derivatives bearing a Tcr determinant from Haemophilus sp. demonstrated that the inserted DNA was of similar size (8.95 to 9.35 kilobases), close to that of Tn10. Heteroduplex analysis and DNA:DNA hybridization confirmed that the Tcr determinant from Haemophilus sp. had greater than 90% homology with the Tn10 determinant, including the DNA sequence for the repressor.
TI  - Treatment of 160 cases of acute bacterial meningitis with cefotaxime.
AB  - One hundred and sixty cases of acute bacterial meningitis were treated with cefotaxime. Patients were between 9 days and 79 years old: 7 new borns, 37 infants, 43 children, 19 adolescents and 54 adults. Fifty-eight patients (36%) were in coma when admitted. Aetiology was determined in 110 patients (68.8%): Neisseria meningitidis in 42, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 36, Haemophilus influenzae in 16, Salmonella spp. in 7, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, Enterobacter spp. in 2 and Haemophilus parainfluenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae in one patient each. All isolates were sensitive to cefotaxime, with MIC's for 26 strains ranging from 0.01 to 0.50 mg/l. One hundred and fifty-six of the 160 patients were treated with cefotaxime alone and the four others with cefotaxime in association with an aminoglycoside in three and rifampicin in one. Cefotaxime was administered by intravenous infusion, in a daily dose 100 to 300 mg/kg. Duration of treatment ranged from 8 days to 6 weeks, with a mean of 15 days. One hundred and forty-nine patients (93.1%) were cured, two after a relapse. Three patients had sequelae. Most (88.5%) had sterile CSF within 72 h after starting treatment. Eleven patients (6.9%) died, eight within the first 48 h. The only side-effects observed were mild transient eosinophilia in some patients and rash and leukopenia in 2 each. The study demonstrates that cefotaxime is effective in the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis.
TI  - The use of beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of septicaemia and endocarditis.
AB  - Despite the availability of numerous beta-lactam antibiotics, benzylpenicillin remains the most important beta-lactam antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis. Penicillin alone and in combination with an aminoglycoside is effective in the treatment of endocarditis due to all streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus aprophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Listeria monocytogenes. Oral phenoxymethylpenicillin in combination with streptomycin is effective in treating endocarditis due to viridans streptococci. Ampicillin is effective in endocarditis due to Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, H. paraphrophilus, Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli. Oral amoxicillin with gentamicin has been used to treat enterococcal endocarditis. The penicillinase-resistant penicillins are effective in treating S. aureus endocarditis. Carbenicillin or ticarcillin in combination with tobramycin or gentamicin are used to treat endocarditis due to Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The use of piperacillin in combination with tobramycin against P. aeruginosa endocarditis has been associated with failure and increased resistance. The cephalosporins have been used to treat endocarditis caused by susceptible organisms. There have been few data on the efficacy of the newer cephalosporins in treating endocarditis. They have been used to treat septicaemia due to susceptible organisms with good results.
TI  - IgA1 proteases of Haemophilus influenzae: cloning and characterization in Escherichia coli K-12.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae is one of several bacterial pathogens known to release IgA1 proteases into the extracellular environment. Each H. influenzae isolate produces one of at least three distinct types of these enzymes that differ in the specific peptide bond they cleave in the hinge region of human IgA1. We have isolated the gene specifying type 1 IgA1 protease from a total genomic library of H. influenzae, subcloned it into plasmid vectors, and introduced these vectors into Escherichia coli K-12. The enzyme synthesized by E. coli was active and had the same specificity as that of the H. influenzae donor. Unlike that of the donor, E. coli protease activity accumulated in the periplasm rather than being transported extracellularly. The position of the protease gene in H. influenzae DNA and its direction of transcription was approximated by deletion mapping. Tn5 insertions, and examination of the polypeptides synthesized by minicells. A 1-kilobase probe excised from the IgA1 protease gene hybridized with DNA restriction fragments of all H. influenzae serogroups but not with DNA of a nonpathogenic H. parainfluenzae species known to be IgA1 protease negative.
TI  - Molecular nature of a plasmid specifying beta-lactamase production in Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - We characterized pJB1, the plasmid previously reported to mediate beta-lactamase  production in Haemophilus ducreyi. We studied its relationship to pMR0360 and RSF0885, the plasmids responsible for beta-lactamase production in Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae, respectively. Although pJB1 was maintained as a multicopy pool in Escherichia coli, it was not stably maintained in the absence of antibiotic selection. Electron microscope heteroduplex studies showed that it carried 100% of the transposable ampicillin resistance sequence TnA. This sequence was transposed to plasmid pUB307 at a low rate. Heteroduplexes between pMR0360 and pJB1 showed that they contained 3.3 megadaltons of homologous sequences. Two sets of nonhomologous sequences, one a TnA sequence and the other a non-TnA sequence, took the form of insertion loops. For plasmids pMR0360 and RSF0885, previously shown to be highly related, the nonhomologous sequences took the form of a substitution loop. We concluded that all three plasmids shared major portions of their sequences but differed in discrete segments. pJB1 was the first such plasmid to have a physically and functionally intact TnA sequence.
TI  - Penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the Netherlands: epidemiology and genetic and molecular characterization of their plasmids.
AB  - Penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains were isolated in the Netherlands with increasing frequency during the period of 1976 to 1979. About 3% of the gonococci isolated in the first half of 1979 produced penicillinase. In contrast to the period of 1976 to 1977, most penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae infections during the period of 1978 to 1979 were contracted in the Netherlands. The results of genetic and molecular studies on 80 penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae strains were similar to earlier observations of others: resistance plasmids of only two sizes, 4.5 and 3.3 megadaltons (Md), occurred in penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae strains, and these encoded for the TEM-1 enzyme. The 4.5-Md plasmid could be transferred to Escherichia coli when it coexisted with a plasmid of 24 Md. The latter plasmid was present in the vast majority of the strains carrying the 4.5-Md plasmid. One strain carried a cryptic 7.5-Md plasmid in addition to the commonly found 2.5-Md plasmid. Two penicillinase-producing strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae isolated were found to carry a 3.3-Md plasmid species which was indistinguishable from the 3.3-Md gonococcal resistance plasmids. No plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid was found in two strains of penicillinase-producing Branhamella catarrhalis, and these strains produced a penicillinase different from the TEM-1 enzyme.
TI  - An eleven-base-pair sequence determines the specificity of DNA uptake in Haemophilus transformation.
AB  - Only certain DNA fragments are taken up efficiently by component Haemophilus cells; this implies that efficient uptake requires the presence of a specific nucleotide sequence on the incoming DNA (Sisco and Smith, 1979). To determine the structure of this "uptake site", we have isolated and sequenced four small fragments of cloned H. parainfluenzae DNA which retain the ability to be taken up by cells. These fragments have a sequence of eleven base pairs in common, 5'-AAGTGCGGTCA-3' and ethylation of certain phosphoryl groups in this sequence causes significant decreases in fragment uptake. We conclude that this is the sequence of the uptake site.
TI  - Evaluation of the four-hour Micro-ID technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative, Gram-negative rods from blood cultures.
AB  - A 4-h Micro-ID technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative gram-negative rods from positive blood cultures was compared to subculture and species identification of single colonies by API 20E and Micro-ID, using standardized inocula. A total of 127 patients (220 positive cultures) were studied. Isolates included 96 Escherichia coli, 46 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 Klebsiella oxytoca, 8 Enterobacter aerogenes, 17 Enterobacter cloacae, 19 Serratia marcescens, 2 Serratia liquefaciens, 8 Proteus mirabilis, 1 Salmonella species, 1 Morganella morganii, 6 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 Bacteroides fragilis, 3 Acinetobacter calcoaceticus biotype anitratus, and 1 Pseudomonas maltophilia. In 90% of the cultures, identification by Micro-ID was identical to that obtained after subculture; if the 15 non-enterobacterial isolates were excluded, the corresponding figure was 96.6%. Enterobacteria identified incorrectly by direct Micro-ID were three S. marcescens (two identified as S. liquefaciens, one as Hafnia alvei), two S. liquefaciens (both identified as E. cloacae), and two K. pneumoniae (one identified as Klebsiella ozaenae, the other as Serratia rubidaea). None of the 15 non-enterobacterial cultures were correctly identified by Micro-ID (non-identifiable, or classified as Providencia/Yersinia/Klebsiella species). Although biochemical discrepancies between direct and final Micro-ID tests occurred in 41% of the enterobacterial cultures, this did not seriously interfere with identification. Direct species identification of Enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures by direct Micro-ID is accurate and easily performed and identified organisms within 4 h compared to at least 24 h by most other methods; the direct Micro-ID technique would be rendered even more valuable by the additional capability of identifying non-enterobacterial gram-negative isolates.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies of cefoperazone in children (author's transl)].
AB  - As a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (CPZ), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) When tested against 10 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of CPZ was found to be weaker than that of CEZ. Against 5 strains of A-beta-Streptococcus and 4 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, both CPZ and CEZ exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. CPZ was effective against 18 strains of Escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. Against 15 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of Haemophilus parahaemolyticus, CPZ was found to be more effective than CEZ though several high-resistant strains were noted. CPZ also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than CEZ against 4 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 5 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of Salmonella sp., 4 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of Proteus sp. (2) The mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of CPZ to three children was 70 minutes. (3) One hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of CPZ to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. In one case, the CSF/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) The average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) Eighteen pediatric patients received CPZ in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. They were RTI in 7, URI in 5, UTI in 5, SSSS in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. The clinical effectiveness of CPZ was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. One patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. The three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) Side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of GOT and GPT, and 1 case of mild elevation of GOT. All were considered to be minor.
TI  - Characterization of plasmids from Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Haemophilus haemolyticus.
AB  
TI  - Sequence-specific DNA uptake in Haemophilus transformation.
AB  - Haemophilus cells efficiently take up Haemophilus DNA from the medium during transformation but do not take up other DNAs. To study the mechanism of this specificity we have cloned an 8.1-kilobase (kb) fragment of H. parainfluenzae DNA in the escherichia coli--pBR322 host--vector system and reisolated the DNA fragment for use as a defined probe. The 5'32P end-labeled 8.1-kb DNA is efficiently absorbed by competent Haemophilus cells whereas vector DNA present in the mixture is not, implying that the 8.1-kb DNA contains sequence-specific recognition sites that are needed for DNA uptake. Absorbed DNA can be recovered from cells as a 32P-labeled duplex of unaltered size for several minutes after uptake. We have determined the number and location of uptake sites in the 8.1-kb DNA by constructing a restriction endonuclease cleavage map and assaying fragments for uptake. Only two small fragments retain the ability to be absorbed. These fragments, 120 and 140 base pairs long, are 3.8 kb apart on the 8.1-kb fragment. We assume that each of these fragments contains a short common sequence, perhaps 8--12 base pairs long, that is the actual recognition site. We have shown by DNA competition assays, with the 8.1-kb DNA as a standard, that about 600 copies of the uptake sites are present in the Haemophilus genome.
TI  - [Ampicillin-resistant "Haemophilus": their detection and occurrence in Brussels area (author's transl)].
AB  - Three hundred and five strains of Haemophilus (129 H. influenzae, 55 H. parainfluenzae, 97 H. parahaemolyticus, 5 H. haemolyticus, 10 H. paraphrophilus and 9 H. paraphrohaemolyticus) isolated from pathological material over the year 1976, were systematically tested for beta-lactamase production. Only 2 strains of H. parainfluenzae produced this enzyme. Both were able to transfer ampicillin resistance to Escherichia coli K12. All strains but the two beta-lactamase producers were susceptible to penicillin G, ampicillin and cephalotin. However, the correct interpretation of the susceptibility tests needed the microscopic observation of prints of the inhibition zones surrounding the disks: all sensitive strains presented a hazy growth around the disks which corresponded to the presence of spheroplasts; this phenomenon was not observed with the 2 beta-lactamase producing strains of H. parainfluenzae which grew up to the disks but presented a typical bacillary form.
TI  - Mechanism of transferable resistance to chloramphenicol in Haemophilus parainfluenzae.
AB  - A clinical isolate of Haemophilus parainfluenzae resistant to chloramphenicol and tetracycline transferred both cam and tet determinants to Escherichia coli K-12 during mixed cultivation on solid media irrespective of the selection employed. The doubly resistant transconjugant was found to contain levels of the enzyme chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) comparable to those found in R plasmid-bearing chloramphenicol-resistant enteric bacteria. Purification of CAT from the transconjugant was achieved by affinity chromatography, and the electrophoretically homogeneous protein was compared with previously characterized CAT variants specified by R plasmids. Although the CAT associated with cam from H. parainfluenzae was found to be distinct from the three types described previously, its N-terminal peptide amino acid sequence was identical with that determined for a type II CAT. Attempts to demonstrate covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid in the H. parainfluenzae donor and the E. coli transconjugant were unsuccessful. The cam and tet determinants were nontransmissible from E. coli but could be cotransferred following the introduction of a suitable conjugative plasmid.
TI  - [Drug sensitivity of Haemophilus sp. and transfer of resistance into E. coli (author's transl)].
AB  - From June 1973 to July 1976, 742 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and parainfluenzae, isolated from clinical specimens, were routinely tested for in vitro sensitivity to twelve antibiotics: penicillin, ampicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, tetracyclin, minocyclin, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazol, trimethoprim. 61 strains were found resistant to one or more of these antibiotics (ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol and tetracyclin). The MICs of 23 antibiotics were determined by the agar dilution method on most of the resistant strains and on 60 sensitive strains isolated during the same period and considered as control. 21 strains transferred their resistance determinants into E. coli K12; 23 plasmids were obtained isolated from these strains: 2 strains contained two different plasmids. 90% of the transconjugants were stable after repeated subcultures.
TI  - Bactericidal factor produced by Haemophilus influenzae b: partial purification of the factor and transfer of its genetic determinant.
AB  - When aerobically grown on complex media, Haemophilus influenzae b and unencapsulated variants, Rb strains, produced a bactericidal factor that was active against other Haemophilus species and certain genera of the Enterobacteriaceae. A total of 341 clinical isolates of Haemophilus were tested for susceptibility to the factor. Ninety-three percent of H. influenzae (nontypable), 75% of H. haemolyticus, 71% of H. parainfluenzae, and 22% of H. parahaemolyticus were susceptible. H. influenaze b strains were resistant producers of the bactericidal factor and H. influenzae f strains were susceptible nonproducers. Only one strain each of H. aegyptius and H. aphrophilus was isolated and each was susceptible and resistant, respectively. 143 clinical isolates of the Enterobacteriaceae were tested and of those 82% of Escherichia coli, 85% of Salmonella sp., and all Citrobacter sp., Shigella sp., and Yersinia sp. were sensitive to the bactericidal factor produced by H. influenzae b. Attempts to isolate the bactericidal activity from mechanically disrupted, solubilized, or osmotically shocked cells failed to release active bactericidal factor. However, we partially purified the bactericidal factor from the spent culture medium of aerobically grown H. influenzae b by a series of extractions. The ability to produce the bactericidal factor was transferable to nonproducer strains without also genetically transforming for type b encapsulation. The converse was also true in that type b capsules were produced by transformed H. influenzae Rd strains but no bactericidal factor was detected from these strains. Additionally, nitrosoguanidine-induced mutants of H. influenzae b lost the ability to produce bactericidal factor without loss of their type-specific capsule, demonstrating that production of the bactericidal factor was genetically separable from production of the type capsule of H. influenzae b.
TI  - Interaction of RNA polymerase with promoters from bacteriophage fd.
AB  - Replicative form DNA of bacteriophage fd, which had been fragmented with the restriction endonuclease II from Hemophilus parainfluenzae (endo R- HpaII), was reacted with Escherichia coli RNA polymerase; the resulting stable preinitiation complexes were analysed using the filter binding assay followed by gel electrophoresis. At 120mM KCL the first-order rate constants for complex decay were determined to be 10(-2)-10(-6)s-1. The second-order rate constants for complex formation were found to be about 10(6) -10(7) M-1 s-1. From these values association constants for the individual promoters were calculated to be 2 x 10(-8) -2 x 10(-11) M-1. The rate of formation and the stability of promoter complexes was enhanced in superhelical DNA. No evidence was found for stable promoter-specific closed complexes consisting of enzyme and helical DNA. This and the kinetic data suggest that the unwinding of base pairs is already important early in promoter selection, and not only for the formation of the final open complex. The initiation of RNA synthesis form the preinitiation complex was faster than complex dissociation and complex formation for all promoters. Consequently, the initiation efficiency of a promoter is determined by the rate of complex formation, and not by its 'affinity' for the enzyme. No correlation was found between the relative order of the fd promoters for the binding and the dissociation reaction. This is explained by different structural determinants, for the two reactions, which are located in different parts of the promoter DNA.
TI  - Transfer of a plasmid-specified beta-lactamase gene from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - A number of ampicillin-resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae could donate a gene specifying the type IIIa (TEM) beta-lactamase to Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Donor strains rapidly lost their ability to transfer ampicillin resistance on storage or subculture. Such strains also apparently contained a single species of covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid of contour length 1.2 mum, equivalent to about 2.5 x 10(6) daltons. No species of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid large enough to encode sex factor activity was detected. Despite this, transfer occurred to several bacterial genera in the presence of deoxyribonuclease, suggesting that transmissibility was by conjugation. The beta-lactamase gene was generally unstable after transfer and was lost in the absence of selection. Where stable transcipients were found, this was evidently by insertion of the beta-lactamase gene into the host chromosome. In P. aeruginosa insertion was always accompanied by induction of auxotrophy for adenine, suggesting insertion at a specific site. It is believed that insertion also occurred at one site on the chromosome of Escherichia coli. Crypticity measurements for beta-lactamase activity showed that there was little or no penetration barrier to beta-lactam drugs in Haemophilus. This may explain the long delay in the acquisition of ampicillin resistance by this organism.
TI  - Proposed structure of two defective viral DNA oligomers produced in 3T3 cells transformed by the ts-a mutant of polyoma virus.
AB  - The various oligomeric viral DNA species produced at 32 C by two related syblines of ts-a-transformed mouse 3T3 cells were characterized. Results from the analysis of the cleavage products observed after digestion with restriction endonucleases from Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Escherichia coli RI, and Haemophilus suis are consistent with the assumption that in both sublines, the major oligomeric component is a dimer from which a segment of different length is deleted. The major oligomeric (27S) component in subline 1 was estimated to be 1.77 times the size of the viral monomer, and the major (25.5S) component in subline 15 was estimated to be 1.54 times the size of the viral monomer. These size estimates were confirmed by electron micrograph measurements. The larger oligomers produced by both sublines were found to be multiples of the major oligomeric component of each subline.
TI  - [Gentamicin-susceptibility of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials].
AB  - We studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing with other antibiotics. Beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. Staph, aureus and Staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin, and no resistant strain to this drug was found. Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Serratia and five species of Proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. A few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in E. coli, Citrobacerr, Serratia, Pr. morganii and Pr. rettgeri. Pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of Proteus. Antibacterial activity of gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. Gentamicin-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.
TI  - Human papillomavirus DNA: physical map.
AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA form I (supercoiled) was prepared from plantar warts. HPV DNA was cleaved with restriction enzymes obtained from the following sources: escherichia coli (EcoRI), Hemophilus influenzae strain Rd (both unfractionated Hind and aeparated HindII and HindIII enzymes) and Hemophilus parainfluenzae (HpaI). The cleavage products were analyzed by polyacrylamide gradient slab gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. HPV DNA was cleaved into two fragments by EcoRI (87% and 13% of the genome) and into six fragments, ranging in size from 33.5 to 1.2% of the genome, by Hind endonucleases. The six Hind fragments result from the cleavage of three sequences recognized by HindII, two of which are also cleaved by HpaI, and of three sequence recognized by HindIII. The order of these fragments was determined by comparing their size with that of the fragments obtained with HindII, HindIII, HpaI, and the mixture of HindIII + Hpal. The two EcoRI cleavage sites were located on two adjacent Hind fragments and one of these sites has been taken for the zero point to construct a physical map. The treatment of superhelical HPV DNA with bacteriophage T4 gene 32 protein yields circular structures with a denaturation loop. The cleavage of these complexes with EcoRI and HindIII has shown two easily denatured regions which were located on the cleavage map.
TI  - Mapping of cleavage sites for restriction endonucleases in lambdadv plasmids.
AB  - Restriction nucleases from Escherichia coli carrying the resistance transfer factor RI, from Hemophilus influenzae, Hemophilus parainfluenzae, and Bacillus subtilis were used for the generation of specific DNA fragments from lambdadv plasmids. Cleavage maps were established for various plasmids containing different but overlapping parts of bacteriophage lambdaDNA by analysis of digestion patterns obtained in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The correlation between the plasmid cleavage maps and the genetic map of lambda was based upon the location of the EcoRI cleavage site at 81.3% of lambda fractional length and the position of promoters PL and PR on the plasmid DNA fragments.
TI  - Adenovirus transcription. II. RNA sequences complementary to simian virus 40 and  adenovirus 2DNA in AD2+ND1- and AD2+ND3-infected cells.
AB  - The genomes of the two nondefective adenovirus 2/simian virus 40 (Ad2/SV 40) hybrid viruses, nondefective Ad2/SV 40 hybrid virus 1 (Ad2+ND1) and nondefective hybrid virus 3 (Ad2+ND3), WERE FORMED BY A DELETION OF ABOUT 5% OF Ad2 DNA and insertion of part of the SV40 genome. We have compared the cytoplasmic RNA synthesized during both the early and late stages of lytic infection of human cells by these hybrid viruses to that expressed in Ad2-infected and SV40-infected cells. Separated strands of the six fragments of 32P-labeled Ad2 DNA produced by cleavage with the restriction endonuclease EcoRI (isolated from Escherichia coli) and the four fragments of 32P-labeled SV40 DNA produced by cleavage with both a restriction nuclease isolated from Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Hpa1, and EcoRI were prepared by electrophoresis of denatured DNA in agarose gels. The fraction of each fragment strand expressed as cytoplasmic RNA was determined by annealing fragmented 32P-labeled strands to an excess of cellular RNA extracted from infected cells. The segment of Ad2 DNA deleted from both hybrid virus genomes is transcribed into cytoplasmic mRNA during the early phase of Ad2 infection. Hence, we suggest that Ad2 codes for at least one "early" gene product which is nonessential for virus growth in cell culture. In both early Ad2+ND1 and Ad2+ND3-infected cells, 1,000 bases of Ad2 DNA adjacent to the integrated SV40 sequences are expressed as cytoplasmic RNA but are not similarly expressed in early Ad2-infected cells. The 3' termini of this early hybrid virus RNA maps in the vicinity of 0.18 on the conventional SV40 map and probably terminates at the same position as early lytic SV40 cytoplasmic RNA. Therefore, the base sequence in this region of SV40 DNA specifies the 3' termini of early messenger RNA present in both hybrid virus and SV40-infected cells.
TI  - R-factor mediated beta-lactamase production by Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Production of beta-lactamase by 15 strains of Haemophilus influenzae has been investigated. All the strains produce a constitutive beta-lactamase, which readily hydrolyses penicillin G, ampicillin, and cephaloridine. The beta-lactamase produced by these strains is indistinguishable from the type-IIIa enzyme commonly found in strains of Escherichia coli. The beta-lactamase gene has been transferred from the enzyme-producing strains of Haemophilus to strains of H. parainfluenzae and a strain of E. coli.
TI  - A new method for isolation of a restriction enzyme from Hemophilus parainfluenzae.
AB  
TI  - Specificity in deoxyribonucleic acid uptake by transformable Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Cells of Haemophilus influenzae strain Rd competent for genetic transformation irreversibly bound approximately five molecular fragments of H. influenzae deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) per cell; under identical conditions, DNA derived from Escherichia coli B was not taken up (<1 molecule per 50 cells). Similarly, DNA from Xenopus laevis was not taken up by competent H. influenzae. Of the heterologous DNAs tested, only DNA from H. parainfluenzae interfered with the uptake of H. influenzae DNA, as judged by competition experiments employing either DNA binding or genetic transformation as the test system. The extracellular heterologous DNA did not suffer either single- or double-strand breakage upon exposure to competent H. influenzae.
TI  - Polyoma DNA: a physical map.
AB  - The action of restriction enzymes on polyoma DNA was studied with uniformly (32)P-labeled viral DNA obtained from either infected 3T6 or secondary mouse-embryo cells. Three restriction enzymes were used to construct a physical map of the polyoma genome. An enzyme from Hemophilus parainfluenzae, Hpa(II), cleaved polyma DNA into eight unique fragments (Hpa(II)-1 to Hpa(II)-8), ranging in size from 27.3 to 1.8% of the genome. An enzyme from Hemophilus influenzae, Hin(III), gave two fragments (56 and 44%); and a third enzyme from Escherichia coli, EcoR(I), cut at a single unique site. The physical map of the polyma genome was constructed from methods involving: (1) further digestion of the fragments produced by enzymes EcoR(I) and Hin(III) with Hpa(II), and (2) analysis of the products of partial digestion with Hpa(II). Analysis by electron microscopy of replicating DNA molecules (less than 50% replicated) cut with the Hin(III) enzyme, in combination with other studies, has indicated that the origin of DNA replication is located at 71 +/- 3 map units from the EcoR(I) cleavage site, probably in Hpa(II)-5.
TI  - Comparison of JC and BK human papovaviruses with simian virus 40: restriction endonuclease digestion and gel electrophoresis of resultant fragments.
AB  - JC virus was found to have a buoyant density of 1.20 g/cm(3) in linear sucrose-D(2)O and 1.35 g/cm(3) in cesium chloride isopycnic gradients. DNA extracted either from JC-infected cultures or from gradient-purified virions occupied a dense position relative to linear DNA in cesium chloride/ethidium bromide gradients, and the circular configuration of the extracted DNA was confirmed by electron microscopy, with a measured molecular weight of 2.93 x 10(6). DNA from BK virus was similarly prepared and compared to JC and to an SV40 DNA standard by digestion with restriction endonuclease preparations from Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Escherichia coli. Digests were electrophoretically analyzed on gradient polyacrylamide slab gels or agarose gels, and the three viruses were found to have distinctly different cleavage patterns by this form of analysis: JC and BK viruses were almost entirely different from SV40 and significantly different from each other. Thus, JC and BK human papovaviruses appear to be discrete new members of the papovavirus group, rather than SV40 variants.
TI  - Method for isolating mutants overproducing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and  its precursors.
AB  - A procedure has been developed for isolating mutants which are defective with respect to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) metabolism. It is based on the well known V-factor requirement of Haemophilus parainfluenzae. This procedure was used to isolate a series of mutants from Escherichia coli. The pyridine metabolism of wild-type and mutant E. coli cells falls in one of four distinct classes. Class A includes wild-type E. coli and represents strains that are normal with respect to pyridine metabolism. Class B mutants have altered internal pools of NAD. The intracellular NAD concentration of different class B mutants varies over a 10-fold range. Class C mutants excrete pyridine mononucleotides, and class D mutants excrete NAD. The production of pyridine nucleotides by class C and D mutants exceeds that of wild-type E. coli by a factor of at least ten. The mutant strains generally have normal generation times and achieve normal cell densities in minimal medium.
TI  - Cardiolipin-specific phospholipase D of Haemophilus parainfluenzae. II. Characteristics and possible significance.
AB  - A phospholipase specific for cardiolipin (CL) was found in the membrane of Haemophilus parainfluenzae. The enzyme hydrolyzed CL to phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG), indicating that it was a phospholipase D (an enzyme activity believed to be confined to higher plants). In addition to its substrate specificity, this enzyme was unusual in its requirement for Mg(2+) (K(m) of 1.3 mm) for maximal activity and its inhibition by chelating agents, heavy metals, some detergents, and organic solvents. When inhibitors of phospholipase activity were added to the growth medium, CL accumulated and PG disappeared in the membrane, suggesting that the phospholipase D was active in vivo. The activity of phospholipase D in cell-free homogenates was greater than expected from earlier studies of CL metabolism and greater than the other phospholipase activities detected in the homogenate. The high activity of the CL-specific phospholipase D suggests there might be a very active degradation of CL to PG and PA and an active resynthesis of CL from the hydrolysis products.
TI  - Cardiolipin-specific phospholipase D activity in Haemophilus parainfluenzae.
AB  - A highly active phospholipase D that is specific for cardiolipin was detected in  the gram-negative bacterium Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Previously reported phospholipase D preparations have come exclusively from higher plants. The bacterial enzyme hydrolyzed cardiolipin to phosphatidyl glycerol and phosphatidic acid. During the incubation, phosphatidic acid disappeared. Phosphatidyl ethanolamine, methylated phosphatidyl ethanolamines, phosphatidyl choline, and phosphatidyl glycerol were not hydrolyzed when cardiolipin was rapidly hydrolyzed.
TI  - Genetic integration in the heterospecific transformation of Haemophilus influenzae cells by Haemophilus parainfluenzae deoxyribonucleic acid.
AB  - The in vivo chemical linkage of Haemophilus parainfluenzae deoxyribonucleic acid  (DNA) with the H. influenzae genome has been found to occur at a much higher level than is suggested by the low efficiency of the heterospecific transformation of an antibiotic resistance marker. This linkage, about 60% of the level with homospecific DNA, was found to involve alkali-stable bonding. The amount of host DNA label released (about 60%) was about the same as that released during homospecific transformation. Also, over 60% of the H. influenzae cells adsorbing H. parainfluenzae DNA could not form colonies upon plating. This lethality of the heterospecific transformation was not immediate but followed considerable metabolic activity of the host cells. These data are presented to show that the "limited-pairing" hypothesis may be only a partial explanation for the low efficiency of heterospecific transformation. Another hypothesis is presented which takes into account the lethal effect of this kind of transformation.
