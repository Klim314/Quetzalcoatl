technological and probiotic potential of bgra43 a natural isolate of lactobacillus helveticus.
lactobacillus helveticus bgra43 is a human intestinal isolate showing antimicrobial activity, amongst others, against yersinia enterocolitica, shigella sonnei, shigella flexneri, and streptococcus pneumoniae. bgra43 produces prth proteinase with proteolytic activity on both casein and beta-lactoglobulin (blg). bgra43 is able to reduce the allergenicity of blg. bioactive peptides released in bgra43 fermented milk are potent modulators of innate immunity by modulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines il-6 and tnf-alpha. bgra43 is able to survive in simulated gastric and intestinal conditions. the growth of bgra43 in milk results in a fast acidification lowering the milk ph to 4.53 generating mild, homogeneous, and viscous yogurt-like product. the strain bgra43 grows suitably in pure cow or goat's milk as well as in milk containing inulin or nutrim even when they are used as the sole carbon source. it is suggested that strain bgra43 could be used as a single-strain culture for the preparation of yogurt-like products from bovine or caprine milk. overall, l. helveticus bgra43 could be considered as a potential probiotic candidate with appropriate technological properties attractive for the dairy industry.
effects of fermentation by lactic acid bacteria on the antigenicity of bovine whey proteins.
background: the main whey proteins alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-la) and beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lg) are considered as the major allergens in cow's milk. microbial fermentation can produce some proteolytic enzymes, which can induce the degradation of milk protein allergens. in this study, the effects of fermentation by lactic acid bacteria on the antigenicity of alpha-la and beta-lg were investigated using indirect competitive elisa. meanwhile, the proteolysis of milk proteins was detected by tnbs assay and sds-page electrophoresis. results: fermentation by lactic acid bacteria could significantly reduce the antigenicity of alpha-la and beta-lg in skim milk. combined strains of lactobacillus helveticus and streptococcus thermophilus were the most effective in reducing the antigenicity of both whey proteins. in addition, alpha-la and beta-lg antigenicity decreased to a lower value at 6 h of fermentation and at 0.5 d of cold storage by fermentation with the combined strains. the results of tnbs assay and sds-page electrophoresis showed that lactic acid bacteria strains used in this study hydrolysed whey proteins only to a limited extent. conclusion: the fermentation with lactic acid bacteria is an effective way to reduce whey proteins antigenicity.
characterization of bacteriocins produced by strains from traditional bulgarian dairy products.
a result of extensive screening of over 300 strains from the collection of elby bulgaricum, plc, thirty six strains were selected as producers of bacteriocins, active closely related lactic acid bacterial species and some food spoilage bacteria. the selected strains belong to l. helveticus, l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus, which are rare bacteriocin producers. nineteen nonidentified producers were characterized by molecular taxonomic approaches--m13 fingerprinting, repetitive pcr, ribotyping and hybridization with species-specific probes, which allowed to affiliate them to the species l. delbrueckii. several strains were found to harbour plasmids of different size. the estimated activity against food borne pathogens makes the isolated substances perspective as safe food preservatives and the producing strains could be used as components of starters with improved quality.
preliminary characterization of microflora of comte cheese.
the evolution of the microflora of three comte cheeses made in duplicate with raw milk from three different sources was followed during ripening. the same starter was used with each type of milk. the comparison of the cheeses did not reveal any significant difference in the development of the microflora. starter lactic acid bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus), which are added at the beginning of manufacture, decreased quickly in the first stages of ripening supporting the hypothesis of cell autolysis. other microorganisms, i.e. homofermentative and heterofermentative lactobacilli (lact. delbrueckii ssp. lactis, lact. paracasei ssp. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. fermentum), pediococci, enterococci and propionibacteria grew in cheese from small numbers in fresh curd. the characterization of strep. thermophilus by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that wild strains were also able to grow in the curd. the values for the genome size of 11 strep. thermophilus strains determined in this investigation were in the range of 1.8-2.3 mbp. the potential role of starter and raw milk microflora in cheese flavour development was considered.
inhibition of clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. four strains were isolated belonging to the species lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. the sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from nisin. their resistance to phospholipase d indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. the inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains of clostridium tyrobutyricum, lactobacillus helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.
conjugal transfer of plasmid-encoded determinants for bacteriocin production and  immunity in lactobacillus acidophilus 88.
lactobacillus acidophilus 88 produced a bacteriocin, designated lactacin f, that  demonstrated inhibitory activity toward l. acidophilus 6032, l. lactis 970, l. helveticus 87, l. bulgaricus 1489, l. leichmanii 4797, l. fermentum 1750, and streptococcus faecalis 19433. production of lactacin f was ph dependent and could be maximized in mrs broth cultures maintained at ph 7.0. lactacin f was heat stable and sensitive to ficin, proteinase k, trypsin, and bacillus subtilis protease. l. acidophilus 88 harbored plasmids of 4 and 27 megadaltons. variants of l. acidophilus 88 which were deficient in lactacin f production (laf) and lactacin f immunity (laf) retained the two resident plasmids. a laf laf derivative, l. acidophilus 89, was used as a recipient in agar surface mating experiments with l. acidophilus 88 (laf laf). two types of laf laf transconjugants were recovered. one type (t-e) had acquired two plasmids of 68 (ppm68) and 52 (ppm52) megadaltons that were not detected in either the conjugal donor or the other type of laf laf transconjugants (t-89). laf and laf were unstable in the plasmid-bearing transconjugant. plasmid analysis of laf laf variants revealed that ppm52 and ppm68 were cured with loss of laf and laf. bacteriocin production and immunity phenotypes were genetically stable in laf laf transconjugants not harboring ppm52 and ppm68, suggesting chromosomal integration of the transferred determinants. the data demonstrated intragenic conjugation in l. acidophilus and provided direct evidence for involvement of transient plasmid determinants in laf and laf.
