TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == polymicrobial endocarditis in intravenous heroin and fentanyl abuse.
AB  == infective endocarditis is a life threatening condition with a high mortality rate. intravenous drug abusers (ivda) are more likely to acquire endocarditis. most of the cases of infective endocarditis are caused by a single pathogen; cases of polymicrobial endocarditis are rare and they are associated with a reported mortality rate of more than 30%. only 21 cases of n. sicca endocarditis  have been described in the literature since 1918, and only 15 reported cases of endocarditis which involved actinomyces species have been reported since 1939. we are reporting a case of a 49-year-old male with intravenous heroin and fentanyl abuse, who presented with infective endocarditis caused by neisseria sicca/subflava(n. sicca), actinomyces, streptococcus mitis, and haemophilus parainfluenzae, complicated by septic emboli to the lungs and skin, ards , splenic infarct and immunocomplex mediated proliferative glomerulonephritis.

TI  == chitosan-thioglycolic acid as a versatile antimicrobial agent.
AB  == as functionalized chitosans hold great potential for the development of effective and broad-spectrum antibiotics, representative chitosan derivatives were tested for antimicrobial activity in neutral media: trimethyl chitosan (tmc), carboxy-methyl chitosan (cmc), and chitosan-thioglycolic acid (tga; medium molecular weight: mmw-tga; low molecular weight: lmw-tga). colony forming assays  indicated that lmw-tga displayed superior antimicrobial activity over the other derivatives tested: a 30 min incubation killed 100% streptococcus sobrinus (gram-positive bacteria) and reduced colony counts by 99.99% in neisseria subflava (gram-negative bacteria) and 99.97% in candida albicans (fungi). to elucidate lmw-tga effects at the cellular level, microscopic studies were performed. use of fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc)-labeled chitosan derivates in confocal microscopy showed that lmw-tga attaches to microbial cell walls, while transmission electron microscopy indicated that this derivative severely affects  cell wall integrity and intracellular ultrastructure in all species tested. we therefore propose lmw-tga as a promising and effective broad-band antimicrobial compound.

TI  == multiparameter assessments to determine the effects of sugars and antimicrobials  on a polymicrobial oral biofilm.
AB  == clinical studies indicate relationships between dental plaque, a naturally formed biofilm, and oral diseases. the crucial role of nonmicrobial biofilm constituents in maintaining biofilm structure and biofilm-specific attributes, such as resistance to shear and viscoelasticity, is increasingly recognized. concurrent analyses of the diverse nonmicrobial biofilm components for multiparameter assessments formed the focus of this investigation. comparable numbers of actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, neisseria subflava, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans cells were seeded into multiple wells of 96-well polystyrene plates for biofilm formation. quantitative  fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) examined the influences of dietary sugars, incubation conditions, ingredients in oral hygiene  formulations, and antibiotics on biofilm components. biofilm extracellular polymeric substances (eps) were examined with an optimized mixture of fluorescent lectins, with biofilm proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids detected with specific  fluorescent stains. anaerobic incubation of biofilms resulted in significantly more biofilm eps and extractable carbohydrates than those formed under aerobic conditions (p < 0.05). sucrose significantly enhanced biofilm eps in comparison to fructose, galactose, glucose, and lactose (p < 0.05). clsm demonstrated thicker biofilms under sucrose-replete conditions, along with significant increases in biofilm eps, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, than under conditions of sucrose deficiency (p < 0.05). agents in oral hygiene formulations  (chlorhexidine, ethanol, and sodium lauryl sulfate), a mucolytic agent (n-acetyl-l-cysteine), and antibiotics with different modes of action (amoxicillin, doxycycline, erythromycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin) inhibited biofilm components (p < 0.05). multiparameter analysis indicated a dose-dependent inhibition of biofilm eps and protein by chlorhexidine and sodium lauryl sulfate, along with distinctive inhibitory patterns for subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics. collectively, these results highlight multiparameter assessments as  a broad platform for simultaneous assessment of diverse biofilm components.

TI  == vasculitic purpura with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-positive acute renal  failure in a patient with streptococcus bovis case and neisseria subflava bacteremia and subacute endocarditis.
AB  == subacute bacterial endocarditis is frequently associated with extracardiac manifestations and renal failure. clinical variety of endocarditis manifestation  is wide and has the potential to mimic vasculitis. whereas streptococcus bovis is often isolated and associated with colonic tumors, neisseriaceae are rarely found. an association of subacute bacterial endocarditis and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies has been described. we report on a 62-year-old man who was admitted to our hospital with acute oliguric renal failure and a nonpruritic purpural rush without fever. antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody diagnostic revealed perinuclear staining with a titre of 1 : 512 and antiproteinase-3 specificity. immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis without extracapillary proliferation was diagnosed in renal biopsy. finally, blood cultures became positive for streptococcus bovis and neisseria flava. echocardiography showed mobile vegetations on tricuspid valve. under treatment with penicillin g and gentamicin, skin efflorescences and renal function recovered, but vegetations increased. a colonic tumor could be excluded, a disastrous dental status may have been a predisposal factor. when classical findings of subacute bacterial endocarditis are less clear, the presence of renal failure and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in absence of fever may lead to misdiagnosis and deleterious immunosuppressive therapy. neisseria subflava, an upper respiratory tract commensal, may cause subacute bacterial endocarditis without typical symptoms.

TI  == selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. methods: a gradient plate technique was used to expose fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, neisseria subflava, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii,  prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations  of triclosan. escherichia coli atcc 8739 was included as an organism showing the  triclosan resistance development trait. mic values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. results: n. subflava, pr. nigrescens po. gingivalis and e. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (mic range 0.1-3.9 mg/l), whereas the lactobacillus and  s. mutans were less susceptible (mic range 15.6-20.8 mg/l). triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (p < 0.01) for the positive control e. coli, although its mics towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (mic) occurred for pr. nigrescens and in s. sanguis and s. oralis (mbc). mean changes in susceptibilities (mic and mbc) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine mbcs for s. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. conclusions: these data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for e. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than fabi that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.

TI  == biofilm dispersal of neisseria subflava and other phylogenetically diverse oral bacteria.
AB  == polystyrene petri dishes containing liquid medium were inoculated with single-cell suspensions of a fresh clinical isolate of neisseria subflava and were incubated under conditions of low vibration. n. subflava colonies grew firmly attached to the surface of the dish, while the broth remained clear. growing colonies released cells into the medium, resulting in the appearance of 10(2) to 10(4) small satellite colonies attached to the surface of the dish in an area adjacent to each mature colony after 24 h. satellite colonies grew in patterns of streamers shaped like jets and flares emanating from mature colonies  and pointing toward the center of the dish. this dispersal pattern evidently resulted from the surface translocation of detached biofilm cells by buoyancy-driven convection currents that were generated due to slight temperature gradients in the medium. streamers of satellite colonies ranged from 2 to >40 mm  in length. satellite colonies in very long streamers were relatively uniform in size regardless of their distance from the mature colony, suggesting that mature  colonies released single cells or small clusters of cells into the medium and that the detachment, surface translocation, and subsequent surface reattachment of released cells were a transitory process. incubation of n. subflava single cells in a perfused biofilm fermentor resulted in a large spike of the number of  cfu in the perfusate after 9.5 h of growth, consistent with a rapid release of cells into the medium. biofilm colonies of several other phylogenetically diverse oral bacteria, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, haemophilus aphrophilus, streptococcus mitis, and a prevalent but previously uncultured oral  streptococcus sp., exhibited similar temperature-dependent dispersal patterns in  broth culture. this in vitro spreading phenotype could be a useful tool for studying biofilm dispersal in these and other nonflagellated bacteria and may have physiological relevance to biofilm dispersal in the oral cavity.

TI  == haemophilus segnis polymicrobial and monomicrobial bacteraemia identified by 16s  ribosomal rna gene sequencing.
AB  == this paper reports a case of haemophilus segnis polymicrobial bacteraemia and a case of h. segnis monomicrobial bacteraemia identified by 16s ribosomal rna gene  sequencing. in the first case, a gram-negative aerobic coccobacillus was isolated with streptococcus intermedius and s. sanguis from the blood culture of a 32-year-old intravenous drug addict with left thoracic empyema. in the second case, a gram-negative aerobic coccobacillus was isolated from the blood culture of an 82-year-old woman with clostridium difficile colitis and septicaemic shock. both gram-negative coccobacilli grew on chocolate agar as colonies of 1 mm in diameter after incubation for 24 h at 37 degress c in air with co2 5%, but only to pinpoint sizes on blood agar under the same incubation conditions. both strains were factor v-dependent, but not factor x-dependent. for the first isolate, the vitek system (nhi) showed that it was 56% likely to be actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and 40% neisseria subflava; whereas the api  system (nh) showed that it was 58% likely to be h. aphrophilus/paraphrophilus and 42% h. parainfluenzae. for the second isolate, the vitek system (nhi) showed that it was 95% likely to be h. influenzae viii; whereas the api system (nh) showed that it was 58% likely to be h. aphrophilus/paraphrophilus and 42% h. parainfluenzae. 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that there were four base differences between isolate 1 and h. segnis and two base differences between isolate 2 and h. segnis, indicating that both isolates most closely resembled a strain of h. segnis. only two cases of h. segnis bacteraemia were found in the english scientific literature, one in a case of infective endocarditis and the other in a case of pancreatic abscess. including the present two cases, the overall mortality of h. segnis bacteraemia was 50%.

TI  == the formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  == a chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). eleven bacterial species (streptococcus gordonii, strep. mitis i, strep. mutans,  strep. oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, neisseria subflava, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. a flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. the biofilm produced from state-1 showed  a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 pa). the biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while gram-negative species were predominant  in state-2.

TI  == analysis of ph-driven disruption of oral microbial communities in vitro.
AB  == previously, a mixed culture chemostat system was used to demonstrate that the ph  generated from carbohydrate metabolism, rather than carbohydrate availability per se, was responsible for the shifts observed in the oral microflora which are associated with high carbohydrate diets and the development of dental caries. the aim of this study was to determine more accurately the microbially generated ph at which such shifts occurred. nine oral bacteria were grown in three independent chemostats, and pulsed with glucose on 10 consecutive days. in one chemostat, ph  control was discontinued for 6 h, and the ph fall was restricted to a minimum value of ph 5.5; the ph fall was arrested in the other two chemostats at either ph 5. 0, or at ph 4.5. when the ph was allowed to fall, the numbers and proportions of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus rhamnosus increased; this increase was directly related to the magnitude of the ph fall. veillonella dispar was the most numerous organism following all glucose pulsing regimes, especially  at low ph. the increase in proportions of acidogenic bacteria was accompanied by  a fall in the proportions of acid-sensitive species (fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus oralis). the counts of these species were relatively stable between ph 5.5 and 4.5, but were markedly reduced when the ph fell below ph 4.5; neisseria subflava could not persist in the culture at ph 4.5 or below. the data suggest that the disruption of communities associated with glucose metabolism and low ph can be explained in  terms of a two-stage process. a fall in ph to a value between ph 5.5 and 4.5 may  allow the enrichment of potentially cariogenic species, whilst permitting species associated with health to remain relatively unaffected. a further reduction in ph (<ph 4.5) may not only enhance the competitiveness of odontopathogens, but inhibit the growth and metabolism of non-caries-associated species. the results also indicate that species other that mutans streptococci or lactobacilli are competitive at ph values low enough to demineralise enamel, and thus suggest that a broader range of micro-organisms may be associated with caries initiation.

TI  == binding of mannan-binding protein to various bacterial pathogens of meningitis.
AB  == mannan-binding protein (mbp), a calcium-dependent plasma lectin, may play a role  in the innate defence against microorganisms. after binding to carbohydrate structures at the bacterial surface, mbp activates the classical pathway of the complement system. to investigate the binding capacity of mbp to various bacteria associated with meningitis, an assay was developed to study the binding of mbp to bacteria grown in a semisynthetic fluid culture medium. salmonella montevideo (containing a mannose-rich lipopolysaccharide (lps)), used as a positive control  strain, showed binding of radiolabelled mbp at a level of 80% compared with binding of mbp to zymosan. binding of labelled mbp to salm. montevideo was time-dependent, temperature-dependent and saturable. the binding was inhibited by unlabelled mbp, by mannose and by n-acetyl-d-glucosamine. among bacterial pathogens often found to cause meningitis, a wide range of mbp binding capacities could be determined. the encapsulated neisseria meningitidis (representatives from 11 serogroups other than group a were included: n = 22), n. mucosa (n = 1),  haemophilus influenzae type b (n = 10) and streptococcus agalactiae (n = 5) had a low mbp binding capacity of 21.7% (95% confidence interval (ci) 3.3-40.1%). escherichia coli k1 (n = 11), strep. suis (n = 5), strep. pneumoniae (n = 10) and n. meningitidis serogroup a (n = 2) showed intermediate mbp binding capacity of 58.4% (95% ci 40.0-76.8%). a third group consisting of non-encapsulated listeria  monocytogenes (n = 11), non-encapsulated h. influenzae (n = 2), non-encapsulated  n. meningitidis (n = 2), n. cinera (n = 1) and n. subflava (n = 1) strains had a  high mbp binding capacity of 87.5% (95% ci 62.5-112.5%). the majority of encapsulated pathogens causing bacterial meningitis seem to have a rather low mbp binding capacity.

TI  == frequent isolation of capnophilic bacteria in aspirate from bartholin's gland abscesses and cysts.
AB  == aspirate samples were obtained from 73 patients undergoing surgery for a bartholin's gland abscess or cyst. capnophilic bacteria were isolated from 22% of cases, in contrast to previous reports of sporadic isolation. the three streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were serotype 3 or 4. the eight haemophilus influenzae isolates could not be serotyped; six of them were biotype ii but the electrophoretic band patterns of their outer membrane proteins were heterogeneous, indicating that non-serotypable strains from the same anatomical site may not be related. four neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates and one strain of neisseria subflava were recovered. the role of capnophilic bacteria in the pathogenesis of infections of the bartholin's gland remains to be clarified.

TI  == nitrate- and nitrite-reducing bacteria in the achlorhydric stomach.
AB  == the microbial composition of samples of gastric juice from eight achlorhydric patients was determined by aerobic and rigorously anaerobic culture techniques. bacteria from 16 genera were commonly isolated, but representatives of only three genera, (streptococci, neisseriae and haemophili) were isolated from every patient. nitrate and nitrite were both reduced by veillonellae, haemophili, staphylococci, corynebacteria, lactobacilli, flavobacteria and fusobacteria, but  the potential rate of nitrate reduction by suspensions of veillonellae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and members of the enterobacteriaceae were up to ten times more rapid than the rate of nitrite reduction. conversely, although all neisseria spp. reduced nitrite only some strains reduced nitrate. streptococci did not reduce nitrate. streptococcus sanguis reduced nitrite when grown with haematin; other streptococci did not reduce nitrite. bacterial nitrate and nitrite reduction were active over the ph range 6-8, similar to the ph range of the achlorhydric stomach. from a knowledge of the composition of the bacterial flora and their potential rates of nitrate and nitrite reduction under prevailing conditions, predictions were made about the tendency of nitrite to accumulate during nitrate reduction. studies of the transient accumulation of nitrite by mixed cultures of h. parainfluenzae and n. subflava were consistent with these predictions. haemophili and veillonellae could be responsible for the accumulation of nitrite in the gastric juice of some patients, whereas streptococci and neisseriae would tend to remove nitrite from the stomach as rapidly as it formed.

TI  == nitrite accumulation during anaerobic nitrate reduction by binary suspensions of  bacteria isolated from the achlorhydric stomach.
AB  == binary suspensions of bacteria isolated from the gastric juice of achlorhydric patients were used to determine conditions which favour nitrite accumulation during nitrate reduction. suspensions of veillonella parvula and haemophilus parainfluenzae accumulated nitrite during nitrate reduction in the absence of nitrite-reducing neisseria subflava or streptococcus sanguis. the maximum concentration of nitrite that transiently accumulated decreased predictably as the ratio of nitrite-removing bacteria to nitrite-accumulating bacteria increased. this ratio, but more importantly the bacterial density, determined the duration of nitrite accumulation. these results are correlated with the previously reported tendency of nitrite to accumulate in the gastric juice of hypogammaglobulinaemic and pernicious anaemic patients, and with the extremely high incidence of gastric cancer in the two groups.

TI  == efficacy of imipenem/cilastatin in endocarditis.
AB  == imipenem, a potent new beta-lactam antibiotic, which is bactericidal against most pathogenic bacteria, and cilastatin, a dehydropeptidase inhibitor combined with imipenem to prevent the metabolism of imipenem in the kidney, were evaluated in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis. seventeen patients, including 14 who used intravenous drugs, were treated with imipenem/cilastatin in a dose of 500 mg each infused over 30 minutes every six hours. the mean duration of treatment was  29 days with a range of 21 to 56 days. causative bacteria were staphylococcus aureus in 10 patients, s. aureus plus group b streptococcus in one, viridans group streptococcus in two, neisseria subflava, eikenella corrodens, and group g  streptococcus in one patient, and staphylococcus epidermidis, hemophilus aphrophilus, and enterobacter aerogenes in one patient each. the minimal bactericidal concentration of imipenem against 16 of 18 isolates tested was 0.04  micrograms/ml, 1 microgram/ml against h. aphrophilus, and 0.4 micrograms/ml against e. aerogenes. the site of infection was the right side of the heart in 11 patients, the left side in five, and both sides in one. the mean number of days to defervescence was 9.7. all patients were cured, and none required cardiac surgery. adverse effects were few and interrupted treatment occurred in only one  patient who had acute dyspnea during an infusion on day 26 of therapy. imipenem/cilastatin appears to be a relatively safe and highly effective treatment of staphylococcal endocarditis in intravenous drug users; too few patients with endocarditis caused by other bacteria were treated to allow a firm  statement about efficacy in non-staphylococcal endocarditis.

TI  == bacteriolytic action of fluoride ions.
AB  == bacillus subtilis, neisseria subflava, and lyt coccus were found to undergo massive lysis after growth in media containing 0.01 to 10 mm naf. when cells of these organisms were transferred from late-exponential-phase cultures to 0.02 m sodium phosphate buffer plus 0.1 m kcl, they underwent spontaneous autolysis. cells grown in media with fluoride were more liable to autolysis, and walls isolated from them also showed enhanced autolytic sensitivity, even though added  fluoride did not directly stimulate autolysins. sporadic or partial lysis occurred in populations of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans bht or  lm-7 after growth in fluoridated media. most bacteria that were tested did not undergo fluoride-induced lysis. however, cells of all test bacteria were found to have reduced amounts of peptidoglycan per unit of cell weight when grown in the presence of fluoride. incorporation of labeled lysine or glucosamine into peptidoglycan (park-hancock residue) was stimulated, instead of inhibited, by fluoride. however, fluoride also stimulated the loss of radioactivity from park-hancock residues of cells that had previously incorporated labeled lysine or glucosamine. thus, fluoride appeared to enhance peptidoglycan turnover, and this  turnover reduced the peptidoglycan contents of all bacteria tested, but induced lysis in only those bacteria that normally have highly active autolytic systems.
