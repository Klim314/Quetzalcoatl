TI  == ceftaroline versus isolates from animal bite wounds: comparative in vitro activities against 243 isolates, including 156 pasteurella species isolates.
AB  == more than 5 million americans are bitten by animals, usually dogs, annually. bite patients comprise approximately 1% of all patients who visit emergency departments (300,000/year), and approximately 10,000 require hospitalization and  intravenous antibiotics. ceftaroline is the bioactive component of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, which is fda approved for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssis), including those containing methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). there are no in vitro data about the activity of ceftaroline against pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida  and pasteurella multocida subsp. septica, other pasteurella spp., or other bite wound isolates. we therefore studied the in vitro activity of ceftaroline against 243 animal bite isolates. mics were determined using the broth microdilution method according to clsi guidelines. comparator drugs included cefazolin, ceftriaxone, ertapenem, ampicillin-sulbactam, azithromycin, doxycycline, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (smx-tmp). ceftaroline was the most active agent against all 5 pasteurella species, including p. multocida subsp. multocida and p. multocida subsp. septica, with a maximum mic of </=0.008 mug/ml; more active than ceftriaxone and ertapenem (mic(90)s, </=0.015 mug/ml); and more active than cefazolin (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml) doxycycline (mic(90), 0.125 mug/ml), azithromycin (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml), ampicillin-sulbactam (mic(90), 0.125 mug/ml), and smx-tmp  (mic(90), 0.125 mug/ml). ceftaroline was also very active against all s. aureus isolates (mic(90), 0.125 mug/ml) and other staphylococcus and streptococcus species, with a maximum mic of 0.125 mug/ml against all bite isolates tested. ceftaroline has potential clinical utility against infections involving p. multocida, other pasteurella species, and aerobic gram-positive isolates, including s. aureus.

TI  == microbial communities in the tonsils of healthy pigs.
AB  == the tonsils of mammals such as humans and pigs are colonized with an extensive microbiota and are frequently the site for asymptomatic carriage of bacterial pathogens. the goal of this study was to determine the composition of the microbial community of the tonsils in healthy pigs. tonsils were collected from eight pigs from two different healthy herds. samples of the tonsils from each pig were used for culture dependent and culture independent identification of the microbial community. aerobic cultivation identified pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus suis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and escherichia coli from >/= 50% of the pigs in both herds. for culture independent studies, microbial community members were identified by 16s rrna sequences using the ribosomal database project pipeline programs developed at michigan state university. dominant genera identified by 16s rrna analysis in pigs from both herds included actinobacillus,  haemophilus, pasteurella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, bacteroides, and prevotella. these genera were detected in nearly every pig regardless of herd. in contrast, there was an asymmetric distribution of minor genera between the two herds, suggesting herd-specific differences in the microbial communities. in addition, we demonstrated primer bias between two frequently used forward primers when targeting the tonsillar community. our results suggest that the major bacterial community members found in porcine tonsils are the same regardless of herd, while the minor species are unique to each herd. this is the first analysis using 16s rrna sequence libraries of the composition of microbial communities in  the porcine upper respiratory tract.

TI  == pcr evaluation of false-positive signals from two automated blood-culture systems.
AB  == rapid detection of micro-organisms from blood is one of the most critical functions of a diagnostic microbiology laboratory. automated blood-culture systems reduce the time needed to detect positive cultures, and reduce specimen handling. the false-positive rate of such systems is 1-10%. in this study, the presence of pathogens in 'false-positive' bottles obtained from bactec 9050 (becton dickinson) and bact/alert (biomerieux) systems was investigated by eubacterial and fungal pcr. a total of 169 subculture-negative aerobic blood-culture bottles (104 bact/alert and 65 bactec) were evaluated. both fungal  and eubacterial pcrs were negative for all bactec bottles. fungal pcr was also negative for the bact/alert system, but 10 bottles (9.6%) gave positive results by eubacterial pcr. sequence analysis of the positive pcr amplicons indicated the presence of the following bacteria (number of isolates in parentheses): pasteurella multocida (1), staphylococcus epidermidis (2), staphylococcus hominis (1), micrococcus sp. (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (1), corynebacterium spp. (2), brachibacterium sp. (1) and arthrobacter/rothia sp. (1). antibiotic usage by the  patients may be responsible for the inability of the laboratory to grow these bacteria on subcultures. for patients with more than one false-positive bottle, molecular methods can be used to evaluate the microbial dna in these bottles. false positives from the bactec system may be due to elevated patient leukocyte counts or the high sensitivity of the system to background increases in co(2) concentration.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem and 11 other antimicrobial agents against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue animal and human bite wound infections.
AB  == we studied the comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem, a new carbapenem, against 240 aerobic and 180 anaerobic recent clinical bite isolates using an agar dilution method and an inoculum of 10(4) cfu/spot for aerobes and 10(5) cfu/spot  for anaerobes. ertapenem inhibited 410/420 (98%) of the isolates tested at < or = 4 mg/l with only 4/5 campylobacter gracilis and 1/3 campylobacter rectus strains  requiring . or = 16 mg/l for inhibition. ertapenem was only moderately active (mic 8 mg/l) against 4/6 enterococcus faecalis and 1/11 staphylococcus epidermidis strains. all pasteurella multocida, pasteurella septica, pasteurella  canis, pasteurella dagmatis, moraxella spp. and ef-4 isolates were inhibited at < or = 0.015 mg/l. mic(90)s for other aerobic genera and species were as follows: corynebacterium spp., 4 mg/l; staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 mg/l; staphylococcus epidermidis, 4 mg/l; other coagulasenegative staphylococci, 0.25 mg/l; streptococcus milleri group, 0.5 mg/l; eikenella corrodens, 0.03 mg/l; and bergeyella zoohelcum, 0.5 mg/l. for anaerobes the range of mics and mic(90)s were: prevotella ssp., < or = 0.015-0.5, 0.125 mg/l; porphyromonas spp., < or = 0.015-0.03, 0.015 mg/l; fusobacterium spp., 0.015-0.125, 0.03 mg/l; bacteroides tectum, 0.03-0.125, 0.125 mg/l; and peptostreptococcus spp., 0.01-2, 1 mg/l. ertapenem showed excellent potency against the full range of animal and human bite wound pathogens.

TI  == bacterial identity and characteristics in healthy and unhealthy respiratory tracts of sheep and calves.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare different bacteriological aspects of the respiratory systems of healthy (h) versus unhealthy (uh) animals with respiratory signs. the prevalence of different bacterial species was determined in the upper  and lower respiratory tract of h and uh najdi sheep, somali sheep and holstein calves. the characteristics of pasteurella spp. isolates, and the biotype of pasteurella haemolytica were identified in h and uh animals, eighteen out of 28 (64.3%) of the identified bacterial species in the upper respiratory tract were more prevalent in the nasal cavities of uh najdi and somali sheep and holstein calves with respiratory signs than in apparently healthy animals; four of the most prevalent bacteria in the upper respiratory system of uh sheep were moraxella spp., pseudomonas pseudomallei, erysipelothrix spp., pasteurella multocida, while three of the most prevalent bacteria in uh calves were pasteurella haemolytica, actinomyces spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the prevalence of six different bacterial species was greater in the lungs of uh animals, namely actinomyces pyogenes, erysipelothrix spp., p. haemolytica, pasteurella ureae, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis, which could be risk factors in the complexity of the prevalent respiratory diseases of  the animals surveyed. of the biochemical, cytological and colonial characteristics studied in the identified p. haemolytica and p. multocida, two characters were significantly different (p < 0.05) in organisms isolated from uh  as compared to those from h animals. these were the higher loss of haemolytic power by the strains of p. haemolytica and the decreased fermentation of trehalose by all the strains of p. multocida recovered from healthy animals. the  only biotype of p. haemolytica isolated from h animals was biotype a, while both  biotypes a (88.0% of the isolates) and t (12.0% of the isolates) were recovered from uh animals.

TI  == antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to rp 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. in studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and rp 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference mic and mbc tests. no significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/rp 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and streptococcus ssp.  enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but e. faecalis, pasteurella multocida, pediococcus ssp., haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (mic90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). the log phase inoculum was preferred for mbc and kill-curve tests with this combination. the 30:70 ratio in  vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to  predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant e. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.

TI  == species selectivity of new siderophore-drug conjugates that use specific iron uptake for entry into bacteria.
AB  == siderophores selectively bind ferric iron and are involved in receptor-specific iron transport into bacteria. several types of siderophores were synthesized, and growth-promoting or inhibitory activities when they were conjugated to carbacephalosporin, erythromycylamine, or nalidixic acid were investigated. overall, 11 types of siderophores and 21 drug conjugates were tested against seven different bacterial species: escherichia coli, bordetella bronchiseptica, pasteurella multocida, pasteurella haemolytica, streptococcus suis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. in some species, the inhibitory activities of the drug conjugates were associated with the ability of  the bacteria to use the siderophore portion of the molecules for growth promotion in disc diffusion tests (0.04 mumol of conjugate or siderophore per disc). e. coli used catechol-based siderophore portions as well as hydroxamate-based tri-delta-oh-n-oh-delta-n-acetyl-l-ornithine ferric iron ligands for growth under iron-restricted conditions achieved by supplemental ethylenediamine di (o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) (100 micrograms/ml) and was sensitive to carbacephalosporin conjugated to these siderophore types (up to a 34-mm-diameter  inhibition zone). b. bronchiseptica used desferrioxamine b and an isocyanurate-based or trihydroxamate in addition to catechol-based siderophore portions for promotion but was not inhibited by beta-lactam conjugates partly because of the presence of beta-lactamase. p. multocida and p. haemolytica did not use any of the synthetic siderophores for growth promotion, and the inhibitory activities of some conjugates seemed partly linked to their ability to withhold iron from these bacteria, since individual siderophore portions showed some antibacterial effects. individual siderophores did not promote s. suis growth in restrictive conditions, but the type of ferric iron ligands attached to beta-lactams affected inhibitory activities. the antibacterial activities of the  intracellular-acting agents erythromycylamine and nalidixic acid were reduced or  lost, even against s. aureus and s. epidermidis, when the agents were conjugated  to siderophores. conjugate-resistant e. coli mutants showed the absence of some iron-regulated outer membrane proteins in gel electrophoresis profiles and in specific phage or colicin sensitivity tests, implying that the drugs used outer membrane receptors of ferric complexes to get into cells.

TI  == aerobic bacteria from nasal discharge of goats suffering from clinical ppr: isolation and identification.
AB  == bacteriological isolation of aerobic bacteria from nasal discharge of achondroplastic west african dwarf goats showing clinical signs of peste des petits ruminants (ppr), and the laboratory procedures carried out for the identification of the isolates are described. from a total of forty nasal swabs obtained seventy five isolates were recovered. the percentage frequency of isolation of different organisms in descending order of occurrence is as follows: staphylococcus 44.0%; streptococcus 22.67%; neisseria 12.00%; pasteurella 10.67%; pseudomonas 4.00%; proteus 4.00% and corynebacterium 1.33%. a further break-down  using biochemical tests revealed that staphylococcus aureus accounted for 30.67%  of the total bacteria isolates; staphylococcus epidermidis 13.33%; streptococcus  viridans 18.67%; streptococcus pyogenes 4.00%; neisseria catarrhalis 12.00%; proteus mirabilis 2.67%; proteus rettgeri 1.33%; pseudomonas aeruginosa 5.33%; pasteurella multocida 4.00%; pasteurella haemolytica 6.67% and corynebacterium pyogenes 1.33%.

TI  == bovine recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor enhancement of bovine neutrophil functions in vitro.
AB  == neutrophils were purified from blood of dexamethasone-treated (0.04 mg/kg of body weight) and untreated calves. cells were untreated (controls) or cultured in media containing 5 or 10 ng of bovine recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rbgm-csf)/ml for 10 to 12 hours before being tested for various functions. dexamethasone treatment of calves decreased luminol-dependent chemiluminescence, decreased phagocytosis of pasteurella multocida and several staphylococcus spp by various degrees, and decreased antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against bovine herpesvirus-infected cells by 26 to 32%. the percentage phagocytosis of coagulase-positive s aureus and s intermedius was higher than that of coagulase-negative s epidermidis for neutrophils from all calves. culture of neutrophils with rbgm-csf significantly increased (p less than 0.05) all of the aforementioned functions, compared with control neutrophils; however, rbgm-csf-induced increases in function tended to be higher in neutrophils from dexamethasone-treated calves than in neutrophils from  untreated calves.

TI  == [aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  == on the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in april 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. they were: bordetella bronchiseptica, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus sp., branhamella catarrhalis, micrococcus sp., enterobacter agglomerans, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas paucimobilis, pseudomonas diminuta, alcaligenes faecalis and escherichia coli. however, young weaned rabbits were more often pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. the usefulness of performing only pasteurella and bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. it is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.

TI  == laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  == the growth of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. fecalis, s. sanguis, s. bovis, s. mitior, s. agalactiae, escherichia coli, a-d group, klebsiella aerogenes, k. oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, pasteurella multocida or listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood  cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no  growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. the analysis detected the growth of s. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect  the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and species of micrococcus, corynebacterium or bacillus in 18 blood cultures.

TI  == [intrauterine bacterial and mycotic infections in cows].
AB  == bacteriologic, mycologic, and serologic investigations of cows and calves and three experiments with rabbits were carried out to shed light on the bacteriology and mycology of the intrauterine infections in cows. the following organisms were isolated from the investigated cows that exhibited disturbances in their reproduction, and had abortions, or gave birth to calves that were affected with  diseases or died: escherichia coli (17.84%), association of bacteria (7.64%); vibrio genitalis (3.86%); streptococcus sp. (2.78%); moulds (2.54%); staphylococcus aureus (2.20%); proteus sp. (1.62%); staphylococcus epidermidis (1.39%); pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.39%); pasteurella multocida (0.11%). the serologic investigation of a total of 231 blood samples from cows that miscarried, gave birth to dead calves, or failed to conceive revealed that in 15.58 per cent there was vibriosis, and in 6.06 per cent--leptospirosis. demonstrated was the etiologic link between cows with reproductive disturbances and diseased calves with regard to vibriosis and leptospirosis. the tests with rabbits were indicative of bacterial carriers (with special reference to the genitalia) up to the 60th day following infection. there were abortions, sterility, and death cases and the birth of unviable bunnies in the case of reproduced coital infections with escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == aerobic bacterial flora of oral and nasal fluids of canines with reference to bacteria associated with bites.
AB  == oral and nasal fluids of 50 dogs were examined to determine the prevalence of aerobic bacteria frequently associated with animal bite wounds. the most frequently isolated microorganisms included: iij, ef-4, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, group d streptococci, corynebacterium sp., enterobacteria, neisseria sp., moraxella sp., and bacillus sp. other species and genera were infrequently recovered and may represent transient flora. the high incidence of iij, ef-4, p. multocida, and s. aureus, all known human pathogens, suggests that they should be considered as probably contaminants in bite wounds.
