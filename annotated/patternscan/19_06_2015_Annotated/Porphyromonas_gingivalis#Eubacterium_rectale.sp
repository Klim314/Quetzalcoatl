TI  == molecular characterization of novel pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes from the human microbiome.
AB  == pyridoxal-5'-phosphate or plp, the active form of vitamin b6, is a highly versatile cofactor that participates in a large number of mechanistically diverse enzymatic reactions in basic metabolism. plp-dependent enzymes account for approximately 1.5% of most prokaryotic genomes and are estimated to be involved in approximately 4% of all catalytic reactions, making this an important class of enzymes. here, we structurally and functionally characterize three novel plp-dependent enzymes from bacteria in the human microbiome: two are from eubacterium rectale, a dominant, nonpathogenic, fecal, gram-positive bacteria, and the third is from porphyromonas gingivalis, which plays a major role in human periodontal disease. all adopt the type i plp-dependent enzyme fold and structure-guided biochemical analysis enabled functional assignments as tryptophan, aromatic, and probable phosphoserine aminotransferases.
