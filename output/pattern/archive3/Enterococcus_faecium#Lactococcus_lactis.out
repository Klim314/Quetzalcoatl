chloride-inducible expression vector for delivery of antimicrobial peptides targeting antibiotic-resistant enterococcus faecium.
antibiotic-resistant enterococcal infections are a major concern in hospitals where patients with compromised immunity are readily infected. enterococcus faecium bacteria are of particular interest as these pathogens account for over 80% of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections. antimicrobial peptides (amps) produced at the site of infection by engineered bacteria may offer a potential alternative to traditional antibiotics for the treatment of resistant bacteria such as e. faecium. for this mode of delivery to be effective, it is essential to identify a suitable protein expression system that can be used in the desired delivery bacterium. in this study, we describe a promising chloride-inducible promoter and its application in the bacterial delivery of amps from lactococcus lactis to reduce counts of e. faecium bacteria in vitro. reporter gene studies show that at chloride concentrations found within the human intestines, the chloride-inducible promoter exhibits high levels of protein expression compared to those of the commonly used nisin-inducible promoter. these results indicate that this system is powerful and would not require the exogenous administration of an inducer molecule. in its application for amp production against e. faecium in vitro, l. lactis producing amps under the chloride promoter rapidly decreased e. faecium counts by nearly 10,000-fold. as an extension of this application, we also demonstrate the potential in using this type of delivery system in combination with traditional antibiotics to slow the development of resistance. collectively, this study shows the promise of using a chloride-inducible promoter for the bacterial delivery of amps in the body for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and other antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
modified lactic acid bacteria detect and inhibit multiresistant enterococci.
we designed lactococcus lactis to detect enterococcus faecalis. upon detection, l. lactis produce and secrete antienterococcal peptides. the peptides inhibit enterococcal growth and reduce viability of enterococci in the vicinity of l. lactis. the enterococcal sex pheromone ccf10 serves as the signal for detection. expression vectors derived from pcf10, a ccf10-responsive e. faecalis sex-pheromone conjugative plasmid, were engineered in l. lactis for the detection system. recombinant host strains were engineered to express genes for three bacteriocins, enterocin a, hiracin jm79 and enterocin p, each with potent antimicrobial activity against e. faecalis. sensitive detection and specific inhibition occur both in agar and liquid media. the engineered l. lactis also inhibited growth of multidrug-resistant e. faecium strains, when induced by ccf10. the presented vectors and strains can be components of a toolbox for the development of alternative antibiotic technologies targeting enterococci at the site of infection.
interactive effects of ph and temperature on the bacteriocin stability by response surface analysis.
the combined influence of ph and temperature on bacteriocins produced by three lactic acid bacteria, pediococcus pentosaceus mmz26, enterococcus faecium mmz17 and lactococcus lactis mmz25, isolated from tunisian traditional dry fermented meat was studied using a second order orthogonal factorial design and response-surface methodology (rsm). this method allows estimating the interactive effects of ph and temperature on the stability of each bacteriocin. the high heat stability of the three bacteriocins was demonstrated, with optimum values at light acidic ph around 5.0, temperature below 90 degrees c and short incubation times. this study contributes to a better understanding of relation between bacteriocins production and stability in order to enhance their, in situ, application as a food and feed biopreservative in fermented and/or heated food products.
protein expression vector and secretion signal peptide optimization to drive the  production, secretion, and functional expression of the bacteriocin enterocin a in lactic acid bacteria.
replacement of the leader sequence (ls) of the bacteriocin enterocin a (ls(enta)) by the signal peptides (sp) of the protein usp45 (sp(usp45)), and the bacteriocins enterocin p (sp(entp)), and hiracin jm79 (sp(hirjm79)) permits the production, secretion, and functional expression of enta by different lactic acid bacteria (lab). chimeric genes encoding the sp(usp45), the sp(entp), and the sp(hirjm79) fused to mature enta plus the enta immunity genes (enta+entia) were cloned into the expression vectors pnz8048 and pmsp3545, under control of the inducible p(nisa) promoter, and in pmg36c, under control of the constitutive p(32) promoter. the amount, antimicrobial activity, and specific antimicrobial activity of the enta produced by the recombinant lactococcus lactis, enterococcus faecium, e. faecalis, lactobacillus sakei and pediococcus acidilactici hosts varied depending on the signal peptide, the expression vector, and the host strain. however, the antimicrobial activity and the specific antimicrobial activity of the enta produced by most of the lab transformants was lower than expected from their production. the supernatants of the recombinant l. lactis nz9000 (pnzuai) and l. lactis nz9000 (pnzhai), overproducers of enta, showed a 1.2- to 5.1-fold higher antimicrobial activity than that of the natural producer e. faecium t136 against different listeria spp.
use of the usp45 lactococcal secretion signal sequence to drive the secretion and functional expression of enterococcal bacteriocins in lactococcus lactis.
replacement of the signal peptide (sp) of the bacteriocins enterocin p (entp) and hiracin jm79 (hirjm79), produced by enterococcus faecium p13 and enterococcus hirae dch5, respectively, by the signal peptide of usp45 (sp(usp45)), the major sec-dependent protein secreted by lactococcus lactis, permits the production, secretion, and functional expression of entp and hirjm79 by l. lactis. chimeric genes encoding the sp(usp45) fused to either mature entp (entp), with or without the immunity gene (entip) or to mature hirjm79 (hirjm79), with or without the immunity gene (hirijm79), were cloned into the expression vector pmg36c, carrying the p(32) constitutive promoter, and into pnz8048 under control of the inducible pnisa promoter. the production of entp and hirjm79 by most of the l. lactis recombinant strains was 1.5- to 3.7-fold higher and up to 3.6-fold higher than by the e. faecium p13 and e. hirae dch5 control strains, respectively. however, the specific antimicrobial activity of the recombinant entp was 1.1- to 6.2-fold higher than that produced by e. faecium p13, while that of the hirjm79 was a 40% to an 89% of that produced by e. hirae dch5. chimeras of sp(usp45) fused to mature entp or hirjm79 drive the production and secretion of these bacteriocins in l. lactis in the absence of specific immunity and secretion proteins. the supernatants of the recombinant l. lactis nz9000 strains, producers of entp, showed a much higher antimicrobial activity against listeria spp. than that of the recombinant l. lactis nz9000 derivatives, producers of hirjm79.
gene cloning and characterization of efma, a multidrug efflux pump, from enterococcus faecium.
a dna fragment responsible for resistance to antimicrobial agents was cloned from chromosomal dna of enterococcus faecium fn-1, a clinically isolated strain. escherichia coli kam32, a drug-hypersusceptible mutant, was used as a host for gene cloning. cells of e. coli kam32 harboring a recombinant plasmid (ptfm8) carrying the dna fragment became resistant to fluoroquinolones, macrolides, ethidium bromide, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi) and tetraphenylphosphonium chloride (tppcl). three complete open reading frames (orfs) were found in the dna insert of ptfm8, and the deduced amino acid sequences of one of the orfs showed high similarity to mdt(a) from lactococcus lactis. mdt(a) is a multidrug efflux pump belonging to a major facilitator superfamily. we designated the orf efma. e. coli kam32 cells harboring the efma showed energy-dependent efflux of dapi and tpp(+). we also observed norfloxacin/h(+) antiport due to efma. the mrna expression of efma was observed in e. faecium fn-1 grown without any exogenously added antimicrobial agents. thus, we conclude that efma is constitutively expressed under laboratory growth conditions and would contribute to intrinsic resistance against multiple antimicrobial agents in e. faecium fn-1.
characterization and antimicrobial spectrum of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional bulgarian dairy products.
aims: to isolate bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (lab) with high wide  spectrum antibacterial activity and to characterize their inhibitory peptides. method and results: seven lab strains [lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus (pc5), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (bb18), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (bcm5, bk15), enterococcus faecium (mh3), lactobacillus plantarum (br12), lactobacillus casei ssp. casei (bcz2)], isolated from authentic bulgarian dairy products were capable of producing bacteriocins, inhibiting the widest range of pathogenic bacteria. the bacteriocins were resistant to heating at 121 degrees c for 15 min, stable at ph 2-10, sensitive to protease, insensitive to alpha-amylase and lipase. two of bacteriocins produced by lact. bulgaricus bb18 (bulgaricin bb18) and e. faecium mh3 (enterocin mh3) were purified and the molecular masses were determined. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of bulgaricin bb18 did not show strong homology to other known bacteriocins. conclusions: lactobacillus bulgaricus bb18 and e. faecium mh3 produce two novel bacteriocins highly similar to the pediocin-like nonlantibiotics. significance and impact of the study: the two bacteriocins are potential antimicrobial agents and, in conjunction with their producers, may have use in applications to contribute a positive effect on the balance of intestinal microflora. furthermore, bulgaricin bb18 strongly inhibits helicobacter pylori.
listeria monocytogenes and salmonella spp. in raw milk produced in brazil: occurrence and interference of indigenous microbiota in their isolation and development.
this study aimed to verify the occurrence of listeria monocytogenes and salmonella spp. in raw milk produced in brazil. on account of the poor microbiological quality of this product, possible interference from the indigenous microbiota in these pathogens was also evaluated. two-hundred and ten raw milk samples were collected in four important milk-producing areas in brazil, tested for l. monocytogenes and salmonella spp. presence, and for enumeration of indicator microorganisms: mesophilic aerobes, total coliforms and escherichia coli. the interference of the indigenous microbiota in the isolation procedures was also tested, as well the frequency of naturally occurring raw milk strains with antagonistic activity against both pathogens. the pathogens were not isolated in any raw milk sample, but poor microbiological quality was confirmed by the high levels of indicator microorganisms. when present at high levels, the indigenous microbiota generated an evident interference in the methodologies of l. monocytogenes and salmonella spp. isolation, mainly when the pathogens appeared at low levels. three-hundred and sixty raw milk strains were tested for antagonistic activity against both pathogens, and 91 (25.3%) showed inhibitory activity against l. monocytogenes and 33 (9.2%) against salmonella spp. the majority of the antagonistic strains were identified as lactic acid bacteria species, mainly lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and enterococcus faecium, known by antimicrobial substance production.
production of enterocins l50a, l50b, and it, a new enterocin, by enterococcus faecium it62, a strain isolated from italian ryegrass in japan.
enterococcus faecium it62, isolated from ryegrass in japan, was shown to produce  three different bacteriocins, two of which had molecular masses and amino acid sequences that corresponded to those of enterocin l50a and enterocin l50b. these peptides existed, however, as chemically modified forms that were either n formylated or n formylated and oxidized at met(24). the third bacteriocin, named enterocin it, had a molecular mass of 6,390 da, was made up of 54 amino acids, and did not correspond to any known bacteriocin. however, enterocin it was identical to the c-terminal part of the 16-amino-acid-longer bacteriocin 32 (t. inoue, h. tomita, and y. ike, antimicrob. agents chemother., 50:1202-1212, 2006). for the first time, the antimicrobial activity spectra for enterocins l50a and l50b were determined separately and included a wide range of gram-positive bacteria but also a few gram-negative strains that were weakly sensitive. slight differences in the activities of enterocins l50a and l50b were observed, as gram-positive bacteria showed an overall higher level of sensitivity to l50a than to l50b, as opposed to gram-negative ones. conversely, enterocin it showed a very narrow antimicrobial spectrum that was limited to e. faecium strains, one strain of bacillus subtilis, and one strain of lactococcus lactis. this study showed that e. faecium it62, a grass-borne strain, produces bacteriocins with very different activity features and structures that may be found in strains associated with food or those of clinical origin, which demonstrates that a particular enterocin structure may be widespread and not related to the producer's origin.
cloning and heterologous production of hiracin jm79, a sec-dependent bacteriocin  produced by enterococcus hirae dch5, in lactic acid bacteria and pichia pastoris.
hiracin jm79 (hirjm79), a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by enterococcus hirae dch5, was cloned and produced in lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and pichia pastoris. for heterologous production of hirjm79 in lactic acid bacteria (lab), the hirjm79 structural gene (hirjm79), with or without the hirjm79 immunity gene (hirijm79), was cloned into the plasmid pmg36c under the control of the constitutive promoter p(32) and into the plasmid pnz8048 under the control of the inducible p(nisa) promoter. for the production of hirjm79 in p. pastoris, the gene encoding the mature hirjm79 protein was cloned into the ppiczalphaa expression vector. the recombinant plasmids permitted the production of biologically active hirjm79 in the supernatants of l. lactis il1403, l. lactis nz9000, l. sakei lb790, e. faecalis jh2-2, and p. pastoris x-33, the coproduction of hirjm79 and nisin a in l. lactis dpc5598, and the coproduction of hirjm79 and enterocin p in e. faecium l50/14-2. all recombinant lab produced larger quantities of hirjm79 than e. hirae dch5, although the antimicrobial activities of most transformants were lower than that predicted from their production of hirjm79. the synthesis, processing, and secretion of hirjm79 proceed efficiently in recombinant lab strains and p. pastoris.
chimeras of mature pediocin pa-1 fused to the signal peptide of enterocin p permits the cloning, production, and expression of pediocin pa-1 in lactococcus lactis.
chimeras of pediocin pa-1 (peda-1), a bacteriocin produced by pediococcus acidilactici plbh9, fused to the signal peptide of enterocin p (entp), a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium p13, permitted the production of peda-1 in lactococcus lactis. chimeric genes encoding the entp signal peptide (sp(entp)) fused to mature peda-1 (peda), with or without its immunity gene (pedb), were cloned into the expression vector pmg36c to generate the recombinant plasmids pmpp9 (sp(entp):peda) and pmpp14i (sp(entp):peda + pedb). transformation of competent l. lactis subsp. lactis il1403, l. lactis subsp. cremoris nz9000, and l. lactis subsp. lactis dpc5598 with the recombinant plasmids has permitted the detection and quantitation of peda-1 and the coproduction of nisin a and peda-1 in supernatants of producer cells with specific anti-peda-1 antibodies and a noncompetitive indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. recombinant l. lactis hosts carrying pmpp9 or pmpp14i displayed antimicrobial activity, suggesting that mature peda-1 fused to sp(entp) is the minimum requirement for the synthesis, processing, and secretion of biologically active peda-1 in l. lactis. however, the production and antimicrobial activity of the peda-1 produced by l. lactis was lower than that produced by the p. acidilactici control strains.
inhibitory effect of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
objectives: to determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several gram-negative  and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. methods: the in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against h. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. time-kill assay was performed with two staphylococcus spp. strains. results: anti-h. pylori activity was detected with saccharomyces cerevisiae, bacillus spp., 1 enterococcus faecium and 2 lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 h. pylori strains tested. all staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-h. pylori effect: one staphylococcus auricularis and two staphylococcus epidermidis against all h. pylori tested; staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hominis and s. auricularis against six, five and seven h. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative staphylococcus against one h. pylori strain. an inhibitory effect was detected with one escherichia coli against one h. pylori. klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella spp. and acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four h. pylori strains, and enterobacter cloacae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 h. pylori isolates. no anti-h. pylori activity was detected with one lactobacillus spp., two lactococcus lactis, four streptococcus spp., one bacillus cereus, one e. faecium, one enterococcus faecalis, one e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella oxytoca. time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two staphylococcus spp. strains tested. conclusions: several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit h. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
cloning, production and expression of the bacteriocin enterocin a produced by enterococcus faecium plbc21 in lactococcus lactis.
replacement of the leader sequence of enterocin a (enta), a bacteriocin produced  by enterococcus faecium plbc21, by the signal peptide of enterocin p (entp), a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by e. faecium p13, permitted production of enta in lactococcus lactis. chimeras encoding the entp signal peptide (sp( entp )) fused to mature enta (enta), with or without its immunity gene (entia), were cloned into the expression vector pmg36c to generate the recombinant plasmids, pmpa15 (sp( entp ):enta) and pmpa10i (sp( entp ):enta + entia). transformation of competent l. lactis subsp. lactis il1403 and l. lactis subsp. cremoris nz9000 with the recombinant plasmids permitted production of enta by the transformed cells, and the co-production of nisin a and enta by the l. lactis subsp. lactis dpc5598 transformants. mature enta fused to sp(entp) is the minimum requirement for synthesis, processing and secretion of biologically active enta in l. lactis. the production of enta by most recombinant l. lactis hosts was larger than in the e. faecium control strains. all l. lactis derivatives showed antimicrobial activity against listeria spp., and l. lactis (pmpa15) displayed the highest antilisterial effect.
partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by human lactococcus lactis and pediococccus acidilactici isolates.
aims: the aim of this study was to isolate bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (lab) from human intestine. methods and results: a total of 111 lab were isolated from human adult stool and screened for their bacteriocin production. neutralized cell-free supernatants from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis mm19 and pediococcus acidilactici mm33 showed antimicrobial activity. the antimicrobials in the supernatant from a culture of l. lactis inhibited enterococcus faecium, various species of lactobacillus and staphylococcus aureus; while those in the supernatant from a culture of p. acidilactici inhibited enterococcus spp., some lactobacilli and various serotypes of listeria monocytogenes. the antimicrobial metabolites were heat-stable and were active over a ph range of 2-10. the antimicrobial activities of the supernatants of both bacteria were inhibited by many proteases but not by catalase. the plate overlay assay allowed an approximation of size between 3.5 and 6 kda for both antimicrobial substances. conclusions: as the antagonistic factor(s) produced by l. lactis mm19 and p. acidilactici mm33 were sensitive to proteolytic enzymes, it could be hypothesized that bacteriocins were involved in the inhibitory activities. inhibition spectrum and biochemical analysis showed that these bacteria produced two distinct bacteriocins. significance and impact of the study: we are the first to isolate bacteriocin-producing strains of pediococcus and lactococcus from human intestine. these strains might be useful for control of enteric pathogens.
high-level heterologous production and functional expression of the sec-dependent enterocin p from enterococcus faecium p13 in lactococcus lactis.
enterocin p (entp), a sec-dependent bacteriocin from enterococcus faecium p13, was produced by lactococcus lactis. the entp structural gene (entp) with or without the entp immunity gene (entip) was cloned in (1), plasmid pmg36c under control of the lactococcal constitutive promoter p32, (2) in plasmid png8048e under control of the inducible pnisa promoter, and (3) in the integration vector pint29. introduction of the recombinant vectors in l. lactis resulted in production of biologically active entp in the supernatants of l. lactis subsp. lactis il1403 and l. lactis subsp. cremoris nz9000, and the coproduction of nisin a and entp in l. lactis subsp. lactis dpc5598. the level of production of entp, detected and quantified by specific anti-entp antibodies and a noncompetitive indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, by the recombinant l. lactis strains depended on the host strain, the expression vector, and the presence of the entip gene in the constructs of the recombinant l. lactis strains. the highest amount of entp was produced with derivatives containing entp and entip, for both l. lactis il1403 and l. lactis nz9000. these derivatives produced up to five- to six-fold more entp than e. faecium p13. mass spectrometry analysis revealed that entp purified from l. lactis il1403 (pjp214) has a molecular mass identical to that purified from e. faecium p13, suggesting that the synthesis, processing, and secretion of entp progresses efficiently in recombinant l. lactis hosts.
efficacy of nisin in combination with protective cultures against listeria monocytogenes scott a in tofu.
nisin can be used as a biopreservative to control growth of listeria monocytogenes in various minimally processed foods. tofu is an example of a non-fermented soybean product, which may allow growth of listeria at refrigeration temperatures and in which nisin may be applied to prevent multiplication of listeria. the efficacy of nisin against listeria may be compromised by the emergence of spontaneous nisin-resistant mutants. exposure of l. monocytogenes scott a to nisin in a culture medium or in a food product results in an initial reduction of listeria population which is followed by regrowth of survivors to nisin during further incubation. in vitro studies using standard i nutrient broth showed that enterococcus faecium bfe 900-6a and lactobacillus sakei lb 706-1a used as protective cultures in combination with nisin were able to suppress proliferation of listeria cells not killed by nisin at 10 degrees c. growth and bacteriocin production of these two strains and a third protective culture, lactococcus lactis bfe 902 was also observed in soymilk and tofu at 10 degrees c. inoculation studies with tofu prepared with nisin and protective cultures showed that lower amounts of nisin are required for an effective inhibition of l. monocytogenes scott a when either e. faecium bfe 900-6a or lc. lactis bfe 902 are used in addition. the combination of nisin with these bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (lab) resulted in a complete suppression of listerial growth in homemade tofu stored at 10 degrees c for 1 week. lb. sakei lb 706-1a was less effective and did not prevent a slight increase of l. monocytogenes scott a numbers during storage.
characterization of anti-listeria monocytogenes bacteriocins from enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and lactococcus lactis strains isolated from raib, a moroccan traditional fermented milk.
seventy-four samples of raib, a moroccan traditional fermented milk, were screened for their anti-listeria monocytogenes activity. nine lactic acid bacteria with antilisterial activity were isolated and identified as lactococcus lactis [4], enterococcus faecium [4], and e. faecalis [1]. antibacterial spectra, determined against 45 target strains, led to the selection of four antibacterial-producing strains, which were further characterized. their anti-microbial agents, inactivated by one or more proteases, were designed as bacteriocins. lactococcin r9/2 and r10/1 showed the broadest range of inhibitory action. anti-bacterial spectra and physico-chemical properties suggest that these bacteriocins were similar to nisin. enterocin r69 had a specificity of action against listeria spp., whereas enterocin r18 had a broad spectrum of activity. lc. lactis r9/2 and e. faecalis r18 were able to coagulate sterilised uht milk at 30 degrees c in 24 h and induced a 2 log reduction in l. monocytogenes atcc 15313 population.
simple method to identify bacteriocin induction peptides and to auto-induce bacteriocin production at low cell density.
the production of some bacteriocins by lactic acid bacteria is regulated by induction peptides (ips) that are secreted by a dedicated secretion system. the ip gene cbax, for carnobacteriocin a production by carnobacterium piscicola lv17a, and a presumptive ip gene (orf6), associated with the genetic locus for enterocin b production in enterococcus faecium bfe 900, were fused to the signal peptide of the bacteriocin divergicin a from carnobacterium divergens lv13 to access the general secretory pathway. the culture supernatants of c. piscicola ual26 and lactococcus lactis mg1363 containing either of these constructs were used to induce bacteriocin production by bac(-) cultures of c. piscicola lv17a or e. faecium ctc492. the cbax fusion product induced bacteriocin production by bac(-) c. piscicola lv17a, but the orf6 fusion product did not induce bacteriocin production by e. faecium ctc492. this represents a relatively simple method of confirming the role of presumptive ips. the transformation of c. piscicola lv17a with the cbax gene under expression of the p32 promoter from l. lactis resulted in constitutive production of bacteriocin by either the dedicated transport apparatus or the general secretory pathway.
characterization and heterologous expression of the genes encoding enterocin a production, immunity, and regulation in enterococcus faecium dpc1146.
enterocin a is a small, heat-stable, antilisterial bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium dpc1146. the sequence of a 10, 879-bp chromosomal region containing at least 12 open reading frames (orfs), 7 of which are predicted to play a role in enterocin biosynthesis, is presented. the genes enta, enti, and entf encode the enterocin a prepeptide, the putative immunity protein, and the induction factor prepeptide, respectively. the deduced proteins entk and entr resemble the histidine kinase and response regulator proteins of two-component signal transducing systems of the agrc-agra type. the predicted proteins entt and entd are homologous to abc (atp-binding cassette) transporters and accessory factors, respectively, of several other bacteriocin systems and to proteins implicated in the signal-sequence-independent export of escherichia coli hemolysin a. immediately downstream of the entt and entd genes are two orfs, the product of one of which, orf4, is very similar to the product of the ytei gene of bacillus subtilis and to e. coli protease iv, a signal peptide peptidase known to be involved in outer membrane lipoprotein export. another potential bacteriocin is encoded in the opposite direction to the other genes in the enterocin cluster. this putative bacteriocin-like peptide is similar to lafx, one of the components of the lactacin f complex. a deletion which included one of two direct repeats upstream of the enta gene abolished enterocin a activity, immunity, and ability to induce bacteriocin production. transposon insertion upstream of the entf gene also had the same effect, but this mutant could be complemented by exogenously supplied induction factor. the putative enti peptide was shown to be involved in the immunity to enterocin a. cloning of a 10.5-kb amplicon comprising all predicted orfs and regulatory regions resulted in heterologous production of enterocin a and induction factor in enterococcus faecalis, while a four-gene construct (entaitd) under the control of a constitutive promoter resulted in heterologous enterocin a production in both e. faecalis and lactococcus lactis.
in vitro fructooligosaccharide utilization and inhibition of salmonella spp. by selected bacteria.
in vitro experiments were conducted to determine: 1) inhibitory capacities of potential direct-fed microbial bacteria against salmonella serotypes; and 2) the ability of bifidobacterium bifidum, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus sp., and salmonella spp. to grow in media containing fructooligosaccharides (fos-50 or fos pure formulation) as the only carbohydrate source. thirteen bacteria (two strains of bacillus coagulans, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus subtilis, b. bifidum, e. faecium, two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. casei, pediococcus sp., propionibacterium acidopropionici, p. jensenii, and propionibacterium sp.) were tested for inhibition of six salmonella serotypes (s. california, s. enteritidis, s. heidelberg, s. mission, s. senftenberg, and s. typhimurium) using a spot-the-lawn technique. bifidobacterium bifidum, e. faecium, all lactobacilli, and pediococcus sp. clearly inhibited growth of all salmonella serotypes. in the growth experiments, e. faecium, l. lactis, and pediococcus sp. grew in media with either fos-50 or the pure formulation of fos as the sole carbohydrate source. all tested salmonella serotypes utilized fos-50 for growth; however growth varied among the serotypes. in contrast, none of the salmonella serotypes grew in media containing the pure formulation of fos as the only carbohydrate source.
