TI  == antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from ankober district, north shewa zone, amhara region, ethiopia.
AB  == context: traditional medicinal plants have long been used in ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still  poorly known. objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in ankober district. methods: about 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: plant extracts from embelia schimperi vatke (myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 64 microg/ml against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. pyogenes. growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of ocimum lamiifolium hochst. (lamiaceae) against s. pyogenes, and those of rubus steudneri schweinf. (rosaceae) against s. epidermidis at an mic value of 128 microg/ml. generally, 74% of ethanol extracts  (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial  strains tested at an mic value of 512 microg/ml or below. discussion and conclusions: results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed  strong antimicrobial activities.

TI  == the effect of environmental conditions on expression of bacteroides fragilis and  bacteroides thetaiotaomicron c10 protease genes.
AB  == background: bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron are members of  the normal human intestinal microbiota. however, both organisms are capable of causing opportunistic infections, during which the environmental conditions to which the bacteria are exposed change dramatically. to further explore their potential for contributing to infection, we have characterized the expression in  b. thetaiotaomicron of four homologues of the gene encoding the c10 cysteine protease speb, a potent extracellular virulence factor produced by streptococcus  pyogenes. results: we identified a paralogous set of genes (btp genes) in the b.  thetaiotaomicron genome, that were related to c10 protease genes we recently identified in b. fragilis. similar to c10 proteases found in b. fragilis, three of the b. thetaiotaomicron homologues were transcriptionally coupled to genes encoding small proteins that are similar in structural architecture to staphostatins, protease inhibitors associated with staphopains in staphylococcus  aureus. the expression of genes for these c10 proteases in both b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron was found to be regulated by environmental stimuli, in particular by exposure to oxygen, which may be important for their contribution to the development of opportunistic infections. conclusions: genes encoding c10 proteases are increasingly identified in operons which also contain genes encoding proteins homologous to protease inhibitors. the bacteroides c10 protease gene expression levels are responsive to different environmental stimuli suggesting they may have distinct roles in the bacterial-host interaction.

TI  == recovery of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in sinus fungal ball.
AB  == this case study with chart review describes the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of specimens obtained from 47 patients with aspergillus spp fungus ball. bacteria were recovered from 32 of the 47 (68%) patients. eighty-six isolates, 29 aerobic and facultatives and 57 anaerobic, were recovered. aerobic and facultatives only were recovered in 6 instances (19% of culture-positive specimens), anaerobes only in 11 (34%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes in 15 (47%). the predominant aerobes were staphylococcus aureus (6 isolates), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (5 isolates), enterobacteriacae (4 isolates), and microaerophilic streptococci (4 isolates). the predominant anaerobes were gram-negative bacilli (26), peptostreptococcus spp (14), and fusobacterium spp. (10). twenty-two beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 15 patients. these included all 6 s aureus and 2 bacteroides fragilis group isolates, 4 of 10 of fusobacteria, and 7 of 19 prevotella and porphyromonas. this study demonstrates the recovery of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora in the sinuses of patients with fungus ball.

TI  == the dissemination of c10 cysteine protease genes in bacteroides fragilis by mobile genetic elements.
AB  == background: the c10 family of cysteine proteases includes enzymes that contribute to the virulence of bacterial pathogens, such as speb in streptococcus pyogenes.  the presence of homologues of cysteine protease genes in human commensal organisms has not been examined. bacteroides fragilis is a member of the dominant bacteroidetes phylum of the human intestinal microbiota, and is a significant opportunistic pathogen. results: four homologues of the streptococcal virulence factor speb were identified in the b. fragilis genome. these four protease genes, two were directly contiguous to open reading frames predicted to encode staphostatin-like inhibitors, with which the protease genes were co-transcribed.  two of these protease genes are unique to b. fragilis 638r and are associated with two large genomic insertions. gene annotation indicated that one of these insertions was a conjugative tn-like element and the other was a prophage-like element, which was shown to be capable of excision. homologues of the b. fragilis c10 protease genes were present in a panel of clinical isolates, and in dna extracted from normal human faecal microbiota. conclusions: this study suggests a mechanism for the evolution and dissemination of an important class of protease in major members of the normal human microbiota.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of clove and thyme extracts.
AB  == objective: it has been postulated that geographical locations of the herbs affect the constituents of their essential oils and thus the degree of their antimicrobial action. this study examine two samples of clove obtained from sri lanka and zanzibar and two samples of thyme from iran and oman to determine the antimicrobial potential of their extracted oils. method: the active agents in each plant were extracted by steam distillation and by boiling. the antimicrobial activities of the extracts were determined at neat and by two-fold dilutions in well agar diffusion technique using staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, corynebacterium species, salmonella species, bacteroides fragilis and candida albicans. results: all oil extracts possessed antimicrobial activity against all bacteria and yeast tested.  their water extracts exhibited lower antimicrobial activity, though thyme aqueous extract was active only against s. aureus. the lowest concentration of antimicrobial activity (0.1% i.e., 1:1024) was obtained with thyme oil extract using candida albicans. there was no significant difference in antimicrobial activity between clove obtained from sri lanka or zanzibar or thyme obtained from iran or oman. conclusion: our experiment showed that the country of origin of the herbs has no effect on their antimicrobial activity. however, further work is necessary to ascertain why candida albicans displayed remarkable degree of sensitivity with the extracts than all the other organisms test.

TI  == dna microarray for detection of macrolide resistance genes.
AB  == a dna microarray was developed to detect bacterial genes conferring resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics. a database containing 65 nonredundant genes selected from publicly available dna sequences was constructed and used to design 100 oligonucleotide probes that could specifically detect and discriminate all 65 genes. probes were spotted on a glass slide, and the array was reacted with dna templates extracted from 20 reference strains of eight different bacterial species (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis) known to harbor 29 different macrolide resistance genes. hybridization results showed that probes reacted with, and only with, the expected dna templates and allowed discovery of three unexpected genes, including msr(sa) in b. fragilis, an efflux gene that has not yet been described for gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of micro-organisms recovered from cutaneous lesions of human american tegumentary leishmaniasis in minas gerais, brazil.
AB  == an evaluation of the microbiota present in cutaneous ulcers from 31 patients with a clinical and parasitological diagnosis of american tegumentary leishmaniasis (atl) was carried out by the standard filter paper disc technique, including antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial isolates. microbial examination indicated that 21 patients (67.7%) were contaminated with one to four bacteria and some of them also with yeast. a total of 142 micro-organisms were isolated. staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently recovered bacterium (95.2% of positive patients) and was found to produce type b (70% of the staphylococcal isolates) and type c (50%) enterotoxins as well as toxic shock syndrome toxin (60%). proteus mirabilis (33.3% of the positive patients), streptococcus pyogenes (19.0 %), h(2)s-negative proteus species (19.0%), klebsiella oxytoca (14.3%), enterobacter species (9.5%), peptostreptococcus species (9.5%), pseudomonas species (4.8%), prevotella bivia (4.8%), escherichia coli (4.8%), streptococcus agalactiae (4.8%), bacteroides fragilis (4.8%), candida albicans (9.5%) and candida tropicalis (4.8%) were also isolated. surprisingly, staph. aureus isolates were susceptible to almost all tested drugs, although some of them were  resistant to penicillin (69%) and ampicillin + sulbactam (68%). concerning obligate anaerobes, all the gram-negative isolates (25% of the total) were resistant to metronidazole. the results of the present study show that microbial  secondary contaminants, particularly staph. aureus, should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of atl lesions.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against isolates from patients enrolled in phase 3 clinical trials of treatment for complicated skin and skin-structure infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections.
AB  == the in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 4913 baseline pathogens isolated from 1986 patients enrolled in 4 pivotal phase 3 clinical trials. the trials, which were conducted in 38 countries worldwide, involved patients with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections. tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens for each infection type, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (mics, < or =2 microg/ml for most  pathogens). the spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant s. aureus), streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacteroides  fragilis. a few genera, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the tribe proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline than were other gram-negative pathogens. the susceptibility of the pathogens to tigecycline was similar for isolates obtained from patients enrolled in the studies of complicated skin and skin-structure infection or of complicated intra-abdominal infection. for most pathogens, the susceptibility to tigecycline was similar across all geographic regions. the excellent expanded broad-spectrum activity of  tigecycline demonstrated in vitro against clinical isolates confirmed its potential utility for pathogens associated with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == pharmacodynamic properties of hmr 3004, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  == objective: the pharmacodynamic properties of the novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide) antibiotic, hmr 3004, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect. methods: the time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and bacteroides fragilis. the postantibiotic effects of hmr 3004 were also investigated on these organisms  at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x mic. results: the time kill-kinetic data demonstrated that hmr 3004 is inoculum dependent and predominantly bacteriostatic being only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. hmr 3004  exhibited a significant postantibiotic effect with all strains studied, ranging from 1.9--6.2 h at 10 x mic. conclusions: the bacteriostatic activity and significant postantibiotic effect demonstrated by hmr 3004 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.

TI  == in vitro activities of ertapenem (mk-0826) against recent clinical bacteria collected in europe and australia.
AB  == ertapenem (mk-0826, l-749,345) is a 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long serum half-life. its in vitro activity was determined by broth microdilution against 3,478 bacteria from 12 centers in europe and australia, with imipenem, cefepime,  ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam used as comparators. ertapenem was the most active agent tested against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)s) of < or =1 microg/ml for all species. ertapenem also was more active than imipenem against fastidious gram-negative bacteria and moraxella spp.; on the other hand, ertapenem was slightly less active than imipenem against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci, and anaerobes, but its mic(90)s for these groups remained < or =0.5 microg/ml. acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also much less susceptible to ertapenem than imipenem, and most enterococcus faecalis strains were resistant. ertapenem resistance, based on a provisional nccls mic breakpoint of > or =16 microg/ml, was seen in only 3 of 1,611 strains of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, all of them enterobacter aerogenes. resistance was also seen in 2 of 135 anaerobes, comprising 1 bacteroides fragilis strain and 1 clostridium difficile strain. ertapenem breakpoints for streptococci have not been established, but an unofficial susceptibility breakpoint of < or =2 microg/ml was adopted for clinical trials to generate corresponding clinical response data for isolates for which mics were as high as 2 microg/ml. of 234 streptococcus pneumoniae strains tested, 2 required ertapenem mics of 2 microg/ml and one required an mic of 4 microg/ml, among 67 non-streptococcus pyogenes, non-streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci, single isolates required ertapenem mics of 2 and 16 microg/ml. these streptococci also had diminished susceptibilities to other beta-lactams, including imipenem as well as ertapenem.  the etest and disk diffusion gave susceptibility test results in good agreement with those of the broth microdilution method for ertapenem.

TI  == [cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis: microbiology and pathogenesis].
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes is a common cause of necrotizing cutaneous infections in otherwise healthy children and adults. several surface components are involved in the processes of adherence and invasiveness, such as protein m and capsulae. streptolysin o and other bacterial products, such as pyrogenic exotoxins, are involved in tissue injury and necrosis. toxins a and c act as superantigens and are expressed by strains associated with the toxic shock syndrome. staphylococcus aureus, alone or in association with streptococci, is also commonly isolated form all body sites, but bacteremia is inconstant. capsule, protein a, and the staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin are the major pathogenicity factors. in infections of the face and the neck, the predominant anaerobes recovered in association with group a streptococci are peptostreptococcus magnus, oral prevotella, porphyromonas spp., and fusobacterium spp. bacteroides fragilis, clostridium, enterobacteria, and enterococci are recovered in infections located  next to the perineal area. penicillin is the drug of choice for the treatment of  streptococcal infections. however benzylpenicillin may be not sufficient for severe infections and large inoculum, therefore the administration of clindamycin or another inhibitor of protein synthesis is recommended. since the infection may be polymicrobial, the initial therapy should include treatment for staphylococci  and anaerobes. in some cases broad- spectrum antibiotics also, effective on enterobacteria, are needed. the efficacy of appropriate parenteral antibiotics, however, depends on the prompt and aggressive exploration and debridement of suspected deep-seated infection, and supportive care of shock and multiple organ  failure.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == we investigated activity of piperacillin (pipc) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. the following results were obtained: 1. pipc had  its mic90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in gram-positive bacteria (methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis) and showed its mic of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible prsp strains out of 38 isolates of s. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. pipc showed favorable antibacterial activities as its mic90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae), except for p. mirabilis in which its mic90  was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of p. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as pipc, abpc, ctm and czop. 3. pipc had its mic90  of > 128 micrograms/ml in bacteroides fragilis. from these results, pipc was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when  20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.

TI  == in vitro activities of macrolides against gram-positive aerobes, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and bacteroides fragilis in taiwan.
AB  == background: new macrolides with improved pharmacokinetic characteristics have been developed and introduced for clinical use in taiwan. in order to understand  the antibacterial activities of these new macrolides, we tested their in vitro activities against common pathogenic bacteria. methods: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of azithromycin, clarithromycin, dirithromycin, erythromycin and roxithromycin for clinical isolates collected from six teaching  hospitals in taiwan were determined by the agar dilution method. the tested bacteria included methicillin-sensitive and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, viridans streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus spp, corynebacterium spp, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and bacteroides fragilis. results: high mics were detected against most of the bacteria tested except for h influenzae and m catarrhalis. the mic90  for viridans streptococci, s pneumoniae, s pyogenes, enterococcus spp, s aureus (both methicillin-sensitive and -resistant), coagulase-negative staphylococci (both methicillin-sensitive and -resistant), coryne-bacterium spp, and b fragilis were all at least 128 micrograms/ml. wide ranges of mics were demonstrated. conclusions: most bacteria tested were highly resistant to macrolides. this result is a warning for clinicians that rational use of antibiotics, including macrolides, is mandatory.

TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in taiwan. meropenem was active against most gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis. for many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. it is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. it is uncommon for these common bacteria, except mrsa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to  other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infection after trauma.
AB  == clinical and laboratory data from 1973 to 1988 were retrospectively reviewed to study the microbiology of infection following trauma. a total of 368 specimens obtained from 340 trauma patients showed bacterial growth. the traumas included lacerations (163), blunt trauma (76), penetrating trauma (65), bites (20), and open fractures (10). anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 119 (32%) specimens, aerobic bacteria only in 58 (16%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 191 (52%). a total of 444 anaerobic (1.2 isolates per specimen) and 267 aerobic or facultative (0.7 per specimen) were recovered. the predominant anaerobic bacteria included bacteroides fragilis group (119 isolates), peptostreptococcus spp (113), clostridium spp (78), prevotella spp (58), and fusobacterium spp (23). the predominant aerobic bacteria included escherichia coli (83), staphylococcus aureus (61), streptococcus pyogenes (27), streptococcus group d (16), and klebsiella pneumoniae (16). the types of infections included abscesses (109), bacteremia (32), bites (13), empyema (10), osteomyelitis (21), peritonitis (52), thrombophlebitis (12), and wounds (116, including posttraumatic wounds, cellulitis, stump wound, decubitus ulcers, myositis, and fasciitis). s. aureus was isolated at all sites. however, organisms of the oropharyngeal flora predominated in infections that originated from that location (ie, head and neck  wounds, and abscesses or bites), and those of the gastrointestinal flora predominated in infections that originated from that site (ie, peritonitis, abdominal abscesses, decubitus ulcers). this study showed the polymicrobial nature of many infections that follow trauma.

TI  == differential induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in whole blood by  bacteria: effects of antibiotic treatment.
AB  == the in vitro production of interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), il-6, and the il-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra) in whole blood upon stimulation with different bacterial strains was measured to study the possible relationship between disease severity and the cytokine-inducing capacities of these strains. escherichia coli, neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, bacteroides fragilis, capnocytophaga canimorsus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes induced the cytokines il-1beta, il-6, and il-1ra. gram-negative bacteria induced significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokine production than gram-positive bacteria. these  differences were less pronounced for the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-1ra. in addition, blood was stimulated with e. coli killed by different antibiotics to study the effect of the antibiotics on the cytokine-inducing capacity of the bacterial culture. e. coli treated with cefuroxime and gentamicin induced higher  levels of il-1beta and il-6 production but levels of il-1ra production similar to that of heat-killed e. coli. in contrast, ciprofloxacin- and imipenem-cilastatin-mediated killing showed a decreased or similar level of induction of cytokine production as compared to that by heat-killed e. coli; polymyxin b decreased the level of production of the cytokines.

TI  == in vitro activity of bay 12-8039, a new 8-methoxyquinolone.
AB  == bay 12-8039 is a new 8-methoxyquinolone with antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria which is significantly better than those of sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.062 and 2 mg/l, respectively. the mic90s for ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant s. aureus were 8 mg/l. against  the staphylococcal strains tested sparfloxacin was 2-fold and ciprofloxacin > or  = 10-fold less active. mic90s for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae were 0.125-0.5 mg/l, irrespective of whether strains with diminished ciprofloxacin susceptibility or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains were tested. against the streptococci sparfloxacin was 2- to 4-fold less active. against gram-negative bacteria bay 12-8039 is almost as active as ciprofloxacin, except for pseudomonas aeruginosa.  against bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides spp. and clostridium spp. bay 12-8039 was as active as metronidazole. the bactericidal activity against s. aureus and s. pneumoniae was in contrast to that of the other quinolones tested, penicillin  g, amoxicillin+/-clavulanate, cefuroxime and clarithromycin, concentration-dependent. as compared to ciprofloxacin, development of resistance  was less pronounced. the spontaneous mutation frequency towards bay 12-8039 resistance was 2.8 x 10(-8) in escherichia coli, 7.06 x 10(-8) in s. aureus and < 1.4 x 10(-9) in s. pneumoniae.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (cdzm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cdzm and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in  our laboratory from september to december of 1992 and from september to december  of 1995. the results are summarized as follows: 1. bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cdzm included streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the  range of mic values of cdzm against klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. other strains, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., peptostreptococcus spp.  and bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including cdzm. 2. the mic90's of cdzm were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against streptococcus  spp., h. influenzae, m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently  found in daily treatment of infections. it appears that the effectiveness of cdzm was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. among h. influenzae isolates included imipenem (ipm)-resistant and norfloxacin (nflx)-resistant strains. the mic-range of cdzm against strains collected in 1995 including ipm-resistant and nflx-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and mic90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. cdzm showed strong antimicrobial activities against h. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of necrotizing fasciitis in children.
AB  == specimens obtained from eight children with necrotizing fasciitis (nf) were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. a total of 21 isolates were recovered, 13 anaerobic and 8 aerobic or facultatives. the facultative organism streptococcus pyogenes was present alone in two (25%) instances, and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated in six (75%). the predominant isolates were peptostreptococcus spp. (6 isolates, including 3 peptostreptococcus magnus). s. pyogenes (4), bacteroides fragilis group (3), clostridium perfringens (2), escherichia coli (2), and prevotella spp. (2). organisms similar to the ones isolated from the nf aspirates were recovered in the blood of all patients except one. these included s. pyogenes (3 isolates). b. fragilis group (2), e. coli (1), and p. magnus (1) and clostridium perfringens (1). all patients underwent surgical fasciotomy, and four required skin grafting. antimicrobials were administered to all children. despite extensive resection and intense supportive  therapy, three patients died from sepsis accompanied by shock acidosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. these findings illustrate the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of nf in children.

TI  == in vitro activities of u-100592 and u-100766, novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agents.
AB  == oxazolidinones make up a relatively new class of antimicrobial agents which possess a unique mechanism of bacterial protein synthesis inhibition. u-100592 (s)-n-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-[4-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-piperazinyl]- phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide and u-100766 (s)-n-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]- 2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide are novel oxazolidinone analogs from a directed chemical modification program. mics were determined for a variety of bacterial clinical isolates; the respective mics of u-100592 and u-100766 at which 90% of isolates are inhibited were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant s. aureus, 4  and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 and 2  micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; enterococcus faecium, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; streptococcus pyogenes, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.50 and 1 microgram/ml; corynebacterium spp., 0.50 and 0.50 micrograms/ml; moraxella catarrhalis, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; listeria monocytogenes, 8 and 2 micrograms/ml; and bacteroides fragilis, 16 and 4 micrograms/ml. most strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis and the gram-positive anaerobes were inhibited in the range of 0.50 to 2 micrograms/ml. enterococcal strains resistant to vancomycin (vana, vanb, and vanc resistance phenotypes), pneumococcal strains resistant to penicillin, and m. tuberculosis strains resistant to common antitubercular agents (isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampin, ethionamide, and ethambutol) were not cross-resistant to the oxazolidinones. the  presence of 10, 20, and 40% pooled human serum did not affect the antibacterial activities of the oxazolidinones. time-kill studies demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect of the analogs against staphylococci and enterococci but a bactericidal effect against streptococci. the spontaneous mutation frequencies of s. aureus atcc 29213 were <3.8 x 10(-10) and <8 x 10(-11) for u-100592 and u-100766, respectively. serial transfer of three staphylococcal and two enterococcal strains on drug gradient plates produced no evidence of rapid resistance development. thus, these new oxazolidinone analogs demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activities against a variety of clinically important human pathogens.

TI  == [in vitro and in vivo activities of sulopenem compared with those of imipenem and cephalosporins].
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem (cp-70,429),a new  parenteral penem antibiotic, were compared with those of imipenem (ipm), flomoxef, cefuzonam (czon) and cefotaxime. sulopenem possessed broad-spectrum activities against gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria. antibacterial activities of sulopenem against methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were equivalent to or somewhat superior to those of ipm. against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, sulopenem was 4- to 260-fold more active than reference antibiotics with broad-spectra. in a killing kinetics study for haemophilus influenzae, sulopenem showed a 99.9% decrease of viable cells after 8 hours at a  concentration of 0.20 micrograms/ml. this effect was obtained at a concentration  8-fold lower than that of ipm. the protective effects of sulopenem in murine experimental systemic infections were superior to those of imipenem/cilastatin. in murine experimental mixed infection with escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis, sulopenem had lower ed50, in other words stronger antimicrobial activities than ipm. the therapeutic effect of sulopenem are related well with its mic value. in guinea pigs experimental lung infection with klebsiella pneumoniae, sulopenem was more effective than czon or cefotiam.

TI  == bactericidal activity, morphological alterations, and synergistic interactions of rufloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, alone and in combination with its n-desmethylate d derivative (mf 922).
AB  == the in vitro activity of rufloxacin, alone and in combination with its metabolite (mf 922) against common respiratory and urinary tract pathogens and anaerobes was assessed. no synergistic interaction between rufloxacin and mf 922 was observed by the checkerboard technique against aerobic bacteria. when the time-kill system was employed, 24 synergistic interactions were noted out of 30 tests performed (80%), of which 14 (100%) were with enterobacteriaceae isolates, 2 with moraxella catarrhalis (50%), 4 with haemophilus influenzae (100%), 2 with staphylococcus aureus (50%) and 2 with streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes (50%). synergism was found with all bacteroides fragilis irrespectively of the method used. rufloxacin alone or in combination with mf 922, at concentrations achieved in vivo, induced morphological alterations in all the pathogens analyzed with the exception of m. catarrhalis and h. influenzae. towards s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae, the same levels of rufloxacin and mf 922 were capable of inducing  only bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal effect, followed by reversible morphological modifications. the presence of 50% human serum in the test media did not affect the results.

TI  == susceptibilities of bovine summer mastitis bacteria to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the susceptibility to 9 antimicrobial agents of 32 aerobic bacterial isolates and to 10 antimicrobial agents of 37 anaerobic bacterial isolates from 23 cases of bovine summer mastitis (16 actinomyces pyogenes isolates, 8 streptococcus dysgalactiae isolates, 3 s. uberis isolates, 3 s. acidominimus isolates, 2 streptococcus spp., 15 peptostreptococcus indolicus isolates, 10 fusobacterium necrophorum isolates, and 12 isolates of anaerobic gram-negative rods) was determined by the agar dilution method. all isolates except one bacteroides fragilis isolate (beta-lactamase producer) were susceptible to penicillin g, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and chloramphenicol (the b. fragilis strain was susceptible to the last four), which had mics at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic90s) of < or = 0.06, < or = 0.06, < or = 0.06 0.25, < or = 0.06, and 4.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. spiramycin was active against the gram-positive aerobes (mic90, 1.0 microgram/ml) but not against the anaerobes (mic90, 16.0 micrograms/ml). similar trends were noted for  susceptibilities of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to ofloxacin (mic90s, 2.0 and  8 micrograms/ml, respectively). occasional strains of aerobic streptococci were resistant to oxytetracycline, but all anaerobes were susceptible. tinidazole was  active against all anaerobes (mic90, 2.0 micrograms/ml). beta-lactamase was produced only by the b. fragilis isolate.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == the features and aetiology of fournier's gangrene.
AB  == this paper reports a clinical study of 20 cases of gangrenous ulcers of the scrotum and/or of the penis (fournier's gangrene) and a review of previous publications. even though found mostly in elderly male patients, the disease spares no age group and can involve the external genitalia in neonates and women  as well. the disease is a necrotising fasciitis of infective origin and always has a portal of entry of the infecting organisms even though it may be so trivial as to be undetected. the commonest portals of entry of infection are periurethral sepsis, groin wound sepsis, anorectal sepsis, prostatic sepsis and trauma. the infecting organisms comprise both aerobic and anaerobic organisms such as escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, proteus mirabilis, enterococci, bacteroides fragilis and anaerobic streptococcus. fournier's gangrene is probably the same disease as necrotizing fasciitis occurring in other parts of the body, but modified by the peculiar anatomy of the genitoperineum.

TI  == in vitro activity of cp-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cp-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. cp-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin g and erythromycin (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against s. pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). the activity of cp-99,219 against enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, c.  diversus, helicobacter pylori, and k. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with mic90 values to cp-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for cp-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. cp-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x mic against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broths. the spectrum and potency observed with cp-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.

AB  == the presence of anaerobic bacteria, especially of bacteroides (b.) fragilis, in abdominal abscesses, infected decubitus ulcera, and the infected foot of diabetic patients is well documented. the importance, however, of these microorganisms in  the pathogenesis of deep tissue infections has still to be evaluated. therefore,  the aim of this study was to evaluate the potency of b. fragilis as compared to aerobic bacteria widely known for causing inflammation, in inducing the release of prostaglandin e2 from polymorphonuclear granulocytes. prostaglandin e2 is a potent vasodilator and contributes to edema and erythema, which are part of the inflammatory response. furthermore, the camp-content of the neutrophils was determined after stimulation of the cells with the various bacteria. of the bacterial species tested, b. fragilis proved to be one of the most potent triggers for prostaglandin e2 release from neutrophils indicating a possible major role of this microorganism in the pathogenesis of mixed infections.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of rokitamycin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == we obtained bacterial strains which were clinically isolated and identified from  outpatients with various infections in medical institutions throughout japan. possible antibacterial activities of rokitamycin (rkm) were examined against these isolates. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined through  a comparative study with reference drugs. the results of the study are summarized as follows. 1. resistance patterns of 400 isolates which were highly resistant to macrolides (mls) with mic values > 100 micrograms/ml were classified into 55 patterns. staphylococcus spp. showed cross resistance to 14-membered ring mls with 100% cross resistance observed between erythromycin (em) and clarithromycin  (cam), and 85.2% between em and oleandomycin (ol). fewer isolates showed strong resistance to 16-membered ring mls than to 14-membered ring mls. cross resistances observed among the staphylococcus isolates were 100% between acetylmidecamycin (mdm-ac) and kitasamycin (leucomycin (lm)), 93.9% between mdm-ac and josamycin (jm), and 53.3% between mdm-ac and rkm. streptococcus spp. and peptococcus spp. showed very similar resistance patterns to both 14- and 16-membered ring mls, but resistance patterns to rkm were quite different. most of anaerobic streptococci and bacteroides fragilis group had similar resistance patterns to 14- and 16-membered ring mls, but in some cases a pattern similar to  that of staphylococcus spp. was observed. 2. when ml-resistant bacteria isolated  during 1975 to 1980 were compared to those isolated in 1986 and 1989, it was observed that resistance of staphylococcus aureus remained almost unchanged, that of streptococcus pyogenes was lower in the later years than during 1975 to 1980,  but that of streptococcus pneumoniae increased. 3. most of ml-resistances of the  resistant isolates were inducible, but extents of induction varied depending on drugs tested. strong inductions were observed when 14-membered ring mls were used, but inductions were minimal with 16-membered ring mls. rkm appeared to induce resistance to the least extent. from these results, it appears that the rkm is quite useful clinically even in the 1990s.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of ceftriaxone against clinically isolated strains].
AB  == antibiotic activities (mics) of ceftriaxone (ctrx) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of  other cephems. 1. when compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated mic90s of ctrx: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. no changes were observed in mic90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the mic90 of ctrx to s. pneumoniae was high because a  large number of benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) was present among this species. the mic80 to bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. other oxime-type cephems also had high mics against the above mentioned bacteria. therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as ctrx against pisp and b. fragilis group. 3. sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), cephamycin-resistant  as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. some of there resistant bacteria  are also ctrx-resistant, and ctrx had insufficient activities against them. 4. with regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with ctrx-resistance from year to year,  the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989  and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. it appears that those strains resistant to cephems including ctrx are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. ctrx, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. furthermore, considering that ctrx is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that ctrx is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.

TI  == antibiotics and expression of microbial virulence factors: implications for host  defense.
AB  == the discovery that antibiotics are capable of modifying both the structural appearance and physiology of pathogenic bacteria when they are incorporated in the culture medium at sub-growth inhibitory concentrations, has led to numerous examples in which the expression of one or more virulence factors (both structural and soluble) is inhibited or potentiated--some of these bacterial products are recognized in their own right as substances which can interfere with one or more stages of the normal process of phagocytosis viz, chemotaxis and staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin; opsonization and m protein of streptococcus pyogenes; phagocytic ingestion and capsule of bacteroides fragilis; phagocytic killing and streptolysin o of streptococcus pyogenes. exposure to these bacteria  to low concentrations of various chemotherapeutic drugs can alter the efficacy of the phagocytic process. however, many examples exist in which no specific biochemical lesion induced by exposure to the antibiotic has been recognized. by  way of contrast some recent experimental studies using genetically defined variants of s. aureus expressing protein a, alpha-toxin, beta-toxin or coagulase  have allowed some discrimination as to the specifity of the drug action and the relative role of each virulence factor in bacterial pathogenicity. in particular  it can be recognized that the presence or absence of protein a either through drug treatment (clindamycin or fusidic acid) or through gene delation is critical in determining bacterial susceptibility to opson-ophagocytosis. extension of these studies to in vivo models will shed light on possible antibiotic-host defence interaction during chemotherapy.

TI  == the effect of antimicrobial therapy on mixed infections with bacteroides species. is eradication of the anaerobes important?
AB  == antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations in order to explore their effect on mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. subcutaneous abscesses were induced in mice by single and mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the infected animals were treated for 5 days with spiramycin, gentamicin or metronidazole alone, or metronidazole combined with spiramycin or gentamicin. animals were killed 5 days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses determined. infection induced by a single species of bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. in infections caused by two species of organisms, however, therapy directed at either the bacteroides sp. (with metronidazole) or the aerobes or facultative anaerobes (with spiramycin or  gentamicin) was effective not only in significantly reducing the numbers of the target organism but also, in 13 of 24 instances, in reducing to a small extent the numbers of the other bacteria. despite this phenomenon, in no instance did therapy with a single agent eliminate the infection and eradicate the untargeted  organism. the combination of spiramycin and metronidazole increased the reduction in numbers of b. melaninogenicus in single-organism infections and of bacteroides sp. in mixed infections with s. aureus and s. pyogenes. these findings support the need to aim treatment at all components of mixed infections.

TI  == biological characterization of a new radioactive labeling reagent for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == radiolabeled penicillin g is widely used as the imaging agent in penicillin-binding protein (pbp) assays. the disadvantages of most forms of labeled penicillin g are instability on storage and the long exposure times usually required for autoradiography or fluorography of electrophoretic gels. we  investigated the utility of radioiodinated penicillin v as an alternative reagent. radioiodination of p-(trimethylstannyl)penicillin v with [125i]na, using a modification of the chloramine-t method, is simple, high yielding, and site specific. we demonstrated the general equivalence of commercially obtained [3h]penicillin g and locally synthesized [125i]penicillin v (ipv) in their recognition of bacterial pbps. profiles of pbps in membranes from bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, providencia rettgeri, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium labeled with ipv or [3h]penicillin g were virtually identical. use of ipv as the imaging  agent in competition experiments for determination of the affinities of various beta-lactam antibiotics for the pbps of e. coli yielded results similar to those  obtained in experiments with [3h]penicillin g. dried electrophoretic gels from typical pbp experiments, using ipv at 37.3 ci/mmol and 30 micrograms/ml, exposed  x-ray film in 8 to 24 h. the stability of ipv on storage at 4 degrees c was inversely proportional to specific activity. at 37.3 ci/mmol and 60 micrograms/ml, ipv retained useful activity for at least 60 days at 4 degrees c.  ipv represents a practical and stable reagent for rapid pbp assays.

TI  == intravenous sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  == a total of 82 patients involving 83 episodes of proven or presumed bacterial infection were treated with sulbactam/ampicillin. these included 36 cases of soft tissue infection or abscess, four cases of joint or bone infection, 20 cases of respiratory tract infection (17 cases of pneumonia, two of otitis media, and one  of tonsillitis), 15 urinary tract infections, three cases of enterocolitis, one case of infective endocarditis, two cases of septicemia, and two of peritonitis.  the causative pathogen was isolated in 48 cases (49 infections). these pathogens  included staphylococcus aureus 13 cases, staphylococcus epidermidis one, streptococcus pyogenes two, streptococcus pneumoniae two, viridans group streptococcus two, peptostreptococcus one, haemophilus influenzae one, escherichia coli 12, enterobacter cloacae three, proteus mirabilis one, acinetobacter calcoaceticus one, salmonella spp. two, shigella sonnei one, bacteroides fragilis one, and polymicrobial infections of various combinations in five cases. no bacterial pathogens were isolated in 34 infections, 14 cases of pneumonia and 15 soft tissue infections. sulbactam/ampicillin was given by intravenous bolus in a dosage range of 75-450 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for variable periods of time depending on the type and severity of the infection. of  a total of 83 episodes of infections, 80 (96.4%) cases were either cured or improved. bacteriologic eradication also occurred in 46 (93.9%) of 49 infections. side effects were diarrhea in two patients, acute hemolytic anemia in one patient, and transient elevations in sgot and leukopenia in one patient. side effects disappeared upon completion of treatment. sulbactam/ampicillin is a safe  and effective antibiotic for the treatment of common pediatric infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of s-ofloxacin.
AB  == s-ofloxacin, the optically active form of ofloxacin, was twice as active as the s,r mixture of ofloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and gram-positive species. of the enterobacteriaceae, 90% were inhibited by less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml and 90% of staphylococcus  aureus and streptococcus pyogenes isolates were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. bacteroides fragilis was inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml. organisms resistant to ofloxacin were resistant to s-ofloxacin. like ofloxacin activity, the activity of s-ofloxacin was reduced by mg2+ and by acid ph. spontaneous mutational resistance to s-ofloxacin was similar to that to ofloxacin.

TI  == enhancement of the infectivity of fusobacterium necrophorum by other bacteria.
AB  == necrobacillosis is caused by fusobacterium necrophorum (fn), but other organisms  are often present in the lesions. their possible role was studied in experiments  made with a virulent fn strain which, by itself, produced fatal necrobacillosis in mice provided that large doses (greater than 10(6) organisms, subcutaneously)  were given. mice were inoculated subcutaneously with fn suspended in sub-lethal doses (0.1 ml) of undiluted or diluted broth cultures of other bacteria. undiluted culture of a strain of escherichia coli reduced the infective dose of fn to less than 10 organisms; in the necrobacillosis lesions that developed, fusobacteria greatly outnumbered e. coli. a heat-killed preparation or sterile filtrate of e. coli culture had little if any effect on fn. citrobacter freundii  and comparatively small numbers of corynebacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes produced effects similar to that of e. coli. an alpha-haemolytic streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis and fusobacterium nucleatum also enhanced the infectivity of fn, though less strikingly than e. coli. fn increased the persistence in vivo of the alpha-haemolytic streptococcus and b. fragilis, and enabled the latter to multiply profusely.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == activity of fce 22891 compared with cefuroxime axetil and cefixime in pulmonary and subcutaneous infections in mice.
AB  == the therapeutic activity of fce 22891 was compared with that of two new oral cephalosporins, cefuroxime axetil and cefixime against streptococcus pneumoniae respiratory infection and subcutaneous abscesses induced by mixed aerobes and anaerobes in mice. in experimental pneumonia fce 22891 was the most active antibiotic. in aerobic abscesses fce 22891 proved the most active agent in infections induced by methicillin susceptible and resistant staphylococcus aureus while all three compounds were very active, against str. pyogenes. in abscesses caused by gram-negative bacteria, fce 22891 showed good and constant efficacy. cefixime was the most active drug against the two susceptible strains of escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae and also against resistant esch. coli but was inactive against a strain of ent. cloacae that produced cephalosporinase. cefuroxime axetil was less active than the other two drugs against gram-negative  bacteria with adequate efficacy only against a susceptible strain of ent. cloacae. fce 22891 was more effective than cefixime and cefuroxime axetil in preventing and reducing the size of abscesses induced by bacteroides fragilis 101. we conclude that fce 22891, despite its short half life of 6 min in mice, exerts comparable and sometimes better activity than the two oral cephalosporins  characterized by longer half lives.

TI  == pathogenicity of capsulate and non-capsulate members of bacteroides fragilis and  b. melaninogenicus groups in mixed infection with escherichia coli and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the relationships between capsulate and non-capsulate bacteroides fragilis strains and escherichia coli, and between capsulate and non-capsulate strains of  the b. melaninogenicus group and streptococcus pyogenes, were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. selective antimicrobial agents directed against either aerobic or anaerobic bacteria were used alone or in combination to explore the effect of eradication of one component of the mixed infection. single agent therapy effective against both aerobic and anaerobic flora was also employed. single therapy of mixed infection directed at the elimination of only one organism (s. pyogenes, e. coli or bacteroides sp.) caused significant reductions in the numbers of sensitive organisms and also smaller yet significant decreases in the numbers of insensitive organisms. however, the abscesses were not eliminated after such therapy. combination therapy or use of a single agent (cefoxitin) directed against the aerobic and anaerobic components of the infection was more effective. non-capsulate bacteroides spp. became capsulate after passage in mice mixed with either s. pyogenes or e. coli. therapy directed  at the elimination of s. pyogenes and e. coli did not prevent the emergence of capsulate bacteroides spp. these data demonstrate the synergy between all members of the b. fragilis group and e. coli and between the b. melaninogenicus group and s. pyogenes, and reiterate the need to direct antimicrobial therapy at the eradication of the aerobic and anaerobic components of mixed infections.

TI  == use of antibiotics in the management of postirradiation wound infection and sepsis.
AB  == ionizing gamma irradiation depresses the host defenses and enhances the susceptibility of the immunocompromised host to local and systemic infection due  to endogenous or exogenous microorganisms. trauma and wounding act synergistically and decrease the survival after exposure to irradiation. the current antimicrobial agents suitable for controlling serious infections and their use in post irradiation local and systemic infection with and without trauma are discussed. the experience gained in managing immunocompromised patients following chemotherapy is reviewed. empiric single agent or combination  agent therapy should be directed at the eradication of potential gram-negative as well as gram-positive pathogens. the most important organisms known to cause these infections are pseudomonas sp. and enterobacteriaceae. management of intra-abdominal infections following trauma should include early surgical correlation and antimicrobials directed against the bacteroides fragilis group and enterobacteriaceae. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes cause most skin and soft tissue infections following trauma. chemoprophylaxis of enteric sources of systemic infection can be achieved by antimicrobials that selectively inhibit the enterobacteriaceae sp. and preserve the anaerobic flora.  the management of infection in the injured and irradiated host includes supportive and restorative therapy. supportive therapy includes debridement and cleansing of wounds, fluids, immunoglobulin, and antimicrobials. restorative therapy includes definite surgery repair and replenishment of the immune system by use of immunomodulators, growth factors, and bone marrow transplantation. further studies are needed to examine the usefulness of presently available drugs and experimental agents in the irradiated and traumatized host.

TI  == synergy between spiramycin and metronidazole in the treatment of polymicrobial infections.
AB  == the in-vitro and in-vivo activity of metronidazole and spiramycin, singly or in combination, was tested in the eradication of infection caused by bacteroides spp. alone and in combination with neisseria gonorrhoea, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes or str. faecalis. the in-vitro tests consisted of determinations of the mics with or without the addition of a constant amount of the other antimicrobials. the mics of metronidazole for b. melaninogenicus, b. fragilis and b. bivius were significantly reduced by the addition of 0.125 mg/l spiramycin. the in-vivo tests were carried out in mice and consisted of measurements of the effects of the antimicrobial agents on the bacterial contents of abscesses induced by subcutaneous injection of bacterial suspension. combined  therapy of mixed infections showed further significant reduction of the numbers of bacteroides spp. in seven of 12 combinations and of the aerobic and facultative bacteria in four of 12 combinations. furthermore, a reduction in the  number of facultative anaerobes was noted in mixed infections with bacteroides spp. which were treated with metronidazole alone. the synergy in vitro and in vivo between metronidazole and spiramycin may have important clinical implications in the treatment of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infections.

TI  == changes in expression of bacterial surface antigens induced by antibiotics and their influence on host defenses.
AB  == concomitant with the discovery that a number of antibiotics were able to induce profound morphological changes (increased septation, thickened walls, filamentation) at low concentrations their ability to inhibit bacterial protein/polysaccharide synthesis was determined. in particular toxin and extracellular enzyme biosynthesis could be repressed by the lincosamines, fusidic acid, erythromycin and streptomycin in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. several of these exoproducts act as antigens associated with microbial virulence  and are therefore of importance in pathogenicity. likewise structural components  such as fimbriae in escherichia coli, m protein in streptococcus pyogenes, protein a in staphylococcus aureus and capsule in bacteroides fragilis and haemophilus influenzae were not synthesised when the producer bacteria were grown in low concentrations of antibiotic. these products, through their importance as  impedins of opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by white blood cells, are important determinants in the host-parasite relationship. by their loss during drug exposure, potentiation of opsonophagocytosis occurred leading to more rapid  killing of the pathogen. the immunogenicity of the antibiotic-damaged bacteria was also changed under these circumstances.

AB  == antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations to explore the effect of  prophylactic antimicrobial therapy. subcutaneous abscesses in mice were induced by single and mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococci and escherichia coli. the infected mice were treated with three doses of gentamicin, cefoxitin, metronidazole or clindamycin alone or else  metronidazole or clindamycin in combination with gentamicin. mice were sacrificed five days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses were determined. infection induced by a single bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. however, in infections caused by two organisms, therapy directed at either the bacteroides fragilis (with metronidazole or clindamycin) or escherichia coli (with gentamicin) was effective in not only significantly reducing the colony forming units (cfu) of the target organism but also reducing the number of untreated bacteria. clindamycin alone was effective in reducing the cfu of both components of mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis with either staphylococcus aureus or group a streptococci. cefoxitin alone and the combination of either clindamycin or metronidazole with gentamicin were effective against all mixed infections. these data support the need to provide coverage for all components of mixed infections with single or combination therapy.

TI  == evolution and epidemiology of mls resistance.
AB  == within the framework of this symposium, it is not feasible to present an exhaustive description of the present state of knowledge regarding the sensitivity and resistance of bacterial species to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins (mls). this paper is limited to a description of the evolution of  different types of resistance in the light of decisive factors described in previous papers, in order to deduce, if at all possible, trends in future strategy in therapeutics. only acquired resistance lends itself to epidemiological study, in contrast to natural resistance which is, by definition, characteristic of a species or a genus, and not liable to change. three groups will therefore be studied in turn: staphylococcus aureus, streptococci and bacteroides fragilis. there is as yet insufficient accumulated data to draw conclusions regarding the epidemiology and evolution of mlsb resistance observed  in clostridium perfringens and corynebacterium diphtheriae, or regarding the high-level resistance to erythromycin due to enzymatic inactivation recently described in escherichia coli.

AB  == dn-9550 [(6r, 7r)-7-[(z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(1h-imidazol-4-yl) methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-pyridinio)methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia -1-azabicyclo methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate hydrochloride] is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the activity of dn-9550 against most species of the family enterobacteriaceae was roughly comparable to that of ceftazidime, slightly lower than that of cefotaxime, and far exceeded that of cefoperazone. against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens, dn-9550 was more active than ceftazidime and cefotaxime. dn-9550 and  ceftazidime were significantly more active than cefotaxime against pseudomonas aeruginosa, but dn-9550 and cefotaxime were clearly more active than ceftazidime  against staphylococci and streptococci. haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were also highly susceptible to dn-9550, but bacteroides fragilis was generally not susceptible to the compound. dn-9550 was stable to various types of beta-lactamases and had high affinities for penicillin-binding protein 3 of both  escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. when dn-9550 was administered subcutaneously  to mice experimentally infected with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, or pseudomonas aeruginosa, its efficacy well reflected its in vitro potency.

TI  == peritonsillar abscess: bacteriological evaluation.
AB  == the pus from a series of 41 peritonsillar abscesses was examined bacteriologically. in the majority of the abscesses a mixed bacterial flora was found. the specimens yielded 0-7 different bacterial species per abscess (mean 3.0). one species alone was isolated only in five cases (12.5%). both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria were isolated from the specimens of 25 patients (61%), only  anaerobes from two specimens (4.9%), and only facultative bacteria from 12 specimens (29%). beta haemolytic streptococci were cultured in 43.9% of the cases, but streptococcus pyogenes group a in only 10 cases (24.4%). thus, the pus of the peritonsillar abscess seems to be caused by a mixed bacterial infection, where anaerobic bacteria play a significant role. indications of tonsillectomy in cases with peritonsillar abscess are discussed.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of three new quinolone antibiotics against recent clinical isolates.
AB  == new orally absorbable quinolone derivatives, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin demonstrated excellent activity in vitro against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, proteus mirabilis, proteus sp. indole-positive, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococci. none of the 3 drugs was more than moderately effective against bacteroides fragilis. ciprofloxacin was 2-4 times more effective against most gram-negative strains than was either norfloxacin or  ofloxacin, and was also the most effective against gram-positive strains, though  the difference was less marked. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were almost equally effective against s. aureus. results with agar and with broth were comparable. the activities of all 3 drugs were essentially independent of inoculum size, as the mic values increased less than one dilution step when the inoculum was increased from 10(3) to 10(6). the new quinolone derivatives would appear to be promising alternatives to injectable drugs such as the aminoglycosides and cephalosporins.

AB  == thirty-eight children who had recurrent tonsillitis and who were chronic carriers of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (gabhs) were treated with oral clindamycin. surface tonsillar cultures, obtained prior to therapy and two weeks  after the termination of therapy, were processed for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained from all cultures. prior to therapy, the average yield was 9.3 isolates (5.2 aerobes and 4.1 anaerobes) per specimen; after the completion of therapy, the average yield was 5.5 isolates (3.0 aerobes and 2.5 anaerobes). the gabhs were completely eliminated after clindamycin therapy, and the numbers of isolates of bacteroides  spp and staphylococcus aureus were reduced. beta-lactamase production was detected prior to therapy in 57 isolates recovered from all tonsillar surfaces. this group included all isolates of s. aureus (15) and bacteroides fragilis (eight), 19 of 34 bacteroides melaninogenicus isolates (56 per cent), and seven of 12 bacteroides oralis isolates (58 per cent). only four isolates of beta-lactamase-producing bacterial strains were recovered after the conclusion of therapy. follow-up study of 33 children for eight to 16 months (average, 13 months) showed no recurrence of gabhs in 31.

TI  == quantitative measurement of beta lactamase in tonsils of children with recurrent  tonsillitis.
AB  == tonsils were obtained from 50 children suffering from recurrent tonsillitis. the  tonsils' core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. beta lactamase production was assayed in all isolates and beta lactamase activity was measured in the contents of each tonsil. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained in all patients, yielding an average of 7.9 isolates (4.4 anaerobes  and 3.5 aerobes) per specimen. beta lactamase production was noted in 58 isolates recovered from 39 tonsils (78%). these were all 21 isolates of s. aureus and 10 b. fragilis, 18 of 45 b. melaninogenicus (40%), 7 of 14 b. oralis (50%), and 2 of 13 h. influenzae type b (15%). beta lactamase activity was detected in 33 of the  39 (85%) tonsils which harbored beta lactamase-producing bacteria, and in none of the 11 tonsils which had no beta lactamase-producing bacteria. our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature of deep tonsillar flora in children with recurrent tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of detectable beta lactamase  activity in the tonsillar tissue in most of the tonsils which harbored beta lactamase-producing organism.

TI  == synthesis and antimicrobial activity of clindamycin analogues: pirlimycin, 1,2 a  potent antibacterial agent.
AB  == the preparation of a series of analogues of clindamycin is described in which the naturally occurring five-membered cyclic amino acid amide portion of the molecule is replaced by a four-, six-, or seven-membered cyclic amino acid amide. the most interesting compound is pirlimycin (7e, u-57,930e), in which the (2s-trans)-4-n-propylhygramide portion of clindamycin is replaced by (2s-cis)-4-ethylpipecolamide. this structural modification results in significantly favorable changes in toxicity, metabolism, and antibacterial potency. although the in vitro antibacterial activity of clindamycin and pirlimycin are nearly identical, the latter compound is 2-20 times more active than clindamycin when administered to mice experimentally infected with strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and plasmodium berghei. pirlimycin is absorbed in rats and  mice following both subcutaneous and oral administration. it readily penetrates b. fragilis induced abscesses in mice and is sequestered within these abscesses.  a drug concentration of at least 60 times the required inhibitory concentration is maintained for 6 h following a single subcutaneous dose of 200 mg/kg. urinary  excretion of total bioactivity consists only of intact pirlimycin with no other antibacterially active metabolites being detected. pirlimycin is tolerated well in rats and mice at the administered levels.

TI  == in-vivo protection of group a beta-haemolytic streptococci from penicillin by beta-lactamase-producing bacteroides species.
AB  == the incidence of persistent group a beta-haemolytic streptococci in tonsils, despite penicillin therapy, has increased in recent years. beta-lactamase-producing organisms have previously been recovered from 74% of patients with persisting group a streptococci. we investigated the possibility that beta-lactamase-producing strains of bacteroides spp. can protect streptococci from penicillin. a mixed infection was induced in mice in the form of a subcutaneous abscess involving a penicillin-susceptible group a streptococcus, and a beta-lactamase-producing strain of either bact. melaninogenicus or bact. fragilis. the infected animals were treated for seven days with parenteral penicillin, penicillin and clavulanic acid or clindamycin. penicillin treatment prevented the formation of abscesses in animals inoculated with group a streptococci alone, but not in those inoculated with group a streptococci and bacteroides spp. we attributed this resistance to penicillin therapy, and the subsequent formation of abscesses in mice, to protection of the  streptococci from penicillin by beta-lactamase-producing strains of bacteroides spp. effective therapy for mixed infections was achieved when clavulanic acid, a  beta-lactamase inhibitor, was administered with penicillin. a similar effect was  noted with clindamycin, which is active against both group a streptococci and bacteroides spp.

AB  == the prevalence of strictly anaerobic bacteria in the secretions from untreated cases of mastitis in lactating dairy cows was investigated. the study involved 147 friesland cows in 12 highveld herds. all herds yielded cows with anaerobic udder infections. no anaerobic bacteria were recovered from cows with normal quarters or those with latent aerobic infections. only anaerobes were present in  10% of so-called 'aseptic' mastitis cases. a variety of anaerobic organisms was isolated concurrently with facultative bacteria from 5,3% and 58,8% of cases classified as subclinical and clinical respectively. peptococcus spp. was associated with corynebacterium pyogenes and bacteroides spp. with staphylococcus aureus and/or streptococcus agalactiae in 80% anaerobic udder infections. gram positive anaerobic species were mostly sensitive to penicillin-g but all the gram negative rods were resistant. in addition, all b. fragilis strains produced beta-lactamase. the ability to produce heparinase was demonstrated in one strain  of peptococcus indolicus and a peptostreptococcus sp.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefotetan.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of cefotetan, a recently developed cephamycin, was investigated under various experimental conditions. the compound showed moderate  activity against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus faecalis, but a high activity against enterobacteriaceae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. haemophilus influenzae also was fairly susceptible. the mbc was usually equal to  or two- or fourfold higher than mic. medium composition, ph and inoculum size had minimal influence on its activity. about 50% of recent clinical isolates of bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to cefotetan, but some were highly resistant. killing curves of cefotetan against different bacterial strains indicated that it was rapidly bactericidal at concentrations equal to mic or two- to fourfold higher. however, some strains showed regrowth after initial inhibition. combination of cefotetan with aminoglycosides, or with cefazolin, cefotaxime, moxalactam or piperacillin resulted either in synergy, addition or indifference according to the bacterial strain and the nature of the combination. antagonism was never observed. human serum protein binding varied from 75 to 86%  according to the assay method. binding with horse serum protein was about 28%.

TI  == in vitro protection of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci from penicillin and cephalothin by bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == beta-lactamase produced by bacteroides fragilis could protect from antibiotics group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (gabhs), penicillin-susceptible pathogens frequently isolated from acute tonsillitis in children. to test this hypothesis we determined the minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) to penicillin and cephalothin of gabhs alone and in mixed culture with eleven beta-lactamase-producing strains of b. fragilis. b. fragilis strains with mbc values less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml to penicillin and less than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml to cephalothin did not provide any protection for gabhs. however, strains with mbc greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml to penicillin and greater than or equal to 256 micrograms/ml to cephalothin provided protection by increasing the mbc of gabhs at least 8,534 times for penicillin and 2,048 times for cephalothin. this phenomenon was most marked in 5% co2. b. fragilis provided no protection against clindamycin. these results may explain the inability of penicillin therapy to completely eradicate gabhs from cases of recurrently infected tonsils.

AB  == ly127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. the lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)s) of ly127935 for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. the mic(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. the  mic(90)s for enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. the mic(90)s for anaerobes ranged from  2 to >32 mug/ml. as determined by mic(90)s, ly127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. in a population of multidrug-resistant isolates,  concentrations of 8 mug or less of ly127935 per ml inhibited 82% of enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of enterobacteriaceae and 40% of p. aeruginosa. increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ly127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some enterobacteriaceae. all four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. the broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of ly127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.
