TI  == tunel analysis of dna fragmentation in mouse unfertilized oocytes: the effect of  microorganisms within human follicular fluid collected during ivf cycles.
AB  == recently we reported the presence of bacteria within follicular fluid. previous studies have reported that dna fragmentation in human spermatozoa after in vivo or in vitro incubation with bacteria results in early embryo demise and a reduced rate of ongoing pregnancy, but the effect of bacteria on oocytes is unknown. this study examined the dna within mouse oocytes after 12 hours' incubation within human follicular fluids (n=5), which were collected from women undergoing in vitro fertilization (ivf) treatment. each follicular fluid sample was cultured to detect the presence of bacteria. terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dutp nick-end labeling (tunel) was used to label dna fragmentation in ovulated, non-fertilized mouse oocytes following in vitro incubation in human follicular fluid. the bacteria streptococcus anginosus and peptoniphilus spp., lactobacillus gasseri (low-dose), l. gasseri (high-dose), enterococcus faecalis, or propionibacterium acnes were detected within the follicular fluids. the most severe dna fragmentation was observed in oocytes incubated in the follicular fluids containing p. acnes or l. gasseri (high-dose). no dna fragmentation was observed in the mouse oocytes incubated in the follicular fluid containing low-dose l. gasseri or e. faecalis. low human oocyte fertilization rates (<29%) were associated with extensive fragmentation in mouse oocytes (80-100%). bacteria colonizing human follicular fluid in vivo may cause dna fragmentation in mouse oocytes following 12h of in vitro incubation. follicular fluid bacteria may result in poor quality oocytes and/or embryos, leading to poor ivf outcomes.

TI  == [analysis of diversity of vaginal microbiota in healthy chinese women by using dna-fingerprinting].
AB  == objective: to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in  different physiological states with pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), to establish the basis for the future study of lower genital tract infections, and to provide a theoretical basis for the development of vaginal probiotics adapted to chinese females. methods: women who underwent routine gynecologic examinations in peking university first hospital from october 2009 to january 2010 were enrolled, including 30 at reproductive age and 30 at post menopause age. vaginal samples were collected and then total bacterial dna was extracted. universal bacterial primers were used to amplify the v3 region of 16s  rdna gene. pcr products were analyzed by denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). featured bands on dgge were recovered, cloned and sequenced. alignment with known sequence was made by using blast on genbank to identify bacterial strains so as to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora  in different physiological states. results: (1) vaginal flora in healthy chinese  women at their reproductive age were relatively simple, lactobacillus were the dominant bacteria. common bacteria included: lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners,and lactobacillus gasseri. while l. iners were the dominant vaginal bacteria that could not be recognized by traditional method. (2) vaginal  bacteria in the women at post menopause age were more complex than in those at reproductive age. common bacteria included: lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus gallolyticus, veillonella sp., streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus anginosus, prevotella sp., anaerococcus lactolyticus and bacteroides fragilis. conclusion: based on the dgge analysis, the most common vaginal bacteria in chinese healthy women at reproductive age are lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners,and lactobacillus gasseri. the most common vaginal bacteria in healthy post-menopausal women are lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., prevotella sp.,bacteroides fragilis and lactic acid producing veillonella sp. and anaerococcus lactolyticus. meanwhile lactobacillus iners was firstly found by dgge to be the dominant vaginal bacteria in different physiological states.

TI  == antibiotic effects on bacterial profile in osteonecrosis of the jaw.
AB  == objective: oral infection is considered to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (bronj), and antibiotic therapy has become a mainstay of bronj therapy. this study was aimed to investigate the effect of antibiotics on bacterial diversity in bronj tissues. materials and methods: the bacterial profile from soft tissues associated with the bronj lesion was determined using 16s rrna-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and sequencing. twenty bronj subjects classified as stage  0-2 were enrolled in this study, and patient groups were divided into an antibiotic cohort (n=10) treated with systemic antibiotic and a non-antibiotic cohort (n=10) with no prior antibiotic therapy. results: the dgge fingerprints indicated no significant differences in bacterial diversity of bronj tissue samples. patients on antibiotics had higher relative abundance of phylum firmicutes with bacterial species, streptococcus intermedius, lactobacillus gasseri, mogibacterium timidum, and solobacterium moorei, whereas patients without antibiotics had greater amounts of parvimonas micra and streptococcus anginosus. thirty percent of bacterial populations were uncultured (yet-to be cultured) phylotypes. conclusion: this study using limited sample size indicated  that oral antibiotic therapy may have a limited efficacy on the bacterial population associated with bronj lesions.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.
