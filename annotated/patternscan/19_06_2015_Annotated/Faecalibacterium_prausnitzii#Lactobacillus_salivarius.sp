TI  == effect of lactobacillus salivarius ls-33 on fecal microbiota in obese adolescents.
AB  == background & aims: this study is a part of the clinical trials with probiotic bacterium lactobacillus salivarius ls-33 conducted in obese adolescents. previously reported clinical studies showed no effect of ls-33 consumption on the metabolic syndrome in the subject group. the aim of the study was to investigate  the impact of l. salivarius ls-33 on fecal microbiota in obese adolescents. methods: the study was a double-blinded intervention with 50 subjects randomized  to intake of l. salivarius ls-33 or placebo for 12 weeks. the fecal microbiota was assessed by real-time quantitative pcr before and after intervention. concentrations of fecal short chain fatty acids were determined using gas chromatography. results: ratios of bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group to  firmicutes belonging bacteria, including clostridium cluster xiv, blautia coccoides_eubacteria rectale group and roseburia intestinalis, were significantly increased (p </= 0.05) after administration of ls-33. the cell numbers of fecal bacteria, including the groups above as well as clostridium cluster i, clostridium cluster iv, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, enterobacteriaceae, enterococcus, the lactobacillus group and bifidobacterium were not significantly  altered by intervention. similarly, short chain fatty acids remained unaffected.  conclusion: l. salivarius ls-33 might modify the fecal microbiota in obese adolescents in a way not related to metabolic syndrome. clinical trial number: nct 01020617.

TI  == identification and characterization of potential performance-related gut microbiotas in broiler chickens across various feeding trials.
AB  == three broiler feeding trials were investigated in order to identify gut bacteria  consistently linked with improvements in bird performance as measured by feed efficiency. trials were done in various geographic locations and varied in diet composition, broiler breed, and bird age. gut microbial communities were investigated using microbial profiling. eight common performance-linked operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified within both the ilea (180, 492, and 564-566) and ceca (140-142, 218-220, 284-286, 312, and 482) across trials. otu 564-566 was associated with lower performance, while otus 140-142, 482, and 492 were associated with improved performance. targeted cloning and sequencing of these eight otus revealed that they represented 26 bacterial species or phylotypes which clustered phylogenetically into seven groups related  to lactobacillus spp., ruminococcaceae, clostridiales, gammaproteobacteria, bacteroidales, clostridiales/lachnospiraceae, and unclassified bacteria/clostridia. where bacteria were identifiable to the phylum level, they belonged predominantly to the firmicutes, with bacteroidetes and proteobacteria also identified. some of the potential performance-related phylotypes showed high sequence identity with classified bacteria (lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus aviarius, lactobacillus crispatus, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, escherichia coli, gallibacterium anatis, clostridium lactatifermentans, ruminococcus torques, bacteroides vulgatus, and alistipes finegoldii). the 16s rrna gene sequence information generated will allow quantitative assays to be developed which will enable elucidations of which of these phylotypes are truly performance related. this information could be used to monitor strategies to improve feed efficiency and feed formulation for optimal gut health.

TI  == selected microbial groups and short-chain fatty acids profile in a simulated chicken cecum supplemented with two strains of lactobacillus.
AB  == among the bacterial fermentation end products in the chicken cecum, butyrate is of particular importance because of its nutritional properties for the epithelial cell and pathogen inhibitory effects in the gut. an in vitro experiment, operated with batch bioreactor, was conducted to quantify butyric-producing bacteria in a  simulated broiler cecum supplemented with lactobacillus salivarius ssp. salicinius jcm 1230 and lactobacillus agilis jcm 1048 during 24 h of incubation.  selected bacterial species were determined by real-time pcr and short-chain fatty acids and lactate concentrations were monitored. the results showed that after 24 h of incubation, lactobacillus supplementation significantly increased the number of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and faecalibacterium prausnitzii in medium containing cecal content and lactobacilli supplementation (cc + l) compared with  the control (cc). addition of lactobacilli did not alter escherichia coli and clostridium butyricum, whereas it significantly (p < 0.05) reduced salmonella in  treatment cc + l compared with the cc treatment. propionate and butyrate formation were significantly (p < 0.05) increased in treatment cc + l as compared with the cc treatment. lactate was only detected in treatment containing 2 lactobacillus strains. after 24 h of incubation, acetate concentration significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in all treatments. it was suggested that lactate produced by lactobacillus in the cecal content improved the growth of butyric producers such as f. prausnitzii, which significantly increased butyrate  accumulation. additionally, the results showed that butyrate and propionate inhibited salmonella without influencing the e. coli profile.

TI  == 16s rrna gene-based analysis of mucosa-associated bacterial community and phylogeny in the chicken gastrointestinal tracts: from crops to ceca.
AB  == mucosa-associated microbiota from different regions of the gastrointestinal (gi)  tract of adult broilers was studied by analysis of 16s rrna gene sequences. the microbiota mainly comprised gram-positive bacteria along the gi tract. fifty-one  operational taxonomic units (otus) (from 98 clones) were detected in the ceca, as compared with 13 otus (from 49 clones) in the crops, 11 otus (from 51 clones) in  the gizzard, 14 otus (from 52 clones) in the duodenum, 12 otus (from 50 clones) in the jejunum and nine otus (from 50 clones) in the ileum. ceca were dominantly  occupied by clostridia-related sequences (40%) with other abundant sequences being related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii (14%), escherichia coli (11%), lactobacilli (7%) and ruminococcus (6%). lactobacilli were predominant in the upper gi tract and had the highest diversity in the crop. both lactobacillus aviarius and lactobacillus salivarius were the predominant species among lactobacilli. candidatus division arthromitus was also abundant in the jejunum and ileum.
