TI  == microbiological quality of ready-to-eat salads: an underestimated vehicle of bacteria and clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes.
AB  == the increase demand for fresh vegetables is causing an expansion of the market for minimally processed vegetables along with new recognized food safety problems. to gain further insight on this topic we analyzed the microbiological quality of portuguese ready-to-eat salads (rts) and their role in the spread of bacteria carrying acquired antibiotic resistance genes, food products scarcely considered in surveillance studies. a total of 50 rts (7 brands; split or mixed leaves, carrot, corn) were collected in 5 national supermarket chains in porto region (2010). they were tested for aerobic mesophilic counts, coliforms and escherichia coli counts as well as for the presence of salmonella and listeria monocytogenes. samples were also plated in different selective media with/without antibiotics before and after enrichment. the e. coli, other coliforms and enterococcus recovered were characterized for antibiotic resistance profiles and  clonality with phenotypic and genetic approaches. a high number of rts presented  poor microbiological quality (86%--aerobic mesophilic counts, 74%--coliforms, 4%--e. coli), despite the absence of screened pathogens. in addition, a high diversity of bacteria (species and clones) and antibiotic resistance backgrounds  (phenotypes and genotypes) were observed, mostly with enrichment and antibiotic selective media. e. coli was detected in 13 samples (n=78; all types and 4 brands; phylogenetic groups a, b1 and d; none stec) with resistance to tetracycline [72%; tet(a) and/or tet(b)], streptomycin (58%; aada and/or stra-strb), sulfamethoxazole (50%; sul1 and/or sul2), trimethoprim (50%; dfra1 or dfra12), ampicillin (49%; blatem), nalidixic acid (36%), ciprofloxacin (5%) or chloramphenicol (3%; cata). e. coli clones, including the widespread group d/st69, were detected in different samples from the same brand or different brands pointing out to a potential cross-contamination. other clinically relevant resistance genes were detected in 2 raoultella terrigena carrying a bla(shv-2) and 1 citrobacter freundii isolate with a qnrb9 gene. among enterococcus (n=108;  35 samples; enterococcus casseliflavus--40, enterococcus faecalis--20, enterococcus faecium--18, enterococcus hirae--9, enterococcus gallinarum--5, and  enterococcus spp.--16) resistance was detected for tetracyclines [6%; tet(m) and/or tet(l)], erythromycin [3%; erm(b)], nitrofurantoin (1%) or ciprofloxacin (1%). the present study places ready-to-eat salads within the spectrum of ecological niches that may be vehicles for antibiotic resistance bacteria/genes with clinical interest (e.g. e. coli-d-st69; bla(shv-2)) and these findings are worthy of attention as their spread to humans by ingestion cannot be dismissed.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus species from meat and fermented meat products isolated by a pcr-based rapid screening method.
AB  == enterococci are predominantly found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals, but species commonly resident on vegetation are known. their presence in large numbers in foods may indicate a lapse in sanitation and their ability to serve as a genetic reservoir of transferable antibiotic resistance is of concern. conventional culture methods for identification of enterococci are slow and sometimes give false results because of the biochemical diversity of the organisms in this genus. this work reports the development of a pcr-based assay to detect enterococci at the genus level by targeting a 16s rrna sequence. published 16s rrna sequences were aligned and used to design genus specific primers (entf and entr). the primers were able to amplify a 678 bp target region  from enterococcus faecalis atcc 7080 and 20 other strains of enterococci from 11  different species, but there was no amplification by 32 species from closely related genera (pediococcus, lactobacillus, streptococcus and listeria) or species of escherichia coli and salmonella. the pcr positive samples were plated, screened by a colony patch technique and their identities were confirmed by api 20 strep panels and sequencing. when dry fermented sausage and ham as well as fresh meat batter for dry cured sausage manufacture were tested for enterococci by the method, 29 enterococcus strains (15 e. faecalis, 13 e. faecium, and one e. gallinarum) were identified. when susceptibility of these enterococci to 12 antibiotics was tested, the highest incidence of resistance was to clindamycin (89.6%), followed by tetracycline hydrochloride (65.5%), tylosin (62%), erythromycin (45%), streptomycin and neomycin (17%), chloramphenicol (10.3%), penicillin (10.3%), ciprofloxacin (10.3%) and gentamicin (3.4%). none was resistant to the clinically important drugs vancomycin or ampicillin. most strains (27/29) were resistant to more than one antibiotic while 17 of 29 strains were resistant to three to 8 antibiotics. the molecular method developed was validated for speciation of enterococci and was useful in assessing uncooked processed meat products as a reservoir for multi-drug resistant enterococcus species.

TI  == the effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. a completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. the highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log cfu g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. the highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log cfu g(-1)). moreover, the maldi tof ms biotyper identified the following genera: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella  oxytoca, as well as lactobacillus acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. fermentum and l.  salivarius from the lactobacilli group and enterococcus avium, e. casseliflavus,  e. cecorum, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae and e. malodoratus from the enterococci group. additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of  chickens were tested. the best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against k. oxytoca.

TI  == echinoderms from azores islands: an unexpected source of antibiotic resistant enterococcus spp. and escherichia coli isolates.
AB  == the prevalence of antibiotic resistance and the implicated mechanisms of resistance were evaluated in enterococcus spp. and escherichia coli, isolated from a total of 250 faecal samples of echinoderms collected from azorean waters (portugal). a total of 144 enterococci (120 enterococcus faecium, 14 e. hirae, 8  e. faecalis, 2 e. gallinarum) and 10 e. coli were recovered. high percentages of  resistance in enterococci were found for erythromycin, ampicillin, tetracyclin and ciprofloxacin. the erm(a) or erm(b), tet(m) and/or tet(l), vat(d), aac(6')-aph(2'') and aph(3')-iiia genes were found in isolates resistant to erythromycin, tetracycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin, high-level gentamicin and  high-level kanamycin, respectively. resistance in e. coli isolates was detected for streptomycin, amikacin, tetracycline and tobramycin. the aada gene was found  in streptomycin-resistant isolates and tet(a)+tet(b) genes in tetracycline-resistant isolates. the data recovered are essential to improve knowledge about the dissemination of resistant strains through marine ecosystems  and the possible implications involved in transferring these resistances either to other animals or to humans.

TI  == glucose triggers atp secretion from bacteria in a growth-phase-dependent manner.
AB  == atp modulates immune cell functions, and atp derived from gut commensal bacteria  promotes the differentiation of t helper 17 (th17) cells in the intestinal lamina propria. we recently reported that enterococcus gallinarum, isolated from mice and humans, secretes atp. we have since found and characterized several atp-secreting bacteria. of the tested enterococci, enterococcus mundtii secreted  the greatest amount of atp (>2 mum/10(8) cells) after overnight culture. glucose, not amino acids and vitamins, was essential for atp secretion from e. mundtii. analyses of energy-deprived cells demonstrated that glycolysis is the most important pathway for bacterial atp secretion. furthermore, exponential-phase e.  mundtii and enterococcus faecalis cells secrete atp more efficiently than stationary-phase cells. other bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus, also secrete atp in exponential but  not stationary phase. these results suggest that various gut bacteria, including  commensals and pathogens, might secrete atp at any growth phase and modulate immune cell function.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of propolis on the microbiota from gastrointestinal tract of chickens.
AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the effect of propolis extracts on the microbial colonization of chicken gastrointestinal tract in vivo. the propolis was administered to both feed mixtures in various amounts except of the control group. the addition of 150 mg propolis to 1 kg of feed was included in the first  experimental group, the addition of 450 mg.kg(-1) in the second experimental group, the addition of 600 mg.kg(-1) the third experimental group and 800 mg kg(-1) in the fourth one. the highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the third group (8.6 cfu.g(-1)) where 600 mg of propolis to 1 kg was added to the feed mixture. the highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the fourth experimental group (8.83 cfu.g(-1)) where was 800 mg of propolis added to 1 kg of feed mixture and number of enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in control group (8.73 cfu.g(-1)). with rtq pcr detected species from the genus enterococcus were: e. avium, e. casseliflavus, e cecorum, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae and e. malodoratus and from genus lactobacillus were: lactobacillus crispatus, l. acidophilus and l. salivarius. with maldi tof ms biotyper from enterobacteriaceae genera were identified citrobacter braakii, raoultella ornithinolytica, serratia fonticola, escherichia coli and klebsiella oxytoca. antimicrobial activities in vitro of six species of bacteria isolated from gastrointestinal tract of chickens were also tested. the best antimicrobial  effect of citrobacter braakii on ethanolic propolis extract in all concentrations were found.

TI  == intestinal steroid profiles and microbiota composition in colitic mice.
AB  == reduced gut microbiota diversity in conjunction with a bloom of few bacterial species is a common feature in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) patients. however, the environmental changes caused by inflammation and their possible impact on the microbiota are largely unknown. since ibd is associated with an impaired intestinal steroid metabolism, we hypothesized that changes in intestinal steroid and particularly bile acid (ba) concentrations affect microbial communities. we used interleukin-10 deficient (il-10-/-) mice as a model for chronic gut inflammation. healthy wild-type mice served as controls. in these animals, intestinal steroid concentrations and gut microbial diversity were analyzed at 24 weeks of age. the il 10-/- mice developed moderate inflammation in cecum and colon and colorectal tumor formation was observed in 55 % of the animals. compared to the healthy conditions, gut inflammation was associated with higher intestinal cholesterol and cholic acid concentrations and a reduced microbial diversity. the latter was accompanied by a proliferation of robinsoniella peoriensis, clostridium innocuum, escherichia coli, and enterococcus gallinarum. all these species proved to be highly bile acid resistant. we concluded that chronic colitis in il-10-/- mice is associated with  changes in intestinal steroid profiles. these changes may be due to alterations in gut microbiota composition or vice versa. whether the bacterial sterol and bile acid metabolism is implicated in colitis and colorectal carcinoma etiology remains to be clarified.

TI  == molecular characterization of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-containing escherichia coli isolates in wild birds from the azores archipelago.
AB  == to study the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-containing escherichia coli isolates, and the mechanisms of resistance implicated, 220 faecal samples from wild birds were  collected between 2006 and 2010 in the azores archipelago. samples were spread on slanetz-bartley agar plates supplemented with 4 mg/l vancomycin and on levine agar plates supplemented with 2 mg/l cefotaxime for vre and esbl-containing e. coli isolation, respectively. vana-containing enterococcal isolates (four enterococcus faecium and two enterococcus durans) and vanc-1 enterococcus gallinarum isolates were detected in six and seven faecal samples, respectively.  vre isolates showed ampicillin (n=11), ciprofloxacin (n=9), tetracycline (n=6), erythromycin (n=5), quinupristin/dalfopristin (n=3) and high-level kanamycin resistance (n=1). the tet(l) and/or tet(m) gene was found in all tetracycline-resistant isolates and the erm(b) gene in all erythromycin-resistant isolates. three vana-containing e. faecium and two e. gallinarum presented specific sequences of the tn5397 transposon. four vre isolates harboured the ace  virulence gene. one faecal sample revealed one esbl-containing e. coli isolate that belongs to the a phylogenetic group, showed a phenotype of resistance to beta-lactams and tetracycline, and harboured the bla (ctx-m-14), bla (shv-12) and the tet(a) genes. to our knowledge, this is the first study to focus on defining  the prevalence of vre and/or esbl-containing e. coli strains in wild birds from the azores. the data recovered are essential to improve knowledge about the dissemination of resistant strains through wild ecosystems and their possible implications by transferring these resistances to other animals or to humans.

TI  == development of a dna microarray for enterococcal species, virulence, and antibiotic resistance gene determinations among isolates from poultry.
AB  == a dna microarray (enteroarray) was designed with probes targeting four species-specific taxonomic identifiers to discriminate among 18 different enterococcal species, while other probes were designed to identify 18 virulence factors and 174 antibiotic resistance genes. in total, 262 genes were utilized for rapid species identification of enterococcal isolates, while characterizing their virulence potential through the simultaneous identification of endogenous antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. enterococcal isolates from broiler chicken farms were initially identified by using the api 20 strep system, and the results were compared to those obtained with the taxonomic genes atpa, reca, phes, and ddl represented on our microarray. among the 171 isolates studied, five different enterococcal species were identified by using the api 20 strep system:  enterococcus faecium, e. faecalis, e. durans, e. gallinarum, and e. avium. the enteroarray detected the same species as api 20 strep, as well as two more: e. casseliflavus and e. hirae. species comparisons resulted in 15% (27 isolates) disagreement between the two methods among the five api 20 strep identifiable species and 24% (42 isolates) disagreement when considering the seven enteroarray identified species. the species specificity of key antibiotic and virulence genes identified by the enteroarray were consistent with the literature adding further  robustness to the redundant taxonomic probe data. sequencing of the cpn60 gene further confirmed the complete accuracy of the microarray results. the new enteroarray should prove to be a useful tool to accurately genotype strains of enterococci and assess their virulence potential.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of fecal indicators in municipal wastewater treatment plant.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance of fecal coliforms (n = 153) and enterococci (n = 199) isolates was investigated in municipal wastewater treatment plant (wwtp) based on activated sludge system. the number of fecal indicators (in influent and effluent as well as in the aeration chamber and in return activated sludge mixture) was determined using selective media. susceptibility of selected strains was tested against 19 (aminoglycosides, aztreonam, carbapenems, cephalosporins, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, fluoroquinolones, penicillines, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) and 17 (high-level aminoglycosides, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides, linezolid, lincosamides, nitrofuration, streptogramins, tetracycline) antimicrobial agents respectively. among enterococci the predominant species were enterococcus faecium (60.8%) and enterococcus faecalis (22.1%), while remaining isolates belonged to enterococcus hirae (12.1%), enterococcus casseliflavus/gallinarum (4.5%), and enterococcus durans (0.5%). resistance to nitrofuration and erythromycin was common among enterococci (53% and 44%, respectively), and followed by resistance to ciprofloxacin (29%) and tetracycline (20%). the resistance phenotypes related to glycopeptides (up to 3.2%) and high-level aminoglycosides (up to 5.4%) were also observed. most frequently, among escherichia coli isolates the resistance patterns were found for ampicillin (34%), piperacillin (24%) and tetracycline (23%). extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing e. coli was detected once, in the aeration chamber. in the study the applied wastewater treatment processes considerably reduced the number of fecal indicators. nevertheless their number in the wwtp effluent was higher than 10(4) cfu per 100 ml and periodically contained 90% of bacteria with antimicrobial resistance patterns. the positive selection of isolates with antimicrobial resistance patterns was observed during the treatment processes. substantial concern should be paid to the isolates resistant to 3 or more chemical classes of antimicrobials (mar). in treated wastewater mar e. coli  and mar enterococci constituted respectively 9% and 29% of tested isolates.

TI  == expression of the avian-specific toll-like receptor 15 in chicken heterophils is  mediated by gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, but not tlr agonists.
AB  == toll-like receptors (tlrs) are a critical component of the innate immune response of mammalian and avian species. while most mammalian tlrs have been well characterized, the chicken-specific tlr15 has not been extensively studied. we recently demonstrated that tlr15 is differentially expressed between salmonella-susceptible-and-resistant chickens, indicating a potential role in the innate immune response to infection with salmonella. the aim of the present study was to gain better insight into the nature of the ligand for tlr15 by characterizing gene expression patterns of tlr15 by heterophils in response to numerous bacterial-derived tlr agonists lps, flagellin, cpg oligodeoxynucleotides, lipotechoic acid (lta), peptidoglycan (pgn), and pam3csk4  (pam), stimulation with live salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis (se-used as  a positive control), chicken isolates of escherichia coli (ec) and enterococcus gallinarum (eg), the equine-specific pathogen rhodococcus equi, and stimulation with heat-killed, and formalin-killed se, ec, and eg. tlr15 expression increased  significantly in response to stimulation with live, heat-killed and formalin-killed se, ec, and eg, but was unaffected by stimulation with known tlr  agonists and r. equi. overall, these observations demonstrate that the individual tlr agonists are not the ligand for tlr15, and that tlr15 recognizes a unique, non-secreted, heat-stabile component of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria commonly found in and/or capable of causing disease in chickens.

TI  == aryl rhodanines specifically inhibit staphylococcal and enterococcal biofilm formation.
AB  == staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus are the leading causative agents of indwelling medical device infections because of their ability to form biofilms on artificial surfaces. here we describe the antibiofilm activity of a class of small molecules, the aryl rhodanines, which specifically inhibit biofilm formation of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and e. gallinarum but not the gram-negative species pseudomonas aeruginosa or escherichia coli. the aryl rhodanines do not exhibit antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial strains tested and are not cytotoxic against hela cells. preliminary mechanism-of-action studies revealed that the aryl rhodanines  specifically inhibit the early stages of biofilm development by preventing attachment of the bacteria to surfaces.

TI  == purification, crystallization and preliminary x-ray analysis of aminoglycoside-2''-phosphotransferase-ic [aph(2'')-ic] from enterococcus gallinarum.
AB  == bacterial resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics is primarily the result of deactivation of the drugs. three families of enzymes are responsible for this activity, with one such family being the aminoglycoside phosphotransferases (aphs). the gene encoding one of these enzymes, aminoglycoside-2''-phosphotransferase-ic [aph(2'')-ic] from enterococcus gallinarum, has been cloned and the wild-type protein (comprising 308 amino-acid  residues) and three mutants that showed elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations towards gentamicin (f108l, h258l and a double mutant f108l/h258l)  were expressed in escherichia coli and subsequently purified. all aph(2'')-ic variants were crystallized in the presence of 14-20%(w/v) peg 4000, 0.25 m mgcl(2), 0.1 m tris-hcl ph 8.5 and 1 mm mg(2)gtp. the crystals belong to the monoclinic space group c2, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. the approximate unit-cell parameters are a = 82.4, b = 54.2, c = 77.0 a, beta = 108.8 degrees. x-ray diffraction data were collected to approximately 2.15 a resolution from an f108l crystal at beamline bl9-2 at ssrl, stanford, california, usa.

TI  == isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as  antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis,  s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20  other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment  with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability  by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized  with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.

TI  == partial characterization of enterocin mr99 from a corn silage isolate of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == aims: to assess the inhibitory activity on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of several species of enterococci recovered from a natural corn silage.  methods and results: the inhibitory activity of strains of enterococcus faecalis  (58), enterococcus faecium (35), enterococcus gallinarum (3) and enterococcus casseliflavus (4) were studied employing indicator strains from various sources (clinical, food and atcc). enterococcus faecalis mr99, the only strain with inhibitory activity, inhibited other enterococci, listeria spp., staphylococcus aureus, clostridium spp., bacillus spp., escherichia coli, shigella sonnei and shigella flexneri. the bacterium contained only one conjugative pheromone-responsive plasmid. the partially chromatography-purified mr99 enterocin (ppe) had a molecular weight of approx. 5000 da and a pi of 6.2, was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and could be extracted in benzene and butanol. it appeared stable to adjustment of ph 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0 and was resistant to heat. inactivation was at 15 min at 121 degrees c. enterocin mr99 was bactericidal on strains of listeria monocytogenes, staph. aureus, and bovine  mastitis agents, it was bacteriostatic on e. coli. although enterocins mr99 and as48 have inhibitory activity on gram-negative bacilli, pcr studies demonstrated  a lack of relationship between them. conclusions: the active component had a protein nature, was resistant to heat and presented a wide inhibitory spectrum. significance and impact of the study: the biological properties of ent. faecalis  mr99 suggest that this strain merits further investigations so it can be applied  in human and veterinary health programmes.

TI  == detection of low levels of listeria monocytogenes cells by using a fiber-optic immunosensor.
AB  == biosensor technology has a great potential to meet the need for sensitive and nearly real-time microbial detection from foods. an antibody-based fiber-optic biosensor to detect low levels of listeria monocytogenes cells following an enrichment step was developed. the principle of the sensor is a sandwich immunoassay where a rabbit polyclonal antibody was first immobilized on polystyrene fiber waveguides through a biotin-streptavidin reaction to capture listeria cells on the fiber. capture of cells on the fibers was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. a cyanine 5-labeled murine monoclonal antibody, c11e9, was used to generate a specific fluorescent signal, which was acquired by  launching a 635-nm laser light from an analyte 2000 and collected by a photodetector at 670 to 710 nm. this immunosensor was specific for l. monocytogenes and showed a significantly higher signal strength than for other listeria species or other microorganisms, including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica, lactobacillus plantarum, carnobacterium gallinarum, hafnia alvei, corynebacterium glutamicum, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens, in pure or in mixed-culture setup. fiber-optic results could be obtained within 2.5 h of sampling. the sensitivity threshold was about 4.3 x 10(3) cfu/ml for a pure culture of l. monocytogenes grown at 37 degrees c. when l. monocytogenes was mixed with lactic acid bacteria or grown at 10 degrees c with 3.5% nacl, the detection threshold was 4.1 x 10(4) or 2.8 x 10(7) cfu/ml, respectively. in less  than 24 h, this method could detect l. monocytogenes in hot dog or bologna naturally contaminated or artificially inoculated with 10 to 1,000 cfu/g after enrichment in buffered listeria enrichment broth.

AB  == presently, enterococci take the third place of bacterial pathogens associated with nosocomial infections, after staphylococci and escherichia coli. especially, the resistances of enterococci to several available antibiotics are threatening.  we attempted to determine which species of enterococci could be found in food of  animal origin and their significance according to their antibiotic resistances for human beings. from november 2000 to may 2002 we investigated 155 samples of food of animal origin bought in retail outlets in germany: 27 samples of sausages, 19 of ham, 83 of minced meat, 26 of cheese. from these food samples we  isolated 416 enterococcal strains. the most frequent species was enterococcus faecalis (299 strains); furthermore, we found enterococcus faecium (54 strains),  enterococcus durans together with enterococcus hirae (24 strains), enterococcus casseliflavus (22 strains), enterococcus avium (9 strains) and enterococcus gallinarum (8 strains). we focused on the resistance patterns of 118 selected e.  faecium and e. faecalis strains to 13 antimicrobial active agents (ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, avilamycin, chloramphenicol, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, flavomycin, gentamicin, penicillin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin, tetracycline and vancomycin). from the clinical point of view, the situation of antibiotic resistance to the examined antimicrobial agents seemed to be favourable. the investigated strains were sensitive to ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. these antibiotics are, in combination with an aminoglycoside, for example gentamicin, agents of choice for the treatment of enterococcal infections in human medicine. only one e. faecium strain was resistant to penicillin, while all strains were sensitive to the glycopeptide antibiotics, vancomycin and teicoplanin. resistances found against the antibiotics, tetracycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin and erythromycin, are causes for concern.

TI  == asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
AB  == chronic inflammatory state and chronic infections appear to be one of the most important risk factors of morbidity and mortality in patients (pts) on dialysis.  the aim of our study was to determine the frequency of urinary tract infections (uti) in clinically asymptomatic patients on capd. the study included 43 (22f, 21m) clinically stable asymptomatic capd patients with diuresis ranged from 300 to 2500 ml per 24 h. clean catch urine specimen, was cultured and identified by standard technique. urine from 31 patients had no significant organism growth, from 12 patients grew over 100,000 colonies per ml; 8 patients had been infected  with e. coli, 2 pts with proteus mirabilis, one with enterococcus gallinarum, one with klebsiella oxytocea. 7/12 infected pts were diabetic, 67% infected and 13% not infected pts had pyuria. conclusions: immune system disturbance and renal failure can predispose to common asymptomatic uti in capd pts. e. coli is the most common bacterial strain found in infected dialysis pts. diabetes mellitus is and additional predisposing factor for uti in patients on capd. pyuria is a valuable parameter of uti in capd patients.

TI  == diversity of domain v of 23s rrna gene sequence in different enterococcus species.
AB  == the highly conserved central loop of domain v of 23s rna (nucleotides 2042 to 2628; escherichia coli numbering) is implicated in peptidyltransferase activity and represents one of the target sites for macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b antibiotics. dna encoding domain v (590 bp) of several species of enterococcus was amplified by pcr. twenty enterococcal isolates were tested, including enterococcus faecium (six isolates), enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus casseliflavus (two isolates of each), and enterococcus raffinosus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus malodoratus, and enterococcus hirae (one isolate of each).  for all isolates, species identification by biochemical testing was corroborated  by 16s rrna gene sequencing. the sequence of domain v of the 23s rrna gene from e. faecium and e. faecalis differed from those of all other enterococci. the domain v sequences of e. durans and e. hirae were identical. this was also true for e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus. e. avium differed from e. casseliflavus by 23 bases, from e. durans by 16 bases, and from e. malodoratus by 2 bases. e. avium differed from e. raffinosus by one base. despite the fact that domain v is  considered to be highly conserved, substantial differences were identified between several enterococcal species.

TI  == serine and alanine racemase activities of vant: a protein necessary for vancomycin resistance in enterococcus gallinarum bm4174.
AB  == vancomycin resistance in enterococcus gallinarum results from the production of udp-murnac-pentapeptide[d-ser]. vant, a membrane-bound serine racemase, is one of three proteins essential for this resistance. to investigate the selectivity of racemization of l-ser or l-ala by vant, a strain of escherichia coli tkl-10 that  requires d-ala for growth at 42 degrees c was used as host for transformation experiments using plasmids containing the full-length vant from ent. gallinarum or the alanine racemase gene (alr) of bacillus stearothermophilus: both plasmids  were able to complement e. coli tkl-10 at 42 degrees c. no alanine or serine racemase activities were detected in the host strain e. coli tkl-10 grown at 30,  34 or 37 degrees c. serine and alanine racemase activities were found almost exclusively (96%) in the membrane fraction of e. coli tkl-10/pca4(vant): the alanine racemase activity of vant was 14% of the serine racemase activity in both e. coli tkl-10/pca4(vant) and e. coli xl-1 blue/pca4(vant). alanine racemase activity was present mainly (95%) in the cytoplasmic fraction of e. coli tkl-10/pjw40(alr), with a trace (1.6%) of serine racemase activity. additionally, dna encoding the soluble domain of vant was cloned and expressed in e. coli m15 as a his-tagged polypeptide and purified: this polypeptide also exhibited both serine and alanine racemase activities; the latter was approximately 18% of the serine racemase activity, similar to that of the full-length, membrane-bound enzyme. n-terminal sequencing of the purified his-tagged polypeptide revealed a single amino acid sequence, indicating that the formation of heterodimers between subunits of his-tagged c-vant and endogenous alanine racemases from e. coli was unlikely. the authors conclude that the membrane-bound serine racemase vant also  has alanine racemase activity but is able to racemize serine more efficiently than alanine, and that the cytoplasmic domain is responsible for the racemase activity.

TI  == enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no  antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl.  tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.

TI  == characterization and modelling of vant: a novel, membrane-bound, serine racemase  from vancomycin-resistant enterococcus gallinarum bm4174.
AB  == sequence determination of a region downstream from the vanxyc gene in enterococcus gallinarum bm4174 revealed an open reading frame, designated vant, that encodes a 698-amino-acid polypeptide with an amino-terminal domain containing 10 predicted transmembrane segments. the protein contained a highly conserved pyridoxal phosphate attachment site in the c-terminal domain, typical of alanine racemases. the protein was overexpressed in escherichia coli, and serine racemase activity was detected in the membrane but not in the cytoplasmic  fraction after centrifugation of sonicated cells, whereas alanine racemase activity was located almost exclusively in the cytoplasm. when the protein was overexpressed as a polypeptide lacking the predicted transmembrane domain, serine racemase activity was detected in the cytoplasm. the serine racemase activity was partially (64%) inhibited by d-cycloserine, whereas host alanine racemase activity was almost totally inhibited (97%). serine racemase activity was also detected in membrane preparations of constitutively vancomycin-resistant e. gallinarum bm4174 but not in bm4175, in which insertional inactivation of the vanc-1 d-ala:d-ser ligase gene probably had a polar effect on expression of the vanxyc and vant genes. comparative modelling of the deduced c-terminal domain was based on the alignment of vant with the air alanine racemase from bacillus stearothermophilus. the model revealed that almost all critical amino acids in the active site of air were conserved in vant, indicating that the c-terminal domain of vant is likely to adopt a three-dimensional structure similar to that of air and that the protein could exist as a dimer. these results indicate that the source of d-serine for peptidoglycan synthesis in vancomycin-resistant enterococci expressing the vanc phenotype involves racemization of l- to d-serine by a membrane-bound serine racemase.

TI  == bacterial resistance to vancomycin: overproduction, purification, and characterization of vanc2 from enterococcus casseliflavus as a d-ala-d-ser ligase.
AB  == the vanc phenotype for clinical resistance of enterococci to vancomycin is exhibited by enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus. based on the detection of the cell precursor udp-n-acetylmuramic acid pentapeptide intermediate terminating in d-ala-d-ser instead of d-ala-d-ala, it has been predicted that the vanc ligase would be a d-ala-d-ser rather than a d-ala-d-ala ligase. overproduction of the e. casseliflavus atcc 25788 vanc2 gene in escherichia coli and its purification to homogeneity allowed demonstration of atp-dependent d-ala-d-ser ligase activity. the kcat/km2 (km2 = km for d-ser or c-terminal d-ala) ratio for d-ala-d-ser/d-ala-d-ala dipeptide formation is 270/0.69 for a 400-fold selection against d-ala in the c-terminal position. vanc2 also has substantial d-ala-d-asn ligase activity (kcat/km2 = 74 mm-1min-1).

TI  == a novel gentamicin resistance gene in enterococcus.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum sf9117 is a veterinary isolate for which the mic of gentamicin is 256 micrograms/ml. time-kill studies with a combination of ampicillin plus gentamicin failed to show synergism against sf9117. a probe representing aac(6')-aph(2") did not hybridize to dna from sf9117. a 3.2-kb fragment from plasmid pyn134 of sf9117 was cloned and conferred resistance to gentamicin in escherichia coli dh5 alpha. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the presence of a 918-bp open reading frame whose deduced amino acid sequence had a region with homology to the c-terminal domain of the bifunctional enzyme aac(6')-aph(2"). the gene is designated aph(2")-ic, and its observed phosphotransferase activity is provisionally designated aph(2")-ic. an intragenic probe hybridized to the genomic dna from an enterococcus faecium isolate from the peritoneal fluid of one patient and to the plasmid dna of an enterococcus faecalis isolate from the blood of another patient. an enterococcal isolate containing this novel resistance gene might not be readily detected in clinical laboratories that use gentamicin at 500 or 2,000 micrograms/ml for screening for  high-level resistance.

TI  == the gene encoding for penicillin-binding protein 5 of enterococcus faecalis is useful for development of a species-specific dna probe.
AB  == recently, in escherichia coli was cloned a sau3ai 3.4-kb fragment containing the  gene encoding for penicillin-binding protein 5 (pbp5) of enterococcus faecalis. the structural gene for the pbp of e. faecalis and the flanking regions were entirely sequenced (c. signoretto, m. boaretti, and p. canepari, fems microbiol.  lett. 123:99-106, 1994). when the entire cloned e. faecalis dna insert, labeled with digoxigenin, was used as a probe to detect a homology gene in enterococci, it was observed that only dnas of all the e. faecalis strains reacted to the probe. the same results were obtained when a hindiii fragment of 0.35 kb from the entire insert of 3.4 kb was used. in this study we tested a total of 62 clinically isolated enterococcal strains, belonging to the species e. faecalis (36 strains), e. faecium (13), e. gallinarum (6), e. bovis (2) e. avium (3), e. hirae (1), and e. casseliflavus (1). the results indicate that both the entire segment and the hindiii fragment may be useful for preparing a species-specific probe for rapid identification of e. faecalis species.

TI  == a survey of sixty turkey flocks exhibiting hepatic foci taken at time of processing.
AB  == fifty turkey flocks including 24 16-week-old male flocks and 26 20-week-old male  flocks were sampled at time of processing. hepatic foci were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the majority of these did not have any bacteria recovered from the lesions. of the bacteria that were recovered, most were facultative anaerobes, with escherichia coli and salmonella sp. comprising the most common isolates. all of the birds examined (300 total) for parasites were infected with  varying levels of ascaridia dissimilis. the highest average worm burden was found in the 20-week-old flocks. heterakis gallinarum were found in only a few of the younger turkeys (16 weeks old) and not in any of the older birds. an analysis of  the spatial distribution of the hepatic foci performed in an additional 10 turkey flocks (500 birds) revealed that, although present on the surface of all regions  of the liver, 56.12% of the lesions were found on the left hepatic lobe and 43.88% were found on the right hepatic lobe.

TI  == analysis of genes encoding d-alanine-d-alanine ligase-related enzymes in enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus flavescens.
AB  == using degenerate oligonucleotides complementary to sequences encoding conserved amino acid motifs in d-alanine-d-alanine (ddl) ligases, we have amplified ca. 600-bp fragments from enterococcus casseliflavus atcc 25788 and enterococcus flavescens ccm439. sequence analysis of the amplification products indicated that each strain possessed two genes, ddle. cass. and vanc-2, and ddle. flav. and vanc-3, respectively, encoding ddl-related enzymes. the fragments internal to the vanc genes were 98.3% identical. the vanc-2 gene was cloned into escherichia coli and sequenced. extensive similarity (66% nucleotide identity) was detected between this gene and vanc-1 from enterococcus gallinarum (s. dutka-malen, c. molinas, m. arthur, and p. courvalin, gene 112:53-58, 1992), suggesting that the  vanc genes are required for intrinsic low-level resistance to vancomycin. the partial deduced amino acid sequences of ddle. cass. and ddle. flav. were identical and closely related to that of the ddl ligase of enterococcus faecalis  (79% identity). in southern hybridization experiments, only dna from e. casseliflavus and e. flavescens hybridized to probes internal to the vanc-2 and ddle. cass. genes.
