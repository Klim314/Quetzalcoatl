TI  - Microbial conversion of choline to trimethylamine requires a glycyl radical enzyme.
AB  - Choline and trimethylamine (TMA) are small molecules that play central roles in biological processes throughout all kingdoms of life. These ubiquitous metabolites are linked through a single biochemical transformation, the conversion of choline to TMA by anaerobic microorganisms. This metabolic activity, which contributes to methanogenesis and human disease, has been known for over a century but has eluded genetic and biochemical characterization. We have identified a gene cluster responsible for anaerobic choline degradation within the genome of a sulfate-reducing bacterium and verified its function using both a genetic knockout strategy and heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. Bioinformatics and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy revealed the involvement of a C-N bond cleaving glycyl radical enzyme in TMA production, which is unprecedented chemistry for this enzyme family. Our discovery provides the predictive capabilities needed to identify choline utilization clusters in numerous bacterial genomes, underscoring the importance and prevalence of this metabolic activity within the human microbiota and the environment.
TI  - Combating bacterial colonization on metals via polymer coatings: relevance to marine and medical applications.
AB  - Metals are widely used in engineering as well as medical applications. However, their surfaces are easily colonized by bacteria that form biofilms. Among the numerous concerns with biofilm formation, biocorrosion is of particular importance in industry, because structural integrity may be compromised, leading to technical failures. In the food industry and medical field, biofilms also pose health risks. To inhibit bacterial colonization, the surfaces of metals can be coated with a polymeric layer which is antiadhesive and/or bactericidal. This article describes polymers that have these desired properties and the methodologies for immobilizing them on metal surfaces of relevance to the marine and medical fields. The focus is on polymer coatings that have a high degree of stability in aqueous medium and do not leach out. The efficacies of the different polymer coatings against bacteria commonly encountered in marine (Desulfovibrio desulfuricans) and medical applications (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli) are demonstrated.
TI  - Strategy for microbiome analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis on the Illumina sequencing platform.
AB  - Understanding the identity and changes of organisms in the urogenital and other microbiomes of the human body may be key to discovering causes and new treatments of many ailments, such as vaginosis. High-throughput sequencing technologies have recently enabled discovery of the great diversity of the human microbiome. The cost per base of many of these sequencing platforms remains high (thousands of dollars per sample); however, the Illumina Genome Analyzer (IGA) is estimated to have a cost per base less than one-fifth of its nearest competitor. The main disadvantage of the IGA for sequencing PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes is that the maximum read-length of the IGA is only 100 bases; whereas, at least 300 bases are needed to obtain phylogenetically informative data down to the genus and species level. In this paper we describe and conduct a pilot test of a multiplex sequencing strategy suitable for achieving total reads of > 300 bases per extracted DNA molecule on the IGA. Results show that all proposed primers produce products of the expected size and that correct sequences can be obtained, with all proposed forward primers. Various bioinformatic optimization of the Illumina Bustard analysis pipeline proved necessary to extract the correct sequence from IGA image data, and these modifications of the data files indicate that further optimization of the analysis pipeline may improve the quality rankings of the data and enable more sequence to be correctly analyzed. The successful application of this method could result in an unprecedentedly deep description (800,000 taxonomic identifications per sample) of the urogenital and other microbiomes in a large number of samples at a reasonable cost per sample.
TI  - An HcpR homologue from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans and its possible role in nitrate reduction and nitrosative stress.
AB  - The Escherichia coli CRP (cAMP receptor protein), is a global regulator of transcription that modulates gene expression by activation or repression at a range of promoters in E. coli. A major function is to regulate the selection of nutrients required for growth. The anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC27774 is capable of utilizing sulfate, nitrite and nitrate as terminal electron acceptors. In the presence of both sulfate and nitrate, sulfate is reduced preferentially despite nitrate being the thermodynamically more favourable electron acceptor. Three inverted repeat sequences upstream of the D. desulfuricans ATCC27774 nap (nitrate reduction in the periplasm) operon have high levels of similarity to the consensus sequence for the E. coli CRP DNA-binding site. In other Desulfovibrio species a putative CRP homologue, HcpR [regulator of hcp (hybrid cluster protein) transcription], has a predicted regulon comprising genes involved in sulfate reduction and nitrosative stress. The presence of CRP consensus sites within the D. desulfuricans ATCC27774 nap promoter prompted a search for CRP homologues in the genomes of sulfate-reducing bacteria. This revealed the presence of a potential CRP homologue that we predict binds to CRP consensus sites such as those of the nap operon. Furthermore, we predict that much of the core HcpR regulon predicted in other Desulfovibrio species is conserved in D. desulfuricans.
TI  - Desulfovibrio desulfuricans PglB homolog possesses oligosaccharyltransferase activity with relaxed glycan specificity and distinct protein acceptor sequence requirements.
AB  - Oligosaccharyltransferases (OTases) are responsible for the transfer of carbohydrates from lipid carriers to acceptor proteins and are present in all domains of life. In bacteria, the most studied member of this family is PglB from Campylobacter jejuni (PglB(Cj)). This enzyme is functional in Escherichia coli and, contrary to its eukaryotic counterparts, has the ability to transfer a variety of oligo- and polysaccharides to protein carriers in vivo. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that in the delta proteobacteria Desulfovibrio sp., the PglB homolog is more closely related to eukaryotic and archaeal OTases than to its Campylobacter counterparts. Genetic analysis revealed the presence of a putative operon that might encode all enzymes required for N-glycosylation in Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. D. desulfuricans PglB (PglB(Dd)) was cloned and successfully expressed in E. coli, and its activity was confirmed by transferring the C. jejuni heptasaccharide onto the model protein acceptor AcrA. In contrast to PglB(Cj), which adds two glycan chains to AcrA, a single oligosaccharide was attached to the protein by PglB(Dd). Site-directed mutagenesis of the five putative N-X-S/T glycosylation sites in AcrA and mass spectrometry analysis showed that PglB(Dd) does not recognize the "conventional bacterial glycosylation sequon" consisting of the sequence D/E-X(1)-N-X(2)-S/T (where X(1) and X(2) are any amino acid except proline), and instead used a different site for the attachment of the oligosaccharide than PglB(Cj.). Furthermore, PglB(Dd) exhibited relaxed glycan specificity, being able to transfer mono- and polysaccharides to AcrA. Our analysis constitutes the first characterization of an OTase from delta-proteobacteria involved in N-linked protein glycosylation.
TI  - Towards an integrated system for bio-energy: hydrogen production by Escherichia coli and use of palladium-coated waste cells for electricity generation in a fuel cell.
AB  - Escherichia coli strains MC4100 (parent) and a mutant strain derived from this (IC007) were evaluated for their ability to produce H(2) and organic acids (OAs) via fermentation. Following growth, each strain was coated with Pd(0) via bioreduction of Pd(II). Dried, sintered Pd-biomaterials ('Bio-Pd') were tested as anodes in a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell for their ability to generate electricity from H(2). Both strains produced hydrogen and OAs but 'palladised' cells of strain IC007 (Bio-Pd(IC007)) produced ~threefold more power as compared to Bio-Pd(MC4100) (56 and 18 mW respectively). The power output used, for comparison, commercial Pd(0) powder and Bio-Pd made from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, was ~100 mW. The implications of these findings for an integrated energy generating process are discussed.
TI  - Biorefining of precious metals from wastes: an answer to manufacturing of cheap nanocatalysts for fuel cells and power generation via an integrated biorefinery?
AB  - Bio-manufacturing of nano-scale palladium was achieved via enzymatically-mediated deposition of Pd from solution using Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, Escherichia coli and Cupriavidus metallidurans. Dried 'Bio-Pd' materials were sintered, applied onto carbon papers and tested as anodes in a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell for power production. At a Pd(0) loading of 25% by mass the fuel cell power using Bio-Pd( D. desulfuricans ) (positive control) and Bio-Pd( E. coli ) (negative control) was ~140 and ~30 mW respectively. Bio-Pd( C. metallidurans ) was intermediate between these with a power output of ~60 mW. An engineered strain of E. coli (IC007) was previously reported to give a Bio-Pd that was >3-fold more active than Bio-Pd of the parent E. coli MC4100 (i.e. a power output of >110 mW). Using this strain, a mixed metallic catalyst was manufactured from an industrial processing waste. This 'Bio-precious metal' ('Bio-PM') gave ~68% of the power output as commercial Pd(0) and ~50% of that of Bio-Pd( D. desulfuricans ) when used as fuel cell anodic material. The results are discussed in relation to integrated bioprocessing for clean energy.
TI  - c-Type cytochrome biogenesis can occur via a natural Ccm system lacking CcmH, CcmG, and the heme-binding histidine of CcmE.
AB  - The Ccm cytochrome c maturation System I catalyzes covalent attachment of heme to apocytochromes c in many bacterial species and some mitochondria. A covalent, but transient, bond between heme and a conserved histidine in CcmE along with an interaction between CcmH and the apocytochrome have been previously indicated as core aspects of the Ccm system. Here, we show that in the Ccm system from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, no CcmH is required, and the holo-CcmE covalent bond occurs via a cysteine residue. These observations call for reconsideration of the accepted models of System I-mediated c-type cytochrome biogenesis.
TI  - Thioredoxin is involved in U(VI) and Cr(VI) reduction in Desulfovibrio desulfuricans G20.
AB  - A transposon insertion mutant has been identified in a Desulfovibrio desulfuricans G20 mutant library that does not grow in the presence of 2 mM U(VI) in lactate-sulfate medium. This mutant has also been shown to be deficient in the ability to grow with 100 microM Cr(VI) and 20 mM As(V). Experiments with washed cells showed that this mutant had lost the ability to reduce U(VI) or Cr(VI), providing an explanation for the lower tolerance. A gene encoding a cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP) was identified as the site of the transposon insertion. The remainder of the mre operon (metal reduction) contains genes encoding a thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, and an additional oxidoreductase whose substrate has not been predicted. Expression studies showed that in the mutant, the entire operon is downregulated, suggesting that the CRP may be involved in regulating expression of the whole operon. Exposure of the cells to U(VI) resulted in upregulation of the entire operon. CdCl(2), a specific inhibitor of thioredoxin activity, inhibits U(VI) reduction by washed cells and inhibits growth of cells in culture when U(VI) is present, confirming a role for thioredoxin in U(VI) reduction. The entire mre operon was cloned into Escherichia coli JM109 and the transformant developed increased U(VI) resistance and the ability to reduce U(VI) to U(IV). The oxidoreductase protein (MreG) from this operon was expressed and purified from E. coli. In the presence of thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, and NADPH, this protein was shown to reduce both U(VI) and Cr(VI), providing a mechanism for the cytoplasmic reduction of these metals.
TI  - A thermostable hybrid cluster protein from Pyrococcus furiosus: effects of the loss of a three helix bundle subdomain.
AB  - Pyrococcus furiosus hybrid cluster protein (HCP) was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized. This is the first archaeal and thermostable HCP to be isolated. Compared with the protein sequences of previously characterized HCPs from mesophiles, the protein sequence of P. furiosus HCP exhibits a deletion of approximately 13 kDa as a single amino acid stretch just after the N-terminal cysteine motif, characteristic for class-III HCPs from (hyper)thermophilic archaea and bacteria. The protein was expressed as a thermostable, soluble homodimeric protein. Hydroxylamine reductase activity of P. furiosus HCP showed a K(m) value of 0.40 mM and a k(cat) value of 3.8 s(-1) at 70 degrees C and pH 9.0. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy showed evidence for the presence of a spin-admixed, S = 3/2 [4Fe-4S](+) cubane cluster and of the hybrid cluster. The cubane cluster of P. furiosus HCP is presumably coordinated by a CXXC-X(7)-C-X(5)-C motif close to the N-terminus, which is similar to the CXXC-X(8)-C-X(5)-C motif of the Desulfovibrio desulfuricans and Desulfovibrio vulgaris HCPs. Amino acid sequence alignment and homology modeling of P. furiosus HCP reveal that the deletion results in a loss of one of the two three-helix bundles of domain 1. Clearly the loss of one of the three-helix bundles of domain 1 does not diminish the hydroxylamine reduction activity and the incorporation of the iron-sulfur clusters.
TI  - Macromolecular crowding modulates folding mechanism of alpha/beta protein apoflavodoxin.
AB  - Protein dynamics in cells may be different from those in dilute solutions in vitro, because the environment in cells is highly concentrated with other macromolecules. This volume exclusion because of macromolecular crowding is predicted to affect both equilibrium and kinetic processes involving protein conformational changes. To quantify macromolecular crowding effects on protein folding mechanisms, we investigated the folding energy landscape of an alpha/beta protein, apoflavodoxin, in the presence of inert macromolecular crowding agents, using in silico and in vitro approaches. By means of coarse-grained molecular simulations and topology-based potential interactions, we probed the effects of increased volume fractions of crowding agents (phi(c)) as well as of crowding agent geometry (sphere or spherocylinder) at high phi(c). Parallel kinetic folding experiments with purified Desulfovibro desulfuricans apoflavodoxin in vitro were performed in the presence of Ficoll (sphere) and Dextran (spherocylinder) synthetic crowding agents. In conclusion, we identified the in silico crowding conditions that best enhance protein stability, and discovered that upon manipulation of the crowding conditions, folding routes experiencing topological frustrations can be either enhanced or relieved. Our test-tube experiments confirmed that apoflavodoxin's time-resolved folding path is modulated by crowding agent geometry. Macromolecular crowding effects may be a tool for the manipulation of protein-folding and function in living cells.
TI  - Oligosaccharide-mediated inhibition of the adhesion of pathogenic Escherichia coli strains to human gut epithelial cells in vitro.
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the ability of pectic oligosaccharides (POS) to inhibit adhesion of three strains of verotoxigenic Escherichia coli, three strains of enteropathogenic E. coli, and one nonclinical strain of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans to human intestinal epithelial cell cultures. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus gasseri were included for comparison. Attachment was determined in the human HT29 cell line by viable count of adherent bacteria. POS in buffer at pH 7.2 were antiadhesive at a dose of 2.5 mg ml(-1), reducing adhesion of enteropathogenic E. coil and verotoxigenic E. coli strains to less than 30% of control values. Concentrations resulting in 50% inhibition ranged from 0.15 to 0.46 mg ml(-1). L. acidophilus was not significantly affected, but adhesion of L. gasseri was reduced to 29% of the control value. POS reduced the adhesion of D. desulfuricans to 0.33% of the control value. POS also had a protective effect against E. coli verocytotoxins VT1 and VT2 at concentrations of 0.01 and 1 microg ml(-1), respectively.
TI  - Manufacture of stable palladium and gold nanoparticles on native and genetically  engineered flagella scaffolds.
AB  - The use of bacterial flagella as templates for the immobilization of Pd and Au nanoparticles is described. Complete coverage of D. desulfuricans flagellar filaments by Pd(0) nanoparticles was obtained via the H(2)-mediated reduction of Pd(NH3)4]Cl2 but similar results were not obtained using HAuCl4. The introduction of additional cysteine-derived thiol residues in the E. coli FliC protein increased Au(III) sorption and reduction onto the surface of the flagellar filament and resulted in the production of stabilized Au(0) nanoparticles of approximately 20-50 nm diameter. We demonstrate the application of molecular engineering techniques to manufacture biologically passivated Au(0) nanoparticles of a size suitable for catalytic applications.
TI  - Effect of Hofmeister ions on protein thermal stability: roles of ion hydration and peptide groups?
AB  - We have systematically explored the Hofmeister effects of cations and anions (0.3-1.75 M range) for acidic Desulfovibrio desulfuricans apoflavodoxin (net charge -19, pH 7) and basic horse heart cytochrome c (net charge +17, pH 4.5). The Hofmeister effect of the ions on protein thermal stability was assessed by the parameter dT trs/d[ion] (T trs; thermal midpoint). We show that dT trs/d[ion] correlates with ion partition coefficients between surface and bulk water and ion surface tension effects: this suggests direct interactions between ions and proteins. Surprisingly, the stability effects of the different ions on the two model proteins are similar, implying a major role of the peptide backbone, instead of charged groups, in mediation of the interactions. Upon assessing chemical/physical properties of the ions responsible for the Hofmeister effects on protein stability, ion charge density was identified as most important. Taken together, our study suggests key roles for ion hydration and the peptide group in facilitating interactions between Hofmeister ions and proteins.
TI  - Mercury methylation by planktonic and biofilm cultures of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans.
AB  - While biofilms are now known to be the predominant form of microbial growth in nature, very little is yet known about their role in environmental mercury (Hg) methylation. Findings of Hg methylation in periphyton communities have indicated the importance of investigating how environmental biofilms affect Hg methylation, as periphyton can be the base of the food webs in aquatic ecosystems. Chemical speciation influences the microbial uptake and methylation of inorganic Hg by planktonic cultures of sulfate-reducing bacteria; however, the effect of speciation on Hg methylation by biofilm cultures of these organisms has previously not been studied. In the present study, Hg methylation rates in biofilm and planktonic cultures of two isolates of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans from a coastal wetland were compared. Notably, the specific Hg methylation rate found was approximately an order of magnitude higher (0.0018 vs. 0.0002 attomol cell(-1) day(-1)) in biofilm cells than in planktonic cells, suggesting an important role for environmental biofilms in Hg methylation. To investigate the role of chemical speciation of Hg, experiments were conducted at two levels of sulfide. Both biofilm and planktonic cultures produced methylmercury at roughly twice the rate at low sulfide, when HgS(0)(aq), rather than HgHS2-, was the dominant Hg species. This indicates that the presence of a biofilm does not alter the relative availability of the dominant Hg species in sulfidic medium, in accordance with our previous studies of Hg uptake by Escherichia coli along a chloride gradient.
TI  - Biorecovery of gold by Escherichia coli and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans.
AB  - Microbial precipitation of gold was achieved using Escherichia coli and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans provided with H2 as the electron donor. No precipitation was observed using H2 alone or with heat-killed cells. Reduction of aqueous AuIII ions by both strains was demonstrated at pH 7 using 2 mM HAuCl4 solution and the concept was successfully applied to recover 100% of the gold from acidic leachate (115 ppm of AuIII) obtained from jewelry waste. Bioreductive recovery of gold from aqueous solution was achieved within 2 h, giving crystalline Au0 particles (20-50 nm), in the periplasmic space and on the cell surface, and small intracellular nanoparticles. The nanoparticle size was smaller (red suspension) at acidic pH (2.0) as compared to that obtained at pH 6.0 and 7.0 (purple) and 9.0 (dark blue). Comparable nanoparticles were obtained from AuIII test solutions and jewelry leachate.
TI  - EPR characterization of the molybdenum(V) forms of formate dehydrogenase from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774 upon formate reduction.
AB  - The EPR characterization of the molybdenum(V) forms obtained on formate reduction of both as-prepared and inhibited formate dehydrogenase from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774, an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of formate to CO(2), is reported. The Mo(V) EPR signal of the as-prepared formate-reduced enzyme is rhombic (g(max)=2.012, g(mid)=1.996, g(min)=1.985) and shows hyperfine coupling with two nuclear species with I=1/2. One of them gives an anisotropic splitting and is not solvent exchangeable (A(max)=11.7, A(mid)=A(min)=non-detectable, A-values in cm(-1)x10(-4)). The second species is exchangeable with solvent and produces a splitting at the three principal g-values (A(max)=7.7, A(mid)=10.0, A(min)=9.3). The hyperfine couplings of the non-solvent and solvent exchangeable nuclei are assigned to the hydrogen atoms of the beta-methylene carbon of a selenocysteine and to a Mo ligand whose nature, sulfydryl or hydroxyl, is still in debate. The Mo(V) species obtained in the presence of inhibitors (azide or cyanide) yields a nearly axial EPR signal showing only one detectable splitting given by nuclear species with I=1/2 (g(max)=2.092, g(mid)=2.000, g(min)=1.989, A(max)=non-detectable, A(mid)=A(min)=7.0), which is originated from the alpha-proton donated by the formate to a proximal ligand of the molybdenum. The possible structures of both paramagnetic molybdenum species (observed upon formate reduction in presence and absence of inhibitors) are discussed in comparison with the available structural information of this enzyme and the structural and EPR properties of the closely related formate dehydrogenase-H from Escherichia coli.
TI  - Regulation of arsenate resistance in Desulfovibrio desulfuricans G20 by an arsRBCC operon and an arsC gene.
AB  - Desulfovibrio desulfuricans G20 grows and reduces 20 mM arsenate to arsenite in lactate-sulfate media. Sequence analysis and experimental data show that D. desulfuricans G20 has one copy of arsC and a complete arsRBCC operon in different locations within the genome. Two mutants of strain G20 with defects in arsenate resistance were generated by nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis. The arsRBCC operons were intact in both mutant strains, but each mutant had one point mutation in the single arsC gene. Mutants transformed with either the arsC1 gene or the arsRBCC operon displayed wild-type arsenate resistance, indicating that the two arsC genes were equivalently functional in the sulfate reducer. The arsC1 gene and arsRBCC operon were also cloned into Escherichia coli DH5alpha independently, with either DNA fragment conferring increased arsenate resistance. The recombinant arsRBCC operon allowed growth at up to 50 mM arsenate in LB broth. Quantitative PCR analysis of mRNA products showed that the single arsC1 was constitutively expressed, whereas the operon was under the control of the arsR repressor protein. We suggest a model for arsenate detoxification in which the product of the single arsC1 is first used to reduce arsenate. The arsenite formed is then available to induce the arsRBCC operon for more rapid arsenate detoxification.
TI  - The role of the hybrid cluster protein in oxidative stress defense.
AB  - Hybrid cluster proteins (HCP) contain two types of Fe/S clusters, namely a [4Fe-4S](2+/1+) or [2Fe-2S](2+/1+) cluster and a novel type of hybrid cluster, [4Fe-2S-2O], in the as-isolated state. Although first isolated from anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria, the analysis of the genomic sequences reveals that genes encoding putative hybrid cluster proteins are present in a wide range of organisms, aerobic, anaerobic, or facultative, from the Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya domains. Despite a detailed spectroscopic and structural characterization, the precise physiological function of these proteins remained unknown. The present work shows that the transcription of the Escherichia coli hcp gene is induced by hydrogen peroxide, and this induction is regulated by the redox-sensitive transcriptional activator, OxyR. The E. coli hcp mutant strain exhibits higher sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, a behavior that reverts to the wild type phenotype once a plasmid carrying the hcp gene is reintroduced. Furthermore, the purified HCPs from E. coli and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774 show an alternative enzymatic activity, which under physiological conditions exhibited K(m) values for hydrogen peroxide (approximately 0.3 mM) within the range of other peroxidases. Altogether, the results reveal that HCP is involved in oxidative stress protection.
TI  - Biorecovered precious metals from industrial wastes: single-step conversion of a  mixed metal liquid waste to a bioinorganic catalyst with environmental application.
AB  - The complete and continuous reduction of 1 mM Cr(VI) to Cr(III) was achieved in a flow-through reactor using a novel bioinorganic catalyst ("MM-bio-Pd(0)"), which was produced by single-step reduction of platinum group metals (PGM) from industrial waste solution onto biomass of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 29577. Two flow-through reactor systems were compared using both "MM-bioPd(0)" and chemically reduced Pd(0). Reactors containing the latter removed Cr(VI) for 1 week only at the expense of formate as the electron donor, whereas the former gave complete Cr(VI) removal for 3 months of continuous operation. Mass balance analysis showed 100% reduction of Cr(VI) to soluble Cr(III) in the bioreactor exit solution. With the use of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) no intermediate Cr(V) species could be detected. Pd(0) was biodeposited similarly using Escherichia coliMC4100 and "bio-Pd(0)". The latter was used to recover Pd(II) from two acidic industrial waste leachates to generate two types of "MM-bio-Pd(0)": "SI-bio-Pd(0)" and "SII-bio-Pd(0)", respectively. The biomaterial composition was comparable in both cases, and the catalytic activity was related inversely to the amount of chloride in the waste leachate from which it was derived.
TI  - Comparison of the structural and kinetic properties of the cytochrome c nitrite reductases from Escherichia coli, Wolinella succinogenes, Sulfurospirillum deleyianum and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans.
AB  - The recent crystallographic characterization of NrfAs from Sulfurospirillum deleyianum, Wolinella succinogenes, Escherichia coli and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans allows structurally conserved regions to be identified. Comparison of nitrite and sulphite reductase activities from different bacteria shows that the relative activities vary according to organism. By comparison of both amino acid sequences and structures, differences can be identified in the monomer-monomer interface and the active-site channel; these differences could be responsible for the observed variance in substrate activity and indicate that subtle changes in the NrfA structure may optimize the enzyme for different roles.
TI  - Caseinoglycomacropeptide inhibits adhesion of pathogenic Escherichia coli strains to human cells in culture.
AB  - Caseinoglycomacropeptide (CGMP) derived from kappa-casein was investigated for its ability to inhibit the adhesion of 3 strains of verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) and 3 strains of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) to human HT29 tissue cell cultures. Effects on adhesion of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus gasseri were also investigated. Generally, CGMP exerted effective anti-adhesive properties at a dose of 2.5 mg/mL, albeit with a high degree of strain specificity. The CGMP reduced adhesion of VTEC strains to <50% of the control and reduced adhesion of EPEC strains to between 80 and 10% of the control. The CGMP also reduced the adhesion of L. pentosus and L. casei to 44 and 42%, respectively. A slight but significant reduction of L. acidophilus, to 81%, was observed, but no significant effects were detected with either Dsv. desulfuricans or L. gasseri. Further investigation of the dose response relationships with the E. coli strains gave IC50 values ranging between 0.12 and 1.06 mg/mL.
TI  - Biochemical-genetic analysis and distribution of DES-1, an Ambler class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamase from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans.
AB  - Desulfovibrio spp. are gram-negative anaerobes phylogenetically related to Bacteroides spp., which are rarely isolated and which are mostly isolated from intra-abdominal abscesses. Desulfovibrio desulfuricans clinical isolate D3 had a clavulanic acid-inhibited beta-lactam resistance profile and was resistant to some expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. A beta-lactamase gene, bla(DES-1), was cloned from whole-cell DNA of isolate D3 and expressed in Escherichia coli. Purified beta-lactamase DES-1, with a pI value of 9.1, had a relative molecular mass of ca. 31 kDa and a mature protein of 288 amino acids. DES-1 was distantly related to Ambler class A beta-lactamases and most closely related to PenA from Burkholderia pseudomallei (48% amino acid identity). It was weakly related to class A beta-lactamases CblA, CepA, CfxA, and CfxA2 from other anaerobic species, Bacteroides spp. and Prevotella intermedia. Its hydrolysis spectrum included amino- and ureidopenicillins, narrow-spectrum cephalosporins, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone. bla(DES-1)-like genes were not identified in phylogenetically related Desulfovibrio fairfieldensis isolates. However, they were found in some but not all D. desulfuricans strains, thus suggesting that these genes may be present in a given D. desulfuricans subspecies.
TI  - Presence of the cofactor speeds up folding of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans flavodoxin.
AB  - Flavodoxin is an alpha/beta protein with a noncovalently bound flavin-mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor. The apo-protein adopts a structure identical to that of the holo-form, although there is more dynamics in the FMN-binding loops. The equilibrium unfolding processes of Azotobacter vinelandii apo-flavodoxin, and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC strain 27774 apo- and holo-flavodoxins involve rather stable intermediates. In contrast, we here show that both holo- and apo-forms of flavodoxin from D. desulfuricans ATCC strain 29577 (75% sequence similarity with the strain 27774 protein) unfold in two-state equilibrium processes. Moreover, the FMN cofactor remains bound to the unfolded holo-protein. The folding and unfolding kinetics for holo-flavodoxin exhibit two-state behavior, albeit an additional slower phase is present at very low denaturant concentrations. The extrapolated folding time in water for holo-flavodoxin, approximately 280 microsec, is in excellent agreement with that predicted from the protein's native-state topology. Unlike the holo-protein behavior, the folding and unfolding reactions for apo-flavodoxin are best described by two kinetic phases, with rates differing approximately 15-fold, suggesting the presence of a kinetic intermediate. Both folding phases for apo-flavodoxin are orders of magnitude slower (40- and 530-fold, respectively) than that for the holo-protein. We conclude that polypeptide-cofactor interactions in the unfolded state of D. desulfuricans strain 29577 flavodoxin alter the kinetic-folding path towards two-state and speed up the folding reaction.
TI  - Expression of a Desulfovibrio tetraheme cytochrome c in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A tetraheme cytochrome c was successfully overexpressed for the first time in Escherichia coli. Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774 tetraheme cytochrome c(3) was expressed in aerobically grown Escherichia coli cotransformed with Escherichia coli ccm gene cluster (Arslan et al. (1998) Bioch. Biophys. Res. Commun. 251, 744-747). The analysis of the produced cytochrome showed that the signal peptide was correctly cleaved, the four heme groups were inserted and the electronic structure around the heme irons was conserved, i.e., the recombinant tetraheme cytochrome was identical to that isolated from the native source. Contradicting previous results which indicated that Escherichia coli was only capable of producing apocytochrome c(3) (Pollock et al. (1989) J. Gen. Microbiol. 135, 2319-2328), the present work proves unequivocally that the holoform can also be obtained.
TI  - Microbial reduction of technetium by Escherichia coli and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans: enhancement via the use of high-activity strains and effect of process parameters.
AB  - Escherichia coli and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans reduce Tc(VII) (TcO(4)(-)) with  formate or hydrogen as electron donors. The reaction is catalyzed by the hydrogenase component of the formate hydrogenlyase complex (FHL) of E. coli and is associated with a periplasmic hydrogenase activity in D. desulfuricans. Tc(VII) reduction in E. coli by H(2) and formate was either inhibited or repressed by 10 mM nitrate. By contrast, Tc(VII) reduction catalyzed by D. desulfuricans was less sensitive to nitrate when formate was the electron donor, and unaffected by 10 mM or 100 mM nitrate when H(2) was the electron donor. The optimum pH for Tc(VII) reduction by both organisms was 5.5 and the optimum temperature was 40 degrees C and 20 degrees C for E. coli and D. desulfuricans, respectively. Both strains had an apparent K(m) for Tc(VII) of 0.5 mM, but Tc(VII) was removed from a solution of 300 nM TcO(4)(-) within 30 h by D. desulfuricans at the expense of H(2). The greater bioprocess potential of D. desulfuricans was shown also by the K(s) for formate (>25 mM and 0.5 mM for E. coli and D. desulfuricans, respectively), attributable to the more accessible, periplasmic localization of the enzyme in the latter. The relative rates of Tc(VII) reduction for E. coli and D. desulfuricans (with H(2)) were 12.5 and 800 micromol Tc(VII) reduced/g biomass/h, but the use of an E. coli HycA mutant (which upregulates FHL activities by approx. 50%) had a similarly enhancing effect on the rate of Tc reduction. The more rapid reduction of Tc(VII) by D. desulfuricans compared with the E. coli strains was also shown using cells immobilized in a hollow-fiber reactor, in which the flow residence times sustaining steady-state removal of 80% of the radionuclide were 24.3 h for the wild-type E. coli, 4.25 h for the upregulated mutant, and 1.5 h for D. desulfuricans.
TI  - Application of a tetrazolium dye as an indicator of viability in anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The use of the redox dye 5-cyano-2,3,-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) for evaluating the metabolic activity of aerobic bacteria has gained wide application in recent years. In this study, we examined the utility of CTC in capturing the metabolic activity of anaerobic bacteria. In addition, the factors contributing to abiotic reduction of CTC were also examined. CTC was used in conjunction with the fluorochrome 5-(4,6-dichlorotriazinyl) aminofluorescein (DTAF), that targets bacterial cell wall proteins, to quantitate the active fraction of total bacterial numbers. Facultative anaerobic bacteria, including Escherichia coli grown fermentatively, and Pseudomonas chlorophis, P. fluorescens, P. stutzeri, and P. pseudoalcalegenes subsp. pseudoalcalegenes grown under nitrate-reducing conditions, actively reduced CTC during all phases of growth. Greater than 95% of these cells accumulated intracellular CTC-formazan crystals during the exponential phase. Obligate anaerobic bacteria, including Syntrophus aciditrophicus grown fermentatively, Geobacter sulfurreducens grown with fumarate as the electron acceptor, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans and D. halophilus grown under sulfate-reducing conditions, Methanobacterium formicicum grown on formate, H2 and CO2, and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum grown autotrophically on H2 and CO2 all reduced CTC to intracellular CTC-formazan crystals. The optimal CTC concentration for all organisms examined was 5 mM. Anaerobic CTC incubations were not required for quantification of anaerobically grown cells. CTC-formazan production by all cultures examined was proportional to biomass production, and CTC reduction was observed even in the absence of added nutrients. CTC was reduced by culture fluids containing ferric citrate as electron acceptor following growth of either G. metallireducens or G. sulfurreducens. Abiotic reduction of CTC was observed in the presence of ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, dithiothreitol, NADH, NADPH, Fe(II)Cl2, sodium thioglycolic acid and sodium sulfide. These results suggest that while CTC can be used to capture the metabolic activity of anaerobic bacteria, care must be taken to avoid abiotic reduction of CTC.
TI  - Biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of overexpressed fuscoredoxin from Escherichia coli.
AB  - Fuscoredoxin is a unique iron containing protein of yet unknown function originally discovered in the sulfate reducers of the genus Desulfovibrio. It contains two iron-sulfur clusters: a cubane [4Fe-4S] and a mixed oxo- and sulfido-bridged 4Fe cluster of unprecedented structure. The recent determination of the genomic sequence of Escherichia coli (E. coli) has revealed a homologue of fuscoredoxin in this facultative microbe. The presence of this gene in E. coli raises interesting questions regarding the function of fuscoredoxin and whether this gene represents a structural homologue of the better-characterized Desulfovibrio proteins. In order to explore the latter, an overexpression system for the E. coli fuscoredoxin gene was devised. The gene was cloned from genomic DNA by use of the polymerase chain reaction into the expression vector pT7-7 and overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. After two chromatographic steps a good yield of recombinant protein was obtained (approximately 4 mg of pure protein per liter of culture). The purified protein exhibits an optical spectrum characteristic of the homologue from D. desulfuricans, indicating that cofactor assembly was accomplished. Iron analysis indicated that the protein contains circa 8 iron atoms/molecule which were shown by EPR and Mossbauer spectroscopies to be present as two multinuclear clusters, albeit with slightly altered spectroscopic features. A comparison of the primary sequences of fuscoredoxins is presented and differences on cluster coordination modes are discussed on the light of the spectroscopic data.
TI  - Crystal structure of the first dissimilatory nitrate reductase at 1.9 A solved by MAD methods.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The periplasmic nitrate reductase (NAP) from the sulphate reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774 is induced by growth on nitrate and catalyses the reduction of nitrate to nitrite for respiration. NAP is a molybdenum-containing enzyme with one bis-molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (MGD) cofactor and one [4Fe-4S] cluster in a single polypeptide chain of 723 amino acid residues. To date, there is no crystal structure of a nitrate reductase. RESULTS: The first crystal structure of a dissimilatory (respiratory) nitrate reductase was determined at 1.9 A resolution by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) methods. The structure is folded into four domains with an alpha/beta-type topology and all four domains are involved in cofactor binding. The [4Fe-4S] centre is located near the periphery of the molecule, whereas the MGD cofactor extends across the interior of the molecule interacting with residues from all four domains. The molybdenum atom is located at the bottom of a 15 A deep crevice, and is positioned 12 A from the [4Fe-4S] cluster. The structure of NAP reveals the details of the catalytic molybdenum site, which is coordinated to two MGD cofactors, Cys140, and a water/hydroxo ligand. A facile electron-transfer pathway through bonds connects the molybdenum and the [4Fe-4S] cluster. CONCLUSIONS: The polypeptide fold of NAP and the arrangement of the cofactors is related to that of Escherichia coli formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and distantly resembles dimethylsulphoxide reductase. The close structural homology of NAP and FDH shows how small changes in the vicinity of the molybdenum catalytic site are sufficient for the substrate specificity.
TI  - The superoxide dismutase activity of desulfoferrodoxin from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774.
AB  - Desulfoferrodoxin (Dfx), a small iron protein containing two mononuclear iron centres (designated centre I and II), was shown to complement superoxide dismutase (SOD) deficient mutants of Escherichia coli [Pianzzola, M.J., Soubes M. & Touati, D. (1996) J. Bacteriol. 178, 6736-6742]. Furthermore, neelaredoxin, a protein from Desulfovibrio gigas containing an iron site similar to centre II of Dfx, was recently shown to have a significant SOD activity [Silva, G., Oliveira, S., Gomes, C.M., Pacheco, I., Liu, M.Y., Xavier, A.V., Teixeira, M., Le Gall, J. & Rodrigues-Pousada, C. (1999) Eur. J. Biochem. 259, 235-243]. Thus, the SOD activity of Dfx isolated from the sulphate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774 was studied. The protein exhibits a SOD activity of 70 U x mg-1, which increases approximately 2.5-fold upon incubation with cyanide. Cyanide binds specifically to Dfx centre II, yielding a low-spin iron species with g-values at 2.27 (g perpendicular) and 1.96 (g parallel). Upon reaction of fully oxidized Dfx with the superoxide generating system xanthine/xanthine oxidase, Dfx centres I and II become partially reduced, suggesting that Dfx operates by a redox cycling mechanism, similar to those proposed for other SODs. Evidence for another SOD in D. desulfuricans is also presented - this enzyme is inhibited by cyanide, and N-terminal sequence data strongly indicates that it is an analogue to Cu,Zn-SODs isolated from other sources. This is the first indication that a Cu-containing protein may be present in a sulphate-reducing bacterium.
TI  - 15N-labelling and preliminary heteronuclear NMR study of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough cytochrome c553.
AB  - When using heteronuclear NMR, 15N-labelling is necessary for structural analysis, dynamic studies and determination of complex formation. The problems that arise with isotopic labelling of metalloproteins are due to their complex maturation process, which involves a large number of factors. Cytochromes c are poorly expressed in Escherichia coli and the overexpression that is necessary for 15N-labelling, requires an investigation of the expression host and special attention to growth conditions. We have succeeded in the heterologous expression and the complete and uniform isotopic 15N-labelling of the cytochrome c553 from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough, in a sulphate-reducing bacterium, D. desulfuricans G200, by using a growth medium combining 15N-ammonium chloride and 15N-Celtone. These conditions allowed us to obtain approximately 0.8 mg x L-1 of pure labelled cytochrome c553. 1H and 15N-assignments for both the oxidized and the reduced states of cytochrome c553 were obtained from two-dimensional heteronuclear experiments. Pseudocontact effects due to the haem Fe3+ have been analysed for the first time through 15N and 1H chemical shifts in a c-type cytochrome.
TI  - Growth of a human intestinal Desulfovibrio desulfuricans in continuous cultures containing defined populations of saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting bacteria.
AB  - Ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (SRB) Desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). Reproducible defined bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: Bifidobacterium longum, Bif. adolescentis, Bif. pseudolongum, Bif. infantis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bact. vulgatus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Cl. butyricum, Cl. innocuum, Cl. bifermentans. Lactobacillus and Cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. Inclusion of Des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly Bif. longum, Cl. perfringens and Bif. pseudolongum. The two bacteroides species were unaffected by Des. desulfuricans, while numbers of Cl. butyricum increased. Extensive wall growth developed in the SRB culture, consisting mainly of Des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), Bact. thetaiotaomicron and Bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, Cl. perfringens and Bif. longum. Wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures. Chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (C15) and bifidobacterial (C18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-C15:0, C16:0, i-C17:1) could be identified. The metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the SRB chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. High concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were detected in the SRB chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. Saccharolytic organisms growing in the SRB fermenter utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. Profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the SRB culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.
TI  - Characterisation of a new rubredoxin isolated from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans 27774: definition of a new family of rubredoxins.
AB  - A new rubredoxin from the sulphate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774, grown with nitrate as terminal electron acceptor, was isolated and characterised. The protein is an 8.5 kDa monomer containing one iron atom per molecule, with a reduction potential of 25 +/- 5 mV at pH 7.6. Like the recombinant Rdl protein from D. vulgaris, expressed in Escherichia coli [Lumpio, H.L., Shenvi, N.V., Garg, R.P., Summers, A.O. and Kurtz, D.M., J. Bacteriol. 179 (1997) 4607-4615], it contains an unusual spacing of four amino acids between the first two of the iron coordinating cysteinyl residues. This difference is reflected in the structure of the iron centre, as observed by visible and EPR spectroscopies. All together, these features make these proteins the first members of a new family of rubredoxins.
TI  - New shuttle vectors for the introduction of cloned DNA in Desulfovibrio.
AB  - The pBG1 replicon from the cryptic plasmid of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans G100A was inserted into pTZ18U derivatives to generate a new family of shuttle vectors. These plasmids are stable both in Escherichia coli and in Desulfovibrio, they present a large number of unique restriction sites, and colonies of recombinant clones can be identified by blue/white screening in E. coli. The pBMC, pBMK, and pBMS series carry the cat, npt, or strAB genes as selectable markers, respectively. The pBMC6, pBMK6, and pBMS6 plasmids can be introduced both in D. desulfuricans and in Desulfovibrio fructosovorans by electrotransformation, and the pBMC7, pBMK7, and pBMS7 plasmids contain additional mobilization functions which makes them suitable for conjugation.
TI  - Evidence for the bacterial origin of genes encoding fermentation enzymes of the amitochondriate protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica.
AB  - Entamoeba histolytica is an amitochondriate protozoan parasite with numerous bacterium-like fermentation enzymes including the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (POR), ferredoxin (FD), and alcohol dehydrogenase E (ADHE). The goal of this study was to determine whether the genes encoding these cytosolic E. histolytica fermentation enzymes might derive from a bacterium by horizontal transfer, as has previously been suggested for E. histolytica genes encoding heat shock protein 60, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase. In this study, the E. histolytica por gene and the adhE gene of a second amitochondriate protozoan parasite, Giardia lamblia, were sequenced, and their phylogenetic positions were estimated in relation to POR, ADHE, and FD cloned from eukaryotic and eubacterial organisms. The E. histolytica por gene encodes a 1,620-amino-acid peptide that contained conserved iron-sulfur- and thiamine pyrophosphate-binding sites. The predicted E. histolytica POR showed fewer positional identities to the POR of G. lamblia (34%) than to the POR of the enterobacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae (49%), the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. (44%), and the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis (46%), which targets its POR to anaerobic organelles called hydrogenosomes. Maximum-likelihood, neighbor-joining, and parsimony analyses also suggested as less likely E. histolytica POR sharing more recent common ancestry with G. lamblia POR than with POR of bacteria and the T. vaginalis hydrogenosome. The G. lamblia adhE encodes an 888-amino-acid fusion peptide with an aldehyde dehydrogenase at its amino half and an iron-dependent (class 3) ADH at its carboxy half. The predicted G. lamblia ADHE showed extensive positional identities to ADHE of Escherichia coli (49%), Clostridium acetobutylicum (44%), and E. histolytica (43%) and lesser identities to the class 3 ADH of eubacteria and yeast (19 to 36%). Phylogenetic analyses inferred a closer relationship of the E. histolytica ADHE to bacterial ADHE than to the G. lamblia ADHE. The 6-kDa FD of E. histolytica and G. lamblia were most similar to those of the archaebacterium Methanosarcina barkeri and the delta-purple bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, respectively, while the 12-kDa FD of the T. vaginalis hydrogenosome was most similar to the 12-kDa FD of gamma-purple bacterium Pseudomonas putida. E. histolytica genes (and probably G. lamblia genes) encoding fermentation enzymes therefore likely derive from bacteria by horizontal transfer, although it is not clear from which bacteria these amebic genes derive. These are the first nonorganellar fermentation enzymes of eukaryotes implicated to have derived from bacteria.
TI  - DcrA, a c-type heme-containing methyl-accepting protein from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough, senses the oxygen concentration or redox potential of the environment.
AB  - The amino acid sequence of DcrA from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough, a strictly anaerobic, sulfate-reducing bacterium, indicated homology with the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins from enteric bacteria (A. Dolla, R. Fu, M. J. Brumlik, and G. Voordouw, J. Bacteriol. 174:1726-1733, 1992). The homology is restricted to the cytoplasmic C-terminal signaling domain. The periplasmic N-terminal sensor domain was found to contain a unique sequence, CHHCH, corresponding to a consensus c-type heme binding site. A pretreated, DcrA-specific polyclonal antiserum, generated against DcrA protein overproduced in Escherichia coli, was used for immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled DcrA from D. vulgaris and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans G200(pJRFR2), a transconjugant that overexpresses functional DcrA. Labeling of the latter with the heme precursor 5-amino-[4-14C]levulinic acid, followed by immunoprecipitation, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and fluorography, confirmed the presence of c-type heme, while labeling with L-[methyl-3H]methionine in the absence of protein synthesis confirmed that DcrA is a methyl-accepting protein. The base liability of the incorporated radioactivity indicated methyl ester formation like that occurring in the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins of enteric bacteria. L-[methyl-3H]methionine labeling of D. desulfuricans G200(pJRFR2) under different conditions indicated that methyl labeling of DcrA decreased upon addition of oxygen and increased upon subsequent addition of the reducing agent dithionite. These results indicate that DcrA may serve as a sensor of oxygen concentration and/or redox potential.
TI  - Overexpression of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough cytochrome c553 in Desulfovibrio desulfuricans G200. Evidence of conformational heterogeneity in the oxidized protein by NMR.
AB  - Plasmid pRC41, containing the cyf gene encoding cytochrome c533 from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough, was transferred by conjugation from Escherichia coli to Desulfovibrio desulfuricans G200. The structural properties of the purified protein were studied by one-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR. A heterogeneity in the folding of the cytochrome isolated from D. vulgaris Hildenborough and from D. desulfuricans G200 was observed for the oxidized from. Temperature, pH and salt-dependence studies indicated that the heterogeneity does not result from an intermediate in the protein unfolding process, but derives from two conformations which are not in dynamic equilibrium.
TI  - The hmc operon of Desulfovibrio vulgaris subsp. vulgaris Hildenborough encodes a  potential transmembrane redox protein complex.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the hmc operon from Desulfovibrio vulgaris subsp. vulgaris Hildenborough indicated the presence of eight open reading frames, encoding proteins Orf1 to Orf6, Rrf1, and Rrf2. Orf1 is the periplasmic, high-molecular-weight cytochrome (Hmc) containing 16 c-type hemes and described before (W. B. R. Pollock, M. Loutfi, M. Bruschi, B. J. Rapp-Giles, J. D. Wall, and G. Voordouw, J. Bacteriol. 173:220-228, 1991). Orf2 is a transmembrane redox protein with four iron-sulfur clusters, as indicated by its similarity to DmsB from Escherichia coli. Orf3, Orf4, and Orf5 are all highly hydrophobic, integral membrane proteins with similarities to subunits of NADH dehydrogenase or cytochrome c reductase. Orf6 is a cytoplasmic redox protein containing two iron-sulfur clusters, as indicated by its similarity to the ferredoxin domain of [Fe] hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio species. Rrf1 belongs to the family of response regulator proteins, while the function of Rrf2 cannot be derived from the gene sequence. The expression of individual genes in E. coli with the T7 system confirmed the open reading frames for Orf2, Orf6, and Rrf1. Deletion of 0.4 kb upstream from orf1 abolished the expression of Hmc in D. desulfuricans G200, indicating this region to contain the hmc operon promoter. The expression of two truncated hmc genes in D. desulfuricans G200 resulted in stable periplasmic c-type cytochromes, confirming the domain structure of Hmc. We propose that Hmc and Orf2 to Orf6 form a transmembrane protein complex that allows electron flow from the periplasmic hydrogenases to the cytoplasmic enzymes that catalyze the reduction of sulfate. The domain structure of Hmc may be required to allow interaction with multiple hydrogenases.
TI  - Characterization of a small plasmid from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans and its use  for shuttle vector construction.
AB  - A 2.3-kb plasmid present in about 20 copies per genome was identified in extracts of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans G100A and designated pBG1. It appears to be unable to replicate in Escherichia coli. Although composite plasmids of pBG1 inserted into pTZ18U are stable in E. coli, few if any pBG1-specific transcripts are detectable. The plasmid sequence reveals several features typical of the origin of replication of non-ColE1 enterobacterial plasmids as well as several potential open reading frames. This small replicon has been shown to support the replication of recombinant plasmids in D. desulfuricans G100A and Desulfovibrio fructosovorans. A conjugable shuttle vector has been constructed.
TI  - Overproduction of prismane protein in Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Hildenborough): evidence for a second S = 1/2-spin system in the one-electron reduced state.
AB  - The gene encoding the prismane protein from Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Hildenborough) was inserted into broad-host-range vector pSUP104. The recombinant plasmid, pJSP104, was transferred to D. vulgaris by conjugal plasmid transfer. In the transconjugant D. vulgaris cells the prismane protein was 25-fold overproduced. The overproduced prismane protein was characterized by molecular mass, isoelectric point, iron content and spectroscopical properties. Both the iron content and the ultraviolet/visible spectrum are identical to the wild-type protein indicating that iron incorporation in the overproduced protein is complete. EPR spectra of the dithionite-reduced form of the overproduced protein indicated that the Fe-S cluster might occur in a similar structure as found in inorganic model compounds containing a [6Fe-6S] prismane core. The as-isolated overproduced protein showed the presence of a second S = 1/2 spin system that was also detected in the corresponding prismane protein from D. desulfuricans (ATCC 27774), but not in the protein from wild-type D. vulgaris. This additional signal was irreversibly transformed to the 'wild-type' high-spin and low-spin systems upon two reduction/re-oxidation cycles. It is shown that the EPR spectroscopy of the overproduced prismane protein is very similar to that of the D. desulfuricans enzyme and, with the exception of the second S = 1/2 spin system, to that of the prismane protein from wild-type D. vulgaris. Contrary to claims for the D. desulfuricans protein, it is shown here that all data can be fully explained assuming a single [6Fe-6S] cluster, that might be titrated into four different redox states and occurs in up to three different spin systems in the one-electron reduced state.
TI  - Plasmid transfer by conjugation in Desulfovibrio desulfuricans.
AB  - Conjugational transfer of several IncQ plasmids from Escherichia coli to the strictly anaerobic, sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans strain G100A was demonstrated. Plasmid DNA from exconjugants was visualized on agarose gels and was used to transform E. coli to the appropriate antibiotic resistances. Neither transfer of IncW and IncP plasmids to strain G100A, nor transfer of any plasmid to D. desulfuricans strain ATCC 27774 was observed. Conjugation of suicide plasmids containing either Tn5 or Tn9 into D. desulfuricans did not result in detectable transposition. Optimal conditions for conjugational transfer and antibiotic resistance levels of strain G100A were examined.
TI  - The third subunit of desulfoviridin-type dissimilatory sulfite reductases.
AB  - In addition to the 50-kDa (alpha) and 40-kDa (beta) subunits, an 11-kDa polypeptide has been discovered in highly purified Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Hildenborough) dissimilatory sulfite reductase. This is in contrast with the hitherto generally accepted alpha 2 beta 2 tetrameric subunit composition. Purification, high-ionic-strength gel-filtration, native electrophoresis and isoelectric focussing do not result in dissociation of the 11-kDa polypeptide from the complex. Densitometric scanning of SDS gels and denaturing gel-filtration indicate a stoichiometric occurrence. A similar 11-kDa polypeptide is present in the desulfoviridin of D. vulgaris oxamicus (Monticello), D. gigas and D. desulfuricans ATCC 27774. We attribute an alpha 2 beta 2 gamma 2 subunit structure to desulfoviridin-type sulfite reductases. N-terminal sequences of the alpha, beta and gamma subunits are reported.
TI  - Possible involvement of a L-delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) reductase in the synthesis of proline in Desulfovibrio desulfuricans Norway.
AB  - A L-delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase activity has been detected in crude extracts of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans Norway. This P5C reductase activity is also found when a 2.5 kb D. desulfuricans DNA fragment is introduced into an Escherichia coli proC mutant. Although it restores growth of the proC mutant, the ProDd enzyme might be detrimental to the E. coli host since the plasmid carrying the cognate proDd gene is segregated at high rate by the cells but is stabilized by small deletions which lead to a loss of the P5C reductase activity.
TI  - Regulation of the hexaheme nitrite/nitric oxide reductase of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, Wolinella succinogenes and Escherichia coli. A mass spectrometric study.
AB  - Dissimilatory nitrite reduction, carried out by hexaheme proteins, gives ammonia  as the final product. Representatives of this enzyme group from 3 bacterial species can also reduce NO to either ammonia or N2O. The redox regulation of the nitrite/nitric oxide activities is discussed in the context of the denitrifying pathway.
TI  - Functional expression of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough cytochrome c3 in Desulfovibrio desulfuricans G200 after conjugational gene transfer from Escherichia coli.
AB  - Plasmid pJRDC800-1, containing the cyc gene encoding cytochrome c3 from Desulfovibrio vulgaris subsp. vulgaris Hildenborough, was transferred by conjugation from Escherichia coli DH5 alpha to Desulfovibrio desulfuricans G200. The G200 strain produced an acidic cytochrome c3 (pI = 5.8), which could be readily separated from the Hildenborough cytochrome c3 (pI = 10.5). The latter was indistinguishable from cytochrome c3 produced by D. vulgaris subsp. vulgaris Hildenborough with respect to a number of chemical and physical criteria.
TI  - Cytoplasmic and periplasmic expression of a synthetic gene for ferredoxin in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A synthetic gene coding for a modified ferredoxin II of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans Norway strain was assembled from 10 oligonucleotides. This gene was cloned into various expression vectors allowing either cytoplasmic expression or export to the periplasmic space. In the latter case, two different constructs were made, each of which contained the OmpA signal peptide: one of these constructs contained 3 additional N-terminal amino acids as compared to the wild-type ferredoxin (56 amino acid residues). The expression of proteins encoded by the 3 constructs was assayed in E coli and the proteins were localized by cell fractionation and immunogold labelling. A low percentage of the periplasmic ferredoxin (approximately 5%) was secreted to the medium in the absence of cell lysis. The recombinant ferredoxin was purified and found to be correctly processed by the leader peptidase. However, due to the high cysteine content intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bonds were formed and prevented binding of [4Fe-4S] clusters. Reconstitution experiments using these recombinant proteins are in progress.
TI  - Purification of Vibrio fischeri nitrite reductase and its characterization as a hexaheme c-type cytochrome.
AB  - Dissimilatory nitrite reductase was isolated from anaerobically nitrate-grown Vibrio fischeri cells and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The enzyme catalyzes the six-electron reduction of nitrite to ammonia. Upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, under either nonreducing or reducing conditions, the purified nitrite reductase migrated as a single protein band of Mr 57,000. Gel filtration chromatography revealed a native molecular weight of 58,000, indicating the enzyme as isolated to be present in the monomeric form. Purified nitrite reductase exhibited typical c-type cytochrome absorption spectra with the reduced alpha-band at 552.5 nm. Heme content analysis using the purified preparation indicated the enzyme to contain 5.5 heme c groups per molecule. Iron analysis showed the presence of 5.62 g iron atoms per mole of enzyme and no nonheme irons were detected. These results clearly indicate that, similar to the dissimilatory nitrite reductases from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, Wolinella succinogenes, and Escherichia coli, the V. fischeri nitrite reductase is a hexaheme c-type cytochrome. Amino acid composition of V. fischeri also revealed close similarities to those of the other three hexaheme nitrite reductases previously studied. Based on this information, it is concluded that the four ammonia-forming, dissimilatory nitrite reductases isolated to date represent a homologous group of proteins with the distinct property of being hexaheme c-type cytochromes.
TI  - Reversible activation of hydrogenase from Escherichia coli.
AB  - Hydrogenase from Escherichia coli exhibited low activity when assayed for hydrogen:methyl viologen reductase activity and no activity when assayed for hydrogen-uptake activity with acceptors of high redox potential (dichloroindophenol, methylene blue). Nor did the enzyme as isolated catalyse proton-tritium exchange activity. Incubation under hydrogen resulted in an increase in hydrogen-uptake activity with methyl viologen and the appearance of hydrogen-uptake activity with dichloroindophenol and methylene blue. Following such treatment, the enzyme also readily catalysed isotope exchange. This process is interpreted as the conversion of the hydrogenase from an inactive 'unready' state to an 'active' state. Oxidation of active hydrogenase with dichloroindophenol caused conversion to a state resembling that of the enzyme as isolated but capable of more rapid activation under reducing conditions. This form is termed the 'ready' state. Such interconversions have been reported for hydrogenases from Desulfovibrio gigas and D. desulfuricans, and the possibility that they constitute a regulatory mechanism suggested.
TI  - Cloning in Escherichia coli of genes involved in the synthesis of proline and leucine in Desulfovibrio desulfuricans Norway.
AB  - A library of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans Norway genomic DNA was constructed in Escherichia coli with pBR322 as vector and plasmids able to complement the proA and leuB mutations of the host were screened. It was observed that all the plasmids studied were highly unstable, the insert DNA being rapidly lost under non-selective growth conditions. A 2.75 kb DNA fragment of D. desulfuricans Norway was found to complement E. coli ProA, ProB and ProC deficiencies. From the results of restriction analysis and Southern hybridizations, it is proposed that the genes involved in proline and leucine biosynthesis are clustered on the chromosome of D. desulfuricans Norway.
TI  - Cloning the DdeI restriction-modification system using a two-step method.
AB  - DdeI, a Type II restriction-modification system from the gram-negative anaerobic  bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, recognizes the sequence CTNAG. The system has been cloned into E. coli in two steps. First the methylase gene was cloned into pBR322 and a derivative expressing higher levels was constructed. Then the endonuclease gene was located by Southern blot analyses; BamHI fragments large enough to contain the gene were cloned into pACYC184, introduced into a host containing the methylase gene, and screened for endonuclease activity. Both genes are stably maintained in E. coli on separate but compatible plasmids. The DdeI methylase is shown to be a cytosine methylase. DdeI methylase clones decrease in viability as methylation activity increases in E. coli RR1 (our original cloning strain). Therefore the DdeI system has been cloned and maintained in ER1467, a new E. coli cloning strain engineered to accept cytosine methylases. Finally, it has been demonstrated that a very high level of methylation was necessary in the DdeI system for successful introduction of the active endonuclease gene into E. coli.
TI  - Purification of a hexaheme cytochrome c552 from Escherichia coli K 12 and its properties as a nitrite reductase.
AB  - Anaerobic cytochrome c552 was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration from a mutant of Escherichia coli K 12 that synthesizes an increased amount of this pigment. Several molecular and enzymatic properties of the cytochrome were investigated. Its relative molecular mass was determined to be 69 000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It was found to be an acidic protein that existed in the monomeric form in the native state. From its heme and iron contents, it was concluded to be a hexaheme protein containing six moles of heme c/mole protein. The amino-acid composition and other properties of the purified cytochrome c552 indicated its similarity to Desulfovibrio desulfuricans hexaheme cytochrome. The cytochrome c552 showed nitrite and hydroxylamine reductase activities with benzyl viologen as an artificial electron donor. It catalyzed the reduction of nitrite to ammonia in a six-electron transfer. FMN and FAD also served as electron donors for the nitrite reduction. The apparent Michaelis constants for nitrite and hydroxylamine were 110 microM and 18 mM, respectively. The nitrite reductase activity of the cytochrome c552 was inhibited effectively by cupric ion and cyanide.
TI  - Natural relationship between bacteroides and flavobacteria.
AB  - Comparisons among 16S rRNA sequences from various eubacteria reveal a natural relationship between the bacteroides (represented by the Bacteroides fragilis sequence) and a phylogenetic unit that comprises the flavobacteria, cytophagae, flexibacteria, and others (represented by the Flavobacterium heparinum sequence). Although the relationship is not a close one, it is, nevertheless, specific. rRNAs from these two organisms are not only closer to one another in overall sequence than they are to outgroup species (such as Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens), but they show common idiosyncrasies (i.e., derived characteristics) in both rRNA sequences and higher-order structures.
TI  - The genomes of Desulfovibrio gigas and D. vulgaris.
AB  - Two-dimensional electrophoresis of sequential double-restriction digests showed that the genome of Desulfovibrio gigas compromised 1.63 x 10(6) bp (1.09 x 10(9) Dal) of DNA; an ammonia-limited chemostat population possessed an average of nine genomes per cell and a multiplying batch culture possessed approximately 17 genomes per cell. The genome size of D. vulgaris (Hildenborough) was 1.72 x 10(6) bp (1.14 x 10(9) Dal); a population from an ammonia-limited batch culture contained four genomes per cell. Control digestions and analyses with Escherichia coli GM4 agreed reasonably with published values: a genome size of 3.95 x 10(6) bp and approximately two genomes per cell from a stationary batch culture in glucose minimal medium. Desulfovibrio gigas carried two plasmids of approximately 70 MDal (1.05 x 10(5) bp) and approximately 40 MDal (6 x 10(4) bp); D. vulgaris (Hildenborough) contained one of approximately 130 MDal (1.95 x 10(5) bp). Single plasmids were also detected in a second strain of D. vulgaris and in strain Berre sol of D. desulfuricans but not in 10 other desulfovibrios including representatives of D. desulfuricans, D. vulgaris, D. salexigens and D. africanus.

AB  - In mixed cultures, carbon and electron sources for Desulfovibrio desulfuricans are excreted by Escherichia coli from glucose fermentation. Desulfovibrio produces substrates for Chlorobium strain.
TI  - Hydrogenase measurement with photochemically reduced methyl viologen.
AB  - Methyl viologen was reduced photochemically in the presence of proflavine and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The reduced methyl viologen was oxidized by hydrogenase from Vibrio succinogenes. H(2) and oxidized methyl viologen were the products. Hydrogenase activity was determined by spectrophotometric measurement of the disappearance of reduced methyl viologen at 600 nm. The extinction coefficient of reduced methyl viologen was determined and is 8.25 mm(-1) x cm(-1) at 600 nm. Optimal conditions for assaying V. succinogenes hydrogenase were developed. Extracts of Escherichia coli and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans catalyzed reduced methyl viologen oxidation in the assay system, whereas Azotobacter vinelandii extracts were inactive.
