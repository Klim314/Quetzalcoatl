TI  == [screening, identification and optimization of fermentation conditions of an antagonistic endophyte to mulberry bacterial blight].
AB  == objective: antagonistic endophytic strains with strongly inhibitory activity to mulberry bacterial blight (p. syringae pv. mori) were isolated from mulberry endophytes, we identified the antagonistic endophyte and optimized the fermentation conditions. method: streak plate method was used to separate the endophytes from healthy mulberry tissues after strict surface disinfection. antagonistic endophytes were screened out through inhibition zone method. strain  swg2 was identified by morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics and 16s rdna sequence analysis. the conditions of fermentation and medium composition were optimized through single factor and orthogonal experiment. result: in total 77 endophytic strains have been isolated from healthy mulberry. swg2 showed strong and stable antagonistic activity to mulberry bacterial blight. the morphological, cultural, physiological, and biochemical characteristics assays indicated that swg2 belongs to pantoea sp. the 16s rdna sequence phylogenetic analysis reveals that swg2 appeared a sister lineage to p.  agglomerans. the optimized culture conditions of strain swg2 were liquid volume 20 ml in 100 ml flask, 170 r/min at 28 degrees c, inoculation size of 4% for 5 d  with a medium of 2.0% glycerol, 2.0% nh4no3, 0.1% kh2po4, 0.15% mgso4 x 7h2o at initial ph of 7.5. conclusion: the antagonistic endophytic strain swg2 to mulberry bacterial blight was identified as p. agglomerans. swg2 strain shows stronger antagonistic action to mulberry bacterial blight under optimized fermentation conditions.

TI  == [species composition of agents of the horsetail common (equisetum arvense l.) bacteriosises].
AB  == bacterial diseases of weeds horsetail common (equisetum arvense l.) were revealed in the crops of wheat and soya in the fields of kyiv and vinnitsia regions of ukraine. the distinctive symptoms of bacterial affections on the root neck, on stalks of vegetative and spore shoots, on twigs were brown, dark brown or almost  black necrotic spots of oblong form. the necroses increased in size, embraced the stalks. the stalks broke, the plants dried up. patterns of affected plants, isolated and identified phytopathogenic bacteria pseudomonas syringae, pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, pantoea agglomerans and curtobacterium sp. were analyzed these bacteria caused pathological process on the horsetail common, wheat and soy under the conditions of artificial inoculation. the composition of bacteria species was different in different years depending on temperature conditions of vegetative period.

TI  == [phytopathogenic bacteria of couch-grass in the crops of wheat].
AB  == bacterialdiseases of weeds in the crops of wheat on the fields of kyiv and vinnytsya regions of ukraine elytrigia repens (l.) nevski agropyrum repens l. were revealed. the following symptoms of bacterial affections: the leaves wither, oval or hatched necrotic spots on green leaves, necroses on the stalks, empty-ears, partial blackening of the ear axes, awns, caryopsises, scales, water-soaked or dark brown with violet shade spots on the rhizomes were found. during the vegetation period bacteria were isolated from the affected plants which caused pathological process in the couch-grass and wheat. the pathogenic bacteria were identified as pseudomonas syringae, p. viridiflava, pseudomonas sp., erwinia carotovora pv. carotovora, pantoea agglomerans, the part of yellow-pigmentary isolates were not identified. some psyringae were isolated from the rhizomes during winterthawing. the paper is presented in ukrainian.

TI  == characterization of plasmids that encode streptomycin-resistance in bacterial epiphytes of apple.
AB  == streptomycin resistance in strains of pseudomonas syringae pv. papulans, pantoea  agglomerans and a yellow-pigmented, non-fluorescent pseudomonas sp. (py), isolated from apple orchards in new york and washington states, is predominantly  associated with stra-strb genes carried on conjugal plasmids (r plasmids). none of 128 resistant erwinia amylovora strains from the eastern and western usa hybridized with a stra-strb probe, smp3. resistant py strains transfered r plasmids to ps. syringae pv. papulans and to py in vitro at frequencies of 10(-1)-10(-2) per recipient cell whereas ps. syringae pv. papulans transferred its plasmids at frequencies of 10(-2) to below detectable levels. transfer of r plasmids to p. agglomerans was not detected and resistant p. agglomerans did not  transfer their r plasmids to any recipients. r plasmids were found to be highly diverse as measured by dna fingerprint analysis. transfer-deficient transposon mutants of r plasmid pcpp519 were generated, and 3.9 kb ecori and 3.0 kb smai fragments that hybridized with a tn5 probe were cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences of the 3.9 kb fragment were similar to proteins involved in  replication, nicking at orit, and piliation in other bacteria.
