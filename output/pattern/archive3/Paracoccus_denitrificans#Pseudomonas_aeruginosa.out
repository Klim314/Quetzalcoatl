detergent inhibition of nitric-oxide reductase activity.
gas chromatography revealed that exposure of extracts of the denitrifiers 'achromobacter cycloclastes', paracoccus denitrificans, pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas perfectomarina to triton x-100 inhibited reduction of no to n2o, and thus concomitantly inhibited reduction of no2- to n2o. after exposure of extracts to triton x-100, the ratio of h+ consumed to no2- added decreased from approx. 2.0 (for untreated extracts) to approx. 1.5, which indicated that no2- was reduced to no by the treated extracts. addition of a chaps-soluble extract (devoid of nitrite reductase activity but rich in nitric-oxide reductase activity) to the triton x-100-treated extract of p. denitrificans restored capacity for reduction of no2- on to n2o. exposure to either the no that accumulated from reduction of no2- or to enthetic no transiently inhibited rates of no2- reduction in triton x-100-treated extracts. use of an oxides of nitrogen analyzer indicated that only 5-33% of no2- reduced by untreated extracts appeared in the stripping gas as no, whereas 80-95% of no2- reduced by triton x-100-treated extracts was recovered as no.
comparison of denitrification by pseudomonas stutzeri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and paracoccus denitrificans.
a comparison was made of denitrification by pseudomonas stutzeri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and paracoccus denitrificans. although all three organisms reduced nitrate to dinitrogen gas, they did so at different rates and accumulated different kinds and amounts of intermediates. their rates of anaerobic growth on nitrate varied about 1.5-fold; concomitant gas production varied more than 8-fold. cell yields from nitrate varied threefold. rates of gas production by resting cells incubated with nitrate, nitrite, or nitrous oxide varied 2-, 6-, and 15-fold, respectively, among the three species. the composition of the gas produced also varied markedly: pseudomonas stutzeri produced only dinitrogen; pseudomonas aeruginosa and paracoccus denitrificans produced nitrous oxide as well; and under certain conditions pseudomonas aeruginosa produced even more nitrous oxide than dinitrogen. pseudomonas stutzeri and paracoccus denitrificans rapidly reduced nitrate, nitrite, and nitrous oxide and were able to grow anaerobically when any of these nitrogen oxides were present in the medium. pseudomonas aeruginosa reduced these oxides slowly and was unable to grow anaerobically at the expense of nitrous oxide. furthermore, nitric and nitrous oxide reduction by pseudomonas aeruginosa were exceptionally sensitive to inhibition by nitrite. thus, although it has been well studied physiologically and genetically, pseudomonas aeruginosa may not be the best species for studying the later steps of the denitrification pathway.
inhibition, but not uncoupling, of respiratory energy coupling of three bacterial species by nitrite.
the effect of nitrite on respiratory energy coupling of three bacteria was studied in light of a recent report that nitrite acted as an uncoupling agent with paracoccus denitrificans grown under denitrifying conditions. our determinations of proton translocation stoichiometry of pseudomonas putida (aerobically grown), pseudomonas aeruginosa, and p. denitrificans (grown both aerobically and under denitrifying conditions) showed nitrite inhibition of proton-to-oxidant stoichiometry, but not uncoupling. nitrite both reduced the h+/o ratio and decreased the rate of proton resorption. increased proton resorption rates, characteristic of authentic uncoupling agents, were not observed. the lack of enhanced proton permeability due to nitrite was verified via passive proton permeability assays. the h+/o ratio of p. aeruginosa increased when growth conditions were changed from aerobic to denitrifying. this suggested the induction of an additional coupling site in the electron transport chain of denitrifying p. aeruginosa.
