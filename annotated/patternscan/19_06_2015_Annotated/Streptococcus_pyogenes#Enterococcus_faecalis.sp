TI  == a derivative of the thiopeptide ge2270a highly selective against propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == a chemical derivative of the thiopeptide ge2270a, designated nai003, was found to possess a substantially reduced antibacterial spectrum in comparison to the parent compound, being active against just a few gram-positive bacteria. in particular, nai003 retained low mics against all tested isolates of propionibacterium acnes and, to a lesser extent, against enterococcus faecalis. furthermore, nai003 showed a time- and dose-dependent killing of both a clindamycin-resistant and a clindamycin-sensitive p. acnes isolate. gel-shift experiments indicated that, like the parent compound, nai003 retained the ability to bind to elongation factors (ef) tu derived from escherichia coli, e. faecalis  or p. acnes, albeit with reduced efficiency. in contrast, ef-tu's derived from the nai003-insenstitive staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes did not bind this compound. these results were confirmed by in vitro studies using a hybrid translation system, which indicated that nai003 can inhibit most efficiently protein synthesis driven by the p. acnes ef-tu. p. acnes mutants resistant to nai003 were isolated by direct plating. with one exception, all analyzed strains carried mutation in the tuf gene, encoding ef-tu. because of its selective effect on p. acnes in comparison to resident skin flora, nai003 represents a promising candidate for the topical treatment of acne, which has already completed a phase 1 clinical study.

TI  == decade-long use of the antimicrobial peptide combination tyrothricin does not pose a major risk of acquired resistance with gram-positive bacteria and candida  spp.
AB  == tyrothricin, an antimicrobial peptide combination produced by bacillus brevis consisting of gramicidins and tyrocidins commands broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria and some yeasts in vitro. the polypeptide and its  components have been used therapeutically for about 60 years in the local treatment of infected skin and infected oro-pharyngeal mucous membranes. though older studies suggest that resistance development of originally susceptible microorganisms towards tyrothricin is a rare event, data concerning recent state  of resistance are lacking. in the present in vitro study the susceptibility to tyrothricin of clinical isolates of bacterial and yeast origin from superficial swabs of the skin and mucous membranes of outpatients and inpatients obtained from clinical material in the second half of the year 2003 was determined. using  a microdilution assay, the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic and mic90, defined as the concentration that inhibits at least 90 percent of the tested strains) of 20 strains each of staphylococcus aureus of the variety mssa (susceptible to methicillin), staphylococcus aureus of the variety mrsa (methicillin resistant), staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium spec., candida albicans and candida parapsilosis was determined. all of the tested gram-positive bacteria turned out  to be highly susceptible to tyrothricin with mics </= 4mg/l. the tested yeast strains were susceptible to the polypeptide antibiotic as well, but (with mics of 16 mg/l and 32 mg/l, respectively) to a lesser extent. no acquired resistance of  the tested strains was determined, indicating that the risk of resistance development against topically applied tyrothricin is only marginal, if there is any at all. thus, long-term-, i.e. decade-long use of topically applied tyrothricin and its components in the local treatment of infected skin does not pose a major risk with respect to acquired resistance of originally susceptible gram-positive bacteria and yeasts, not even in the case of staphylococcus aureus, both with mssa and mrsa strains. the broad anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activity of tyrothricin combined with its lacking risk for resistance development make the antimicrobial peptide a valuable addition to our therapeutic armamentarium in the treatment of infected skin.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of prodigiosin isolated from serratia marcescens ufpeda 398.
AB  == prodigiosin is an alkaloid and natural red pigment produced by serratia marcescens. prodigiosin has antimicrobial, antimalarial and antitumor properties  and induces apoptosis in t and b lymphocytes. these properties have piqued the interest of researchers in the fields of medicine, pharmaceutics and different industries. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of prodigiosin against pathogenic micro-organisms. the red pigments produced by s. marcescens exhibited absorption at 534 nm, rf of 0.59 and molecular weight of 323 m/z. antimicrobial activity was tested against oxacillin-resistant escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, acinetobacter sp. and oxacillin-resistant s. aureus. the standard antibiotics employed were ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin and oxacillin. the disc-diffusion tests demonstrated  significant inhibition zones for s. aureus (35 +/- 0.6), e. faecalis (22 +/- 1.0) and s. pyogenes (14 +/- 0.6). however, prodigiosin showed resistance to e. coli,  p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter, where no significant formation of inhibitory halos were observed. we determined the inhibitory minimum concentrations and bactericidal for 20 strains of oxacillin-resistant s. aureus (orsa). the pattern  was the antibiotic oxacillin. the minimum inhibitory concentrations observed ranged from 1, 2 and 4.0 mug/ml, respectively, while the minimum bactericidal concentrations ranged from 2, 4, 8 and 16 mug/ml. the s. marcescens prodigiosin produced by showed bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect showing promising antimicrobial activity and suggesting future studies regarding its applicability  in antibiotics therapies directed orsa.

TI  == bacteriocin protein bacl1 of enterococcus faecalis targets cell division loci and specifically recognizes l-ala2-cross-bridged peptidoglycan.
AB  == bacteriocin 41 (bac41) is produced from clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis and consists of two extracellular proteins, bacl1 and baca. we previously reported that bacl1 protein (595 amino acids, 64.5 kda) is a bacteriolytic peptidoglycan d-isoglutamyl-l-lysine endopeptidase that induces cell lysis of e. faecalis when an accessory factor, baca, is copresent. however,  the target of bacl1 remains unknown. in this study, we investigated the targeting specificity of bacl1. fluorescence microscopy analysis using fluorescent dye-conjugated recombinant protein demonstrated that bacl1 specifically localized at the cell division-associated site, including the equatorial ring, division septum, and nascent cell wall, on the cell surface of target e. faecalis cells. this specific targeting was dependent on the triple repeat of the sh3 domain located in the region from amino acid 329 to 590 of bacl1. repression of cell growth due to the stationary state of the growth phase or to treatment with bacteriostatic antibiotics rescued bacteria from the bacteriolytic activity of bacl1 and baca. the static growth state also abolished the binding and targeting  of bacl1 to the cell division-associated site. furthermore, the targeting of bacl1 was detectable among gram-positive bacteria with an l-ala-l-ala-cross-bridging peptidoglycan, including e. faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, or streptococcus pneumoniae, but not among bacteria with alternate peptidoglycan structures, such as enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, staphylococcus aureus, or listeria monocytogenes. these data suggest that bacl1 specifically targets the l-ala-l-ala-cross-bridged peptidoglycan and potentially  lyses the e. faecalis cells during cell division.

TI  == construction of a chimeric lysin ply187n-v12c with extended lytic activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
AB  == developing chimeric lysins with a wide lytic spectrum would be important for treating some infections caused by multiple pathogenic bacteria. in the present work, a novel chimeric lysin (ply187n-v12c) was constructed by fusing the catalytic domain (ply187n) of the bacteriophage lysin ply187 with the cell binding domain (146-314aa, v12c) of the lysin plyv12. the results showed that the chimeric lysin ply187n-v12c had not only lytic activity similar to ply187n against staphylococcal strains but also extended its lytic activity to streptococci and enterococci, such as streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis, which ply187n could not lyse. our work demonstrated that generating novel chimeric lysins with an extended lytic spectrum was feasible through fusing a catalytic domain with a cell-binding domain from lysins with lytic spectra across multiple genera.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from ankober district, north shewa zone, amhara region, ethiopia.
AB  == context: traditional medicinal plants have long been used in ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still  poorly known. objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in ankober district. methods: about 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: plant extracts from embelia schimperi vatke (myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 64 microg/ml against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. pyogenes. growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of ocimum lamiifolium hochst. (lamiaceae) against s. pyogenes, and those of rubus steudneri schweinf. (rosaceae) against s. epidermidis at an mic value of 128 microg/ml. generally, 74% of ethanol extracts  (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial  strains tested at an mic value of 512 microg/ml or below. discussion and conclusions: results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed  strong antimicrobial activities.

TI  == photocatalytic antibacterial effects are maintained on resin-based tio2 nanocomposites after cessation of uv irradiation.
AB  == photocatalysis induced by tio2 and uv light constitutes a decontamination and antibacterial strategy utilized in many applications including self-cleaning environmental surfaces, water and air treatment. the present work reveals that antibacterial effects induced by photocatalysis can be maintained even after the  cessation of uv irradiation. we show that resin-based composites containing 20% tio2 nanoparticles continue to provide a pronounced antibacterial effect against  the pathogens escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis for up to two hours post uv. for biomaterials or implant coatings, where direct uv illumination is not feasible, a prolonged antibacterial effect after the cessation of the illumination would offer new unexplored treatment possibilities.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == rapid detection of gram-positive organisms by use of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the bact/alert pediatric fan system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == organism-adapted specificity of the allosteric regulation of pyruvate kinase in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == pyruvate kinase (pyk) is a critical allosterically regulated enzyme that links glycolysis, the primary energy metabolism, to cellular metabolism. lactic acid bacteria rely almost exclusively on glycolysis for their energy production under  anaerobic conditions, which reinforces the key role of pyk in their metabolism. these organisms are closely related, but have adapted to a huge variety of native environments. they include food-fermenting organisms, important symbionts in the  human gut, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens. in contrast to the rather conserved inhibition of pyk by inorganic phosphate, the activation of pyk shows high variability in the type of activating compound between different lactic acid bacteria. system-wide comparative studies of the metabolism of lactic acid bacteria are required to understand the reasons for the diversity of these closely related microorganisms. these require knowledge of the identities of the  enzyme modifiers. here, we predict potential allosteric activators of pyks from three lactic acid bacteria which are adapted to different native environments. we used protein structure-based molecular modeling and enzyme kinetic modeling to predict and validate potential activators of pyk. specifically, we compared the electrostatic potential and the binding of phosphate moieties at the allosteric binding sites, and predicted potential allosteric activators by docking. we then  made a kinetic model of lactococcus lactis pyk to relate the activator predictions to the intracellular sugar-phosphate conditions in lactic acid bacteria. this strategy enabled us to predict fructose 1,6-bisphosphate as the sole activator of the enterococcus faecalis pyk, and to predict that the pyks from streptococcus pyogenes and lactobacillus plantarum show weaker specificity for their allosteric activators, while still having fructose 1,6-bisphosphate play the main activator role in vivo. these differences in the specificity of allosteric activation may reflect adaptation to different environments with different concentrations of activating compounds. the combined computational approach employed can readily be applied to other enzymes.

TI  == kinetic characterization of arginine deiminase and carbamate kinase from streptococcus pyogenes m49.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus, gas) is an important human pathogen causing mild superficial infections of skin and mucous membranes, but also life-threatening systemic diseases. s. pyogenes and other prokaryotic organisms use the arginine deiminase system (ads) for survival in acidic environments. in this study, the arginine deiminase (ad), and carbamate kinase (ck) from s. pyogenes m49 strain 591 were heterologously expressed in escherichia coli dh5alpha, purified, and kinetically characterized. ad and ck from s. pyogenes m49 share high amino acid sequence similarity with the respective enzymes from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis il1403 (45.6% and 53.5% identical amino acids) and enterococcus faecalis v583 (66.8% and 66.8% identical amino acids). we found that the arginine deiminase of s. pyogenes is not allosterically regulated by the intermediates and products of the arginine degradation (e.g., atp, citrulline, carbamoyl phosphate). the km and vmax values for arginine were 1.13+/-0.12mm (mean+/-sd) and 1.51+/-0.07mumol/min/mg protein. the carbamate kinase is inhibited by atp but unaffected by arginine and citrulline. the km and  vmax values for adp were 0.72+/-0.08mm and 1.10+/-0.10mumol/min/mg protein and the km for carbamoyl phosphate was 0.65+/-0.07mm. the optimum ph and temperature  for both enzymes were 6.5 and 37 degrees c, respectively.

AB  == despite high similarity in sequence and catalytic properties, the l-lactate dehydrogenases (ldhs) in lactic acid bacteria (lab) display differences in their  regulation that may arise from their adaptation to different habitats. we combined experimental and computational approaches to investigate the effects of  fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (fbp), phosphate (pi), and ionic strength (nacl concentration) on six ldhs from four labs studied at ph 6 and ph 7. we found that 1) the extent of activation by fbp (kact) differs. lactobacillus plantarum ldh is not regulated by fbp, but the other ldhs are activated with increasing sensitivity in the following order: enterococcus faecalis ldh2 </= lactococcus lactis ldh2 < e. faecalis ldh1 < l. lactis ldh1 </= streptococcus pyogenes ldh. this trend reflects the electrostatic properties in the allosteric binding site of the ldh enzymes. 2) for l. plantarum, s. pyogenes, and e. faecalis, the effects of pi are distinguishable from the effect of changing ionic strength by adding nacl. 3) addition of pi inhibits e. faecalis ldh2, whereas in the absence  of fbp, pi is an activator of s. pyogenes ldh, e. faecalis ldh1, and l. lactis ldh1 and ldh2 at ph 6. these effects can be interpreted by considering the computed binding affinities of pi to the catalytic and allosteric binding sites of the enzymes modeled in protonation states corresponding to ph 6 and ph 7. overall, the results show a subtle interplay among the effects of pi, fbp, and ph that results in different regulatory effects on the ldhs of different labs.

TI  == identification of pathogens in mastitis milk samples with fluorescent in situ hybridization.
AB  == traditionally, the bacteriological examination of mastitis milk samples is performed by culture followed by biochemical tests on the cultured bacteria to allow identification of the causative pathogen. depending on the species involved, this classic identification is time-consuming compared to other techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish), a culture-independent method that utilizes oligonucleotides (labeled with a fluorophore) that are specific to a string of target dna/rna. in the current study, the applicability of fish was evaluated for the detection of mastitis pathogens directly in milk samples. to remove interfering lipids and proteins from mastitis milk samples prior to fish, a previously published enzymatic treatment with savinase was evaluated. fish was performed using oligonucleotides  specific for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, and trueperella (arcanobacterium) pyogenes. the enzymatic pretreatment and the sensitivity of fish were evaluated using spiked whole milk samples and mastitis milk samples with bacterial loads of less than 10(3) up to 10(8) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. bacteria were reliably detected in milk samples with bacterial numbers of 10(6) cfu/ml or higher. however, bacteria present in numbers below 10(6) cfu/ml were not detectable in all cases. the ability of fish to identify mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples, and therefore earlier than classical culture methods, can supplement the classic diagnostic procedures for mastitis milk samples.

TI  == novel carbapenem antibiotics for parenteral and oral applications: in vitro and in vivo activities of 2-aryl carbapenems and their pharmacokinetics in laboratory animals.
AB  == sm-295291 and sm-369926 are new parenteral 2-aryl carbapenems with strong activity against major causative pathogens of community-acquired infections such  as methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (including ciprofloxacin-resistant strains), with mic(90)s of </= 1 mug/ml. unlike tebipenem (mic(50), 8 mug/ml), sm-295291 and sm-369926 had no activity against hospital pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic(50), >/=  128 mug/ml). the bactericidal activities of sm-295291 and sm-369926 against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren. the therapeutic efficacies of intravenous administrations of sm-295291 and sm-369926 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren, respectively, reflecting their in vitro activities. sm-295291 and sm-369926 showed intravenous  pharmacokinetics similar to those of meropenem in terms of half-life in monkeys (0.4 h) and were stable against human dehydropeptidase i. sm-368589 and sm-375769, which are medoxomil esters of sm-295291 and sm-369926, respectively, showed good oral bioavailability in rats, dogs, and monkeys (4.2 to 62.3%). thus, 2-aryl carbapenems are promising candidates that show an ideal broad spectrum for the treatment of community-acquired infections, including infections caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, have low selective pressure on antipseudomonal carbapenem-resistant nosocomial pathogens, and allow parenteral,  oral, and switch therapies.

TI  == lantibiotic production by pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesised, post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides produced by gram positive bacteria, many which have broad-ranging antimicrobial activities. lantibiotics have long been the subject of investigation with a view to their application as food preservatives or chemotherapeutic agents for clinical and veterinary medicine, while the associated biosynthetic machinery has been employed for peptide engineering purposes. however, although many lantibiotics are produced by generally regarded  as safe or food-grade bacteria, it is increasingly apparent that a number of gram positive pathogens, including strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus uberis and enterococcus faecalis, also produce these compounds. it is proposed that production of these antimicrobials may provide the associated microorganisms with a competitive advantage when colonizing/infecting  a host, thereby enhancing the virulence of the producing strain. here we review the production of lantibiotics by these pathogens and discuss how their production may contribute to their disease-causing potential.

AB  == this study aimed to establish the vaginal introitus microbial flora in girls with and without symptoms of vulvovaginitis, and to present the distribution of isolated microorganisms by age groups in girls with vulvovaginitis. we enrolled 500 girls with vulvovaginitis symptoms, aged 2-12 years, referred by their pediatricians for microbiological examination of the vaginal introitus swabs, and 30 age-matched asymptomatic girls. similar microbial flora was isolated in both groups, but the symptomatic girls had significantly more common positive microbiological findings compared to controls (p < 0.001). in symptomatic girls,  the following pathogenic bacteria were isolated: streptococcus pyogenes (4.2%), haemophilus influenzae (0.4%), and staphylococcus aureus (5.8%). bacteria of fecal origin were found in vaginal introitus swabs in 33.8% of cases, most commonly proteus mirabilis (14.4%), enterococcus faecalis (12.2%), and escherichia coli (7.0%). the finding of fecal flora was more common compared to controls, reaching a statistical significance (p < 0.05), as well as in girls aged up to 6 years (p < 0.001). candida species were found in 2.4% of girls with  vulvovaginitis symptoms. conclusion: the microbial ecosystem in girls with clinical signs of vulvovaginitis is complex and variable, and the presence of a microorganism does not necessarily imply that it is the cause of infection. the diagnosis of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls requires a complex and comprehensive approach, and microbiological findings should be interpreted in the context of clinical findings.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  == the study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. the aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology  (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, pasteurella multocida, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, e. coli haemolyticus, arcanobacterium pyogenes, streptococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. no mycoplasmas were observed. the present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. during diestrus, e. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. vaginal presence of streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (p = 0.005). therefore, streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. among the 12 antibiotics tested, gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (p = 0.038). however, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. in conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during  proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.

AB  == five new silver(i) complexes of formulas [ag(tpms)] (1), [ag(tpms)(pph(3))] (2),  [ag(tpms)(pcy(3))] (3), [ag(pta)][bf(4)] (4), and [ag(tpms)(pta)] (5) {tpms = tris(pyrazol-1-yl)methanesulfonate, pph(3) = triphenylphosphane, pcy(3) = tricyclohexylphosphane, pta = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane} have been synthesized and fully characterized by elemental analyses, (1)h, (13)c, and (31)p nmr, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (esi-ms), and ir spectroscopic techniques. the single crystal x-ray diffraction study of 3 shows the tpms ligand acting in the n(3)-facially coordinating mode, while in 2 and 5 a n(2)o-coordination is found, with the so(3) group bonded to silver and a pendant  free pyrazolyl ring. features of the tilting in the coordinated pyrazolyl rings in these cases suggest that this inequivalence is related with the cone angles of the phosphanes. a detailed study of antimycobacterial and antiproliferative properties of all compounds has been carried out. they were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29922), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), streptococcus pneumoniae (atcc  49619), streptococcus pyogenes (sf37), streptococcus sanguinis (sk36), streptococcus mutans (ua159), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), and the fungus candida albicans (atcc 24443). complexes 1-5 have been found to display effective antimicrobial activity against the series of bacteria and fungi, and some of them are potential candidates for antiseptic or disinfectant drugs. interaction of ag  complexes with deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) has been studied by fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, using ethidium bromide (eb) as a fluorescence probe of  dna. the decrease in the fluorescence of dna-eb system on addition of ag complexes shows that the fluorescence quenching of dna-eb complex occurs and compound 3 is particularly active. complexes 1-5 exhibit pronounced antiproliferative activity against human malignant melanoma (a375) with an activity often higher than that of agno(3), which has been used as a control, following the same order of activity inhibition on dna, i.e., 3 > 2 > 1 > 5 > agno(3)>> 4.

TI  == high-level fluorescence labeling of gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. we constructed a novel vector based on the e. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pat28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. the plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the camp-factor gene (cfb) promoter of streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pbsu101. upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by facs-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. to assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. we successfully labeled streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the egfp reporter plasmid pbsu101. in all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level egfp expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.

TI  == population biology of gram-positive pathogens: high-risk clones for dissemination of antibiotic resistance.
AB  == infections caused by multiresistant gram-positive bacteria represent a major health burden in the community as well as in hospitalized patients. staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are well-known pathogens of hospitalized patients, frequently linked with resistance  against multiple antibiotics, compromising effective therapy. streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes are important pathogens in the community and s. aureus has recently emerged as an important community-acquired pathogen. population genetic studies reveal that recombination prevails as a driving force  of genetic diversity in e. faecium, e. faecalis, s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes, and thus, these species are weakly clonal. although recombination has a relatively modest role driving the genetic variation of the core genome of s. aureus, the horizontal acquisition of resistance and virulence genes plays a key  role in the emergence of new clinically relevant clones in this species. in this  review, we discuss the population genetics of e. faecium, e. faecalis, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and s. aureus. knowledge of the population structure of these pathogens is not only highly relevant for (molecular) epidemiological research but also for identifying the genetic variation that underlies changes in clinical behaviour, to improve our understanding of the pathogenic behaviour of particular clones and to identify novel targets for vaccines or immunotherapy.

TI  == susceptibility of gram-positive and -negative bacteria to novel nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle technology.
AB  == the rapidly evolving crisis of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms has contributed to the rise of patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial and community-acquired infections. therefore, innovative antimicrobial technology targeting mechanisms to which the bacteria are unlikely to evolve resistance is urgently needed. we have previously described a nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle (no-np) with efficacy against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and acinetobacter baumannii in vitro and in murine wound and abscess models. although the prior findings suggest that the no-np can be a useful therapeutic for skin and soft tissue infections, the antimicrobial spectrum of no-np has yet to be fully elucidated. in the current study, we investigated the efficacy of a no-np against several gram-positive and -negative  clinical isolates. we found that the no-np were uniformly active against all of the streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates examined, including strains that were both sensitive and resistant to commonly used antibiotics. we concluded that the no-np have the potential to serve as a novel broad spectrum antimicrobial agent.

TI  == streptococcus
AB  == the genus streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. among  the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. the nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. for several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: s pyogenes (group a streptococci) and s pneumoniae (pneumococci). in 1984, two members were assigned  a new genus - the group d enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and e faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). in recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. a variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. some of the other medically important streptococci are s agalactiae (group b), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease;  e faecalis (group d), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include s mutans and s sanguis (involved in dental caries), s mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "s milleri" (associated with suppurative  infections in children and adults). there remains persistent taxonomic confusion  regarding "s milleri." these and other streptococci of medical importance are listed intable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.

TI  == ozone in dentistry: microbiological effects of gas action depending on the method and the time of application using the ozonytron device. experimental study.
AB  == introduction: bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal activity of ozone is generally known and has been exploited for years in industry and medicine. ozone  therapy became an inherent element of the treatment of infection in such fields as surgery, dermatology, cosmetics, and dentistry. ozone is a gas, so it penetrates very well even into such tissues and spaces that are not easily accessible. thanks to the property of deep penetration and long ozone presence in tissues after treatment, a long-lasting bactericidal effect is achieved. the action of oxygen radicals is, however, not neutral for the human organism, therefore the use of an appropriate procedure and therapy algorithms is essential. material and methods: we decided to confirm the effect of antibacterial activity of ozone applied by means of the ozonytron device (made by biozonix) on model strains of streptococcus salivarius, pneumonia, pyogenes, and  agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, using two application patterns developed by us. results: we found a statistically significant difference in the size of zones of inhibited bacterial growth on all  media depending on the time of action of ozone. in the present paper, the bactericidal activity of ozone in relation to bacterial strains that are most frequently isolated from the oral cavity was confirmed. what is more, two models  of application of the gas on the infected medium were compared. conclusion: research on the use of ozone in combatting bacteria typical for dental diseases has shown that the gas has an oxidizing effect on these bacteria and is bactericidal.

TI  == characterization of three lactic acid bacteria and their isogenic ldh deletion mutants shows optimization for yatp (cell mass produced per mole of atp) at their physiological phs.
AB  == several lactic acid bacteria use homolactic acid fermentation for generation of atp. here we studied the role of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme on the general  physiology of the three homolactic acid bacteria lactococcus lactis, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pyogenes. of note, deletion of the ldh genes hardly affected the growth rate in chemically defined medium under microaerophilic conditions. however, the growth rate was affected in rich medium. furthermore, deletion of ldh affected the ability for utilization of various substrates as a carbon source. a switch to mixed acid fermentation was observed during glucose-limited continuous growth and was dependent on the growth rate for s. pyogenes and on the ph for e. faecalis. in s. pyogenes and l. lactis, a change in ph resulted in a clear change in y(atp) (cell mass produced per mole of atp). the ph that showed the highest y(atp) corresponded to the ph of the natural habitat of the organisms.

TI  == myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  == myeloperoxidase (mpo) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. the present study provides direct evidence of mpo binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. the microbicidal effectiveness of h(2)o(2) and of ocl(-) was compared to that of mpo plus h(2)o(2). synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining streptococcus sanguinis, a h(2)o(2)-producing microbe showing low mpo binding, with high-mpo-binding escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, or pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous h(2)o(2), with and without mpo, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [rbcs]). selectivity of mpo microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the mpo mic and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) for 82 bacteria including e. coli, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. both h(2)o(2) and ocl(-) destroyed rbcs at submicrobicidal concentrations. nanomolar concentrations of mpo increased h(2)o(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. streptococci plus mpo produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and rbcs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. mpo directly killed h(2)o(2)-producing s. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-h(2)o(2)-producing e. faecalis. the mpo  mics and mbcs for e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus were significantly lower  than those for e. faecalis. the streptococcal studies showed much higher mic/mbc  results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. e.  faecalis mpo binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. selective mpo binding results in selective killing.

TI  == synergism between maggot excretions and antibiotics.
AB  == maggots are successfully used to treat severe, infected wounds. this study investigated whether maggot excretions/secretions influence the antibacterial activity of different antibiotics. minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal  bactericidal concentrations (mbc) were determined of gentamicin and flucloxacillin for staphylococcus aureus, of penicillin for streptococcus pyogenes, of amoxicillin and vancomycin for enterococcus faecalis, of gentamicin  for enterobacter cloacae, and of gentamicin, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin for pseudomonas aeruginosa by checkerboard titration. a range of concentrations of antibiotics in combination with excretions/secretions was examined to investigate the potential of maggot excretions/secretions to affect antibacterial activity. the results showed a dose-dependent increase of the antibacterial effect of gentamicin in the presence of excretions/secretions on s. aureus. minimal concentrations and mbc of gentamicin decreased, respectively, 64- and 32-fold. the mbc of flucloxacillin and excretions/secretions against s. aureus were also decreased. the other antibiotic and excretions/secretions combinations exerted an indifferent effect. excretions/secretions alone did not have any antibacterial effect. the synergism between gentamicin and maggot excretions/secretions could be of direct importance in clinical practice, because it could allow the use of lower doses of gentamicin and thus minimize the risk of gentamicin-related side effects.

AB  == objectives: the aim was to determine the chemical composition of the essential oil of kadsura longipedunculata and the biological activity of the oil and its major components. methods: the essential oil from stem bark of kadsura longipedunculata was analysed by capillary gas chromatography (glc/fid) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (glc/ms). the ability of the oil to reduce diphenylpicrylhydrazine (dpph(*)) was used to evaluate the antioxidant activity.  inhibition of both lipoxygenase and prostaglandin e(2) was used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity. antimicrobial activity was studied in vitro against a range of bacteria and fungi using diffusion and microdilution methods. inhibition of trypanosome proliferation was assessed using resazurin as vital stain. the in-vitro cytotoxicity of the essential oil on six human cancer cell lines (hepg2, mia paca-2, hela, hl-60, mda-mb-231 and sw-480) was examined using the mtt assay. key findings: fifty compounds, representing 97.63% of total oil, were identified. delta-cadinene (21.79%), camphene (7.27%), borneol (6.05%), cubenol (5.12%) and delta-cadinol (5.11%) were found to be the major components of the oil. the oil exerted a good antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive bacteria tested,  including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. streptococcus pyogenes and s. agalactiae were the most sensitive bacteria with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of 60 microg/ml  oil. the essential oil showed a moderate fungicidal activity against yeasts, but  it did not show any activity against gram-negative bacteria. the essential oil showed a good trypanocidal activity in trypanosoma b. brucei with an ic50 value of 50.52 +/- 0.029 microg/ml. radical scavenging activity had an ic50 value of 3.06 +/- 0.79 mg/ml. 5-lipoxygenase inhibition (ic50 = 38.58 microg/ml) and prostaglandin e(2) production inhibition (28.82% at 25 microg/ml) accounted for anti-inflammatory activity of the oil. the oil exhibited some degree of cytotoxic activity against mia paca-2, hepg-2 and sw-480 cell lines with ic50 values of 133.53, 136.96 and 136.62 microg/ml, respectively. the oil increased caspase 3/7  activity (an indicator of apoptosis) 2.5-4 fold in mia paca-2 cells. camphene and borneol did not show antioxidant activity. however, both compounds exhibited some degree of antimicrobial, trypanocidal, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activity.  conclusions: this investigation provided evidence for, and confirmed the efficacy of, k. longipedunculata, a traditionally used chinese medicinal plant for the treatment of inflammation and infection.

TI  == nucleotide sequence and functional analysis of the tet (m)-carrying conjugative transposon tn5251 of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == the tn916-like genetic element tn5251 is part of the composite conjugative transposon (ctn) tn5253 of streptococcus pneumoniae, a 64.5-kb chromosomal element originally called omega(cat-tet) bm6001. dna sequence analysis showed that tn5251 is 18 033-bp long and contains 22 orfs, 20 of which have the same direction of transcription. annotation was possible for 11 out of 22 orfs, including the tet(m) tetracycline resistance gene and int and xis involved in the integration/excision process. autonomous copies of tn5251 were generated during matings of tn5253-containing donors with s. pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. tn5251 was shown to integrate at different sites in the bacterial chromosome. it  behaves as a fully functional ctn capable of independent conjugal transfer to a variety of bacterial species including s. pneumoniae, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, e. faecalis and bacillus subtilis. the excision of tn5251 produces a circular intermediate and a deletion  in tn5253 at a level of 1.2 copies per 10(5) chromosomes.

TI  == [interpretive reading of the antibiogram in gram positive cocci].
AB  == resistance to methicillin in staphylococcus is related to the expression of the meca gene, and involves resistance to all beta-lactams, with the exception of the new cephalosporins, ceftobiprole and ceftaroline. breakpoints for interpretation  of this mechanism differ in s. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. for macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramins b, (mls(b)) the most frequent mechanism among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump nora determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences in the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. strains of s. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (gisa strains) have been described, as well as highly-vancomycin-resistant isolates (vana isolates). in spain, there is a high percentage of s. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, due to mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. the most frequent phenotype of resistance to mls(b) in this species is caused by methylase production. resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is mainly related to mutations in parc/pare (low level) and in gyra. it is important to detect low level resistance due to its clinical implications. no strains of s. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. in spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in s. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. e. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to e. faecium. enterococci show intrinsic  low-level resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (high-level resistance) became resistant to the combination. glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in spain, but nosocomial outbreaks due to vana enterococci and case reports due to vanb2 enterococci have been recently reported.

TI  == comparative genomics and transduction potential of enterococcus faecalis temperate bacteriophages.
AB  == to determine the relative importance of temperate bacteriophage in the horizontal gene transfer of fitness and virulence determinants of enterococcus faecalis, a panel of 47 bacteremia isolates were treated with the inducing agents mitomycin c, norfloxacin, and uv radiation. thirty-four phages were purified from culture supernatants and discriminated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and  restriction mapping. from these analyses the genomes of eight representative phages were pyrosequenced, revealing four distinct groups of phages. three groups of phages, phifl1 to 3, were found to be sequence related, with phifl1a to c and  phifl2a and b sharing the greatest identity (87 to 88%), while phifl3a and b share 37 to 41% identity with phifl1 and 2. phifl4a shares 3 to 12% identity with the phages phifl1 to 3. the phifl3a and b phages possess a high dna sequence identity with the morphogenesis and lysis modules of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris prophages. homologs of the streptococcus mitis platelet binding phage tail proteins, pbla and pblb, are encoded on each sequenced e. faecalis phage. few other phage genes encoding potential virulence functions were identified, and there was little evidence of carriage of lysogenic conversion genes distal to endolysin, as has been observed with genomes of many temperate phages from the opportunist pathogens staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. e. faecalis jh2-2 lysogens were generated using the eight phages, and these were examined for their relative fitness in galleria mellonella. several lysogens exhibited different effects upon survival of g. mellonella compared to their isogenic parent. the eight phages were tested for their ability to package host dna, and three were shown to be very effective for generalized transduction of naive host cells of the laboratory strains og1rf and jh2-2.

TI  == detecting related cases of bloodstream infections using time-interval distribution modelling.
AB  == an algorithm was designed to highlight related bloodstream infections using data  from a nosocomial infection surveillance system to help local public health authorities direct specific measures towards clusters of cases. the approach was  based on a two-step procedure. the first was a test to identify pathogens with an abnormal number of close cases. the second modelled, for the identified pathogens, the distribution of time intervals between successive cases as a mixture of two theoretical distributions in order to determine a threshold below  which a specific investigation is required. the algorithm was applied to bloodstream infection surveillance data collected during a 10-year period (1996-2005) in an 878-bed teaching hospital (24 wards) in lyon, france. the first step identified seven pathogens among the 18 being studied. the modelling succeeded in setting time thresholds to spot clusters of cases requiring further  investigation with defined sensitivity and specificity. setting the sensitivity level at 95%, the threshold values ranged from 24 days (acinetobacter baumannii)  to 294 days (enterobacter cloacae); the specificity was higher than 70% (up to 97.5% for a. baumannii) except for e. cloacae (52.1%). setting the specificity level at 95% resulted in a decrease in sensitivity except for a. baumannii (it reached nearly 100%); it fell below 50% for three pathogens: around 40% for streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis and 25% for enterobacter cloacae. the threshold values then ranged from 8 days (s. pneumoniae) to 67 days  (streptococcus pyogenes). the approach proved promising though further refinements are needed before routine use.

TI  == requirement of the lactobacillus casei maekr two-component system for l-malic acid utilization via a malic enzyme pathway.
AB  == lactobacillus casei can metabolize l-malic acid via malolactic enzyme (malolactic fermentation [mlf]) or malic enzyme (me). whereas utilization of l-malic acid via mlf does not support growth, the me pathway enables l. casei to grow on l-malic acid. in this work, we have identified in the genomes of l. casei strains bl23 and atcc 334 a cluster consisting of two diverging operons, maepe and maekr, encoding a putative malate transporter (maep), an me (maee), and a two-component  (tc) system belonging to the citrate family (maek and maer). homologous clusters  were identified in enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus uberis. our results show that me is essential for l-malic acid utilization in l. casei. furthermore, deletion of either the gene encoding the histidine kinase or the response regulator of the tc system resulted in the loss of the ability to grow on l-malic acid, thus indicating that the cognate tc system regulates and is essential for the expression of me. transcriptional analyses showed that expression of maee is induced in the presence of l-malic acid and repressed by glucose, whereas tc system expression was induced by l-malic acid and was not repressed by glucose. dnase i footprinting analysis showed that maer binds specifically to a set of direct repeats [5'-ttatt(a/t)aa-3'] in the mae promoter region. the location of the repeats strongly suggests that maer activates the expression of the diverging operons maepe and maekr where the first one is also subjected to carbon catabolite repression.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,919 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2007].
AB  == we have reported in this journal in vitro susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics every year since 1992. in this paper, we report the results of an  analysis of in vitro susceptibilities of 12,919 clinical isolates from 72 centers in japan to selected antibiotics in 2007 compared with the results from previous  years. the common respiratory pathogens, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae maintained a high susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (fqs). the resistance of s. pyogenes to macrolides has been increasing every year and this was especially clear this year. most strains of enterobacteriaceae except for escherichia coli showed a high susceptibility to fqs. almost 30% of e. coli strains were resistant to fqs and the resistance increased further this year. fqs resistance of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was approximately 95% with the exception of 45% for sitafloxacin (stfx). fqs resistance of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) was low at about 10%. fqs resistance of  methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (mrcns) was higher than that of methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative staphylococci (mscns), but it  was lower than that of mrsa. however, fqs resistance of mscns was higher than that of mssa. fqs resistance of enterococcus faecalis was 22.5% to 29.6%, while that of enterococcusfaecium was more than 85% except for stfx (58.3%). in clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa derived from urinary tract infections, fqs resistance was 21-27%, which was higher than that of p. aeruginosa from respiratory tract infections at 13-21%, which was the same trend  as in past years. multidrug resistant strains accounted for 5.6% in the urinary tract and 1.8% in the respiratory tract. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. the carbapenem resistant strains, which present a problem  at present, accounted for 2.7%. neisseria gonorrhoeae showed high resistance of 86-88% to fqs. the results of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and n.  gonorrhoeae showed resistance tendencies, and other species maintained high susceptibility rates more than 90% against fqs, which have been used clinically for over 15 years.

AB  == oritavancin activity was tested against 15,764 gram-positive isolates collected from 246 hospital centers in 25 countries between 2005 and 2008. organisms were staphylococcus aureus (n = 9,075), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1,664),  enterococcus faecalis (n = 1,738), enterococcus faecium (n = 819), streptococcus  pyogenes (n = 959), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 415), group c, g, and f streptococci (n = 84), and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1,010). among the evaluated staphylococci, 56.7% were resistant to oxacillin. the vancomycin resistance rate among enterococci was 21.2%. penicillin-resistant and -intermediate rates were 14.7% and 21.4%, respectively, among s. pneumoniae isolates. among nonpneumococcal streptococci, 18.5% were nonsusceptible to erythromycin. oritavancin showed substantial in vitro activity against all organisms tested, regardless of resistance profile. the maximum oritavancin mic against all staphylococci tested (n = 10,739) was 4 microg/ml; the mic(90) against s. aureus was 0.12 microg/ml. against e. faecalis and e. faecium, oritavancin mic(90)s were 0.06 and 0.12, respectively. oritavancin was active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, including vana strains (n = 486), with mic(90)s of 0.25 and 1 microg/ml against vana e. faecium and e. faecalis, respectively. oritavancin showed potent activity against streptococci (n = 2,468); mic(90)s for the different streptococcal species were between 0.008 and 1 microg/ml. these data are consistent with previous studies with respect to resistance rates of gram-positive isolates and demonstrate the spectrum and in vitro activity of oritavancin against a wide variety of contemporary gram-positive pathogens, regardless of resistance to currently used drugs. the data provide a foundation for interpreting oritavancin activity and potential changes in susceptibility over time once oritavancin enters into clinical use.

TI  == resistance to bacitracin in streptococcus pyogenes from oropharyngeal colonization and noninvasive infections in portugal was caused by two clones of distinct virulence genotypes.
AB  == during 2000-2007 in lisbon, we identified 45 bacitracin-resistant streptococcus pyogenes isolates among 1629 isolates: 24 from oropharyngeal healthy carriers (out of 1026), 21 from patients with noninvasive infections (out of 559) and zero from invasive infections (out of 44). forty-four of those isolates, mainly of colonization, are low-level bacitracin-resistant members of the cmls(b)-macrolide-resistant and tetracycline-susceptible emm28/st52 clone previously detected in europe, but only among clinical samples. one high-level bacitracin-resistant isolate, associated with a tonsillitis/pharyngitis episode,  is cmls(b)-macrolide-resistant and tetracycline-resistant member of the emm74/st120 lineage, which was not previously known to include bacitracin-resistant isolates. the bcrabdr operon encoding an atp-binding cassette transporter in enterococcus faecalis was not detected among these bacitracin-resistant s. pyogenes strains. virulence profiling indicated that genes coding for exotoxins and superantigens seem to be clone specific. this study provides an increased knowledge about specific bacitracin-resistant s. pyogenes strains, which may be useful in future investigations aiming to understand the mechanism(s) leading to bacitracin resistance and the cause(s) for differences in colonization and/or dissemination potential.

TI  == combinatorial expression of bacterial whole mevalonate pathway for the production of beta-carotene in e. coli.
AB  == the increased synthesis of building blocks of ipp (isopentenyl diphosphate) and dmapp (dimethylallyl diphosphate) through metabolic engineering is a way to enhance the production of carotenoids. using e. coli as a host, ipp and dmapp supply can be increased significantly through the introduction of foreign mva (mevalonate) pathway into it. the mva pathway is split into two parts with the top and bottom portions supplying mevalonate from acetyl-coa, and ipp and dmapp from mevalonate, respectively. the bottom portions of mva pathway from streptococcus pneumonia, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and saccharomyces cerevisiae were compared with exogenous  mevalonate supplementation for beta-carotene production in recombinant escherichia coli harboring beta-carotene synthesis genes. the e. coli harboring the bottom mva pathway of s. pneumoniae produced the highest amount of beta-carotene. the top portions of mva pathway were also compared and the top mva pathway of e. faecalis was found out to be the most efficient for mevalonate production in e. coli. the whole mva pathway was constructed by combining the bottom and top portions of mva pathway of s. pneumoniae and e. faecalis, respectively. the recombinant e. coli harboring the whole mva pathway and beta-carotene synthesis genes produced high amount of beta-carotene even without  exogenous mevalonate supplementation. when comparing various e. coli strains - mg1655, dh5alpha, s17-1, xl1-blue and bl21 - the dh5alpha was found to be the best beta-carotene producer. using glycerol as the carbon source for beta-carotene production was found to be superior to glucose, galactose, xylose and maltose. the recombinant e. coli dh5alpha harboring the whole mva pathway and beta-carotene synthesis genes produced beta-carotene of 465mg/l at glycerol concentration of 2% (w/v).

TI  == structural studies of the enterococcus faecalis sufu [fe-s] cluster protein.
AB  == background: iron-sulfur clusters are ubiquitous and evolutionarily ancient inorganic prosthetic groups, the biosynthesis of which depends on complex protein machineries. three distinct assembly systems involved in the maturation of cellular fe-s proteins have been determined, designated the nif, isc and suf systems. although well described in several organisms, these machineries are poorly understood in gram-positive bacteria. within the firmicutes phylum, the enterococcus spp. genus have recently assumed importance in clinical microbiology being considered as emerging pathogens for humans, wherein enterococcus faecalis  represents the major species associated with nosocomial infections. the aim of this study was to carry out a phylogenetic analysis in enterococcus faecalis v583 and a structural and conformational characterisation of it sufu protein. results: blast searches of the enterococcus genome revealed a series of genes with sequence similarity to the escherichia coli suf machinery of [fe-s] cluster biosynthesis, namely sufb, sufc, sufd and sufs. in addition, the e. coli iscu ortholog sufu was found to be the scaffold protein of enterococcus spp., containing all features considered essential for its biological activity, including conserved amino acid residues involved in substrate and/or co-factor binding (cys50,76,138 and asp52) and, phylogenetic analyses showed a close relationship with orthologues from other gram-positive bacteria. molecular dynamics for structural determinations and molecular modeling using e. faecalis sufu primary sequence protein over the pdb:1su0 crystallographic model from streptococcus pyogenes were carried out with a subsequent 50 ns molecular dynamic trajectory. this presented a stable model, showing secondary structure modifications near the active site and conserved cysteine residues. molecular modeling using haemophilus influenzae iscu primary sequence over the pdb:1su0 crystal followed by a md trajectory was performed to analyse differences in the c-terminus region of gram-positive sufu and gram-negative orthologous proteins, in which several modifications in secondary structure were observed. conclusion:  the data describe the identification of the suf machinery for [fe-s] cluster biosynthesis present in the firmicutes genome, showing conserved sufb, sufc, sufd and sufs genes and the presence of the sufu gene coding for scaffold protein, instead of sufa; neither sufe nor sufr are present. primary sequences and structural analysis of the sufu protein demonstrated its structural-like pattern  to the scaffold protein iscu nearby on the isc machinery. e. faecalis sufu molecular modeling showed high flexibility over the active site regions, and demonstrated the existence of a specific region in firmicutes denoting the gram positive region (gpr), suggested as a possible candidate for interaction with other factors and/or regulators.

AB  == integrative and conjugative elements (ices), also called conjugative transposons, are genomic islands that excise, self-transfer by conjugation, and integrate in the genome of the recipient bacterium. the current investigation shows the intraspecies conjugative transfer of the first described ices in streptococcus thermophilus, icest1 and icest3. mitomycin c, a dna-damaging agent, derepresses icest3 conjugative transfer almost 25-fold. the icest3 host range was determined  using various members of the firmicutes as recipients. whereas numerous icest3 transconjugants of streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis were recovered, only one transconjugant of lactococcus lactis was obtained. the newly  incoming ices, except the one from l. lactis, are site-specifically integrated into the 3' end of the fda gene and are still able to excise in these transconjugants. furthermore, icest3 was retransferred from e. faecalis to s. thermophilus. recombinant plasmids carrying different parts of the icest1 recombination module were used to show that the integrase gene is required for the site-specific integration and excision of the ices, whereas the excisionase gene is required for the site-specific excision only.

TI  == [comparative in vitro activity of daptomycin against gram-positive microorganisms: sentry surveillance program, spain (2002-2006)].
AB  == introduction and objective: daptomycin is a bactericidal lipopeptide antibiotic,  active against gram-positive bacteria. in this study, the comparative in vitro activity of daptomycin and other antimicrobial agents against isolates recovered  in 3 spanish hospitals from 2002 to 2006 was determined as part of the international sentry antimicrobial resistance surveillance program. the possible  therapeutic role of daptomycin is addressed in the light of spanish susceptibility data. methods: antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed  by the microdilution method with 1398 consecutively recovered gram-positive isolates. results: all the staphylococci (n = 1024), enterococci (n = 228), and streptococci (n = 146) studied were susceptible to daptomycin. the highest mic values were 1, 4, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, regardless of methicillin, vancomycin, or penicillin resistance status. all staphylococcus aureus isolates were also susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. coagulase-negative staphylococci were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. only daptomycin and linezolid were active against all enterococcal isolates. in addition, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and ampicillin were fully active against enterococcus faecalis. daptomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin were active against all streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. viridans group isolates. the distribution of daptomycin mic values in s. aureus and enterococci was homogeneously sustained along the 5-year study period. conclusion: the sustained antimicrobial activity of daptomycin against staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci in spain makes this antibiotic an excellent therapeutic option in severe infection caused by gram-positive microorganisms, including those with multiresistance.

TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin against gram-positive cocci: the first multicentre study in greece.
AB  == a total of 10420 gram-positive cocci (including staphylococci, enterococci and various groups of streptococci) collected from clinically significant specimens in ten greek hospitals during 2006--2007 were tested for their susceptibility to  daptomycin. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by the broth microdilution method. daptomycin demonstrated very high activity against enterococcus faecalis (mic at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited (mic50) =  1mg/l and mic at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (mic90) = 1.36 mg/l), enterococcus faecium (mic50 = 1.36 mg/l and mic90 = 1.90 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (mic50 = 0.12 mg/l and mic90 = 0.50mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (mic50 = 0.09 mg/l and mic90 = 0.12 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mic50 = 0.24 mg/l and mic90 = 0.5 mg/l) and viridans group streptococci (mic50 = 0.50 mg/l and mic90 = 0.89 mg/l). resistance to linezolid and vancomycin for enterococci and to penicillin for streptococci appears to be independent of reduced susceptibility to daptomycin. on the other hand, daptomycin was also active against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mic50 = 0.44 mg/l and mic90 = 0.78 mg/l) and meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic50 = 0.24 mg/l and mic90 = 0.44 mg/l); however, 0.9% of the staphylococci tested had an mic > 1mg/l, which is the clinical and laboratory standards institute breakpoint proposed for susceptibility. for all tested organism groups, resistance to daptomycin was not associated with glycopeptide resistance.

TI  == differentiation of streptococcus pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus [pnc]) is a causative agent of many infectious diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis. there have been documented conjunctivitis outbreaks in which nontypeable (nt), nonencapsulated pnc has been identified as the etiological agent. the use of mass spectrometry to comparatively and differentially analyze protein and peptide profiles of whole-cell microorganisms remains somewhat uncharted. in this report, we discuss a comparative proteomic analysis between nt s. pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak strains (cpnc) and other known typeable or  nt pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates (including pnc tigr4 and r6, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes) and nonstreptococcal isolates (including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus) as controls. cpnc cells and controls were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and subsequently treated with a 10% trifluoroacetic acid-sinapinic acid matrix mixture. protein and peptide fragments of the whole-cell bacterial isolate-matrix combinations ranging in size from 2 to 14 kda were evaluated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. additionally random forest analytical tools and dendrogramic representations (genesis) suggested similarities and clustered the isolates into distinct clonal groups, respectively. also, a peak list of protein and peptide masses was obtained and compared to a known pnc protein mass library, in which a peptide common and unique to cpnc isolates was tentatively identified. information gained from this  study will lead to the identification and validation of proteins that are commonly and exclusively expressed in cpnc strains which could potentially be used as a biomarker in the rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal conjunctivitis.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial effects of topical local anesthetics.
AB  == background: the antibacterial activities of local anesthetics are recognized. objective: to investigate in vitro the activity of topical local anesthetic ointments at clinical doses. methods: the activity of two different local anesthetic ointments including lidocaine 5% and lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% was tested against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis by the disc-diffusion method. sterile discs containing topical local anesthetic drugs were prepared taking into account the doses of ointments used in clinical practice. the validity of the methodology was confirmed using topical antibacterial mupirocin. the inhibition zones of the discs were measured. results: mupirocin inhibited all the bacteria. both local anesthetic ointments were found to be most effective on e. coli, whereas they had no effects on p. aeruginosa. lidocaine 5% revealed antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli, s. pyogenes and e. faecalis, but lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5%  showed no activity on e. faecalis and inhibited s. pyogenes only at double doses. it was also observed that the antibacterial activity was in a dose-dependent manner. conclusion: in the light of these findings, it might be concluded that topical local anesthetic ointments in routine settings may have a preventive role against some bacteria.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens as evaluated by broth microdilution and etest.
AB  == the current surveillance establishes the activity profile of tigecycline against  recent clinical u.s. isolates of target pathogens. findings from a distributed surveillance that utilized etest yielded a tigecycline activity profile that varied from that observed in a separate centralized broth microdilution (bmd) surveillance (d. c. draghi et al., poster d-0701, 46th intersci. conf. antimicrob. agents chemother., san francisco, ca). differences were noted among acinetobacter spp. and serratia marcescens and, to a lesser extent, with streptococcus pyogenes. to address whether these differences were due to discordance in testing methodology or to variations among the analyzed populations, isolates from the current surveillance were concurrently tested by bmd and etest. in all, 1,800 staphylococcus aureus, 259 s. pyogenes, 226 streptococcus pneumoniae, 93 enterococcus faecalis, 1,356 enterobacteriaceae, and 227 acinetobacter baumannii strains were evaluated. tigecycline had potent activity by bmd, with >99.6% susceptibility (%s) observed for all pathogens with  interpretive criteria, excluding enterobacter cloacae (98.3% s) and e. faecalis (86.0% s), and mic(90)s ranged from 0.03 mug/ml (s. pyogenes/s. pneumoniae) to 1  mug/ml (enterobacteriaceae/a. baumannii). similar profiles were observed by etest, with the exception of a. baumannii, although for most evaluated pathogens  etest mics trended one doubling-dilution higher than bmd mics. major or very major errors were infrequent, and a high degree of essential agreement was observed, excluding a. baumannii, s. marcescens, and s. pneumoniae, for which >/=4-fold differences in mics were observed for 29, 27.1, and 34% of the isolates, respectively. further analysis regarding the suitability of the tigecycline etest for testing s. marcescens, acinetobacter spp., and s. pneumoniae is warranted.

TI  == frequency and expression of mutacin biosynthesis genes in isolates of streptococcus mutans with different mutacin-producing phenotypes.
AB  == the aim of this study was to analyse the frequency and expression of biosynthesis genes in 47 streptococcus mutans isolates with different mutacin-producing phenotypes. detection of the frequency and expression of genes encoding mutacin types i, ii, iii and iv were carried out by pcr and semi-quantitative rt-pcr, respectively, using primers specific for each type of biosynthesis gene. in addition, a further eight genes encoding putative bacteriocins, designated bsm 283, bsm 299, bsm 423, bsm 1889c, bsm 1892c, bsm 1896, bsm 1906c and bsm 1914, were also screened. there was a high phenotypic diversity; some streptococcus mutans isolates presented broad antimicrobial spectra against other streptococcus mutans clinical isolates, including bacteria resistant to common antibiotics, as  well as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis  and streptococcus pyogenes. the expression frequency of the bsm gene was higher than that of the previously characterized mutacins (i-iv). there was no positive  correlation between the number of indicator strains inhibited (antimicrobial spectra) and the number of biosynthesis genes expressed (spearman correlation test, r=-0.03, p>0.05). in conclusion, the high diversity of mutacin-producing phenotypes, associated with high frequency of expression of the biosynthesis genes screened, reveals a broad repertoire of genetic determinants encoding antimicrobial peptides that can act in different combinations.

TI  == [antibiotics susceptibility of streptococcus and enterococcus: data of onerba network].
AB  == this work was aimed to analyze trends in susceptibility to antibiotics among the  main species of beta-hemolytic streptococci involved in community-acquired infections in human (streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae), or in  animals (streptococcus suis and streptococcus uberis) and also among the main enterocci species, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. data were recorded since 1996 through the onerba networks. s. pyogenes, as the other beta-hemolytic streptococci studied remained fully susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. however, susceptibility to macrolides is clearly decreasing in s. pyogenes. in 2002, only 62 to 65% of the strains according to the network considered, were susceptible to erythromycin. a similar trend was observed for s. agalactiae with only 75% of erythromycin susceptibility in 2002, and for both species isolated from animals s. suis and s. uberis, with respectively 35 and 76% of strains susceptible to erythromycin. in enterococci, susceptibility to beta-lactams remained stable between 2000 and 2004. indeed, the susceptibility to aminopenicillins remained high in e. faecalis (about 98%), whereas the proportion of e. faecium isolates susceptible to these antibiotics were lower than 60%. from 1999 to 2004, various studies conducted in french hospitals showed that the vancomycin resistance among enterococci accounted for less than 2%. however, the  recent emergence of glycopeptide resistant enterococci clusters in french hospitals is a matter of concern and emphasizes the need for an ongoing surveillance. such trend in macrolide resistance among s. pyogenes or s. agalactiae should consequently lead to propose other alternatives in case of beta-lactam allergy, and for pharyngitis, to rethink the place of the culture for susceptibility testing.

TI  == secreted enteric antimicrobial activity localises to the mucus surface layer.
AB  == objectives: the intestinal mucosa is constantly exposed to a dense and highly dynamic microbial flora and challenged by a variety of enteropathogenic bacteria. antibacterial protection is provided in part by paneth cell-derived antibacterial peptides such as the alpha-defensins. the mechanism of peptide-mediated antibacterial control and its functional importance for gut homeostasis has recently been appreciated in patients with crohn's ileitis. in the present study, the spatial distribution of antimicrobial peptides was analysed within the small  intestinal anatomical compartments such as the intestinal crypts, the overlaying  mucus and the luminal content. methods: preparations from the different intestinal locations as well as whole mouse small intestine were extracted and separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. antibacterial activity was determined in extracts, and the presence of antimicrobial peptides/proteins was confirmed by n-terminal sequencing, mass spectrometry analysis and immunodetection. results: the secreted antibacterial activity was largely confined to the layer of mucus, whereas only minute amounts of activity were noted in the luminal content. the extractable activity originating from either crypt/mucus/lumen compartments respectively (given as a percentage) was for listeria monocytogenes, 48 (4)/44 (4)/8 (8); enterococcus faecalis, 44 (10)/49 (3)/7 (7); bacterium megaterium, 56 (4)/42 (3)/2 (1); streptococcus pyogenes, 48 (4)/46 (3)/6 (6); escherichia coli, 46 (4)/47 (3)/7 (7); and salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium, 38 (3)/43 (7)/19 (10). a spectrum of antimicrobial peptides was identified in isolated mucus, which exhibited strong and contact-dependent antibacterial activity against both commensal and pathogenic bacteria. conclusion: these findings show that secreted antimicrobial  peptides are retained by the surface-overlaying mucus and thereby provide a combined physical and antibacterial barrier to prevent bacterial attachment and invasion. this distribution facilitates high local peptide concentration on vulnerable mucosal surfaces, while still allowing the presence of an enteric microbiota.

AB  == antimicrobial activities of 139 enterococcus isolates (48 e. faecium and 91 e. faecalis) obtained from canine feces, boiler meat samples, swine feces, wild waterfowl feces, and human feces were examined against respective bacteria, including streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enteritidis, and escherichia coli. bacteriocin (bac) production assay revealed that the antimicrobial activity against at least  one of 6 indicator strains (bac+ phenotype) was found in 51 (37%) isolates (29 e. faecium and 22 e. faecalis). twenty-four of 46 isolates positive for at least one of the enterocin structural genes (enta, entb, entl50ab, and cyll) showed a bac+  phenotype. the existence of other enterocins or nonenterocin factors was implied  because the bac+ phenotype was detected in a total of 27 enterococcus isolates that had none of the enterocin genes tested. the antimicrobial activity against gram-negative strains (salmonella enteritidis and e. coli) was detected in the 6  enterococcus isolates that had either the enta, entb, entl50ab or cyll genes. moreover, the proportion of the antimicrobial activity against l. monocytogenes among the cyll-positive e. faecalis isolates showing beta-hemolysis (10/16) was significantly (p<0.01) higher than among those lacking beta-hemolysis (2/15). the results suggested that certain characteristics are likely to be associated with the antimicrobial activity against specific organisms.

TI  == improved diagnosis specificity in bone and joint infections using molecular techniques.
AB  == objectives: the microbiological diagnosis of osteoarticular infections currently  relies on microbiological cultures, to specifically target treatment. however, these conventional methods sometimes lack of sensitivity and of specificity to establish definitive diagnosis. this study was conducted to determine whether molecular method could improve bacterial bone and joint infection diagnosis. methods: we evaluated the performance of nucleic acid extraction with the semi-automated nuclisens minimag instrument coupled to 16s rdna sequencing on 76  samples collected from 51 patients with suspected infections: prosthetic-joint infection (15), spondylodiscitis (7) acute septic arthritis (11) and 18 controls. no pre-treatment of the sample was done before nucleic acid extraction. classification in infected group required an accumulation of arguments. results:  our molecular method identified a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fastidious bacteria like neisseria gonorrhoeae and fusobacterium  nucleatum. the overall pcr sensitivity was 73.3%: 53.8% for prosthetic-joint infections and 88.2% for infections without prostheses. the overall pcr specificity was 95.2%, whereas culture specificity was only 85.7%. conclusions: the instrument was simple to use and provided nucleic acids free of pcr inhibitors and free of contamination by foreign bacterial dna. our study highlights the need for still improved molecular diagnostic sensitivity.

AB  == unlike the colicins, microcins and related peptide antibiotics, little is known about antibiotic proteins (m(r)>10,000) from gram-positive bacteria, since only few examples have been described to date. in this study we used heterologous expression of recombinant proteins to access the 17 kda antibiotic protein sa-m57 from streptococcus pyogenes, along with two proteins of unknown function identified in publicly available databases: ef1097 from enterococcus faecalis and ypkk from corynebacterium jeikeium. here we show that all three are antibiotic proteins with different spectra of antimicrobial activity that kill sensitive bacteria at nanomolar concentrations. in silico structure predictions indicate that although the three proteins share little sequence similarity, they may be composed of conserved secondary structural elements: a relatively unstructured, acidic n-terminal portion and a basic c-terminal portion characterized by two helical elements separated by a loop structure and stabilized by an essential disulphide. expression of individual segments as well as protein chimaeras revealed that, at least in the case of ypkk, the c-terminal portion is responsible for the killing action of the protein, whereas the role of the n-terminal portion remains unclear. both scnm57 and ef1097 appear to be widely distributed in strep. pyogenes and ent. faecalis (respectively), whereas ypkk is  found only rarely amongst clinical isolates of c. jeikeium. finally, we determined that the proteins kill sensitive bacteria without lysis, a feature that distinguishes them from known murolytic proteins.

TI  == qsar studies on benzoylaminobenzoic acid derivatives as inhibitors of beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase iii.
AB  == fatty acid biosynthesis is essential for most of the bacterial survival. components of this biosynthetic pathway have been identified as attractive targets for the development of new antibacterial agents. fabh, beta-ketoacyl-acp  synthase iii, is a attractive target since it is central to the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis. quantitative structure-activity relationship (qsar) studies have been carried out on a series of benzoylaminobenzoic acid derivatives as potent inhibitors of fabh and antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis,  neisseria meningitidis and escherichia coli, which demonstrate fabh inhibitory activity in cell free and whole cell system. the qsar studies revealed that inhibitory activity increases with increase in hydrophobicity, molar refractivity, aromaticity, and presence of oh group (on x position of the nucleus). on the other side presence of hetero-atoms like n, o, or s at r(1) position of the nucleus decreases the inhibitory activity. the comparison of qsar between the fabh inhibitory activity and antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, e. faecalis, n. meningitidis also demonstrates that the hydrophobicity, aromaticity and presence of oh group (on x  position of the nucleus) are conducive for the inhibitory activity.

TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of tigecycline against multiresistant gram-positive cocci containing tetracycline resistance determinants.
AB  == this study was undertaken to test the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 117 clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens and to correlate this activity with their resistance gene content. overall, tigecycline showed a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) range of 0.015-0.5mg/l, able to inhibit potently all multiresistant streptococci, enterococci and mr staphylococci. tigecycline was active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococci, with mics for 90% of the organisms (mic(90)) of 0.25 mg/l and 0.12 mg/l, respectively, being more active than linezolid (mic(90)=2 mg/l) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (mic(90)=0.5 and 2-4 mg/l, respectively). molecular characterisation of resistance determinants demonstrated the concomitant presence of different classes of genes: in particular, tet(m), erm(b) and erm(c) in streptococcus agalactiae; tet(o), variably associated with different erm genes, in streptococcus pyogenes; vana, tet(m) and erm(b) in enterococcus faecalis, and  vana and erm(b) in enterococcus faecium. all the mrsa strains harboured sccmec and erm genes and 50% possessed tet(k) with tet(m) genes. staphylococcus epidermidis strains were only resistant to erythromycin. these results clearly demonstrate that tigecycline has a mic(90) range of 0.015-0.5 mg/l both against tetracycline-susceptible and -resistant isolates carrying other resistance determinants, suggesting that this drug could play an important role in the treatment of infections caused by these multiresistant gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == synthesis and preliminary biological characterization of new semisynthetic derivatives of ramoplanin.
AB  == ramoplanin is a glycolipodepsipeptide antibiotic active against gram-positive bacteria including vancomycin-resistant enterococci. ramoplanin inhibits bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by a mechanism different from that of glycopeptides and hence does not show cross-resistance with these antibiotics. the systemic use of ramoplanin has been so far prevented because of its low local tolerability when injected intravenously. to overcome this problem, the fatty acid side chain of ramoplanin was selectively removed and replaced with a variety of different carboxylic acids. many of the new ramoplanin derivatives showed antimicrobial activity similar to that of the natural precursor coupled with a significantly improved local tolerability. among them the derivative in which the 2-methylphenylacetic acid has replaced the di-unsaturated fatty acid side chain (48) was selected as the most interesting compound and submitted to further in vitro and in vivo characterization studies.

AB  == objectives: to analyse the as yet unexplored genetic elements encoding erm(b)-mediated erythromycin resistance in tetracycline-susceptible pneumococci.  methods: sixteen streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates sharing erm(b)-mediated erythromycin resistance and susceptibility to tetracycline were used. gene detection was performed by pcr using both established and specially designed primers. s. pneumoniae r6, streptococcus pyogenes 12rf and enterococcus  faecalis jh2-2 were used as recipients in mating experiments. results: of the 16  test strains, 14 bore an unexpressed tet(m) gene which in 13 strains had a genetic linkage with erm(b). three isolates yielded a 3.2 kb and 10 an 11.9 kb erm(b)/tet(m) amplicon. the former three showed genetic organizations similar to  that of the composite element tn3872, where the erm(b)-carrying tn917 transposon  is inserted into a tn916-like element. of the latter 10 isolates, 9 showed genetic organizations substantially overlapping with that of tn6002, a newly sequenced erm(b)-containing tn916-related transposon. the tenth isolate carried a novel composite element (designated tn6003) resulting from the insertion into a tn6002-like transposon of a fragment [designated macrolide-aminoglycoside-streptothricin (mas) element] containing a second erm(b) (lacking the stop codon) and a variant of the aade-sat4-apha-3 cluster. the two tet(m)-negative isolates had different tn3872-related elements, one containing a  complete and one a deleted mas fragment. conjugative transfer was obtained from donors carrying tn6002-related elements, not from donors carrying tn3872-related  elements. conclusions: in tetracycline-susceptible pneumococci with erm(b)-mediated erythromycin resistance, the erm(b) gene is carried on a variety  of tn916-related genetic elements either lacking tet(m) or, more often, carrying  an unexpressed tet(m) gene.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == reversal of resistance in microorganisms by help of non-antibiotics.
AB  == intracellular efflux pumps have been largely the research focus in multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms and parasites including cancers. however, drug efflux mechanisms other than pumps per se have been observed, supported by the effects of isomeric, non-antibiotic depressant (dpr), phenothiazines and thixenes, and antidepressant (adpr) phenylpiperidine neurotropic drugs, alone or in combination with classical antimicrobials on mdr staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. of the non-antibiotics we investigated, the dpr l-thioridazine, trans-clopenthixol and isomers of phenylpiperidines nnc 20-4962 (isomer of femoxetine) and nnc 20-7052 (isomer of paroxetine) were potent antimicrobials with the least neurotropic activity, pointing to a possible general isomeric structure-activity  relationship. these compounds may be regarded as new efflux inhibitors. moreover, these isomers have considerably reduced, in some cases absent, neurotropism and reduced mammalian toxicity. this may alleviate concerns about adverse effects and therapeutic safety for infected patients in life-threatening situations where the non-antibiotic dosage would be in the lower, non-chronic dosage ranges generally  prescribed for individuals with mild mental health problems. the results point to the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms' phospholipid/protein domain involvement of the cationic, amphiphilic, non-antibiotic dpr and adpr, with the phospholipids being the initial sites attracting and concentrating the neurotropes to induce a form of suspended animation, followed by gross changes of cell wall and membrane structure, and thereby potentiating their destructive or immobilizing effects on various as yet only hinted at resistance and efflux mechanisms. combination of appropriate isomeric non-antibiotic dpr and adpr of low neurotropism and toxicity with conventional and classical antimicrobials promises early, new therapeutic strategies salutary against microbial resistance, resistance development, pathogenicity and virulence.

TI  == topical ethyl chloride fine spray. does it have any antimicrobial activity?
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to assess whether ethyl chloride fine spray (cryogesic) has antimicrobial activity. material and methods: blood agar plates supplemented with 5% horse blood were inoculated with five different organisms, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis. the plates were assessed for growth inhibition at 24 and 48 h by the microbiologist and compared with the non-sprayed control plates. results: the model showed a highly significant (p<0.0001) reduction in bacterial  count for the plates treated with fine ethyl chloride spray. the estimate of the  percentage of bacteria remaining after spraying with ethyl chloride was 42.7%, with a 95% confidence interval of 35.9-50.9%. there was no evidence that the effect of ethyl chloride fine spray was different for the different organisms (p=0.49). conclusion: the use of ethyl chloride shows bacterial count reduction but the clinical implication of this needs to be determined. the authors postulate that any statistically significant reduction can only be helpful in reducing the infection rates. this coupled with the already proven local anaesthetic effects of ethyl chloride will make it an important tool for procedures like arthrocentesis and venepunctures.

TI  == antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer and antioxidant activities of carlina acanthifolia root essential oil.
AB  == the root of carlina acanthifolia all. (asteraceae) has been traditionally used in the treatment of various disorders including stomach and skin diseases. we studied antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer and antioxidant activities of carlina acanthifolia root essential oil, in order to validate some of the ethnopharmacological claims. antimicrobial activity was tested on 15 bacteria and three strains of fungi using the agar diffusion and broth microdilution methods.  in assessing anti-inflammatory activity the carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema test was used, while ethanol-induced stress gastric ulcer test in rats was used in testing anti-ulcer activity. antioxidant properties were evaluated trough the  effect of the essential oil on lipid peroxidation (tba assay) and its capability  of quenching 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) and oh radicals. the oil expressed significant antimicrobial activity, being the most active against gram  (+) bacteria: streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis and against candida albicans. in all applied concentrations, carlina acanthifolia root essential oil reduced carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema in dose-dependent manner, achieving high degree of anti-inflammatory activity. the effect was comparable with that of indomethacin used as a reference drug. in the ethanol-induced stress gastric ulcer test in rats, it was shown that the tested essential oil produced significant dose-dependent gastroprotective activity. the  results also pointed out substantial and dose-dependent antioxidant activity of the investigated essential oil, with carlina oxide as the main antioxidant component.

TI  == two-component signal transduction systems as key players in stress responses of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) continue as an important group of gram-positive bacteria that have been extensively exploited in food industries and various biotechnological applications. some lab species are, however, opportunistic pathogens and were reported to be associated with overwhelming number of human infections. during the use of lab in industry or over the course of human infection, these bacteria are exposed to environmental stress. while lab display  adaptive mechanisms to cope with adverse conditions, the regulation of these mechanisms remains to be elucidated. recent completion of genome sequencing of various lab strains combined with the development of advanced molecular techniques have enabled the identification of a number of putative two-component  signal transduction systems, also known as two-component regulatory systems (2crs), in lab. examining the effect of deleting genes specifying putative 2crs proteins in these organisms has revealed the involvement of 2crs in the responses of lab to different stresses. there are lines of evidence indicating that certain 2crs may mediate a general stress response in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes. this review highlights the influence of 2crs on the physiology of lab during optimal growth and survival/growth on exposure to environmental stress.

TI  == coenzyme q10 production in recombinant escherichia coli strains engineered with a heterologous decaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene and foreign mevalonate pathway.
AB  == in the present work, escherichia coli dh5alpha was metabolically engineered for coq(10) production by the introduction of decaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene (ddsa) from agrobacterium tumefaciens. grown in 2ytg medium (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% nacl, and 0.5% glycerol) with an initial ph of 7, the recombinant e. coli was capable of coq(10) production up to 470 microg/gdcw (dry  cell weight). this value could be further elevated to 900 microg/gdcw simply by increasing the initial culture ph from 7 to 9. supplementation of 4-hydroxy benzoate did not improve the productivity any further. however, engineering of a  lower mevalonate semi-pathway so as to increase the isopentenyl diphosphate (ipp) supply of the recombinant strain using exogenous mevalonate efficiently increased the coq(10) production. lower mevalonate semi-pathways of staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and saccharomyces cerevisiae were tested. among these, the pathway of streptococcus pneumoniae proved to be superior, yielding coq(10) production of 2,700+/-115 microg/gdcw when supplemented with exogenous mevalonate of 3 mm. in order to construct a complete mevalonate pathway, the upper semi-pathway of the same bacterium, streptococcus pneumoniae, was recruited. in a recombinant e. coli dh5alpha harboring three plasmids encoding for upper and lower mevalonate semi-pathways as well as ddsa enzyme, the heterologous mevalonate pathway could convert endogenous acetyl-coa to ipp, resulting in coq(10) production of up to 2,428+/-75 microg/gdcw, without mevalonate supplementation. in contrast, a whole  mevalonate pathway constructed in a single operon was found to be less efficient. however, it provided coq(10) production of up to 1,706+/-86 microg/gdcw, which was roughly 1.9 times higher than that obtained by ddsa alone.

TI  == characterization of ers, a prfa-like regulator of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == we have identified a transcriptional regulator, named ers (for enterococcal regulator of survival), of enterococcus faecalis, an important opportunistic bacterium commonly recovered from hospitalized patients. ers is a member of the crp/fnr family and is 69% similar to srv, a prfa-like regulator of streptococcus  pyogenes implicated in virulence, and is the e. faecalis protein most closely related to prfa, a positive regulator of virulence genes in listeria monocytogenes. in an in vivo-in vitro macrophage infection model, the survival of an ers mutant was highly significantly decreased compared with that of the parental strain jh2-2. this mutant was more than 10-fold more sensitive to oxidative challenge by hydrogen peroxide. in order to identify genes whose expression was under ers control, the rna levels of 31 likely candidates were measured by real-time quantitative pcr. the results indicate that ers may be autoregulated and that the locus ef0082 appears to be positively regulated by ers. nevertheless, mutation of ef0082 did not result in any detectable changes in the survival of the bacterium within murine macrophages.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel c12 vinyl ketolides.
AB  == a novel series of c12 vinyl erythromycin derivatives have been discovered which exhibit in vitro and in vivo potency against key respiratory pathogens. the c12 modification involves replacing the natural c12 methyl group in the erythromycin  core with a vinyl group via chemical synthesis. from the c12 vinyl macrolide core, a series of c12 vinyl ketolides was prepared. several compounds were found  to be potent against macrolide-sensitive and -resistant bacteria. the c12 vinyl ketolides 6j and 6k showed a similar antimicrobial spectrum and comparable activity to the commercial ketolide telithromycin. however, the pharmacokinetic profiles of c12 vinyl ketolides 6j and 6k in rats differ from that of telithromycin by having higher lung-to-plasma ratios, larger volumes of distribution, and longer half-lives. these pharmacokinetic differences have a pharmacodynamic effect as both 6j and 6k exhibited better in vivo efficacy than telithromycin in rat lung infection models against streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae.

TI  == ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  == although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, enterococcus  faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. to investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might  use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including e. faecalis, e. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. streptococcus bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis showed increased adherence to arh-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of s. bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, and s. aureus by ht-29 enterocytes (prominent  syndecan-1 expression), but not caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). data from experiments with chinese hamster ovary cells with altered  glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. thus, although e. faecalis, e. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical,  and trauma patients.

AB  == objectives: as a result of the prolonged half-life and unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (pk-pd) characteristics of azithromycin, shorter dosing regimens  are being evaluated for the treatment of community-acquired infections. to provide further support for a shorter dosing regimen, the efficacy of azithromycin was determined in preclinical infection models comparing single- versus multi-dose regimens. methods: the efficacy of single versus multi-dose regimens of azithromycin was compared in mouse pneumonia, acute peritonitis, and  neutropenic thigh infection models and in a gerbil model of haemophilus influenzae acute otitis media. azithromycin was administered as a single oral dose on the first treatment day, or as two divided doses over 2 treatment days, or as three divided doses over 3 treatment days. the pharmacokinetics of azithromycin was profiled following single and multi-dose regimens with the single dose data fit to an emax model to characterize the pk-pd of azithromycin.  results: in the mouse efficacy models, administration of single-dose azithromycin produced superior rates of survival and bacterial clearance compared with the same total dose divided over 2 or 3 days. in the gerbil model, a single dose sterilized the middle ear and more rapidly cleared h. influenzae. the pharmacokinetic evaluation confirmed similar total exposure (auc) in serum and pulmonary tissue for the three regimens. correlation of pk-pd parameters and antimicrobial efficacy confirmed a concentration-dependent and dosing-independent relationship for azithromycin. conclusions: these data are consistent with data reported from clinical studies and indicate that a single-dose regimen would be at least as effective as the same dose administered over several days.

AB  == a surveillance study was performed throughout germany from november 2001 to june  2002 to assess the prevalence of linezolid-resistant isolates among gram-positive bacteria from routine susceptibility data and to compare the in-vitro activity of linezolid to that of other antibacterial agents. each of 86 laboratories provided routine susceptibility data for 100 consecutive isolates. most laboratories (c. 60%) used the disk diffusion test. laboratories were also requested to send a representative sample of their isolates, as well as all isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid, to a reference laboratory for mic determination. susceptibility data for 8594 isolates were evaluated. sites of infection were skin and soft tissue (29.9%), upper and lower respiratory tract (19.1%), foreign body or catheter (10.5%), or urinary tract (9.8%). routine linezolid susceptibility data were reported for 6433 isolates. the prevalence of  linezolid resistance, as reported to the clinician, was 0.4% in staphylococcus aureus, 0.3% in staphylococcus epidermidis, 2.9% in enterococcus faecalis, 2.3% in enterococcus faecium, 1.4% in streptococcus pyogenes and 2.9% in streptococcus agalactiae. linezolid resistance was not detected in streptococcus pneumoniae or  in viridans group streptococci. sixty-nine of 115 isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid were retested, but none was resistant to linezolid. linezolid exhibited excellent in-vitro activity against representative isolates of the six most frequently encountered species (mic90, 1-2 mg/l). the prevalence of resistance to linezolid was very low in germany. organisms reported as linezolid-resistant should be retested, either in the same laboratory with an  alternative method or in a reference laboratory.

TI  == single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  == the participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. this study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha  points for 7 d. the gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. e. faecalis, strep. sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the e. faecalis and strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus. no biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with f. nucleatum, prop. acnes, porph. gingivalis and prev. intermedia. these findings suggest that gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability  to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.

TI  == activation of the complement system generates antibacterial peptides.
AB  == the complement system represents an evolutionary old and significant part of the  innate immune system involved in protection against invading microorganisms. here, we show that the anaphylatoxin c3a and its inactivated derivative c3a-desarg are antibacterial, demonstrating a previously unknown direct antimicrobial effect of complement activation. the c3a peptide, as well as functional epitopes in the sequence, efficiently killed the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the gram-positive enterococcus faecalis. in mice, a c3a-derived peptide suppressed infection by gram-positive streptococcus pyogenes bacteria. fluorescence and electron microscopy demonstrated that c3a binds to and induces breaks in bacterial membranes. c3a was also found to induce membrane leakage of liposomes. these findings provide an interesting link between the complement system and antimicrobial peptides, which are two important branches of innate immunity.

TI  == tissue-specific adherent enterococcus faecalis strains that show highly efficient adhesion to human bladder carcinoma t24 cells also adhere to extracellular matrix proteins.
AB  == the ability of enterococcus faecalis clinical isolates to adhere to immobilized extracellular matrixes (ecms) coating the walls of microtiter plates was examined by microscopy. the ecms consisted of fibronectin, laminin, collagen types i, ii,  iv, and v, fibrinogen, and lactoferrin. with the exception of fibrinogen, each isolate showed a different level of adherence to each of the ecms. no significant level of adherence to fibrinogen was observed for any isolate. the tissue-specific adhesive strains as11, as12, as14, as15, ht11, and ht12, which showed highly efficient adherence to human bladder carcinoma t24 cells and human  bladder epithelial cells, showed strong adherence to fibronectin, laminin, and collagen type i, ii, iv, and v ecms, and the levels were greater than 10(4) cells/mm2 of well surface coated by ecm. none of the isolates that showed little  adherence to human bladder carcinoma t24 cells showed efficient adherence to all  the ecms. the levels of adherence of gelatinase-producing isolates to the collagens were lower than the levels of adherence of gelatinase-negative isolates. when tissue-specific adhesive strains that adhered strongly to each ecm were preincubated with fibronectin, the adherence of the strains to fibronectin was inhibited, but the adherence of the strains to collagen type iv was not inhibited. likewise, preincubation with collagen type iv inhibited adherence to collagen type iv but not adherence to fibronectin. all of the e. faecalis isolates were shown to carry the ace gene by pcr analysis performed with specific primers for collagen binding domain a of ace. the ace gene encodes ace (adhesin of collagen from enterococci). the prtf gene of group a streptococci, which encodes the fibronectin binding protein of group a streptococci, was not detected in the tissue-specific adhesive strains by southern analysis performed with the prtf probe of the streptococcus pyogenes jrs4 strain. mutants with altered collagen binding were isolated by insertion of tn916 into the chromosome of tissue-specific adhesive strain as14. the number of mutant adhesive bacterial cells that adhered to collagen and also to laminin was 1 or 2 orders lower than the number observed for the wild-type strain, but the level of adherence to fibronectin remained the same as that of the wild-type strain.

TI  == evaluation of the hyplex bloodscreen multiplex pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  == we evaluated the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) system (bag, lich, germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification  of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive bactec 9240 blood culture bottles. the test involves amplification of the bacterial dna by multiplex pcr and subsequent hybridization  of the pcr product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an elisa-based format. the available probes allow the separate detection of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal meca  gene. the hyplex bloodscreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (s. aureus, 100%; s. epidermidis, 97.2%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). the specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (escherichia coli, 92.5%; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; klebsiella spp., 100%; enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; s. aureus, 100%, s. epidermidis, 97.7%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus  faecium, 99.6%; streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). the result of the meca gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of staphylococcus aureus investigated. in conclusion, the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-elisa system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the meca gene of staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.

TI  == results of a multicenter, randomized, open-label efficacy and safety study of two doses of tigecycline for complicated skin and skin-structure infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  == background: tigecycline is a broad-spectrum glycylcycline antibiotic being investigated for the treatment of serious infections in hospitalized patients. tigecycline has been shown to be efficacious against serious infections in animals, and preliminary studies in healthy adults have shown that tigecycline has an acceptable tolerability profile. objective: this study compared the clinical and microbiological efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, and tolerability of 2 doses of tigecycline in hospitalized patients with a complicated skin and skin-structure infection (csssi). methods: this phase ii, randomized, open-label study was conducted between september 1999 and march 2001  at 14 investigative centers across the united states. patients were randomized to receive tigecycline 25 or 50 mg iv q12h for 7 to 14 days. the primary efficacy end point was the clinically observed cure rate among clinically evaluable (ce) patients at the test-of-cure visit. secondary end points were the clinical cure rate at the end of treatment and bacteriologic response in microbiologically evaluable (me) patients. also, in vitro tests of susceptibility to tigecycline were performed for selected pathogens known to cause skin infections, including methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus  faecium. tolerability assessments also were conducted. results: a total of 160 patients received > or =1 dose of tigecycline; 109 patients were ce, and 91 were  me. the majority of patients (74%) were men, and the mean (sd) age was 49.0 (14.8) years. at the test-of-cure visit, the clinical cure rate in the 25-mg group was 67% (95% ci, 53.3%-79.3%) and in the 50-mg group was 74% (95% ci, 60.3%-85.0%). in the 25-mg group, 56% of the patients had eradication (95% ci, 40.0%-70.4%) of the pathogens compared with 69% (95% ci, 54.2%-82.3%) in the 50-mg group. values for the minimum concentration of tigecycline that is inhibitory for 90% of all isolates ranged from 0.06 to 0.50 microg/ml for the selected pathogens. both tigecycline doses were generally well tolerated. nausea  and vomiting were the most common adverse events. conclusions: in this study, tigecycline appeared efficacious and showed a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and an acceptable safety profile in the treatment of hospitalized patients with csssi. in patients who received 50-mg doses of tigecycline q12h, the clinical cure rates and microbial eradication rates were 74% and 70%, respectively, and were 67% and 56% in patients who received 25-mg doses.

TI  == susceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in 839 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci from norway.
AB  == a total of 839 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci from norway including staphylococcus aureus (n = 214), coagulase negative staphylococcus spp. (n = 100), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 99), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 80), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 127), streptococcus spp. viridans group (n = 70), enterococcus faecalis (n = 75), and enterococcus faecium (n = 74), were tested by e-test for susceptibility to a range of antimicrobials including the novel antibiotics quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid. subgroups of oxacillin resistant s. aureus and coagulase negative staphylococcus spp., penicillin non-susceptible s. pneumoniae and vancomycin resistant enterococcus spp. were specifically included as they are the intended targets for these new drugs. all isolates were susceptible to linezolid (mic5o and mic9o 0.25-2.0 mg/l, mic range  0.12-2 mg/l). staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates were also susceptible to  quinupristin-dalfopristin except for some intermediately susceptible viridans group isolates (mic54, and mic90 0.25-2 mg/l, mic range 0.125-2 mg/l). enterococcus faecium (mic90 = 4.0 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (mic50 = 8.0 mg/l, mic90 > or = 32 mg/l) were less susceptible to this substance. there was no linkage between reduced susceptibility to linezolid or quinupristin-dalfopristin  and resistance to other classes of antimicrobials. the study demonstrated a high  prevalence of in vitro susceptibility to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin, which is necessary for their use in the treatment of infections with resistant gram-positive pathogens. the results were used to evaluate the appropriateness of breakpoints and to define a baseline for monitoring possible future emergence of  resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in norway.

TI  == traditional medicine in north cote-d'ivoire: screening of 50 medicinal plants for antibacterial activity.
AB  == sixty-seven crude ethanol extracts from 50 plants (31 families), which are used in north cote-d'ivoire as traditional remedies for bacterial diseases, were screened for in vitro activity against gram negative (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and bacillus subtilis) bacteria. thirty-one extracts showed antibacterial activity only on gram positive bacteria. of these,  10 extracts from 10 plant species had a promising level of activity against bacteria including strains resistant to antibiotics such as aminosides, penicillin m, macrolides, lincosamide and streptrogramin b. the most active was erythrina senegalensis dc (fabaceae) followed by bobgunnia madagascariensis (desv.) j.h. kirkbr. & wiersema (caesalpinaceae), waltheria lanceolata r. br. ex  mast. (sterculiaceae), uapaca togoensis pax. (euphorbiaceae), ximenia americana l. (olacaceae), khaya senegalensis (ders.) a. juss. (meliaceae), lannea acida a.  rich. (anacardiaceae), cissus populnea guill. & perr. (vitaceae), keetia hispida  (benth.) bridson (rubiaceae) and ficus thonningii (miq.) a. rich. (moraceae). this is the first report of the antibacterial potency of these 10 plant species on a range of bacteria. the results provided evidence that some of the studied plants might indeed be potential sources of new antibacterial agents, also against some antibiotic-resistant strains.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of three new quinolones and azithromycin against  aerobic pathogens causing respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections.
AB  == background: in our study the in vitro susceptibility of common pathogens that cause respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections was tested against two newer fluorquinolones (moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin) as well as levofloxacin and azithromycin. methods: 50 isolates each of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and haemophilus  influenzae isolated from the respiratory tract and from wounds were tested for their susceptibility to moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and azithromycin. results: moxifloxacin proved to be the most active substance against the tested gram-positive pathogens. gatifloxacin was the most active against p. aeruginosa. moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin proved to be comparably active against the clinical isolates of e. coli and h. influenzae. conclusions: moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin display excellent activity against respiratory pathogens as well as nosocomial pathogens causing abdominal wound infections. when treating infections caused by p. aeruginosa the earlier fluorquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin are the substances of choice.

TI  == new antibacterial agents derived from the dna gyrase inhibitor cyclothialidine.
AB  == cyclothialidine (1, ro 09-1437) is a potent dna gyrase inhibitor that was isolated from streptomyces filipinensis nr0484 and is a member of a new family of natural products. it acts by competitively inhibiting the atpase activity exerted by the b subunit of dna gyrase but barely exhibits any growth inhibitory activity against intact bacterial cells, presumably due to insufficient permeation of the  cytoplasmic membrane. to explore the antibacterial potential of 1, we developed a flexible synthetic route allowing for the systematic modification of its structure. from a first set of analogues, structure-activity relationships (sar)  were established for different substitution patterns, and the 14-hydroxylated, bicyclic core (x) of 1 seemed to be the structural prerequisite for dna gyrase inhibitory activity. the variation of the lactone ring size, however, revealed that activity can be found among 11- to 16-membered lactones, and even seco-analogues were shown to maintain some enzyme inhibitory properties, thereby  reducing the minimal structural requirements to a rather simple, hydroxylated benzyl sulfide (xi). on the basis of these "minimal structures" a modification program afforded a number of inhibitors that showed in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria. the best activities were displayed by 14-membered lactones, and representatives of this subclass exhibit excellent and broad in vitro antibacterial activity against gram-positive pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and enterococcus faecalis, and overcome resistance against clinically used drugs. by improving the pharmacokinetic properties of the most active compounds (94, 97), in particular by lowering their lipophilic properties, we were able to identify congeners of cyclothialidine (1) that showed efficacy in vivo.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. a total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa),  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, and peptostreptococcus spp. czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases  in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.

TI  == small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of gram-positive and gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus  pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, helicobacter pylori, chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni. large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two s. aureus libraries, highly representative. consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the  identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. the use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.

TI  == intergeneric transfer of the enterococcus faecalis plasmid pip501 to escherichia  coli and streptomyces lividans and sequence analysis of its tra region.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the transfer (tra) region of the multiresistance broad-host-range inc18 plasmid pip501 was completed. the 8629-bp dna sequence encodes 10 open reading frames (orf), 9 of them are possibly involved in pip501 conjugative transfer. the putative pip501 tra gene products show highest similarity to the respective orfs of the conjugative enterococcus faecalis plasmids pre25 and pambeta1, and the streptococcus pyogenes plasmid psm19035, respectively. orf7 and orf10 encode putative homologues of type iv secretion systems involved in transport of effector molecules from pathogens to host cells  and in conjugative plasmid transfer in gram-negative (g-) bacteria. pip501 mobilized non-selftransmissible plasmids such as pmv158 between different e. faecalis strains and from e. faecalis to bacillus subtilis. evidence for the very broad-host-range of pip501 was obtained by intergeneric conjugative transfer of pip501 to a multicellular gram-positive (g+) bacterium, streptomyces lividans, and to g- escherichia coli. we proved for the first time pip501 replication, expression of its antibiotic resistance genes as well as functionality of the pip501 tra genes in s. lividans and e. coli.

TI  == role of the enterococcus faecalis gele protease in determination of cellular chain length, supernatant pheromone levels, and degradation of fibrin and misfolded surface proteins.
AB  == gelatinase (gele), a secreted zn-metalloprotease of enterococcus faecalis, has been implicated as a virulence factor by both epidemiological data and animal model studies. expression of gele is induced at a high cell density by the fsr quorum-sensing system. in the present study, gele was shown to be responsible for the instability of a number of asc10 (aggregation substance) mutant proteins, implying that gele functions to clear the bacterial cell surface of misfolded proteins. disruption of gele production led to increased cell chain length of e.  faecalis, from a typical diplococcus morphology to chains of 5 to 10 cells. this  function of gele was also exhibited when the protein was expressed in streptococcus pyogenes. gele-expressing e. faecalis strains were more autolytic,  suggesting that gele affects chain length through activation of an autolysin. gele was also essential for degradation of polymerized fibrin. gele expression reduced the titer of ccf10, the peptide pheromone that induces conjugation of pcf10, and pcf10 had increased conjugation into non-gele-expressing strains. these new functions attributed to gele suggest that it acts to increase the dissemination of e. faecalis in high-density environments.

TI  == proteinases of common pathogenic bacteria degrade and inactivate the antibacterial peptide ll-37.
AB  == effectors of the innate immune system, the anti-bacterial peptides, have pivotal  roles in preventing infection at epithelial surfaces. here we show that proteinases of the significant human pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis and streptococcus pyogenes, degrade the  antibacterial peptide ll-37. analysis by mass spectrometry of fragments generated by p. aeruginosa elastase in vitro revealed that the initial cleavages occurred at asn-leu and asp-phe, followed by two breaks at arg-ile, thus inactivating the  peptide. proteinases of the other pathogens also degraded ll-37 as determined by  sds-page. ex vivo, p. aeruginosa elastase induced ll-37 degradation in human wound fluid, leading to enhanced bacterial survival. the degradation was blocked  by the metalloproteinase inhibitors gm6001 and 1, 10-phenantroline (both of which inhibited p. aeruginosa elastase, p. mirabilis proteinase, and e. faecalis gelatinase), or the inhibitor e64 (which inhibited s. pyogenes cysteine proteinase). additional experiments demonstrated that dermatan sulphate and disaccharides of the structure [deltaua(2s)-galnac(4,6s)], or sucroseoctasulphate, inhibited the degradation of ll-37. the results indicate that proteolytic degradation of ll-37 is a common virulence mechanism and that molecules which block this degradation could have therapeutic potential.

TI  == patterns of isolation of common gram positive bacterial pathogens and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents in jimma hospital.
AB  == gram positive bacteria are frequently emerging as antibiotic resistant pathogens, causing serious infections than ever before in the ill and debilitated patients.  the pattern of isolation and the antimicrobial susceptibilities of common gram positive cocci including staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons), streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus species and streptococcus pneumoniae was investigated between january 1997 and june 2000 in jimma hospital. of the 500 specimens collected from children and adults, 116 (23.2%) consisted of one or more of the above organisms. the following strains: staphylococcus aureus, 47 (40.5%), cons, 36 (31.0%), streptococcus pneumoniae, 26 (22.4%) streptococcus pyogenes, 5 (4.3%) and streptococcus faecalis, 2(1.7%) were isolated from different specimens including pus, sputum, urine, stool, blood and oro/nasopharyngeal swabs of patients. the in vitro activities of 14 different antibiotics including penicillin g, ampicillin, cloxacillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, kanamycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin, methicillin, vancomycin and clindamycin was determined against the clinical bacterial isolates. the antimicrobial activities were evaluated by agar diffusion technique using mueller-hinton agar according to nccls recommendations. the majority of the pathogens, 59(50.9%) were recovered from upper respiratory tract infections and 17 (14.6%) from the lower respiratory tract. the resistance patterns of s. aureus, cons, s. pneumoniae and enterococci to penicillin was 91.5%, 94.4%, 7.7%  and 100% respectively. penicillin, ampicillin and cloxacillin showed low effects  (< 60%) on both s. aureus and cons. multi-drug resistance was observed in all the gram-positive isolates, especially higher in staphylococcus species. all isolates of s. aureus (100%) were susceptible to vancomycin, clindamycin and gentamicin. in order to reduce morbidity and mortality due to antibiotic resistance susceptibility testing should be performed for the proper management of bacterial infections. this entails the need for national surveillance to monitor antibiotic resistance in bacteria by susceptibility testing using reliable methods.

TI  == [interpretative reading of the antibiogram in gram-positive cocci].
AB  == resistance to methicillin in staphylococcus is related to expression of the gene  meca, and implies resistance to all beta-lactams. breakpoints for interpretation  of this mechanism differ in s. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. in relation to macrolides-lincosamides-streptograminsb, the most frequent mechanism  among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump nora determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences on the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. strains of s. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (gisa strains) have been recently described. in spain, there is a high percentage of s. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage  of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, because  of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. the most frequent phenotype of resistance to macrolides in this species is caused by methylase production. resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is related to the mechanisms previously indicated for staphylococcus, but clinical interpretation of the antibiograma for this organism is even more complex. no strains of s. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. in spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in s. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. e. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to e. faecium. enterococci show intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes became resistant to the combination. glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in our country, but several genotypes, of which vana is the most relevant from a clinical point of view, have been described in other regions.

TI  == the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase motif is lacking in pmpa, the prsa-like protein involved in the secretion machinery of lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the prsa-like gene from lactococcus lactis encoding its single homologue to prsa, an essential protein triggering the folding of secreted proteins in bacillus subtilis, was characterized. this gene, annotated pmpa, encodes a lipoprotein of  309 residues whose expression is increased 7- to 10-fold when the source of nitrogen is limited. a slight increase in the expression of the prsa-like protein (plp) in l. lactis removed the degradation products previously observed with the  staphylococcus hyicus lipase used as a model secreted protein. this shows that pmpa either triggers the folding of the secreted lipase or activates its degradation by the cell surface protease htra. unlike the case for b. subtilis, the inactivation of the gene encoding pmpa reduced only slightly the growth rate  of l. lactis in standard conditions. however, it almost stopped its growth when the lipase was overexpressed in the presence of salt in the medium. like prsa of  b. subtilis and prtm of l. lactis, the l. lactis pmpa protein could thus have a foldase activity that facilitates protein secretion. these proteins belong to the third family of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerases (ppiases) for which parvulin is the prototype. almost all plp from gram-positive bacteria contain a domain with the ppiase signature. an exception to this situation was found only in streptococcaceae, the family to which l. lactis belongs. plp from streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis possess this signature, but those of l. lactis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus mutans do not. however, secondary structure predictions suggest that the folding of plp is conserved over the entire length of the proteins, including the unconserved signature region. the activity associated with the expression of pmpa in l. lactis and these genomic data show that either the ppiase motif is not necessary for ppiase activity or, more likely, pmpa foldase activity does not necessarily require ppiase activity.

TI  == in vitro action of carboxyfullerene.
AB  == fullerene compounds have avid reactivity with free radicals and are regarded as 'radical sponges'. the trimalonic acid derivative of fullerene is one of the water-soluble compounds that has been synthesized and found to be an effective antioxidant both in vivo and in vitro. carboxyfullerene has been shown to be effective in the treatment of both gram-positive and -negative infections, although its mode of action is poorly understood. we determined the mic and minimal bactericidal concentration of carboxyfullerene for 20 isolates, including staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi and klebsiella pneumoniae. we further investigated the action of carboxyfullerene using transmission electron microscopy (tem), anticarboxyfullerene antibody binding assay and a membrane perturbation assay. all gram-positive species were inhibited by < or = 50 mg/l of carboxyfullerene, whereas gram-negative species were not inhibited, even at 500 mg/l carboxyfullerene. bactericidal activity was demonstrated only for gram-positive species, particularly for streptococcus pyogenes a-20, which was killed rapidly. intercalation of carboxyfullerene into the cell wall of staphylococci and streptococci was demonstrated by tem and anti-carboxyfullerene  binding assay. damage to the cell membrane in gram-positive, but not gram-negative, bacteria was confirmed by the membrane perturbation assay. these findings indicate that the action of carboxyfullerene on gram-positive bacteria is achieved by insertion into the cell wall and destruction of membrane integrity.

AB  == objective: to evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in italy. methods: susceptibility tests were performed according to nccls-guided mic methodology. pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 enterococcal isolates, 40 haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 gram-positive and 25 gram-negative anaerobes. results: quinupristin/dalfopristin  inhibited staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. enterococcus faecalis was not  included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. respiratory pathogens such as h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all gram-negative anaerobes tested. conclusions: these findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe  nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. this drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of dq-113, formerly d61-1113, was compared with those  of antibacterial agents currently available. mics at which 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited (mic90s) of dq-113 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.03, 0.008, 0.03, and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. moreover, dq-113 showed the  most potent activity against ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, with a mic90 of 0.25microg/ml. dq-113 inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains, and streptococcus pyogenes at 0.06 microg/ml, and dq-113 was more active than the other quinolones tested against enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium with mic90s of 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively. against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, dq-113 showed the highest activity among the reference compounds, with a mic range from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml. dq-113 also showed a potent activity against haemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains (mic90, 0.015 microg/ml), and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.03 microg/ml). the activity of dq-113 was roughly comparable to that of levofloxacin against all species of enterobacteriaceae: the mics of dq-113 against ofloxacin-susceptible pseudomonas  aeruginosa ranged from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml, which were four times higher than those of ciprofloxacin. from these results, dq-113 showed the most potent activity against gram-positive pathogens among antibacterial agents tested.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against clinical isolates of enterococcus spp., staphylococcus spp., and streptococcus spp. tested by etest.

TI  == the pava gene of streptococcus pneumoniae encodes a fibronectin-binding protein that is essential for virulence.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae colonizes the nasopharynx in up to 40% of healthy subjects, and is a leading cause of middle ear infections (otitis media), meningitis and pneumonia. pneumococci adhere to glycosidic receptors on epithelial cells and to immobilized fibronectin, but the bacterial adhesins mediating these reactions are largely uncharacterized. in this report we describe a novel pneumococcal protein pava, which binds fibronectin and is associated with pneumococcal adhesion and virulence. the pava gene, present in 64 independent isolates of s. pneumoniae tested, encodes a 551 amino acid residue polypeptide with 67% identical amino acid sequence to fbp54 protein in streptococcus pyogenes. pava localized to the pneumococcal cell outer surface, as demonstrated  by immunoelectron microscopy, despite lack of conventional secretory or cell-surface anchorage signals within the primary sequence. full-length recombinant pava polypeptide bound to immobilized human fibronectin in preference to fluid-phase fibronectin, in a heparin-sensitive interaction, and blocked binding of wild-type pneumococcal cells to fibronectin. however, a c-terminally truncated pava' polypeptide (362 aa residues) failed to bind fibronectin or block pneumococcal cell adhesion. expression of pava in enterococcus faecalis jh2-2 conferred > sixfold increased cell adhesion levels to fibronectin over control jh2-2 cells. isogenic mutants of s. pneumoniae, either abrogated in pava expression or producing a 42 kda c-terminally truncated protein, showed up to 50% reduced binding to immobilized fibronectin. inactivation of pava had no effects on growth rate, cell morphology, cell-surface physico-chemical properties, production of pneumolysin, autolysin, or surface proteins pspa and psaa. isogenic pava mutants of encapsulated s. pneumoniae d39 were approximately 104-fold attenuated in virulence in the mouse sepsis model. these results provide evidence that pava fibronectin-binding protein plays a direct role in the pathogenesis of  pneumococcal infections.

TI  == a simple model host for identifying gram-positive virulence factors.
AB  == we demonstrate the use of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans as a facile and inexpensive model host for several gram-positive human bacterial pathogens. enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus, but not bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecium, or streptococcus pyogenes, kill adult c. elegans. focusing our studies on the enterococcal species, we found that both e. faecalis and e. faecium kill c. elegans eggs and hatchlings, although only e. faecalis kills the adults. in the case of adults, a low inoculum of e. faecalis grows to a high titer in the c. elegans intestine, resulting in a persistent infection that cannot be eradicated by prolonged feeding on e. faecium. interestingly, a high titer of e. faecium also accumulates in the nematode gut, but does not affect the longevity of the worms. two e. faecalis virulence-related factors that play an important role in mammalian models of infection, fsr, a putative quorum-sensing system, and cytolysin, are also important for nematode killing. we exploit the apparent parallels between gram-positive infection in simple and more complex organisms by using the nematode to identify an e. faecalis virulence factor, scrb, which is relevant to  mammalian pathogenesis.

TI  == antibacterial activity of traditional australian medicinal plants.
AB  == fifty-six ethanolic extracts of various parts of 39 plants used in traditional australian aboriginal medicine were investigated for their antibacterial activities against four gram-positive (bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes) and four gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium) bacterial species. in a plate-hole diffusion assay, 12 extracts inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria, with five extracts showing broad spectrum antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria. b. cereus was the most susceptible bacterium, with all 12 extracts displaying activity against this organism. extracts from the leaves of eremophila species (myoporaceae) were the most active, with eremophila duttonii exhibiting the greatest activity (against gram-positive bacteria). the antibacterial effects of  e. duttonii were further investigated by time-course growth assays which showed that significant growth inhibition was observed in cultures incubated in the presence of the extract within 1 h for b. cereus, e. faecalis and s. aureus and 2 h for s. pyogenes.

TI  == conserved degp protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the degp protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, brucella abortus, yersinia enterocolitica, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the function of degp in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. additionally, the degp protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining  the escherichia coli periplasm and influences e. coli pilus biogenesis. we report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degp allele in s. pyogenes is similar to that reported for e. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional degp protease is required for full virulence. these results suggest degp as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.

TI  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of gram-positive aerobic clinical  isolates. mics were determined by an agar dilution method on mueller-hinton agar  (nccls/eucast) and on isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/l free calcium (bsac). both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. daptomycin mics for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/l. for 99 of the 100 enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/l. for all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin mics were 0.016- 0.25 mg/l; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/l. for miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including lactobacillus spp., lactococcus spp., leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp. and isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin mics were 0.03-2 mg/l; mics for the seven isolates of listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/l. there was little difference between the results on mueller-hinton agar and  on supplemented isotonic agar the discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented isotonic agar. daptomycin was active (mics < or = 2 mg/l) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of e. faecium and l. monocytogenes (mics = 4 mg/l). our results indicate that daptomycin mics are independent of methicillin and vancomycin mics.

TI  == in vitro activities of ertapenem (mk-0826) against recent clinical bacteria collected in europe and australia.
AB  == ertapenem (mk-0826, l-749,345) is a 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long serum half-life. its in vitro activity was determined by broth microdilution against 3,478 bacteria from 12 centers in europe and australia, with imipenem, cefepime,  ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam used as comparators. ertapenem was the most active agent tested against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)s) of < or =1 microg/ml for all species. ertapenem also was more active than imipenem against fastidious gram-negative bacteria and moraxella spp.; on the other hand, ertapenem was slightly less active than imipenem against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci, and anaerobes, but its mic(90)s for these groups remained < or =0.5 microg/ml. acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also much less susceptible to ertapenem than imipenem, and most enterococcus faecalis strains were resistant. ertapenem resistance, based on a provisional nccls mic breakpoint of > or =16 microg/ml, was seen in only 3 of 1,611 strains of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, all of them enterobacter aerogenes. resistance was also seen in 2 of 135 anaerobes, comprising 1 bacteroides fragilis strain and 1 clostridium difficile strain. ertapenem breakpoints for streptococci have not been established, but an unofficial susceptibility breakpoint of < or =2 microg/ml was adopted for clinical trials to generate corresponding clinical response data for isolates for which mics were as high as 2 microg/ml. of 234 streptococcus pneumoniae strains tested, 2 required ertapenem mics of 2 microg/ml and one required an mic of 4 microg/ml, among 67 non-streptococcus pyogenes, non-streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci, single isolates required ertapenem mics of 2 and 16 microg/ml. these streptococci also had diminished susceptibilities to other beta-lactams, including imipenem as well as ertapenem.  the etest and disk diffusion gave susceptibility test results in good agreement with those of the broth microdilution method for ertapenem.

TI  == new gene cluster for lantibiotic streptin possibly involved in streptolysin s formation.
AB  == streptolysin s (sls) is a serum-extractable and oxygen-stable hemolysin produced  by group a streptococcus. a sls-deficient mutant in which transposon tn 916 was inserted in a locus distinct from the sag gene cluster [nizet et al. (2000) infect. immun. 68, 4245-4254] was obtained by filter mating of the transposon-harbouring enterococcus faecalis strain and streptococcus pyogenes bl(t). this mutant, n22, had completely lost the hemolytic activity, in consequence of insertion of a single tn 916 into a hitherto-unknown lantibiotic gene cluster composed of 10 open reading frames. the arrangement and sequence of  this lantibiotic gene cluster were similar to those of nisin and subtilin, and so we designated this new lantibiotic as streptin. the bactericidal activity of streptin was abolished on treatment with trypsin or proteinase k. the different host range and nucleotide sequence clearly distinguished streptin from streptococcins. streptin was not hemolytic and its bacteriocin activity was independent of carrier oligonucleotides effective for sls. the fact that n22 also lost the anti-bacterial activity against indicator streptococci reveals that the  factor(s) required for lantibiotic formation plays an important role in sls formation as well.

TI  == dermatan sulphate is released by proteinases of common pathogenic bacteria and inactivates antibacterial alpha-defensin.
AB  == defensins represent an evolutionarily conserved group of small peptides with potent antibacterial activities. we report here that extracellular proteinases secreted by the human pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes release dermatan sulphate by degrading dermatan sulphate-containing proteoglycans, such as decorin. dermatan sulphate was found to bind to neutrophil-derived alpha-defensin, and this binding completely neutralized its bactericidal activity. during infection, proteoglycan degradation and release of dermatan sulphate may therefore represent a previously unknown virulence mechanism, which could serve as a target for novel antibacterial strategies.

AB  == a lactococcus lactis glycine-betaine transport system was identified by functional complementation of an escherichia coli prop prou mutant with a gene library from l. lactis sbsp. cremoris. the cloned locus forms an operon highly homologous to opua, encoding a glycine-betaine uptake system of bacillus subtilis. disruption of opua in l. lactis abolished protection by glycine-betaine against elevated osmolarity. opua belongs to the so-called "abc transporters" family, which comprise an extracellularly localized substrate-binding protein. in b. subtilis opua system, this binding protein is a lipoprotein, attached to the external face of the cytoplasmic membrane by its lipidic moiety. in contrast, in  the l. lactis opua operon, and in other gram-positive homologues as well, a fusion between the gene encoding the integral membrane protein and the substrate-binding protein components gave rise to a hybrid protein presumably attaching the substrate-binding protein to the surface of the cell via its covalent link to the integral membrane component. mapping of l. lactis opua transcription start identified one mrna, more abundant in cells grown at elevated osmolarity. construction of an opua-gusa fusion confirmed that opua transcription is directed by a promoter osmotically inducible in l. lactis. when recombined upstream from a lac transcriptional fusion in the chromosome of e. coli, the opua promoter appeared as very strong, and only poorly stimulated by elevated osmotic  pressure, suggesting the existence of a specific machinery involved in the osmotic signal transduction in l. lactis.

TI  == the gene encoding iiab(man)l in streptococcus salivarius is part of a tetracistronic operon encoding a phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose/glucose phosphotransferase system.
AB  == glucose and mannose are transported in streptococci by the mannose-pts (phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system), which consists of a cytoplasmic iiab protein, called iiab(man), and an uncharacterized membrane permease. this paper reports the characterization of the man operon encoding the  specific components of the mannose-pts of streptococcus salivarius. the man operon was composed of four genes, manl, manm, mann and mano. these genes were transcribed from a canonical promoter (pman) into a 3.6 kb polycistronic mrna that contained a 5'-utr (untranslated region). the predicted manl gene product encoded a 35.5 kda protein and contained the amino acid sequences of the iia and  iib phosphorylation sites already determined from purified s. salivarius iiab(man)l. expression of manl in escherichia coli generated a 35 kda protein that reacted with anti-iiab(man)l antibodies. the predicted manm protein had an estimated size of 27.2 kda. manm had similarity with iic domains of the mannose-eii family, but did not possess the signature proposed for mannose-iic proteins from gram-negative bacteria. from multiple alignment analyses of sequences available in current databases, the following modified iic(man) signature is proposed: gx3g[dnh]x3g[livm]2xg2[stl][lt][eq]. the deduced product of mann was a hydrophobic protein with a predicted molecular mass of 33.4 kda. the mann protein contained an amino acid sequence similar to the signature sequence of the iid domains of the mannose-eii family. mano encoded a 13.7 kda protein. this gene was also transcribed as a monocistronic mrna from a promoter located in the mann-mano intergenic region. a search of current databases revealed the presence of iiab(man)l, manm, mann and mano orthologues in streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. this work has elucidated the molecular structure of the mannose pts in streptococci and enterococci, and demonstrated the presence of a putative regulatory protein (mano) within the man operon.

AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) adhere to surface receptors present on epithelial cells; these receptors include fibronectin and laminin. to identify other possible receptors, plasma membranes from a549 cells, a respiratory tract epithelial cell line, were prepared. these plasma membranes were tested in a protein blot analysis using radiolabeled gbs as a probe. gbs adhered to two species, with molecular masses of 50 kda (p50) and 57 kda (p57). we concluded that p50 and p57 correspond to two forms of cytokeratin 8 (ck8) on the basis of the following results: (i) protein blot results demonstrated that p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with two forms of ck8 after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page); (ii) p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with ck8 after separation by two-dimensional page; (iii) ck8 in solution bound to gbs, as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of proteins from a549 lysates that bound to gbs in a liquid-phase assay; and (iv) radiolabeled gbs bound to a549 lysate-derived ck8 that had been captured in anti-ck8-coated microtiter wells. ck8 bound to coh1-13, an acapsular mutant of coh1, demonstrating that adherence is not mediated by capsular polysaccharide. trypsin-treated gbs did not bind to ck8, indicating that adherence is mediated via a protein on the surface of gbs. soluble ck8 bound to six of six gbs strains  tested. soluble ck8 also bound to staphylococcus aureus, lactococcus lactis, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pyogenes. we hypothesize that adherence  of gbs to cytokeratin may be important for maintenance of colonization at sites of keratinized epithelium, such as the vagina, or for adherence of these bacteria to damaged epithelial cells at other sites.

TI  == the in vitro effects of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate on oral and pharyngeal microorganisms of various ecological niches.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility to cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for various aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms responsible for oral and pharyngeal diseases by assessing the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations  (mbcs) or minimum fungicidal concentrations (mfcs) and by determining kill-times. the mics of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for 46 tested strains (25 reference strains and 21 clinical isolates) ranged from 8 to 500 micrograms/ml. the mic was found to be 31.25 micrograms/ml for 36% of the reference strains. even lower mic values (15.63 micrograms/ml) were observed for some anaerobic strains, for haemophilus influenzae and for candida tropicalis. mic and mbc values corresponded for the majority of strains tested while the mfc for c. tropicalis and c. albicans was much higher. only 9.5% of the clinical isolates gave a mic value of 31.25 micrograms/ml. enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus showed mic at 62.5 micrograms/ml. the mic and  mbc values among the isolates were comparable, while the mfc value for the yeasts was greater. a concentration of 125 micrograms/ml of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate inhibited the growth of all bacteria, except enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae, and yeasts. cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate shows very rapid kill-time for s. sanguis (0"), and rapid (15") for s. pyogenes, s. dysgalactiae and s. mutans and for moraxella catarrhalis, while a longer kill-time was necessary for the other microbes tested.

TI  == structure-activity relationships of novel 2-substituted quinazoline antibacterial agents.
AB  == high-throughput screening of in-house compound libraries led to the discovery of  a novel antibacterial agent, compound 1 (mic: 12-25 microm against s. pyogenes).  in an effort to improve the activity of this active compound, a series of 2-substituted quinazolines was synthesized and evaluated in several antibacterial assays. one such compound (22) displayed improved broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against a variety of bacterial strains. this molecule also inhibited transcription/translation of bacterial rna, suggesting a mechanism for its antibiotic effects. structure-activity relationship studies of 22 led to the synthesis of another 24 compounds. although some of these molecules were found to be active in bacterial growth assays, none were as potent as 22. compound 22 was  tested for its ability to cure a systemic k. pneumonia infection in the mouse and displayed moderate effects compared with a control antibiotic, gentamycin.

TI  == in vitro activity of levofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of levofloxacin was investigated against 256 clinical strains of four gram-positive genera (staphylococcus, streptococcus, enterococcus, and listeria). ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were used as comparators. uniform susceptibility to levofloxacin was recorded among methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci other than streptococcus agalactiae, regardless of their being susceptible, intermediate, or resistant to  penicillin (s. pneumoniae) or erythromycin (s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae), in enterococci other than enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, and in listeria monocytogenes isolates. moreover, 1 of 22 s. agalactiae isolates and 1 of 19 e. faecium isolates was resistant, and 2 of 19 were intermediate. resistances to levofloxacin with mic90s in the resistance range were only observed in methicillin-resistant staphylococci and e. faecalis isolates. in any case, the mics of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were usually 2-4 times higher than those of levofloxacin. in time-kill assays using three test strains (a methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus isolate, a penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae isolate, and an e. faecalis isolate), the bactericidal activity of levofloxacin was greater than that of ciprofloxacin.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin with a wide gram-positive spectrum.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid) is a new injectable streptogramin antibiotic proposed for the treatment of severe antimicrobial infections, that has been shown to be active against gram-positive, multi-resistant cocci. we compared the  in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin with that of amoxycillin, ampicillin, penicillin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, erythromycin, imipenem, meropenem, oxacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, teicoplanin and vancomycin. the susceptibility of 37 staphylococcus aureus (14 ms, 23 mr), 26 staphylococcus epidermidis (16 ms, 10 mr), 20 streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 group  a streptococcus pyogenes, 15 streptococcus agalactiae, 10 enterococcus faecalis (1 vancomycin-resistant), 15 enterococcus faecium (9 van a) was evaluated. quinupristin/dalfopristin was active against all gram-positive species tested, including met-r s. aureus (mic < or = 2 mg/l), met-r s. epidermidis (mic < or = 2 mg/l), s. pneumoniae (mic < or = 1 mg/l), ery-r and ery-s streptococci (mic < or  = 1 mg/l). the strains of e. faecalis were generally less susceptible. time-kill  studies confirmed that quinupristin/dalfopristin at 4 x mic concentration showed  a complete bactericidal effect (3 log reduction) in about 4 6 h against all strains tested. a post-antibiotic effect (pae) of 3.9-5.2 h was observed at 4 x mic concentration of quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococci. a prolonged pae was obtained for s. pneumoniae (8 h), s. pyogenes (9 h) and s. agalactiae (7  h), while the shortest pae was seen for e. faecalis and e. faecium (about 4 h).

AB  == the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with  those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms  except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).

TI  == characterization of enterococcus faecalis alkaline phosphatase and use in identifying streptococcus agalactiae secreted proteins.
AB  == we have identified and characterized an enterococcus faecalis alkaline phosphatase (ap, encoded by phoz). the predicted gene product shows homology with alkaline phosphatases from a variety of species; it has especially high similarity with two alkaline phosphatases from bacillus subtilis. expression of phoz in escherichia coli, e. faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs]), or streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gas]) produces a blue-colony phenotype on plates containing a chromogenic substrate, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (xp or bcip). two tests were made to determine if the activity of the enzyme is dependent upon the enzyme's subcellular location. first, elimination of the signal sequence reduced ap activity to 3% of the wild-type activity (or less) in three species of gram-positive bacteria. restoration of export, using the signal sequence from c5a peptidase, restored ap activity to at least 50% of that of the wild type. second, we engineered two chimeric proteins in which ap was fused to either a periplasmic domain or a cytoplasmic domain of lactose permease (a membrane protein). in e. coli, the periplasmic fusion had 17-fold-higher ap activity than the cytoplasmic  fusion. we concluded that ap activity is export dependent. the signal sequence deletion mutant, phozdeltass, was used to identify random genomic fragments from  gbs that encode exported proteins or integral membrane proteins. included in this set of fragments were genes that exhibited homology with the rib protein (a cell  wall protein from gbs) or with dppb (an integral membrane protein from gas). ap acts as a reporter enzyme in gbs, gas, and e. faecalis and is expected to be useful in a variety of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of various endodontic irrigants on selected microorganisms.
AB  == aim: this study was undertaken to determine the antimicrobial effect of various endodontic irrigants against six selected microorganisms. methodology: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus salivarius, str. pyogenes, escherichia coli and candida albicans were included in the study. pre-sterilized whatman paper discs, 6 mm in diameter and soaked with the test solution, were prepared and placed onto the previously seeded agar petri plates.  each plate was incubated aerobically. a zone of inhibition was recorded for each  plate and the results were analysed statistically. results: 5.25% naocl was effective against all test microorganisms with a substantial zone of inhibition.  saline was always ineffective. decreased concentration of naocl significantly reduced its antimicrobial effect. cresophene showed a significantly larger (p < 0.05) average zone of inhibition compared to the other experimental irrigants. alcohol had smaller but not significantly different zones of inhibition than chlorhexidine. conclusions: 5.25% naocl was superior in its antimicrobial abilities compared with other irrigants used. a reduced concentration of naocl (0.5%) resulted in significantly decreased antimicrobial effects. when compared with 21% alcohol, 0.5% naocl and 2% chlorhexidine, paramonochlorophenol (cresophene) showed a greater antimicrobial effect.

TI  == clpe, a novel type of hsp100 atpase, is part of the ctsr heat shock regulon of bacillus subtilis.
AB  == clp atpases, which include the ubiquitous hsp100 family, are classified according to their structural features and sequence similarities. during the course of the  bacillus subtilis genome sequencing project, we identified a gene encoding a new  member of the hsp100 family. we designated this protein clpe, as it is the prototype of a novel subfamily among the clp atpases, and have identified homologues in several bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, lactobacillus sakei and clostridium acetobutylicum. a unique feature of these hsp100-type clp atpases is their amino-terminal zinc finger motif. unlike the other class iii genes of b. subtilis (clpc and clpp ), clpe does not appear to be required for stress tolerance. transcriptional analysis revealed two sigmaa-type promoters, expression from which was shown to be inducible by heat shock and puromycin treatment. investigation of the regulatory mechanism controlling clpe expression  indicates that this gene is controlled by ctsr and is thus a member of the class  iii heat shock genes of b. subtilis. ctsr negatively regulates clpe expression by binding to the promoter region, in which five ctsr binding sites were identified  through dnase i footprinting and sequence analysis.

AB  == the mics of quinupristin/dalfopristin against common gram-positive bacteria isolated from various clinical specimens at a university hospital in taiwan were  determined by the agar dilution method. the tested bacteria included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis (msse), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis. with the exception of e. faecalis all bacteria were susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin. the mic50 and mic90 were, respectively, 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml for both mrsa and mssa; 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml for mrse; 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.25 microgram/ml for msse; 0.125 microgram/ml and 0.125 microgram/ml for s.  pyogenes; and < or = 0.03 microgram/ml and 0.25 microgram/ml for s. pneumoniae. eighty-two percent of the tested e. faecalis isolates were intermediately resistant or resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin, with an mic50 of 2 micrograms/ml and an mic90 of 4 micrograms/ml. quinupristin/dalfopristin seems to be a promising antimicrobial agent against common gram-positive bacteria other than e. faecalis in taiwan.

TI  == [a consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-positive cocci and gram-negative cocci].
AB  == the results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the japanese ministry of health and welfare during the period of january 1993 to july 1995, were analyzed for typical gram-positive  cocci and gram-negative cocci in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. during these 3 years, streptococcus pyogenes (group a) and streptococcus agalactiae (group b) showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to ofloxacin (oflx) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (st), while  streptococcus pneumoniae and moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis showed slightly  decreasing tendency to cefaclor (ccl). however, these annual changes were almost  negligible. generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against gram-positive and -negative cocci. however, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. on the other hand, cefmetazole (cmz), vancomycin (vcm), latamoxef (lmox), st and minocycline (mino) showed good activities against some of the gram-positive and -negative cocci to which no indication are approved. in conclusion, beside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents)  could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of an antimicrobial agent is necessary.

TI  == ctsr, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == clpp and clpc of bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the clp atp-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. they play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the  so-called class iii group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. the product of ctsr, the first gene of the clpc operon, has now been  shown to act as a repressor of both clpp and clpc, as well as clpe, which encodes a novel member of the hsp100 clp atpase family. the ctsr protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. random mutagenesis, dnasel footprinting and dna sequence deletions and comparisons were  used to define a consensus ctsr recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. this target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus salivarius, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc oenos, lactobacillus sake, lactococcus lactis and clostridium acetobutylicum. ctsr homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by ctsr is highly conserved in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == streptococcus pyogenes protein f promotes invasion of hela cells.
AB  == although the gram-positive bacterium streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus) has been considered an extracellular pathogen which adheres to human mucosal epithelium, the streptococcus possesses invasive capacity for cultured human epithelial cells. this study provides genetic and functional evidence supporting the conclusion that protein f is capable of mediating entry of s. pyogenes into hela cells. using tn916 insertion mutagenesis or an isogenic  s. pyogenes strain with a defined mutation in the gene encoding protein f (prtf), it was observed that the invasive capacity was affected by the levels of surface-exposed protein f, but not by those of m protein. in addition, heterologous expression of protein f on enterococcus faecalis conferred upon the  bacteria an efficient invasive phenotype. several assays demonstrated that both the fibronectin-binding domains of protein f, ur and rd2, were involved in host-cell invasion. in addition, coinfection experiments of hela cells with s. pyogenes and an escherichia coli k-12 strain expressing an afimbrial adhesin afa-i showed that the uptake of s. pyogenes did not permit internalization of the e. coli cells.

TI  == bacteriological activity of trovafloxacin, a new quinolone, against respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  == the use of established fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, as  empirical therapy for the treatment of moderate-to-severe respiratory tract infections is limited by their poor activity against gram-positive and atypical pathogens. data from in vitro susceptibility studies and in vivo animal protection models suggest that the new fluoroquinolone, trovafloxacin, compared with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin offers equivalent activity against gram-negative pathogens and improved activity against gram-positive pathogens. in particular, susceptibility data indicate that trovafloxacin is at least 16-fold more potent than either ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae. other susceptible pathogens include streptococcus pyogenes, vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis and the atypical respiratory pathogens legionella pneumophila, mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumoniae. in vivo studies involving models  of protection against acute systemic infection and pneumococcal pneumonia in mice, and legionnaires' disease in guinea pigs, indicate that the antibacterial spectrum observed for trovafloxacin in vitro extends to the in vivo setting. together, these findings suggest that trovafloxacin may offer clinical efficacy against respiratory pathogens superior to that of ciprofloxacin and of ofloxacin, and may find a useful role as empiric therapy in both the community and hospital  setting.

TI  == blue/white screening of recombinant plasmids in gram-positive bacteria by interruption of alkaline phosphatase gene (phoz) expression.
AB  == the process of screening bacterial transformants for recombinant plasmids is made more rapid and simple by the use of vectors with visually detectable reporter genes. in such systems, an alteration in colony phenotype occurs when a vector-borne indicator gene is interrupted with exogenous dna. although the lacz  system has been used extensively for this purpose in e. coli, analogous systems for use in gram-positive bacteria remain uncommon. we have developed a gram-positive cloning vector that utilizes the interruption of an alkaline phosphatase gene, phoz, to identify recombinant plasmids. to facilitate introduction of foreign dna, a multiple cloning site (mcs) was inserted distal to the region coding for the putative signal peptide of phoz. alkaline phosphatase expressed from the derivative phoz gene (phozmcs) retained activity similar to that of the native protein. the phozmcs was transferred to pjs3, a well-characterized, high-copy number, and broad-host-range plasmid, to produce pdc123. in pdc123, phozmcs was transcriptionally linked to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) gene under the control of the constitutively expressed tetm and cat promoters that drive cat expression in pjs3. s. agalactiae (group b  streptococci, gbs), e. faecalis, s. pyogenes, s. gordonii, and e. coli containing pdc123 displayed a blue colonial phenotype on agar containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (x-p), which was readily distinguished from  that of colonies containing the parent plasmid pjs3. introduction of foreign dna  into the mcs of phozmcs produced a white colonial phenotype in e. coli and gbs on agar containing x-p and allowed discrimination between transformants containing recombinant plasmids versus those maintaining self-annealed or uncut vector. we have used pdc123 to subclone the cpse gene from the plasmid pcer111, which carries a 9.0-kb fragment of the gbs capsular polysaccharide synthesis locus. the plasmid pdc123 containing cpse was isolated by direct electroporation into gbs strain a909 with selection of transformants containing recombinant plasmids achieved by 'blue/white' screening, without the use of an intermediate host. this new cloning vector should improve the efficiency of performing recombinant dna experiments in gram-positive bacteria.

AB  == we characterized the regulated activity of the lactococcal nisa promoter in strains of the gram-positive species streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and bacillus subtilis. nisa promoter activity was dependent on the proteins nisr and nisk, which constitute a two-component signal transduction system that responds to the  extracellular inducer nisin. the nisin sensitivity and inducer concentration required for maximal induction varied among the strains. significant induction of the nisa promoter (10- to 60-fold induction) was obtained in all of the species studied at a nisin concentration just below the concentration at which growth is  inhibited. the efficiency of the nisa promoter was compared to the efficiencies of the spac, xyla, and laca promoters in b. subtilis and in s. pyogenes. because  nisa promoter-driven expression is regulated in many gram-positive bacteria, we expect it to be useful for genetic studies, especially studies with pathogenic streptococci in which no other regulated promoters have been described.

AB  == cfc-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. the in-vitro and in-vivo activities of cfc-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. against gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, cfc-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to  sparfloxacin. against gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of cfc-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. however, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. in mouse systemic infection caused by s. aureus smith or s. aureus tms 33, cfc-222 demonstrated an activity similar  to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. the compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by streptococcus pyogenes atcc 8668. against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. the activity of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against p. aeruginosa mb4-16 in the same infection model. these results suggest that cfc-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.

TI  == pharmacodynamic properties of hmr 3647, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  == the pharmacodynamic properties of a novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide), hmr 3647, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect (pae). the time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and bacteroides fragilis. the paes of hmr 3647 were also investigated on these organisms at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x mic. the time-kill kinetic data demonstrated that hmr 3647 is predominantly bacteriostatic and only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. hmr 3647 exhibited a significant pae with all strains studied, ranging from 1.2 h to 8.2 h at 10 x mic. the bacteriostatic activity and significant pae demonstrated by hmr 3647 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.

TI  == reduced virulence of group a streptococcal tn916 mutants that do not produce streptolysin s.
AB  == streptolysin s (sls) is a potent cytolytic toxin produced by nearly all group a streptococci (gas). sls-deficient tn916 insertional mutants were generated from two clinical isolates of gas, mgas166s and t18ps (m serotypes 1 and 18, respectively), by transposon mutagenesis using tn916 donor strain enterococcus faecalis cg110. representative nonhemolytic transconjugants sbnh5 and sb30-2 each harbored a single tn916 insertion in identical loci. the insertion in sbnh5 was located in the promoter region of an open reading frame, designated saga, rendering it transcriptionally inactive. protease, streptolysin o, and dnase activities and the production of m protein remained the same in the nonhemolytic  mutants and the wild-type strains, as did the growth rates and exoprotein profiles. transconjugants were evaluated in an established murine model by injecting the organisms subcutaneously and monitoring the mice for alterations in weight and the development of necrotic lesions. animals infected with sbnh5, compared to those infected with mgas166s, gained weight during the first 24 h (+1.15 versus -1.16 g; p < 0.05) and had fewer necrotic lesions (0 versus 7; p =  0.0007). animals infected with sb30-2, compared to those infected with t18ps, also gained weight within the first 24 h (+0.54 versus -0.66 g; p < 0.05) and produced fewer necrotic lesions (1 versus 8; p = 0.001). revertants of the mutants in which tn916 had been excised regained the hemolytic phenotype and the  virulence profile of the wild-type strains. this study demonstrates that sls-deficient mutants of gas, belonging to different m serotypes and containing identical tn916 mutations, are markedly less virulent than their isogenic parents.

TI  == import and metabolism of glutathione by streptococcus mutans.
AB  == glutathione (gamma-glucysgly, gsh) is not found in most gram-positive bacteria, but some appear to synthesize it and others, including streptococcus mutans atcc  33402, import it from their growth medium. import of oxidized glutathione (gssg)  by s. mutans 33402 in 7h9 medium was shown to require glucose and to occur with an apparent km of 18+/-5 microm. gssg, gsh, s-methylglutathione, and homocysteine-glutathione mixed disulfide (hcyssg) were imported at comparable rates (measured by depletion of substrate in the medium), as was the disulfide of gamma-glucys. in contrast, the disulfide of cysgly was not taken up at a measurable rate, indicating that the gamma-glu residue is important for efficient transport. during incubation with gssg, little gssg was detected in cells but gsh and gamma-glucys accumulated during the first 30 min and then declined. no significant intracellular accumulation of cys or sulfide was found. transient intracellular accumulation of d/l-homocysteine, as well as gsh and gamma-glucys,  was observed during import of hcyssg. although substantial levels of gsh were found in cells when s. mutans was grown on media containing glutathione, such gsh accumulation had no effect on the growth rate. however, the presence of cellular  gsh did protect against growth inhibition by the thiol-oxidizing agent diamide. import of glutathione by s. mutans atcc 25175, which like strain 33402 does not synthesize glutathione, occurred at a rate comparable to that of strain 33402, but three species which appear to synthesize glutathione (s. agalactiae atcc 12927, s. pyogenes atcc 8668, and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212) imported glutathione at negligible or markedly lower rates.

TI  == discovery of novel pyridinopolyamines with potent antimicrobial activity: deconvolution of mixtures synthesized by solution-phase combinatorial chemistry.
AB  == a 1638-member pyridinopolyamine library, consisting of 13 sublibraries of 126 members prepared by a solution-phase approach, was completely deconvoluted from orthogonally protected intermediates by a combination of iterative and positional scanning procedures. antibacterial assays against streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli imp- and a candida albicans yeast specificity assay were employed to follow the activity of sublibraries. screening of the 13 sublibraries, which were prepared by a synthetic method that places the differentiating functionality in a selected position a (secondary amine), at the  end of the synthesis (fix last), provided several first-round activities. subsequently, six single pyridinopolyamines (2-7) were prepared where the first-round winner, a hydrogen atom, is in the first deconvoluted position and the remaining three positions contained the same functionalities. the range of antibacterial and yeast activities of these single compounds suggested that a more active and selective compound may be discovered by completely deconvoluting  the first-round active sublibraries. pyridinopolyamine positions b (secondary benzylamine) and c (primary benzylamine) were then sequentially positionally scanned with a set of six meta-substituted benzyl functionalities to generate two sets of second/third-round sublibraries, containing 21 or 36 compounds in each sublibrary, respectively. high-throughput screening yielded sublibraries 15, 18,  and 21 with mics of 1-5 microm against s. pyogenes and e. coli imp-. using rounds 1 and 2/3 screening data, two sets of single compounds (22-27) and (28-32) with the combination of m-(trifluoromethyl)-benzyl group at position c and m-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl or m-methylbenzyl group at position b with position d (primary benzylamine) fixed were synthesized in the fourth round deconvolution. subsequently, broader screening of deconvoluted compounds against a tier ii panel of wild-type bacteria identified eight compounds (5, 7, 27, and 29-32) with approximately 100-fold greater selectivity for gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, s. pyogenes, s. pyogenes (wild-type), streptomyces aureus, and enterococcus faecalis were inhibited at mics of 1-12 microm, whereas mics for e.  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were >  100 microm. these eight compounds were not active (> 100 microm) against fungus c. albicans.

TI  == [comparative antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin), the first semisynthetic injectable streptgramin, against gram-positive cocci and other recent clinical pathogens].
AB  == rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. the components of rp 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci. rp 59,500 was active against a wide range of gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant s. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. rp 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus agalactiae and moraxella catarrhalis. rp 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium strains which  are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. no cross-resistance was observed between rp 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. the effect of human serum on the mic of rp 59,500 was studied with strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. faecalis. the presence of 20% (v/v) serum had little or no effect on the mic, although 50% (v/v) serum increased mics by 4-8 folds. laboratory-induced resistance to rp 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. population analysis was performed on rp 59,500 and the reference macrolides against s. aureus atcc 25,923 strain. although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with em, cam, azm and rxm, no rp 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.

AB  == the in vitro production of interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), il-6, and the il-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra) in whole blood upon stimulation with different bacterial strains was measured to study the possible relationship between disease severity and the cytokine-inducing capacities of these strains. escherichia coli, neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, bacteroides fragilis, capnocytophaga canimorsus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes induced the cytokines il-1beta, il-6, and il-1ra. gram-negative bacteria induced significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokine production than gram-positive bacteria. these  differences were less pronounced for the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-1ra. in addition, blood was stimulated with e. coli killed by different antibiotics to study the effect of the antibiotics on the cytokine-inducing capacity of the bacterial culture. e. coli treated with cefuroxime and gentamicin induced higher  levels of il-1beta and il-6 production but levels of il-1ra production similar to that of heat-killed e. coli. in contrast, ciprofloxacin- and imipenem-cilastatin-mediated killing showed a decreased or similar level of induction of cytokine production as compared to that by heat-killed e. coli; polymyxin b decreased the level of production of the cytokines.

TI  == in-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of lb10517, a novel catechol-substituted cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  == lb10517 is a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial  activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. lb10517 inhibited 90%  of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) at 0.25 mg/l (mic90), and was 8-fold more active than cefpirome. lb10517 was two- or four-fold more active  than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse), streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis. both methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse) were highly resistant to all compounds. lb10517 activity against most enterobacteriaceae was  comparable to or greater than that of cefpirome, and it also showed high activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. in a mouse septicaemia model, lb10517 exhibited excellent protective effects. in a respiratory tract infection model, the protective effect of lb10517 was comparable to that of cefpirome and ceftazidime. it was highly stable to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases, showing better physiological efficiency for tem-9 than the other test compounds. lb10517 had the most potent antibacterial activity against beta-lactamase producing resistant strains. lb10517 did not induce beta-lactamase production in enterobacter cloacae 1194e.

TI  == inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-p), has been documented for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and lactococcus lactis, but not for other gram-positive bacteria. using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated atp-dependent hpr(ser) kinase that phosphorylates ser-46 in hpr of the phosphotransferase system. a small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-p phosphatase (pase  ii), previously identified only in lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. further, lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks pase ii. the results reveal that pase ii is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-p hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. they provide correlative evidence that pase ii initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  == an internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase  chain reaction assay. the dna sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes were determined. comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of  the sod proteins from bacillus stearothermophilus, listeria monocytogenes, and streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. phylogenetic analysis of sod peptides showed that members of the genera streptococcus and those of the genera  enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. the method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == efficacies of abt-719 and related 2-pyridones, members of a new class of antibacterial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  == the 2-pyridones are a new class of broad-spectrum orally bioavailable antibacterial agents. these compounds are potent bacterial dna gyrase inhibitors  which differ from fluoroquinolones by placement of the nitrogen atom in the ring  juncture. abt-719 is an s isomer and a representative 2-pyridone. abt-719 administered orally or subcutaneously was 4- to 10-fold more effective than ciprofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes infections in normal mice. abt-719 was equivalent in efficacy to ciprofloxacin for treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa or escherichia coli. the racemate and r forms of abt-719 produced similar results against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. the 50% effective doses of abt-719 were at least threefold  lower than those of ciprofloxacin for therapy of intracellular infections caused  by salmonella typhimurium or listeria monocytogenes. in immunosuppressed mice, abt-719 was more effective than ciprofloxacin against quinolone-sensitive s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium. the pharmacokinetic properties of abt-719 were consistent with its relative efficacy. the 2-pyridones are potent, orally available antibacterial agents with efficacy against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections in mice.

(b.)  catarrhalis, h. influenzae, and almost all of enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc) and piperacillin (pipc), but antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were weak against mrsa and cephems (ceps)-resistant strains detected in some of enterobacteriaceae. 3. it appeared that benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp) or pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) and ceps-resistant escherichia coli increased  year by year. 4. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were strong against streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, m. (b.) catarrhalis and h. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of sbt was observed against beta-lactamase produced by s. aureus and k. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. thus, sbt/abpc is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness,  especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.

TI  == characterization of an erythromycin resistance (erm) plasmid in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == three erythromyxin-resistant swedish isolates of streptococcus pyogenes, representing different t-types, were studied. two of the strains showed constitutive high-level (mic > 200 micrograms/ml) and one showed moderate (mic 6.4 micrograms/ml) resistance; the latter strain was sensitive to lincosamide and clindamycin, and resistance was not induced by erythromycin. in each of the strains, a plasmid with an estimated mw of 17.6 +/- 0.9 x 10(6) was isolated in addition to smaller cryptic plasmids. the three plasmids pse701, pse702, and pse703 had very similar restriction enzyme cleavage patterns. novobiocin curing of the high-level resistance strain er559 showed the resistance to be linked to its 17.6 x 10(6) plasmid, pse703. furthermore, by electroporation this rather large plasmid was reintroduced into an erythromycin-sensitive cured derivative, acquiring resistance, and the plasmid was again recovered from the transconjugant. one of the plasmids, pse702, was shown by filter mating to be conjugative within s. pyogenes. dna-dna hybridization showed that the resistance  determinant of the present three isolates was related to the erm gene on plasmid  pam beta 1 of enterococcus faecalis but not to that of plasmid pe194 of staphylococcus aureus. the copy numbers of pse702 and pse703, derived from the two high-level resistant strains, were 11 +/- 3 and 17 +/- 5 compared to 2 +/- 1  for pse701, derived from the moderately resistant strain, possibly accounting for the phenotypic variation observed. the plasmids pse702 and pam beta 1 showed about 80% homology in dna-dna hybridization tests and high similarity in their restriction maps.

AB  == the streptococci remain important human pathogens despite it being nearly 60 years since sulphonamides were introduced. rheumatic fever and post glomerulonephritis are common diseases in the aboriginal community, and a new invasive disease, toxic shock-like syndrome, is also caused by group a streptococcus. group b, first described over 50 years ago in obstetric wards remains the primary neonatal pathogen despite attempts to eliminate this organism from the genital tract of the carrier mother. a major concern in paediatrics is the relatively poor response to the current pneumococcal vaccines. australian researchers are playing a major role in developing a new vaccine with high antigenicity against all of the 100 odd serotypes of s pneumoniae. the oral streptococci are now recognised as important opportunistic pathogens and the pathogenesis is well defined. disturbing reports from different geographical regions alert us to the antibiotic resistance in some of the streptococci once thought of as sensitive bacteria, for example, group a has shown resistance to erythromycin, the pneumococcus to penicillin and beta-lactam antibiotics and the  aminoglycosides have been ineffective against the enterococci due to plasmid-borne genes.

TI  == molecular cloning, identification, and sequence of the hyaluronan synthase gene from group a streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the hyaluronan (ha) synthase of group a streptococci has been identified by transposon mutagenesis and deletion analysis. the genes for the ha synthase and a recently identified udp-glc dehydrogenase (dougherty, b. a., and van de rijn, i.  (1993) j. biol. chem. 268, 7118-7124) reside on a contiguous stretch of 3.2-kilobase pair dna that can direct ha biosynthesis in enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli as well as mutant streptococcus (deangelis, p. l., papaconstantinou, j., and weigel, p. h. (1993) j. biol. chem. 268, 14568-14571).  the synthase contains 395 residues (calculated mr = 45,063) and migrates on sds-page with a molecular mass of 42 kda. e. coli k5, which synthesizes udp-glucuronic acid for production of its endogenous capsular polysaccharide, can make ha if it contains a plasmid encoding the intact 42-kda protein. e. coli sure or chi 1448 cells containing the same construct, however, cannot produce ha since these strains cannot make both required sugar nucleotide precursors. the ha synthase is predicted to be an integral membrane protein with four membrane-associated helices, which is consistent with the location of the enzyme  activity in streptococci. there is significant homology between the ha synthase and the rhizobium nodc gene product, an enzyme that synthesizes chitin-like oligomers. this is the first description at the molecular level of an enzyme shown to synthesize a glycosaminoglycan.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of sultamicillin against clinical isolates obtained from outpatients].
AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for sultamicillin (sbtpc), and for other major oral beta-lactam agents against clinically isolated  strains collected from outpatients during a period from august, 1992 to february, 1993, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. the ratio of penicillinase  (pcase)-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus was 96.0% and that of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) was 12.0%. mic90 of sbtpc against s. aureus including mrsa was 6.25 micrograms/ml. no increasing tendency was observed for s. aureus resistant to sbtpc. 2. no resistant strains were found among streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis against penicillins (pcs) including sbtpc. but pcs and cephems (ceps) insensitive or resistant streptococcus pneumoniae were observed in 22.0% among all the strains of s. pneumoniae. 3. 100% of the tested both strains of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis were beta-lactamase producers. 12.0% of the tested strains of haemophilus influenzae and 16.0% of the strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae were also beta-lactamase producers. sbtpc showed strong antimicrobial activity against most of these beta-lactamase producing strains. however, in our study of beta-lactamase productivity using plural substrates and test methods, it appeared that a part of strains of e. coli might produce beta-lactamase of "extended broad-spectrum". mics of sbtpc and ceps against those strains were distributed rather in a high range. 4. the results of the study suggested that the resistant  strains of s. pneumoniae against pcs and ceps might be increasing year by year. some of strains of e. coli, resistance against the 2 agents were observed. it is  important to keep observing changes in resistance of such organisms in the future. 5. the antimicrobial activities of sbtpc against clinically isolated strains in this study indicated potential problems such as those mentioned above. it is, however, also confirmed that sbtpc shows still strong antimicrobial activities against most of beta-lactamase producing strains found in daily medical examinations. taking into consideration of the strong activities of sbtpc against so-called indirect pathogenicity caused by beta-lactamase producing indigenous bacteria reported lately, sbtpc may be a useful antibiotic for community acquired infections in the 1990's.

TI  == isolation of a streptococcus pyogenes gene locus that directs hyaluronan biosynthesis in acapsular mutants and in heterologous bacteria.
AB  == a contiguous 3-kilobase pair region of dna was isolated from group a streptococcus pyogenes (gas) that can direct hyaluronic acid (ha) capsule biosynthesis in acapsular mutants as well as heterologous bacteria. the dna was identified by transposon 916 insertional mutagenesis and subcloned into a plasmid shuttle vector. mutant acapsular gas or enterococcus faecalis containing this plasmid, but not vector alone, displayed a mucoid phenotype on agar plates, possessed a capsule as seen by light microscopy, and produced ha in quantities comparable with wild-type gas. the polysaccharide was shown to be authentic ha based on its recognition by a specific proteoglycan and its degradation by streptomyces hyaluronate lyase. escherichia coli with the complementing plasmid also produced ha but at only 10% of the level made by the above cells. e. coli minicell analysis showed that two proteins, 42 and 45 kda, are expressed by the functional dna insert. deletion analysis of the insert in the minicells revealed  that the 42-kda protein is essential for ha production. this is the first demonstration of reconstitution of ha capsule biosynthesis in vivo.

TI  == [a nationwide survey of antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics in japan (1988-1990)].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout japan from september to december in both 1989 and 1990. in this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but streptococcus pyogenes  and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (ipm) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. haemophilus influenzae, escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to ipm and aminoglycosides. bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to ipm. ipm had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (cam) in comparison with other 6 macrolides was determined against 419 recent clinical isolates including streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, moraxella, haemophilus and bacteroides  strains. mics80's of cam against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae were 0.78, 0.10 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. mics80's against moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae were 0.05 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. laboratory-induced resistance to cam in strains of s. pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis or methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in stepwise fashion and at a very low rate. adherence to silicon filter of strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa or s. epidermidis was strongly repressed by the addition of sub-mic of cam or other macrolides. although tosufloxacin (tflx) alone had no bactericidal activity against the sessile cells of p. aeruginosa strains tested, tflx showed synergistic bactericidal activity when combined with sub-mics of cam or erythromycin.

TI  == the microbiologic aspects, including diagnosis, of beta-hemolytic streptococcal and enterococcal infections.
AB  == basic principles concerning the collection, transport, and processing of clinical specimens for the detection of streptococcaceae are given. identification of beta-hemolytic streptococci (s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, lancefield group c and g streptococci, s. anginosus) and enterococci is based on the careful observation of colony morphology and hemolytic pattern on sheep blood agar plates; subsequent genus or species confirmation is achieved by rather simple biochemical or enzymatic tests and by detection of streptococcal cell wall carbohydrate antigens (lancefield grouping). rapid antigen tests for the detection of group a and b streptococci directly from pharyngeal and vaginal swabs, respectively, are highly specific, thus allowing an immediate antibiotic therapy in patients with a positive test result. the reported sensitivities of these nonculture tests are too low to exclude streptococcal colonization or infection, however. the elucidation of the genetics of some major virulence factors of group a and b streptococci has contributed to knowledge of their association with disease, and  molecular techniques have supplemented the traditional (mostly culture and serologic) methods for an improved understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of streptococcal infections. recently employed examples include the  m protein gene typing of group a streptococci by oligonucleotide probes and the use of pcr assays for the detection of the genes encoding for the pyrogenic exotoxins. restriction enzyme endonuclease digestions of bacterial dna in association with dna fragment separation by conventional or pfge have been applied successfully to several species of streptococcaceae (e.g., s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae). enterococci are important pathogens in the hospital setting, exhibiting high morbidity and mortality rates in bacteremic patients with severe  underlying disease. molecular typing methods have clearly confirmed their potential to be nosocomially transmitted. e. faecalis and e. faecium still account for the majority of human infections, but some of the newer enterococcal  species (at present 19 species are recognized) have been encountered as well. the definitive species identification of enterococci requires the performance of an array of biochemical tests. the increasing antimicrobial resistance of enterococci, including high-level resistance to penicillins and aminoglycosides and occasionally also to glycopeptides, has hampered standard therapeutic regimens. all enterococci isolated from serious infections should be tested for high-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance by one of several methods evaluated; beta-lactamase production (primarily found in e. faecalis) is reliably detected by the nitrocefin test.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == biochemical and genetic analysis of the unidirectional theta replication of the s. agalactiae plasmid pip501.
AB  == pip501 is a broad-host-range plasmid originating from streptococcus agalactiae. in this report we show that (i) it replicates by a theta mechanism initiating at  the 3' end of the gene encoding the replication protein repr and progressing in the direction of transcription of this gene; (ii) its replication origin lies within or a few nucleotides downstream from orf r and not upstream from it as suggested in the literature (brantl et al. (1990) nucleic acids res. 18, 4783-4789); (iii) the repr protein positively regulates pip501 copy number; and (vi) the main function ensured by the sequences located upstream from orf r is to express this orf. since the replication properties of pip501 are indistinguishable from those of the highly related enterococcus faecalis plasmid  pam beta 1, we conclude that these elements form the first family of theta replicating plasmids in gram-positive bacteria. based on sequence similarities, we extend this family to the s. pyogenes plasmid psm19035 and to 12 other plasmids isolated from streptococci or enterococci.

TI  == expression of protein f, the fibronectin-binding protein of streptococcus pyogenes jrs4, in heterologous streptococcal and enterococcal strains promotes their adherence to respiratory epithelial cells.
AB  == in a previous study we reported the identification of protein f, a fibronectin-binding protein that was essential to the ability of streptococcus pyogenes jrs4 to adhere to respiratory epithelial cells (e. hanski and m. caparon, proc. natl. acad. sci. usa, 89:6172-6176, 1992). to further evaluate the role of protein f in the adherence of the group a streptococci, we screened other group a streptococcal strains, including six recent clinical isolates, and one strain of enterococcus faecalis for their capacity to bind fibronectin and for the presence of the gene encoding protein f (prtf). seven of eight group a streptococcal strains analyzed, including all recent clinical isolates, both bound fibronectin at high affinity and contained dna sequences that hybridized with a prtf-specific probe. one group a streptococcal isolate and the strain of e. faecalis examined neither contained a prtf-related gene nor bound fibronectin. these two strains also could not efficiently adhere to respiratory epithelial cells. however, upon the introduction of the cloned prtf gene, both of these strains gained the capacity to bind fibronectin and to adhere to respiratory epithelial cells. these results suggest that protein f is an important adhesin, which may have a general role in the virulence of the group a streptococci.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). only one strain each of enterococcus faecium and pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and clostridium perfringens. both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, streptococcus pyogenes and bacteroides sp. all other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin  which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.

TI  == high-level aminoglycoside resistance among enterococci and group a streptococci.
AB  == the occurrence of high-level aminoglycoside resistance (hlamr) was determined for 73 enterococci and 54 group a streptococci by the high-load disc method, tube macrodilution and the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the pcr method revealed the presence of genes coding for aminoglycoside-3'-o-phosphoryltransferase-iii (aph(3')-iii), aminoglycoside-6'-n-acetyltransferase/2''-o-phosphoryltransferase  (aac(6')/aph(2'')), or both, in 20.6%, 9.6% and 4.1% of the enterococci, respectively. the prevalence of hlamr to at least one aminoglycoside among local  enterococci was 37% (27/73). only one of 54 streptococcus pyogenes isolates produced aph(3')-iii and exhibited high-level resistance to kanamycin and streptomycin. in general, the three methods yielded comparable results, with only three discrepancies among the 127 isolates examined. high-load disc screening and tube macrodilution proved to be practical, reliable and reproducible, and thus suitable for routine screening. of 20 enterococcus faecalis strains tested, all were penicillin-tolerant. only one of seven penicillin-tolerant s. pyogenes strains was hlamr. no association between the two forms of resistance was found.

TI  == macrophage response to bacteria: induction of marked secretory and cellular activities by lipoteichoic acids.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) from various bacterial species, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes, were examined for the ability  to induce secretory and cellular responses in a pure population of bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes. some of the highly purified ltas, in particular ltas from bacillus subtilis, s. pyogenes, e. faecalis, and enterococcus hirae, were able to affect each of the macrophage parameters measured, i.e., reductive capacity, secretion of tumor necrosis factor and nitrite, and tumoricidal activity. as after stimulation with whole organisms or other bacterial products, secretion of tumor necrosis factor induced by these ltas reached its maximum within the first few hours of the interaction, while secretion of nitrite and tumoricidal activity required 24 to 36 h for full expression. other purified ltas, i.e., ltas from streptococcus sanguis, s. pneumoniae, and l. monocytogenes, as well as lipomannan from micrococcus luteus affected only some of these parameters, while native lta from s. aureus was inactive. there was no obvious correlation between biological activity and chain  length, kind of glycosyl substituents, glycolipid structures, or fatty acid composition of ltas. deacylation of ltas resulted in a complete loss of activity, and deacylated ltas did not impair the activity of their acylated counterparts, suggesting that acyl chains may be essential for binding of lta to the cell surface. the results demonstrate that some lta species are potent inducers of macrophage secretory and cellular activities.

AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) isolated from bacterial species, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes a, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and listeria monocytogenes, were tested for their ability to stimulate the production of interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta), il-6, and  tumor necrosis factor alpha in cultured human monocytes. ltas from s. aureus and  s. pneumoniae failed to induce monokine production when applied in the concentration range of 0.05 to 5.0 micrograms/ml. however, ltas from several enterococcal species (0.5 to 5 micrograms/ml) induced the release of all three monokines at levels similar to those observed after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. the kinetics of il-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha release elicited by ltas closely resembled those observed following lipopolysaccharide application. cytokine production occurred in the presence of both fetal calf serum and autologous human serum. hence, it was not dependent on complement activation and could not be suppressed by naturally occurring human antibodies. deacylation caused the total loss of monocyte stimulatory capacity. deacylated ltas were unable to prevent monocyte activation by intact ltas, so primary binding of these molecules probably does not involve a simple interaction of a membrane receptor with the hydrophilic portion of the molecule. the results identify some species of ltas as inducers of monokine production in human monocytes.

TI  == the killing activity of microwaves on some non-sporogenic and sporogenic medically important bacterial strains.
AB  == the killing activity of microwaves of 2450 mhz frequency and 325 w, 650 w and 1400 w power on some bacterial strains was investigated. vegetative strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes group a, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis and spores of bacillus subtilis  and bacillis stearothermophilus in aqueous suspensions were exposed to 325 w and  650 w waves for different lengths of time. enterococcus faecalis and spores of b. subtilis and b. stearothermophilus were exposed additionally to 1400 w waves in aqueous and 'dried' suspensions. vegetative bacteria were promptly killed in 5 min or less, e. faecalis being slightly more resistant. bacterial spores were only killed in aqueous suspension when a 1400 w setting was used for 10 to 20 min. bacterial spores adhering to the tube walls after the aqueous suspension was poured out were reduced in number. we assume that the conventional microwave ovens available on the market may be used for a high level of disinfection but not for sterilization, and only then if sufficient water is present.

TI  == a host factor absent from lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis mg1363 is required for conjugative transposition.
AB  == in matings between lactococcus lactis strains, the conjugative transposons tn916  and tn919 are found in the chromosome of the transconjugants in the same place as in the chromosome of the donor, indicating that no transposition has occurred. in agreement with this, the frequency of l. lactis transconjugants from intraspecies matings is the same whether the donor contains the wild-type form of the transposon or the mutant tn916-int1, which has an insertion in the transposon's integrase gene. however, in intergeneric crosses with bacillus subtilis or enterococcus faecalis donors, tn916 and tn919 transpose to different locations on the chromosome of the l. lactis transconjugants. moreover, tn916 and tn919 could  not be transferred by conjugation from l. lactis and b. subtilis, e. faecalis or  streptococcus pyogenes. this suggests that excision of these elements does not occur in l. lactis. when cloned into e. coli with adjacent chromosomal dna from l. lactis, the conjugative transposons were able to excise, transpose and promote conjugation. therefore, the inability of these elements to excise in l. lactis is not caused by a permanent structural alteration in the transposon. we conclude that l. lactis lacks a factor required for excision of conjugative transposons.

TI  == application of the polymerase chain reaction to study the m protein(-like) gene family in beta-hemolytic streptococci.
AB  == evaluation of homologous regions of published m protein (emm) gene sequences from group a streptococci (gas; streptococcus pyogenes) was used to design three primer pairs for polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and three oligonucleotide probe  sequences internal to the amplified products. one set of primers and corresponding probe should detect and lead to amplification of emm(-like) genes of virtually every type ("all m"), another ("sor-m") should only amplify emm(-like) genes from gas negative for serum opacity reaction (sor) and the third ("sor+ m") should expand only emm(-like) genes from sor+ gas. using the "allm" primer pair for pcr on the genomic dna from gas of 29 different m types as well as from a group c and a group g streptococcal isolate, dna fragments within the expected size range were amplified in every assay. all pcr products reacted with  the "allm" probe. related sequences were not detected in genomic dna of an s. agalactiae and an enterococcus faecalis isolate. applying the "sor-m" and "sor+m" primers to identical assays led to mutually exclusive amplification products. the "sor-m" and "sor+m" probes hybridized only to their corresponding products. exceptions to this exclusivity were the sor- gas of m types 3, 8, 27, 34, 42, 67, and 69, which consistently reacted only with the "sor+m" primer/probe set. analysis of sequence data from the amplified emm(-like) 2, 3, 18, and 19 genes revealed interesting specific features such as conserved gaps in the c-terminal sequence regions from sor+ and the exceptional sor- gas strains. these data indicate the existence of a subgroup of strains among sor- gas and may advance our understanding of phylogenetic relationship between different serotypes of gas.

AB  == thirteen strains of viridans group streptococci and two strains of other streptococci were tested for coaggregation with candida albicans. streptococcus sanguis strains generally exhibited low levels of adherence to 28 degrees c-grown exponential-phase yeast cells, but starvation of yeast cells for glucose at 37 degrees c (or at 28 degrees c) increased their coaggregating activity with these  streptococci by at least tenfold. this was a property common to four c. albicans  strains tested, two of which were able to form mycelia (6406 and men) and two of  which were not (mm2002 and ca2). the expression of the coaggregation adhesin during yeast cell starvation was inhibited by addition of trichodermin or amphotericin b. the strains of s. sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus oralis tested for coaggregating activity encompassed a diverse range of physiological and morphological types, yet all exhibited saturable coaggregation with starved c. albicans cells. there was no correlation of cell surface hydrophobicity, of either yeast or streptococcal cells, with their abilities to coaggregate. strains of streptococcus anginosus also coaggregated with starved yeast cells; streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus pyogenes coaggregated to a lesser degree with c. albicans, and the coaggregation with s. pyogenes was not promoted by yeast cell starvation; streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis did not coaggregate with yeast. the coaggregation reactions of s. sanguis and s. gordonii with c. albicans were inhibited by edta and by heat or protease treatment of the yeast cells and were not reversible by the addition  of lactose or other simple sugars. these observations extend the range of intergeneric coaggregations that are known to occur between oral microbes and suggest that coaggregations of c. albicans with viridans group streptococci may be important for colonization of oral surfaces by the yeast.

TI  == biological characterization of a new radioactive labeling reagent for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == radiolabeled penicillin g is widely used as the imaging agent in penicillin-binding protein (pbp) assays. the disadvantages of most forms of labeled penicillin g are instability on storage and the long exposure times usually required for autoradiography or fluorography of electrophoretic gels. we  investigated the utility of radioiodinated penicillin v as an alternative reagent. radioiodination of p-(trimethylstannyl)penicillin v with [125i]na, using a modification of the chloramine-t method, is simple, high yielding, and site specific. we demonstrated the general equivalence of commercially obtained [3h]penicillin g and locally synthesized [125i]penicillin v (ipv) in their recognition of bacterial pbps. profiles of pbps in membranes from bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, providencia rettgeri, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium labeled with ipv or [3h]penicillin g were virtually identical. use of ipv as the imaging  agent in competition experiments for determination of the affinities of various beta-lactam antibiotics for the pbps of e. coli yielded results similar to those  obtained in experiments with [3h]penicillin g. dried electrophoretic gels from typical pbp experiments, using ipv at 37.3 ci/mmol and 30 micrograms/ml, exposed  x-ray film in 8 to 24 h. the stability of ipv on storage at 4 degrees c was inversely proportional to specific activity. at 37.3 ci/mmol and 60 micrograms/ml, ipv retained useful activity for at least 60 days at 4 degrees c.  ipv represents a practical and stable reagent for rapid pbp assays.

TI  == [immunological analysis of streptococcus sanguis antigens].
AB  == the exact cause of behcet's disease is still unknown. recently, advanced bacterial studies revealed that behcet's disease was related to streptococcus (s.) sanguis. however, the antigenicity of s. sanguis has not been fully studied. in this study, we clarified the antigenicity of s. sanguis. we made s. sanguis antigens: mechanical braun extract (mbe) and crude cell wall (ccw) from the whole cells, membrane fraction (mf) and cytoplasmic fraction (cf) from mbe, cell wall fragment (cwf) and lipoteichoic acid (lta) from mbe. we found that the major antigenicity of s. sanguis was present in cf by use of the ouchterlony method and the elisa method. however, apart from s. pyogenes, we could not recognize a common antigenicity among s. sanguis and several other antigens, such as s-ag, irbp, retinal soluble fraction, retinal insoluble fraction and enterococcus faecalis, by the ouchterlony method. since we have clarified the antigenicity of  s. sanguis in this study, we can now perform detailed examinations with samples from patients with behcet's disease for s. sanguis antigens.

TI  == [studies on delayed skin reactivity to streptococci in behcet's disease].
AB  == delayed type hypersensitivity of patients with behcet's disease was investigated  by intradermal skin test and prick test, using various inactivated microorganisms as antigens. in the intradermal skin test, 13 patients showed significantly increased skin reactivity to e. faecalis, compared with 5 normal controls. no significant differences were observed between these two groups in terms of reaction to s. pyogenes. prick test was performed in 11 patients and 6 controls,  using s. pyogenes, s. sanguis, s. salivarius and e. faecalis as antigens. it was  shown that patients with this disease had significantly greater skin reactions to crude cell wall antigens, as well as to whole cell antigens of these streptococci than the controls. the antigenicity of streptococci seemed to be present mainly in the cell wall fragment, and these streptococci seemed to have cross reactivity with each other. these results suggest that streptococci may have some significant role in the immunopathogenesis of this disease.

TI  == few-minutes tests for the identification of group a streptococci and enterococci  with chromogenic substrates.
AB  == the usefulness of paper strip tests for rapid identification of streptococcus pyogenes and enterococci cultured on blood agar plates was investigated. the paper strips used contain dried chromogenic substrates for pyrrolidonyl peptidase (pyrase) and beta-glucosidase (beta-gluc). material from only a few colonies needed to be applied to the test strips. the reactions could be read after two min (pyrase) and 5-7 min (beta-gluc), respectively. results from testing 503 streptococcal strains were evaluated. the reactions proved very useful for rapid  differentiation of s. pyogenes and enterococci from human sources. nearly all strains of these streptococcal species showed positive reactions in the pyrase test whereas only the enterococci (e. faecalis and e. faecium) were positive for  both enzymes.

AB  == a total of 287 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. the test was positive for all but one isolate, strain doc-1. this autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of s. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lyta gene. we used lyta as a dna probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. in dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the dna of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate doc-1. no hybridization occurred when strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus bovis were tested. the lyta gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a dna probe for the identification of s. pneumoniae.

TI  == in vivo antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == the therapeutic activities of orally administered fk482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of  bacteria in mice and rabbits. in systemic infections in mice, oral fk482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (ccl) and more effective than oral cephalexin (cex) against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis infections. however, fk482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against e. coli infection in mice,  and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given ccl. in comparison with ccl, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given fk482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. in local infections in rabbits, a species in which fk482 was better absorbed than in mice, fk482 was more effective than ccl, cex or amoxicillin (ampc). against pneumonia induced by s. aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, fk482 was as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. in the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, fk482 was superior to ccl and ampc against methicillin-resistant s. aureus infection, as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl against enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (cfix) and more effective than ccl and ampc against e. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.

AB  == to interpret of the cefoperazone (cpz) disc susceptibility test, a 4 category system is used in japan, but a 3 category system is used in the u.s.a. and europe. in the 4 category interpretation system of showa cpz disc the following classification is used: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3 approximately 15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15 approximately 60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. in the 3 category system the classification used is as follows: susceptible mic less than  or equal to 16 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible mic greater than 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, resistant mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, or susceptible mic less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible mic greater than 32 approximately 64 micrograms/ml, resistant mic greater than 64 micrograms/ml, depending on dose levels, 1 or 2 g. reliability of the cpz disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate mics by classifying the test results into 4 categories was studied using discs containing 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 and  75 micrograms. the mics were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. a good negative correlation was observed between  inhibitory zone diameters and mics, showing reliability of the test using these discs. the results obtained with discs containing 30 or 75 micrograms of cpz were well categorized into the 4 groups mentioned above. some strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, however, showed false positive results. when different break points of inhibitory zone diameters than those used for other bacteria were used for p. aeruginosa, and e. faecalis was excluded from the test, an excellent correlations were obtained. with 30 or 75 micrograms discs, it was unable to subclassify strains against which mics of cpz were below 3 micrograms/ml. however, with discs containing 1 to 10 micrograms, it was possible to separate the strains against which mics were less than 0.5 microgram/ml. the fact that most frequent values of mics of cpz against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp., haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes etc. were less than 0.5 microgram/ml supports the usefulness of low dose discs. according to recently ongoing concepts on the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics and their penetration into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding appear to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except into hepatic biliary system.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the plasmid-free streptococcus pyogenes a454 contains a conjugative element, tn3701, encoding resistance to erythromycin (emr), tetracycline (tcr), and minocycline (mnr). we have mapped a 50-kilobase (kb) chromosomal region of a454 corresponding to the internal part of tn3701. tn3701 includes a 19.7-kb structure, designated tn3703, on which the emr tcr mnr determinants were localized. tn3703 was very similar in structure to tn916. translocation of the emr tcr mnr markers from a454 onto pip964, an enterococcus faecalis hemolysin plasmid, yielded different pip964 derivatives. when the inserts of four of these  derivatives were aligned with the 50-kb region of tn3701, three of them were found to result from the transposition of tn3703 and one resulted from the insertion of a 44.0-kb portion of tn3701, including tn3703. tn3701 inserted, apparently without changing its structure, in the chromosomes of various streptococcal transconjugants, as well as in one of the 12 e. faecalis transconjugants studied. tn3703 inserted at different chromosomal sites in four e. faecalis transconjugants, and one copy of tn3701 plus an additional copy of tn3703 were detected in the chromosomes of seven transconjugants.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of a new 3-azinomethyl-rifamycin.
AB  == the new 3-azinomethyl-rifamycin, spa-s-565, was shown to exert an effective antibacterial activity in vitro comparable to that of rifampicin. in fact, the antibacterial activity of spa-s-565 against numerous gram-positive cocci belonging to staphylococcus and streptococcus species as well as against 20 strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis, was similar to that of rifampicin. in swiss albino mice intraperitoneally infected with staphylococcus aureus oxford strain or streptococcus pyogenes, the protective activity of spa-s-565 and rifampicin was quite remarkable, and no significant difference was noted between  the two antibiotics. in m. tuberculosis-infected mice treated with the antibacterial agents every seven days, the protection exerted by spa-s-565 was significantly greater than that exerted by rifampicin.

TI  == synergy between spiramycin and metronidazole in the treatment of polymicrobial infections.
AB  == the in-vitro and in-vivo activity of metronidazole and spiramycin, singly or in combination, was tested in the eradication of infection caused by bacteroides spp. alone and in combination with neisseria gonorrhoea, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes or str. faecalis. the in-vitro tests consisted of determinations of the mics with or without the addition of a constant amount of the other antimicrobials. the mics of metronidazole for b. melaninogenicus, b. fragilis and b. bivius were significantly reduced by the addition of 0.125 mg/l spiramycin. the in-vivo tests were carried out in mice and consisted of measurements of the effects of the antimicrobial agents on the bacterial contents of abscesses induced by subcutaneous injection of bacterial suspension. combined  therapy of mixed infections showed further significant reduction of the numbers of bacteroides spp. in seven of 12 combinations and of the aerobic and facultative bacteria in four of 12 combinations. furthermore, a reduction in the  number of facultative anaerobes was noted in mixed infections with bacteroides spp. which were treated with metronidazole alone. the synergy in vitro and in vivo between metronidazole and spiramycin may have important clinical implications in the treatment of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infections.

TI  == measurement of active constitutive l-pyrrolidonyl-peptidase from the genera streptococcus and enterococcus.
AB  == in the family streptococceae the ability to measure l-pyrrolidonyl-peptidase is limited to lancefield group d enterococcus and group a streptococcus pyogenes. a  number of methods exist to assay this enzyme. all measure pyrrolidonyl-peptidase  by the ability of the bacterium to cleave l-pyrrolidonyl-beta-naphthylamide to form free beta-naphthylamine and l-pyrrolidone-carboxylic acid. free beta-naphthylamine is then reacted with n,n-dimethylamino-cinnamaldehyde to form  a red color complex. these methods are generally expensive and require a 2-4 h incubation period before results are available. a method, which employs the substrate dried on paper discs and can be easily made, is described herein. it is simple to perform, inexpensive, rapid, and has a long storage life. the results of this constitutive method are equivalent to those obtained using a commercial system.

TI  == modulation of complement fixation and the phlogistic capacity of group a, b, and  d streptococci by human lysozyme acting on their cell walls.
AB  == streptococci and streptococcal cell wall fragments induce arthritis in rats, with the severity and duration depending on the capacity of the cells or cell fragments to resist degradation by tissue enzymes. their phlogogenic effects are  apparently related to their ability to activate the alternate complement pathway  (acp). the in vitro activation of the acp by lysozyme-treated cells and cell walls of group a, b, and d streptococci suggests that both rat and human lysozyme can modulate this activity, i.e., increasing it, decreasing it, or doing both in  that order. the effects of the lysozymes also correlated with the degree to which they can unmask the aminosugar-reducing groups detectable in a given amount of cell wall, which suggests that partial depolymerization of the cell wall is critical for acp activation. the effects of mutanolysin and c phage lysin on acp  activation were found to be correlated with their action on streptococcal cell walls. neuraminidase had relatively little effect on acp activation by most streptococcal strains tested. we conclude that the participation of tissue enzymes, including but not necessarily limited to lysozyme, is an important determinant for the clinical arthritis induced by group a, b, or d streptococci.  experimental arthritis induced in rats with whole (or disrupted) streptococci may depend both on the capacities of the cell walls to activate the acp and on the capacities of the host tissue enzymes to modulate this activation. great severity and long durations of the disease were determined by the capacity of the enzymes  to degrade cell wall antigens to a degree sufficient to ensure efficient activation of the acp without completely degrading the material so that it no longer activates complement. in this model, the limited resistance of group b peptidoglycan to lysozyme was a critical pathogenic factor.

TI  == comparative adhesion of seven species of streptococci isolated from the blood of  patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of aridicins, novel glycopeptide antibiotics with high and prolonged levels in blood.
AB  == three new glycopeptide antibiotics, aridicins a, b, and c, produced by kibdelosporangium aridum have a spectrum of antimicrobial activity in vitro which is similar to that of vancomycin. the antimicrobial activities of these glycopeptides against clinical bacterial isolates were compared with those of vancomycin and other related glycopeptide antibiotics in vitro by agar dilution and microtiter broth dilution tests and in vivo in mouse protection studies. in vitro they were somewhat less effective than vancomycin against strains of staphylococcus aureus and less active against coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. however, they were more active than vancomycin against strains of streptococcus faecalis and markedly superior to vancomycin and other glycopeptide antibiotics against strains of clostridium difficile. in experimental infections, aridicin a was effective against strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pyogenes, although its 50% effective doses were higher than those of vancomycin when administered after infection. after subcutaneous administration, aridicin a had a higher peak level in serum and a longer half-life than vancomycin or teicoplanin. the aridicins were markedly superior to vancomycin when administered prior to infection in mouse protection tests, indicating long-acting potential.

TI  == granulomatous enterocolitis induced in rats by purified bacterial cell wall fragments.
AB  == this study was designed to determine if poorly biodegradable bacterial cell wall  components can produce chronic intestinal inflammation. a sterile aqueous suspension of sonically disrupted group a or group d streptococcal cell wall fragments was injected intramurally into the small intestine and cecum of 100 rats. gross findings in rats killed at intervals of 1 day to 6 mo included intestinal thickening, adhesions, and mesenteric contraction. acute histologic inflammation subsided by 2 wk, but chronic granulomatous inflammation persisted for 6 mo in the rats injected with group a streptococcal cell wall fragments and  3 mo in the rats injected with group d streptococcal cell wall fragments. ninety-six control rats identically injected with human serum albumin or phosphate-buffered saline demonstrated mild acute inflammation that resolved, with only 1 rat having chronic intestinal inflammation. granulomas in the intestine, mesentery, and mesenteric lymph nodes developed in 46% of the rats injected with group a fragments and 45% of the rats injected with group d streptococcal cell wall fragments, compared with 20% of the controls injected with albumin and 4% of the controls injected with phosphate-buffered saline. group a streptococcal antigen was detected by immunofluorescence at the site of inflammation for 4 mo, and possible reactivation of acute inflammation was seen up to 6 mo after injection. we conclude that bacterial cell wall fragments are capable of producing chronic granulomatous inflammation in the intestinal wall if present in appropriate particle size and concentration. we speculate that cell walls from the enteric microflora may leak across a permeable mucosa in chronic inflammatory bowel disease to initiate and sustain local and systemic inflammation.

TI  == streptococcal phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system: purification  and characterization of a phosphoprotein phosphatase which hydrolyzes the phosphoryl bond in seryl-phosphorylated histidine-containing protein.
AB  == histidine-containing protein (hpr) of gram-positive bacteria was found to be phosphorylated at a seryl residue (p-ser-hpr) in an atp-dependent reaction catalyzed by a protein kinase (j. deutscher and m. h. saier, jr., proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a. 80:6790-6794, 1983). here we describe the purification and characterization of a soluble enzyme of streptococcus faecalis which splits the phosphoryl bond in p-ser-hpr. the enzyme has a molecular weight of ca. 7.5 x 10(4), as determined by its migration behavior on a sephacryl s-200 column. on native polyacrylamide gels the purified enzyme produced only one protein band. on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels we found one major protein band of molecular weight 2.9 x 10(4) and two minor protein bands of molecular weights 2.3 x 10(4) and 7 x 10(4). fructose 1,6-diphosphate, which stimulated the atp-dependent, protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of hpr, had no effect on  the phosphatase activity. other glycolytic intermediates also had no effect. however, inorganic phosphate, which inhibited the atp-dependent hpr kinase, stimulated the p-ser-hpr phosphatase. edta at a concentration of 0.1 mm completely inhibited the phosphatase. divalent cations like mg2+, mn2+, and co2+  overcame the inhibition by edta. fe2+, zn2+, and cu2+ had no effect, whereas ca2+ slightly inhibited the phosphatase. atp was also found to inhibit the phosphatase. under conditions in which atp severely inhibited the phosphatase, adp was found to have no effect on the enzyme activity. besides p-ser-hpr of s. faecalis, the phosphatase was also able to hydrolyze the phosphoryl bond in p-ser-hpr of streptococcus lactis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, and lactobacillus casei. phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside phosphorylation, catalyzed by the s. aureus phosphoenolpyruvate:lactose phosphotransferase system, was about 150-fold  decreased in the presence of p-ser-hpr of s. aureus, as compared with hpr. however, when p-ser-hpr was first incubated with p-ser-hpr phosphatase to allow complete hydrolysis of the phosphoryl bond, it had the same activity as hpr. besides this cytoplasmic phosphoprotein phosphatase, we detected a membrane-bound phosphatase which also hydrolyzed the phosphoryl bond in p-ser-hpr.

(great britain) and difco laboratories (usa). the physico-chemical and physiological characteristics of the proposed medium have been determined. the use of the new dried culture medium in medical practice will make it possible to  improve the microbiological diagnosis of streptococcal infections.

TI  == identification of a streptococcal penicillin-binding protein that reacts very slowly with penicillin.
AB  == penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 5 of streptococcus faecium atcc 9790 has an unusually low affinity for penicillin (50% binding occurred at a penicillin level of 8 micrograms/ml after 60 min of incubation, and the protein only became labeled after 20 min of incubation with high concentrations of radioactive penicillin). pbps with similar properties are carried by strains of streptococcus durans, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus lactis but not by strains of groups a, b, c, and g streptococci or streptococcus pneumoniae. the strains carrying the slow-reacting pbp demonstrated a sensitivity to penicillin that was  several hundred times lower than that of strains not carrying it. spontaneous mutants with minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin of 20, 40, and 80 micrograms/ml were isolated from s. faecium atcc 9790. they all showed a dramatic increase in the amount of slow-reacting pbp produced. mutants with increased penicillin resistance were also isolated from wild-type strains of s. durans, s.  faecalis, and s. faecium. all of them carried a greater amount of the slow-reacting pbp than that carried by the parent. finally, it was found that resistant s. faecium atcc 9790 mutants grew normally in the presence of penicillin concentrations that were far above that saturating all pbps except pbp 5. cell growth was, on the contrary, inhibited by a penicillin concentration that saturated the slow-reacting pbp by 90%. this penicillin dose was equal to the minimal inhibitory concentration.

TI  == rat arthritis due to whole group b streptococci. clinical and histopathologic features compared with groups a and d.
AB  == heat-killed streptococci of groups a, b, and d injected intraperitoneally into sprague-dawley rats induced arthritis. the histopathologic features of the arthritis were those of erosive synovitis. early acute lesions were associated with deposits of streptococcal antigens. the serogroups and the physical state of the streptococci determined the incidence, the time of onset, the duration, and the severity of the disease, the severity being a blend of degree of inflammation, tendency to relapse, and occurrence of ankylosis. whole group a usually failed to induce arthritis. group a disrupted with sonication regularly induced arthritis after a 24-hour latent period. the disease lasted over 60 days  and caused ankylosis. whole group b regularly induced arthritis but only after a  latent period of 6-8 days. the disease lasted over 40 days and caused ankylosed joints. with sonicated group b a similar disease was induced, except that, as with sonicated group a, the latent period was 24 hours. whole group d induced disease after a latent period of 48 hours. the arthritis lasted only 2 weeks and  was transient. in contrast to its effects on group a and b cocci, sonication of group d abrogated its capacity to induce arthritis. it is postulated that for whole streptococci, in contrast to sonicated streptococci, arthritogenicity depends on the sensitivity of the cocci to initial processing in vivo. processing may be partial digestion by enzymes of phagocytes. cocci such as those of group a that are insensitive to processing, injected whole, tend not to cause arthritis,  but when they do cause disease, it is chronic. a coccus, such as one of group d,  that is very sensitive to processing produces a transient arthritis after a short latent period, while a coccus of intermediate sensitivity, such as one of group b, induces disease only after a substantial latent period, and the disease is severe and chronic. the nature of processing remains to be determined.

AB  == formocresol and eugenol are the two nonspecific intracanal medicaments commonly used in endodontic practice. both have high tissue irritation potential when used in conventional strength. propylene glycol is an alcohol that is injectable and itself possesses significant antibacterial action. it is a popular vehicle and hence was used to modify the two drugs. standard bacteriologic methods were employed to test the antibacterial action of these lower concentrations of the two drugs against four test organisms. the investigations indicate that formocresol at as low as 10 to 20% and eugenol at 75% are bactericidal in action  and hence may be useful at these concentrations for clinical use. evaluation of these lower concentrations is warranted for possible clinical use. propylene glycol, which possesses antibacterial action and is remarkably innocuous to tissues, appears to be a suitable vehicle for dilution of formocresol and eugenol.

TI  == non-group d streptococcal meningitis misidentified as enterococcal meningitis. diagnostic and therapeutic implications of misdiagnosis by screening microbiology.
AB  == two patients had nonhemolytic gram-positive coccal meningitis. both pathogens were initially misidentified as a group d enterococcus by growth in "selective" media, which led to the use of inappropriate and potentially toxic systemic and intrathecal aminoglycosides. careful evaluation of the antibiotic sensitivity data and additional microbiological studies allowed correct identification of the organism. the important diagnostic and therapeutic considerations in differentiating true enterococcal infections, especially meningitis, from those caused by other alpha-hemolytic or nonhemolytic streptococci are emphasized. a simple laboratory schema for rapid recognition of such pathogens is reviewed.

TI  == superoxide dismutase and oxygen metabolism in streptococcus faecalis and comparisons with other organisms.
AB  == streptococcus faecalis contains a single superoxide dismutase that has been purified to homogeneity with a 55% yield. this enzyme has a molecular weight of 45,000 and is composed of two subunits of equal size. it contains 1.3 atoms of manganese per molecule. its amino acid composition was determined and is compared with that for the superoxide dismutases from escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, and mycobacterium lepraemurium. when used as an antigen in rabbits, the s. faecalis enzyme elicited the formation of a precipitating and inhibiting antibody. this antibody cross-reacted with the superoxide dismutase present in another strain of s. faecalis, but neither inhibited nor precipitated the superoxide dismutases in a wide range of other bacteria, including several other  streptococci, such as s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, and s. lactis. the inhibiting antibody was used to suppress the superoxide dismutase activity present in cell extracts of s. faecalis and thus allow the demonstration that 17% of the total oxygen consumption by such extracts, in the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, was associated with the production of o(2) (-). a variety of bacterial species were surveyed for their content of superoxide dismutases. the iron-containing enzyme was distinguished from the manganese-containing enzyme through the use of h(2)o(2), which inactivates the former more readily than the latter. some of the bacteria appeared to contain only the iron enzyme, others only the manganese enzyme, and still others both. indeed, some had multiple, electrophoretically distinct superoxide dismutases in both categories. there was  no discernible absolute relationship between the types of superoxide dismutases in a particular organism and their gram-stain reaction.

AB  == activation of the alternate complement pathway in human serum by several bacterial components was compared. peptidoglycan from group a streptococcal cell  walls was the most active material, on a weight basis, followed by cell walls, protoplast membranes, and whole cells. the group-specific carbohydrate was inactive. treatment of peptidoglycan with low concentrations of lysozyme or short periods of sonic treatment enhanced complement activation. high concentrations of lysozyme or extended sonic treatment of peptidoglycan destroyed or greatly reduced the capacity to activate complement. lysozyme treatment of group a streptococcal cell walls or lipopolysaccharide had no measurable effect. activation of the alternate complement pathway by group d streptococcal cell walls was destroyed by lysozyme. activity of peptidoglycan was not inhibited by n-acetyl glucosamine, n-acetyl muramic acid, or d-alanine-d-alanine. conversion of c3 and factored b by peptidoglycan was shown to occur by immunoelectrophoresis and crossed immunoelectrophoresis.

TI  == heterogeneity of nonimmune immunoglobulin fc reactivity among gram-positive cocci: description of three major types of receptors for human immunoglobulin g.
AB  == two hundred and thirty strains of various gram-positive cocci were tested for quantitative, nonimmune binding of radiolabeled human polyclonal immunoglobulin g (igg). the majority of coagulase-positive staphylococci and streptococci belonging to serogroups c and g showed a high uptake of igg. the binding of immunoglobulin to group a streptococci was considerably less, with a number of strains completely negative. none of the pneumococcal or the group b or d streptococcal strains displayed any binding capacity. heterogeneity of the igg reactivity of various reactive strains was studied in an inhibition assay using 10 different animal serum pools. three different inhibition patterns were seen, each of them revealing a striking degree of homogeneity within single bacterial species. staphylococcus aureus and group a streptococci, respectively, constituted two homogeneous groups which differed markedly from each other and from c and g streptococci. no differences were observed between group c and g streptococci. based on the profound differences between these homogeneous groups, three major types of fc receptors could be defined. type i and ii fc receptors were found on s. aureus and on group a streptococci, respectively. fc receptor type iii represented the immunoglobulin-binding structure of both group c and g streptococci.

TI  == resistance mechanism of chloramphenicol in streptococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == the chloramphenicol resistance of streptococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis isolated from clinical materials was proved to be due to an inactivating enzyme produced by these bacteria. the inactivated products of chloramphenicol were identified as 1-acetoxy, 3-acetoxy and 1,3-diacetoxy derivatives by thin-layer chromatography and infrared spectroscopy. the responsible enzyme was thus confirmed to be chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. the enzyme was inducible. it was partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, deae-cellulose chromatography and gel filtration  on sephadex g-150. the enzymes obtained from s. haemolyticus, s. pneumoniae and s. faecalis have been compared with the conclusion that they are identical with respect to molecular weight (approximately 75,000-80,000), optimum ph and heat stability.

TI  == selective adsorption of heterophile polyglycerophosphate antigen from antigen extracts of streptococcus mutans and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == hot saline extracts of streptococcus mutans have been shown to contain antigenic  substances which occasionally react nonspecifically with some antisera against whole cells of various serological groups and types of streptococci. chromatography of the extract of s. mutans strain mt703 (serotype e) on a diethylaminoethyl-sephadex a-25 column gave two principal antigens. one antigen was eluted without adsorption to the resin and was identified as the serotype-specific polysaccharide. the other antigen, which contained a large quantity of phosphorus, was absorbed to and released from the resin by gradient elution. it was reactive against the antisera specific for polyglycerophosphate (pgp) from group a streptococcus pyogenes and/or s. mutans strain ingbritt (type  c). the pgp antigen was further purified by gel filtration with sephadex g-75. two peaks, pgp-1, and pgp-2, were obtained. each possessed the same antigenic specificity to anti-pgp serum as shown by immunodiffusion. chemical analyses revealed that the molar ratio of phosphorus to glycerol in both was about 1:1, although the protein content between the two was significantly different. pgp antigen was found to be widely distributed in hot saline extracts from various gram-positive bacteria, with a few exceptions. however, all gram-negative bacteria examined were free of pgp. the pgp in the hot saline extracts of various gram-positive bacteria possessed an essentially identical antigenic specificity.  the addition of diethylaminoethyl-sephadex a-25 resin to hot saline extracts successfully removed the cross-reacting pgp antigen. after adsorption of the extract from s. mutans, the supernatant contained only type-specific polysaccharide antigen, except type b, in which both type b-specific polysaccharide and pgp antigens were absorbed with the resin. this simple procedure should be useful for the removal of the pgp-type teichoic acid from antigen extracts of bacteria that contain uncharged polysaccharides.

AB  == complement consumption by isolated membranes and walls from group a streptococci  and various other gram-positive microbes has been tested. these microbial structures were found to activate the alternate complement pathway. however, unlike endotoxin, inulin, or other plant polysaccharides, activation of complement by our material was found to bypass properdin. the activating factor(s) also differs from cobra venom in its/their requirement for factor d. preliminary experiments suggest this factor isolated from membranes to be a protein and to have a mol wt greater than 40-60,000 daltons. our studies have led us to speculate that the phylogenetic role of the alternate complement pathway may be the primordial nonspecific defense system which has retained certain fundamental aspects up to the present time.

AB  == in the initial phase of acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (agn), antigenic sites not covered by specific antibody can be demonstrated in the glomeruli. these sites are on the endothelial side of the glomerular basement membrane and in the mesangial matrix. the antigen is contained in a water-soluble fraction of nephritogenic streptococci. it can be highly purified by column chromatography or acrylamide electrophoresis. this antigen against which the patient develops specific antibodies is contained and immunologically identical in all nephriotogenic streptococci examined so far irrespective of their m or t protein. it is not identical with any known streptococcal extracellular product.  when antibodies are produced in rabbits against this streptococcal antigen they localize on kidney biopsies, obtained early during the disease from patients with agn in an identical way as does the labelled antibody of the serum of patients wiht agn. this antigen may be suited as a vaccine for the prevention of agn.

TI  == selective adherence as a determinant of the host tropisms of certain indigenous and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the relationship between the selective abilities of bacteria to adhere and their  predilections for colonizing different mammalian hosts was investigated by using  bacteria indigenous to the tongue dorsum of humans and rats as models. streptococcus salivarius and s. sanguis averaged 22.6 and 2.8%, respectively, of  the cultivable bacteria recovered from swab samples of the tonges of five humans, but these organisms were not indigenous on the tongues of rats (charles river strain). s. faecalis and serum-requiring diphtheroids were consistently prominant on the tongues of rats, but they were not detected on the tongues of the humans examined. the ability of these organisms to adhere to the tongue surface of the hosts was compared by introducing mixtures of streptomycin-resistant strains into the mouths of human volunteers and rats. s. salivarius adhered in higher proportions to the dorsal tongue surface of humans than did strains of s. faecalis and the serum-requiring diphtheroid. s. sanguis also adhered to human tongues better than the serum-requiring diphtheroid. however, s. faecalis and the serum-requiring diphtheroid sorbed in higher proportions to the tongues of rats.  in an in vivo assay, human strains of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius attached in higher numbers to buccal epithelial cells derived from humans than to those obtained from rats, whereas the reverse was observed with a serum-requiring diphtheroid derived from rats. collectively, these studies show that bacteria sorb with a high degree of specificity to the tissues of different mammalian hosts, and the relative adherence of the organisms studied correlated with their  natural host tropisms. the selective adherence of s. salvarius and s. faecalis was similar to the tongues of conventional and germ-free rats, suggesting that the presence of an indigenous bacterial flora did not significantly influence their attachment selectivity. moreover, the ability of these organisms to colonize the tongues of gnotobiotic rats lacking an indigenous flora paralleled their adherence selectivity. direct scanning microscopic observations indicated that the tongue dorsum of conventional rats is highly papillated but contains relatively sparse bacterial populations. indigenous organisms colonized the bases of papillae on the anterior tip and lateral edges of the tongue as discrete microcolonies, but bacteria were rarely observed on other papillae. this localized and restricted pattern of colonization and the spatial distribution of  the microcolonies of indigenous bacteria present also suggest that antagonistic interactions are unlikely to account for the bacterial tropisms observed for colonization of the tongues of rats.

TI  == streptococcal infections--updated.
AB  == streptococci are amont the most common bacterial pathogens physicians encounter in practice. infections with streptococci continue to occur with significant frequency despite the general sensitivity of these organisms to a variety of widely used antibiotics. in newborn infants and other special patient groups, streptococci may produce fulminant and fatal sepsis (table 1). in normal children and adults, infections usually are short term and often mild or unrecognized but  with the possibility of resulting, unpredictably, in nonsuppurative complications some weeks or months later. although scarlet fever has become an unusual and clinically attenuated disease, its rashless analog, streptococcal pharyngitis, presents thorny problems in the differential diagnosis of symptomatic patients and in the detection of subclinical infections. erysipelas now is a rare disease, but recent studies have confirmed that streptococci often are the primary etiologic agent in impetigo, another type of skin infection--with peculiar bacteriologic and epidemiologic features. infections with group d streptococci have always been a special case because of their frequent resistance to penicillin, and group b streptococci (also somewhat resistant) present special problems in the perinatal period. streptococci may appear in unexpected places or guises (see table 1). thus, the modern physician has little reason to relax in his vigilance for and knowledge of streptococcal infections.

AB  == the lysis of 14c-labeled bacteria by hydrolases of human and rabbit leukocytes was studied in vitro. while staphylococcus albus, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus mutans were highly susceptible to lysis, staphylococcus auresus was intermediate in its susecptibility to lysis by the leukocyte enzymes. group a streptococcus, listeria monocytogenes, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli, and mycobacterium smegmatis were very resistant to degradation by these enzymes. the  lytic activity of leukocyte lysates from human and rabbit blood was probably due  to acid hydrolases of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. extracts of human blood monocytes and of rabbit peritoneal and lung macrophages were less lytic for the bacteria tested. lymphocytes and platelet extracts were not bacteriolytic. the lytic effect of the leukocyte lysates was not inhibited by kcn or sodium azide, but was abolished to a large extent by cationic polyelectrolytes such as protamine sulfate, histone and leukocyte cationic proteins, and poly-lysine, as well as by the anionic polyelectrolytes such as heparin, chondroitin sulfate, dna, carrageenin, alginate sulfate, dextran sulfate, and ploy-l-glutamic acid. other potent inhibitors of bacteriolysis were trypan blue, congo red, phosphatidic acid, normal immunoglobulins, and components of streptococcal cell wall.

TI  == platelet interaction with bacteria. 3. ultrastructure.
AB  == the interaction of several common strains of bacteria with rabbit or human platelets in vitro has been examined sequentially with scanning and transmission  electron microscopy. bacteria were added to platelets in their native plasma or to washed platelets in a balanced salt solution at ratios of about 1:1 or at low  bacteria to platelet ratios (down to 1:100). the platelet-bacterial interaction (pbi) was studied with recording nephelometry. matched samples were fixed for microscopy at various points in the aggregation response. the results support these conclusions: a) bacteria stimulate platelet aggregation by direct contact and adhesion with the platelet surface. b) adhesion between the two cell types requires divalent cations, occurs through fusion of normal cell-surface coats and appears identical in the presence or absence of extracellular plasma protein. c)  the morphologic transformation of platelets during pbi is identical to that produced by collagen. d) during pbi the bacteria are incorporated into the forming platelet aggregates and reside predominantly intercellularly. e) phagocytosis of bacteria by a single platelet is very rare. f) bacteria which have resided within platelet aggregates for one hour are unaltered morphologically. g) pbi occurs even at very low bacterial numbers and produces platelet-bacterial aggregates in small numbers without stimulating generalized platelet aggregation. methods for concentration of thrombocytopenic plasma and washing human platelets are presented.

AB  == overnight cultures of v. cholerae, v. el tor, non-cholera vibrio, and streptococcus pneumoniae in tryptone-soya broth (with 5% blood added for the last-named) failed to grow on subculture despite visible growth in all tubes. viable counts and ph determinations of overnight cultures of various species in tryptone-soya broth, brain-heart infusion broth, and lab-lemco peptone broth show that death in tryptone-soya broth is associated with the drop in ph resulting from fermentation of glucose in the medium and that this drop is greater than that produced by the same amount of glucose in brain-heart infusion broth. some strains of pneumococci failed to grow in brain-heart infusion broth and it is suggested that both these media are unsuitable for blood cultures.

TI  == platelet interaction with bacteria. ii. fate of the bacteria.
AB  == several common strains of bacteria have been studied to determine their influence on human and rabbit platelets in vitro. bacteria at a nominal ratio of 1:1 were added to platelets in their native plasma or to platelets in a balanced salt solution. the platelet-bacterial interaction was examined by nephelometry and by  sequential light microscopy of fixed specimens taken at key points in the reaction. the results support the following conclusions: (1) bacteria that were potent stimuli of the platelet aggregation reaction were incorporated in large numbers into the forming platelet aggregates. (2) bacteria sequestered within platelet aggregates remained in direct contact with the aggregated platelet mass  for up to 1 hour in vitro and during this time showed no morphologic changes by light microscopy. (3) plateletbacterial interaction produced clumping of the bacteria but no demonstrable killing of the microorganisms. (4) collagen-platelet interaction resulted in release of platelet products that were capable of clumping bacteria but were not lethal to them. (5) rabbit and human platelets showed no species differences in plateletbacterial interaction. (6) washed platelets interacted with bacteria without added serum factors but the addition of serum accelerated the aggregation reaction.

TI  == platelet interaction with bacteria. i. reaction phases and effects of inhibitors.
AB  == interactions between human platelets and several common species of bacteria have  been studied in vitro by the technic of recording nephelometry. results of this investigation have established the following parameters of platelet-bacterial interaction: (1) bacteria are potent stimuli of the platelet-aggregating reaction. (2) the platelet-bacterial interaction proceeds through four distinct phases which are separable by varying the platelet-bacterial ratios or adding appropriate chemical inhibitors. (3) the degree and rate of the platelet response is proportional to the ratio of bacteria to platelets. (4) direct contact between platelets and bacteria, physiologic levels of divalent cations and nucleotide release from platelets are essential for aggregation of platelets by bacteria. (5) by adding equivalent numbers of six species of microorganisms to platelet-rich plasma, their potency as initiators of the platelet reaction was determined, with staphylococcus being the most powerful.

TI  == media exchange method for demonstrating killing of l-phase variants in solid media by normal human serum.
AB  == normal human serum has been shown to kill l-phase variants in a fluid system by the action of antibody plus complement. previous studies, however, failed to demonstrate such killing in solid media. this failure probably resulted from inhibition of complement by medium components such as agar and nacl. a method was developed which circumvents the problems of the anticomplementary properties of agar media and the requirement of some l-phase variants for concentrations of salt that inhibit complement. using this method, we have demonstrated in solid media the killing by normal human serum of the l-phase variants of staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhi. this method provides a relatively simple and graphic means for studying host humoral factors lethal for l-phase variants.

TI  == antipseudomonal activity of alpha-sulfoaminopenicillins.
AB  == a series of penicillins characterized by the presence of a sulfoamino or a modified sulfoamino group in the side chain was subjected to in vitro antimicrobial screening tests. although the most potent members of the series were less active than benzylpenicillin against gram-positive bacteria and comparably active against most gram-negative bacteria, they were, on the average, 8 to 16 times more effective against strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. in other  comparative laboratory tests against p. aeruginosa, these compounds were about as active as carbenicillin and four to eight times more active than ampicillin. an examination of structure-activity relationships indicated that maximal potency was obtained with penicillins having an alpha-(aromatic or heteroaromatic)-alpha-sulfoaminoacetamido side chain. the compound with an alpha-phenyl group was comparable in activity to those having an alpha-(2- or 3-thienyl) group, whereas any modification in position or structure of the alpha-sulfoamino group reduced activity. results of studies with a cell-free p. aeruginosa beta-lactamase suggest that the marked inhibitory effects of alpha-sulfoamino penicillins for p. aeruginosa can be attributed, at least in part, to their high degree of resistance to this enzyme. some derivatives, however, had weak antipseudomonal activity, despite possessing a high degree of beta-lactamase resistance.

AB  == an antimicrobial system in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) consisting of myeloperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide has been proposed. this system appears to be activated during phagocytosis as a result of the stimulated metabolic activities. a lysed-granules (lg) fraction was prepared from guinea pig exudative pmn. lg alone possessed bactericidal activity which was related to the ph of the  reaction; the lower the ph, the more marked the activity. when low concentrations of both h(2)o(2) and lg were combined under conditions where neither factor alone exhibited significant killing power, there was a striking increase in bactericidal activity. this enhanced activity was much greater than an additive effect. the lg-peroxide antibacterial system was most active over a ph range of 4.0 to 6.0. the activity of the lg-peroxide system was essentially abolished by peroxidase inhibitors, nan(3), kcn, and aminotriazole. the antibacterial activity of this system was nonspecific in nature, being equally effective against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms.
