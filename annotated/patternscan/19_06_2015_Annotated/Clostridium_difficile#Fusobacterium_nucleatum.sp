TI  == extensive identification of bacterial riboflavin transporters and their distribution across bacterial species.
AB  == riboflavin, the precursor for the cofactors flavin mononucleotide (fmn) and flavin adenine dinucleotide, is an essential metabolite in all organisms. while the functions for de novo riboflavin biosynthesis and riboflavin import may coexist in bacteria, the extent of this co-occurrence is undetermined. the ribm,  ribn, rfuabcd and the energy-coupling factor-ribu bacterial riboflavin transporters have been experimentally characterized. in addition, impx, rfnt and  ribxy are proposed as riboflavin transporters based on positional clustering with riboflavin biosynthetic pathway (rbp) genes or conservation of the fmn riboswitch regulatory element. here, we searched for the fmn riboswitch in bacterial genomes to identify genes encoding riboflavin transporters and assessed their distribution among bacteria. two new putative riboflavin transporters were identified: ribz in clostridium and ribv in mesoplasma florum. trans-complementation of an escherichia coli riboflavin auxotroph strain confirmed the riboflavin transport activity of ribz from clostridium difficile, ribxy from chloroflexus aurantiacus, impx from fusobacterium nucleatum and rfnt from ochrobactrum anthropi. the analysis of the genomic distribution of all known bacterial riboflavin transporters revealed that most occur in species possessing  the rbp and that some bacteria may even encode functional riboflavin transporters from two different families. our results indicate that some species possess ancestral riboflavin transporters, while others possess transporters that appear  to have evolved recently. moreover, our data suggest that unidentified riboflavin transporters also exist. the present study doubles the number of experimentally characterized riboflavin transporters and suggests a specific, non-accessory role for these proteins in riboflavin-prototrophic bacteria.

TI  == advancement in the routine identification of anaerobic bacteria by maldi-tof mass spectrometry.
AB  == we evaluated matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) biotyper as a tool for the identification of anaerobic bacteria compared with 500 base-pair (bp) 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna) gene sequencing analysis, which is considered to be the "gold standard" method. a total of 484 anaerobic bacteria were retrieved from the clinical specimens of 318 pediatric patients. molecular identification resulted in 18 genera and 51 species. the most prevalent genus was clostridium (76.85 %),  with 70 % c. difficile isolates. the concordance and sensitivity determined by maldi-tof ms for c. difficile, the most prevalent species isolated, was 94.08 %,  whereas the specificity was 100 %. for the other anaerobes, the sensitivity and specificity were 94.07 % and 81.82 %, respectively, with a concordance of 93.15 %. low performance was observed for propionibacterium acnes and fusobacterium nucleatum, for which a dedicated pretreatment procedure should likely be set up.  maldi-tof ms was shown to be a valid alternative for the fast and reliable identification of the most clinically relevant anaerobic bacteria; moreover, it is less time-consuming, the cost for reagents is minimized, and it does not require dedicated personnel.

TI  == genome sequence of fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies polymorphum - a genetically tractable fusobacterium.
AB  == fusobacterium nucleatum is a prominent member of the oral microbiota and is a common cause of human infection. f. nucleatum includes five subspecies: polymorphum, nucleatum, vincentii, fusiforme, and animalis. f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum atcc 10953 has been well characterized phenotypically and, in contrast to previously sequenced strains, is amenable to gene transfer. we sequenced and annotated the 2,429,698 bp genome of f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum atcc 10953. plasmid pfn3 from the strain was also sequenced and analyzed. when compared to the other two available fusobacterial genomes (f. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, and f. nucleatum subsp. vincentii) 627 open reading frames unique to f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum atcc 10953 were identified. a large percentage of these mapped within one of 28 regions or islands containing five or more genes. seventeen percent of the clustered proteins that demonstrated similarity were most similar to proteins from the clostridia, with others being most similar to proteins from other gram-positive organisms such as bacillus and  streptococcus. a ten kilobase region homologous to the salmonella typhimurium propanediol utilization locus was identified, as was a prophage and integrated conjugal plasmid. the genome contains five composite ribozyme/transposons, similar to the cdist istrons described in clostridium difficile. istrons are not  present in the other fusobacterial genomes. these findings indicate that f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum is proficient at horizontal gene transfer and that exchange with the firmicutes, particularly the clostridia, is common.

TI  == antianaerobe activity of ceftobiprole, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == agar dilution testing of 463 anaerobes showed most gram-positive beta-lactamase-negative strains (other than some clostridium difficile and peptostreptococcus anaerobius), as well as both beta-lactamase-positive and beta-lactamase-negative strains of fusobacterium nucleatum, to have ceftobiprole  mic values of < or =0.016 to 4 microg/ml. ceftobiprole was less active against beta-lactamase-positive gram-negative bacilli, especially the members of the bacteroides fragilis group. like ceftobiprole, piperacillin was active mainly against beta-lactamase-negative strains, though mic values for piperacillin were  often 1 to 2 dilutions higher than for ceftobiprole. carbapenems had mic values < or =4 microg/l against all except some c. difficile and 2 strains of b. fragilis. all strains were susceptible to metronidazole, and all bacteria, except c. difficile and a single bacteroides distasonis strain, were susceptible to chloramphenicol. clindamycin resistance was seen in most anaerobe groups, whereas high moxifloxacin mics were found mainly among the b. fragilis and prevotella groups, and a few c. difficile and f. nucleatum strains.

TI  == inhibitory effects of various micro-organisms on the growth of helicobacter pylori.
AB  == aims: to examine the in vitro influence of various bacteria species on helicobacter pylori (hp) growth. methods and results: the effects of 29 micro-organisms on 31 hp strains were determined using two modified 'cross streak' methods. staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens, bacteroides fragilis, fusobacterium nucleatum and clostridium difficile showed the strongest inhibition. the inhibitory effects varied, depending on the bacteria spp. and hp strains, and were method dependent. the caga status of hp strains did not correlate with the extent of inhibition. conclusions: helicobacter pylori is inhibited by a significant number of commensal bacteria species as well as opportunistic human pathogens. the success  and progress of hp infection may be influenced by the bacterial flora present, while the difficulty in cultivating hp from the oral mucosa and faeces may be the result of antagonistic bacterial interaction. significance and impact of the study: this study provides valuable data on the sensitivity of hp to a variety of intestinal and oral commensals as well as opportunistic human pathogens. hp's varying pathogenicity and the specific localization of infection may be the result of these sensitivities. these results can also serve as a basis for further studies to identify the inhibitory substances and make them available for therapeutic use.

TI  == ["in vitro" activity of ten antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria. a collaborative study, 1999-2002].
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, imipenem, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, clindamycin, metronidazole, and azitromycin was assesed against 166 strains of anaerobic bacteria recovered from eight hospitals in buenos aires. the strains studied were bacteroides fragilis group (65), fusobacterium spp. (26), prevotella spp. (21), porphyromonas spp. (10), clostridium difficile (10), other clostridia (12), and gram-positive cocci (22). the mics were determined by the agar dilution method according to nccls document m11-a5. metronidazole and piperacillin-tazobactam were the most active antimicrobial agents tested and exhibited mic90 values of <  or = 2 microg/ml and < or = 4 microg/ml against gram-negative organisms, and < or = 2 microg/ml, and < or = 8 microg/ml against gram-positive organisms, respectively. among beta-lactams the activity against gram-negative rods was in the following order: imipenem > piperacillin > cefoxitin > ceftriaxone > ampicillin. among the gram-positive bacteria the decreased activity was: piperacillin > imipenem > cefoxitin > ceftriaxone > ampicillin. the majority of the species studied showed different degrees of resistance to clindamycin and azitromycin. nevertheless, 90% of fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas spp.  isolates were inhibited by 0.125 mg/ml of clindamycin and azitromycin, respectively.

TI  == dehydration of (r)-2-hydroxyacyl-coa to enoyl-coa in the fermentation of alpha-amino acids by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == several clostridia and fusobacteria ferment alpha-amino acids via (r)-2-hydroxyacyl-coa, which is dehydrated to enoyl-coa by syn-elimination. this  reaction is of great mechanistic interest, since the beta-hydrogen, to be eliminated as proton, is not activated (pk 40-50). a mechanism has been proposed, in which one high-energy electron acts as cofactor and transiently reduces the electrophilic thiol ester carbonyl to a nucleophilic ketyl radical anion. the 2-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydratases are two-component systems composed of an extremely oxygen-sensitive component a, an activator, and component d, the actual dehydratase. component a, a homodimer with one [4fe-4s]cluster, transfers an electron to component d, a heterodimer with 1-2 [4fe-4s]clusters and fmn, concomitant with hydrolysis of two atp. from component d the electron is further  transferred to the substrate, where it facilitates elimination of the hydroxyl group. in the resulting enoxyradical the beta-hydrogen is activated (pk14). after elimination the electron is handed-over to the next incoming substrate without further hydrolysis of atp. the helix-cluster-helix architecture of component a forms an angle of 105 degrees, which probably opens to 180 degrees upon binding of atp resembling an archer shooting arrows. therefore we designated component a  as 'archerase'. here, we describe 2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa dehydratase from acidaminococcus fermentans, clostridium symbiosum and fusobacterium nucleatum, 2-phenyllactate dehydratase from clostridium sporogenes, 2-hydroxyisocaproyl-coa  dehydratase from clostridium difficile, and lactyl-coa dehydratase from clostridium propionicum. a relative of the 2-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydratases is benzoyl-coa reductase from thauera aromatica. analogous but unrelated archerases  are the iron proteins of nitrogenase and bacterial protochlorophyllide reductase. in anaerobic organisms, which do not oxidize 2-oxo acids, a second energy-driven  electron transfer from nadh to ferredoxin, the electron donor of component a, has been established. the transfer is catalysed by a membrane-bound nadh-ferredoxin oxidoreductase driven by an electrochemical na(+)-gradient. this enzyme is related to the rnf proteins involved in rhodobacter capsulatus nitrogen fixation.

TI  == in vitro activities of faropenem against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of faropenem, a new oral penem, was tested against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria by using the nccls-approved reference method. drugs tested included amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, faropenem, imipenem, and metronidazole. of the 176 strains of bacteroides fragilis group isolates tested, two isolates had faropenem mics of 64 micro g/ml and imipenem mics of >32 micro g/ml. faropenem had an mic of 16 micro g/ml for an additional isolate of b. fragilis; this strain was sensitive to imipenem (mic of 1 micro g/ml). both faropenem and imipenem had mics of < or=4 micro g/ml for all isolates of bacteroides capillosus (10 isolates), bacteroides splanchnicus (13 isolates), bacteroides ureolyticus (11 isolates), bilophila wadsworthia (11 isolates), porphyromonas species (42 isolates), prevotella species (78 isolates), campylobacter species (25 isolates), sutterella wadsworthensis (11 isolates), fusobacterium nucleatum (19 isolates), fusobacterium mortiferum/varium (20 isolates), and other fusobacterium species (9 isolates). faropenem and imipenem had mics of 16 to 32 micro g/ml for two strains of clostridium difficile; the mics for all other strains of clostridium tested (69 isolates) were < or =4 micro g/ml. faropenem had mics of 8 and 16 micro g/ml, respectively, for two strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius (mics of imipenem were 2 micro g/ml). mics were < or =4 micro g/ml for all other strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (53 isolates) and non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (28 isolates). other results were as expected and reported in previous studies. no metronidazole resistance was seen in gram-negative anaerobes other than s. wadsworthensis (18% resistant); 63% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods were resistant. some degree of clindamycin resistance was seen in most of the groups tested.

TI  == antianaerobic activity of a cecropin---melittin peptide.
AB  == objective: several small, 15-residue peptides that contain portions of the amino  acid sequences of both cecropin a and melittin have previously been shown to have broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against aerobic microorganisms, with no undesirable hemolytic properties. it would also be useful to know what effect these hybrid peptides have on anaerobic bacteria. methods: the minimum inhibitory concentrations of one hybrid, ca(1--7)m(2--9)nh2, were compared with those of seven other antimicrobial agents against 111 clinical anaerobic strains; bacteroides fragilis, 24 strains; other bacteroides fragilis group, 14 strains; other bacteroides species, 13 strains; fusobacterium nucleatum, six strains; clostridium difficile, 22 strains; clostridium perfringens, 10 strains, propionibacterium spp., nine strains; and anaerobic cocci, 13 strains. results: ninety per cent of strains belonging to the b. fragilis group, fusobacteria, propionibacteria and peptostreptococci were inhibited by 4 mg/l ca(1--7)m(2--9)nh2, and the antimicrobial activity was approximately in the same  range as that of chloramphenicol. conclusion: this investigation showed that the  antimicrobial spectrum of this cecropin---melittin hybrid also includes anaerobic organisms.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of abt-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. mics at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for actinomyces spp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium spp., and porphyromonas spp. the mic(50)s and mic(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for eubacterium spp., lactobacillus spp., clostridium difficile, and clostridium ramosum. the mic(90) for bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides ureolyticus, and campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for prevotella bivia and other prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. the mic(90) for fusobacterium nucleatum was 8  microg/ml, and that for fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. the mic(90)s for the bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for b. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides distasonis, and bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. telithromycin mics for the b. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than abt-773 mics. for all strains, abt-773  was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.

TI  == in vitro activity of rifaximin, metronidazole and vancomycin against clostridium  difficile and the rate of selection of spontaneously resistant mutants against representative anaerobic and aerobic bacteria, including ammonia-producing species.
AB  == background: rifaximin is a rifamycin derivative characterized by a wide antibacterial activity. this drug is neither absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract nor inactivated by gastric juices, and exerts its action entirely within the intestinal lumen. methods: in this study, the activity of this antibiotic was compared with that of metronidazole and vancomycin against 93 clostridium difficile isolates. the rate of emergence of bacteria spontaneously resistant to  the new compound was also evaluated in relation to representative gram-positive and gram-negative strains. in terms of mic(50) values, rifaximin showed an intrinsic activity superior to that of the other agents. the emergence of spontaneously resistant strains was assessed with 46 aerobic (staphylococci, enterococci, proteus spp., citrobacter freundii, providencia rettgeri, enteropathogenic, enteroinvasive, enterotoxigenic and entero- hemorrhagic escherichia coli, and salmonella enteritidis) and anaerobic (clostridium spp., bacteroides spp., fusobacterium nucleatum and peptococcus spp.) pathogens, most of them also ammonium producers. two different methods, broth and agar dilution,  were employed. results: when liquid medium was employed, bacteria capable of sustained growth in 100 microg/ml of rifaximin were obtained after 2-5 transfers  with gram-positive aerobic cocci, 2-3 transfers with gram-negative aerobic strains and 2-5 transfers with anaerobic species. at the highest dose used with the agar dilution method (8 x mic), the frequency of emergence of spontaneously resistant mutants ranged from <1 x 10(-9) to 1.6 x 10(-8) with gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic cocci, while with aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, this value ranged from <1 x 10(-9) to 1.7 x 10(-7). c. difficile showed a particularly low incidence of spontaneously resistant mutants (<1 x 10(-9)). the low incidence of resistant subpopulations selected by levels of 8 x mic of rifaximin suggests that the high levels of the drug which were reached in the gastrointestinal lumen may further prevent the selection of mutants. conclusion:  the low toxicity, broad antibacterial activity and very poor absorption from the  gastrointestinal tract of rifaximin suggest a potential therapeutic use for this  drug in gastrointestinal diseases, as well as in the management of patients with  cirrhosis and chronic portal-systemic encephalopathy.

TI  == periodontal microflora of hiv infected patients with periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the microbial profile of periodontal lesions in hiv seropositive patients and to compare it with rapidly progressing periodontal lesions in systemically healthy patients. the subgingival microflora  of 20 cdc ii, 20 cdc iii, 20 cdc iv/v and 20 systemically healthy patients with rapidly progressing periodontitis was examined. four sites with greatest probing  depth in each patient were selected for microbiological sampling. the samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the microflora of periodontitis lesions within the three stages of the hiv infection was similar to that of progressing periodontitis in systemically healthy adults including campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, selenomonas spp. and peptostreptococcus micros. however, hiv seropositive periodontitis lesions harboured a range of exogenous pathogens rarely associated with common types of periodontitis including staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloaca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium, clostridium difficile, aspergillus fumigatus, klebsiella pneumoniae and mycoplasma incognitum. the lack of immune effector and regulatory cells in hiv infected patients could in fact explain the increase of some opportunistic pathogens and the characteristic and rapidly progressing nature of the periodontal disease in these patients.

AB  == the efficacy of cefoxitin, mezlocillin, latamoxef and metronidazole in anaerobic  lung infection was studied using a rabbit model. a mixture of bacteroides fragilis, peptococcus morbillorum, eubacterium lentum and fusobacterium nucleatum was inoculated transtracheally to produce infection within the lung. mezlocillin  was most effective, achieving bacteriologic cure in 5 out of 8 animals. with cefoxitin therapy, 4 out of 8 became bacteriologically sterile. severe diarrhea with elevated titers of clostridium difficile toxin was noted in most cefoxitin-treated animals. latamoxef- and metronidazole-treated animals had apparently healed lesions, but cultures were positive in 6 and 7 out of 8 in each group, respectively. the commonest pathogen isolated in the last two groups was p. morbillorum. the therapeutic superiority of mezlocillin over metronidazole and latamoxef was statistically significant (p less than or equal to 0.05).

TI  == effect of bacterial contamination on cecal size and cecal contents of gnotobiotic rodents.
AB  == in the present investigation the effect of various bacterial contaminations of gnotobiotic mice and rats on cecal size is presented. of the species tested, bacteroides oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum did not establish in germ-free mice. streptococcus mutans, clostridium difficile, a neisseria strain and two recent cecal isolates established, but failed to exert an effect upon the cecum of mice. a group k streptococcus and b. fragilis increased the cecal size apparently by increasing the levels of water-soluble protein, peptides, and carbohydrates in the cecal contents. mixed ileal bacteria decreased the cecal size by preventing accumulation of soluble proteins and carbohydrates in the cecum. a peptococcus strain caused a reduction by lowering the levels of insoluble material in the cecum. when this strain was combined with two clostridium isolates and introduced into gnotobiotic rats, 50 to 65% cecal reduction was observed. this polycontamination did not decrease the per cent water of the cecal contents but caused lower levels of both soluble and insoluble material to accumulate in the cecum. no net nitrogen absorption from the distal small intestine occurred in either the germ-free or polycontaminated rats.
