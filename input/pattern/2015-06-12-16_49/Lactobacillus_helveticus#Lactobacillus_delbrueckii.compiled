TI  - Selected adjunct cultures remarkably increase the content of bioactive peptides in Bulgarian white brined cheese.
AB  - Some lactic acid bacteria strains in milk media are capable of releasing bioactive peptides. In this study, we evaluated the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)inhibitory activity of 180 lactic acid bacteria and selected several Lactobacillus helveticus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and L. casei strains that demonstrated strong ACE-inhibitory activity. The aim was to carry out a molecular study on the bioactive peptides released by the strains with the best ACE-inhibitory properties and by the strains demonstrating a calcium-binding effect. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of bioactive peptides in Bulgarian white cheese. Peptides with the strongest ACE-inhibitory activity were purified and sequenced. The strains were assessed for production of peptides with calcium-binding properties. These peptides were isolated, purified and sequenced. Two strains releasing bioactive peptides with the strongest ACE-inhibitory and calcium-binding activities were selected for development of cheese starters. The strain with the best ACE-inhibitory activity was L. helveticus A1, which releases the peptide Ala-Leu-Pro-Met as a main contributor to the ACE inhibition. The strain with the best calcium-binding activity was L. casei C3 releasing the peptide SpLSpSpSpE (fraction 15-20 of ss-casein) as a main contributor to calcium binding. After pilot production of cheeses with the developed starters, the ACE-inhibitory and calcium-binding effects were confirmed during the cheese ripening. The addition of the two selected adjunct cultures led to increased production of bioactive peptides in the cheese. In this way, it is possible to increase the functional properties of Bulgarian white brined cheese.
TI  - characterization of the adhesive factors of selected probiotics to Caco-2 epithelium cell line.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to analyse the type of adhesive factors of selected probiotic strains. A large number of lactic acid bacteria with intestinal and dairy origin were collected and assessed for adhesion on Caco-2 cell line. From the best adherent bacteria, four strains were selected for further research: Lactobacillus gasseri G7, L. plantarum F1, L. helveticus AC and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus B14. The average number of adhered bacteria was 17 per one Caco-2 cell in the case of L. gasseri G7 and 21 per cell in the case of L. plantarum F1. Treatment with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), trypsin and metaperiodic acid in separate assays revealed that cell-bonded extracellular proteins were responsible for the adhesion of the selected L. gasseri, L. plantarum and L. helveticus strains, in contrast to the L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strain, whose adhesive factors were identified as cell-bonded exopolysaccharides. The cell-wall proteins from the first three strains were isolated, fractionated and assessed for adhesion to Caco-2 cells. Based on the attachment properties of the purified proteins towards Caco-2 cells, it was clearly proved exactly which proteins are involved in the adherence. L. plantarum F1 strain contains two adhesive proteins in contrast to the other selected strains containing one adhesive protein each. The determination of the factors mediating the adhesive abilities of the selected strains provides important information about the possible ways to preserve and increase adhesive properties towards epithelium cells.
TI  - Molecular identification and quantification of lactic acid bacteria in traditional fermented dairy foods of Russia.
AB  - Russian traditional fermented dairy foods have been consumed for thousands of years. However, little research has focused on exploiting lactic acid bacteria (LAB) resources and analyzing the LAB composition of Russian traditional fermented dairy foods. In the present study, we cultured LAB isolated from fermented mare and cow milks, sour cream, and cheese collected from Kalmykiya, Buryats, and Tuva regions of Russia. Seven lactobacillus species and the Bifidobacterium genus were quantified by quantitative PCR. The LAB counts in these samples ranged from 3.18 to 9.77 log cfu/mL (or per gram). In total, 599 LAB strains were obtained from these samples using de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar and M17 agar. The identified LAB belonged to 7 genera and 30 species by 16S rRNA and murE gene sequencing and multiplex PCR assay. The predominant LAB isolates were Lactobacillus helveticus (176 strains) and Lactobacillus plantarum (63 strains), which represented 39.9% of all isolates. The quantitative PCR results revealed that counts of 7 lactobacilli species and Bifidobacterium spp. of 30 fermented cow milk samples ranged from 1.19 +/- 0.34 (Lactobacillus helveticus in Tuva) to 8.09 +/- 0.71 (Lactobacillus acidophilus in Kalmykiya) log cfu/mL of fermented cow milk (mean +/- standard error). The numbers of Bifidobacterium spp., Lb. plantarum, Lb. helveticus, and Lb. acidophilus revealed no significant difference between the 3 regions; nevertheless, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus sakei, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus exhibited different degrees of variation across 3 regions. The results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of Russia have complex compositions of LAB species. The diversity of LAB might be related to the type of fermented dairy product, geographical origin, and manufacturing process.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese.
AB  - The water buffalo mozzarella cheese is a typical Italian cheese which has been introduced in the thriving Brazilian market in the last 10 y, with good acceptance by its consumers. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) play an important role in the technological and sensory quality of mozzarella cheese. In this study, the aim was to evaluate the diversity of the autochthones viable LAB isolated from water buffalo mozzarella cheese under storage. Samples were collected in 3 independent trials in a dairy industry located in the southeast region of Brazil, on the 28th day of storage, at 4 masculineC. The LAB were characterized by Gram staining, catalase test, capacity to assimilate citrate, and production of CO2 from glucose. The diversity of LAB was evaluated by RAPD-PCR (randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction), 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and by Vitek 2 system. Twenty LAB strains were isolated and clustered into 12 different clusters, and identified as Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Lactobacillus helveticus. Enterococcus species were dominant and citrate-positive. Only the strains of L. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and L. fermentum produced CO2 from glucose and were citrate-positive, while L. casei was only citrate positive. This is the first report which elucidates the LAB diversity involved in Brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese. Furthermore, the results show that despite the absence of natural whey cultures as starters in production, the LAB species identified are the ones typically found in mozzarella cheese.
TI  - Cell growth and proteolytic activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus  helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus in milk as affected by supplementation with peptide fractions.
AB  - The present investigation examined the effects of supplementation of milk peptide fractions produced by enzymatic hydrolysis on the fermentation of reconstituted skim milk (RSM). Changes in pH, cell growth, proteolytic activity, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity were monitored during fermentation of RSM by pure cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. The study showed that supplementation with peptide fractions of different molecular weights did not significantly affect the bacterial growth in RSM. All bacteria showed an increased proteolytic activity in RSM supplemented with large peptides (>10 kDa), and L. helveticus in general exhibited the highest proteolytic activity among the bacteria studied. The ACE-inhibitory activity was observed to be the maximum in RSM supplemented with larger peptides (>10 kDa) for all bacteria. The results suggest that proteolysis by bacteria leads to increased production of ACE-inhibitory peptides compared to the supplemented peptides produced by enzymatic hydrolysis.
TI  - Pyrosequencing analysis of the microbial diversity of airag, khoormog and tarag,  traditional fermented dairy products of mongolia.
AB  - Here, we used pyrosequencing to obtain a detailed analysis of the microbial diversities of traditional fermented dairy products of Mongolia. From 22 Airag (fermented mare's milk), 5 Khoormog (fermented camel's milk) and 26 Tarag (fermented milk of cows, goats and yaks) samples collected in the Mongolian provinces of Arhangai, Bulgan, Dundgobi, Tov, Uburhangai and Umnugobi, we obtained a total of 81 operational taxonomic units, which were assigned to 15 families, 21 genera and 41 species in 3 phyla. The genus Lactobacillus is a core bacterial component of Mongolian fermented milks, and Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens and Lactobacillus delbrueckii were the predominant species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the Airag, Khoormog and Tarag samples, respectively. By using this pyrosequencing approach, we successfully detected most LAB species that have been isolated as well as seven LAB species that have not been found in our previous culture-based study. A subsequent analysis of the principal components of the samples revealed that L. delbrueckii, L. helveticus, L. kefiranofaciens and Streptococcus thermophilus were the main factors influencing the microbial diversity of these Mongolian traditional fermented dairy products and that this diversity correlated with the animal species from which the milk was sourced.
TI  - Diversity and functional characterization of Lactobacillus spp. isolated throughout the ripening of a hard cheese.
AB  - The aim of this work was to study the Lactobacillus spp. intra- and inter- species diversity in a Piedmont hard cheese made of raw milk without thermal treatment and without addition of industrial starter, and to perform a first screening for potential functional properties. A total of 586 isolates were collected during the cheese production and identified by means of molecular methods: three hundred and four were identified as Lactobacillus rhamnosus, two hundred and forty as Lactobacillus helveticus, twenty six as Lactobacillus fermentum, eleven as Lactobacillus delbrueckii, three as Lactobacillus pontis, and two as Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus reuteri, respectively. A high genetic heterogeneity was detected by using the repetitive bacterial DNA element fingerprinting (rep-PCR) with the use of (GTG)5 primer resulting in eight clusters of L. helveticus and sixteen clusters in the case of L. rhamnosus. Most of isolates showed a high auto-aggregation property, low hydrophobicity values, and a general low survival to simulated digestion process. However, sixteen isolates showed promising functional characteristics.
TI  - Peptidoglycan hydrolases as species-specific markers to differentiate Lactobacillus helveticus from Lactobacillus gallinarum and other closely related homofermentative lactobacilli.
AB  - We propose a new method that allows accurate discrimination of Lactobacillus helveticus from other closely related homofermentative lactobacilli, especially Lactobacillus gallinarum. This method is based on the amplification by PCR of two peptidoglycan hydrolytic genes, Lhv_0190 and Lhv_0191. These genes are ubiquitous and show high homology at the intra-species level. The PCR method gave two specific PCR products, of 542 and 747 bp, for 25 L. helveticus strains coming from various sources. For L. gallinarum, two amplicons were obtained, the specific 542 bp amplicon and another one with a size greater than 1,500 bp. No specific PCR products were obtained for 12 other closely related species of lactobacilli, including the L. acidophilus complex, L. delbrueckii, and L. ultunensis. The developed PCR method provided rapid, precise, and easy identification of L. helveticus. Moreover, it enabled differentiation between the two closely phylogenetically related species L. helveticus and L. gallinarum.
TI  - Microbiological, physico-chemical, nutritional and sensory characterization of traditional Matsoni: selection and use of autochthonous multiple strain cultures to extend its shelf-life.
AB  - Matsoni, a traditional Georgian fermented milk, has variable quality and stability besides a short shelf-life (72-120 h at 6 degrees C) due to inadequate production and storage conditions. To individuate its typical traits as well as select and exploit autochthonous starter cultures to standardize its overall quality without altering its typicality, we carried out a thorough physico-chemical, sensorial and microbial characterization of traditional Matsoni. A polyphasic approach, including a culture-independent (PCR-DGGE) and two PCR culture-dependent methods, was employed to study the ecology of Matsoni. Overall, the microbial ecosystem of Matsoni resulted largely dominated by Streptococcus (S.) thermophilus and Lactobacillus (Lb.) delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. High loads of other lactic acid bacteria species, including Lb. helveticus, Lb. paracasei and Leuconostoc (Leuc.) lactis were found to occur as well. A selected autochthonous multiple strain culture (AMSC) composed of one Lb. bulgaricus, one Lb. paracasei and one S. thermophilus strain, applied for the pilot-scale production of traditional Matsoni, resulted the best in terms of enhanced shelf-life (one month), sensorial and nutritional quality without altering its overall typical quality. This AMSC is at disposal of SMEs who need to exploit and standardize the overall quality of this traditional fermented milk, preserving its typicality.
TI  - [Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of probiotic bacterial strains used in medicinal products].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The optimization of quality testing strategy of products containing probiotics might allow to general improvement of its safer use in humans. The goal of the study was the evaluation of quality expressed by identity, colony forming unit (CFU) and antibiotic sensitivity ofprobiotics used in medicinal products available in Poland using the appropriate and validated procedures. METHODS: The medicinal products containing L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and B. animalis subsp. lactis, L. helveticus, and L. gasseri were tested for species identity performed with validated rep-PCR (BOXA 1R) method. The antimicrobial susceptibility of working seeds and strains isolated to 26 antibiotics were tested by disk diffusion and E-test methods using relevant references as recommended by EUCAST. The numbers of probiotic strains, expressed as cfu count per package, was done using plating plunge method. RESULTS: All strains tested, except B. lactis, were found to be resistant to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, nalidixic acid, metronidazole, and colistin. B. lactis was resistant to aminoglycosides. L. rhamnosus strains were found to be resistant to vancomycin, (MIC > 256 microg/ml) similarly to ATCC strains (L. rhamnosus GG 53103 and 244). The sensitivity to other antibiotics was strain specific. The rep-PCR method was found species and strain specific. All products tested fulfilled declared countent as measured by cfu count/package. CONCLUSIONS: Quality of medicinal products containing probiotics was found undoubted and confirmed. The optimized strategy of quality monitoring of probiotics used in medicinal products can be used in dietary supplements and foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses.
TI  - Species-specific quantification of probiotic lactobacilli in yoghurt by quantitative real-time PCR.
AB  - AIMS: Lactobacilli strains with probiotic effects have been widely used in dairy  products such as yoghurts as well as in food additives and pharmaceuticals. Despite their successful commercial application, the current species identification and quantification methods of the genus Lactobacillus are time-consuming and labour-intensive. METHODS AND RESULTS: To fulfil the requirements of a robust quality management, we have developed a quantitative real-time PCR assay based on the heat shock protein 60 gene (hsp60) for accurate identification and quantification of five commercially important Lactobacillus species. The developed assay allows an unambiguous species-specific detection of the species Lact. acidophilus, Lact. brevis, Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lact. helveticus and Lact. reuteri from bacterial cultures as well as directly from dairy products for instance yoghurt. CONCLUSIONS: With the assay, we were able to specifically detect lactobacilli strains down to 10(5) CFU ml(-1) directly from yoghurt, which is a sufficient detection limit as commercial products usually contain 10(6) -10(12) CFU ml(-1) of probiotic strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The real-time PCR assay developed here might become a convenient tool enabling an accurate, fast and sensitive detection of probiotic lactobacilli commercially used in food.
TI  - Diversity and dynamic of lactic acid bacteria strains during aging of a long ripened hard cheese produced from raw milk and undefined natural starter.
AB  - The aim of this study was to explore diversity and dynamic of indigenous LAB strains associated with a long ripened hard cheese produced from raw milk and undefined natural starter such as PDO Grana Padano cheese. Samples of milk, curd, natural whey culture and cheeses (2nd, 6th, 9th and 13th months of ripening) were collected from 6 cheese factories in northern Italy. DNA was extracted from each sample and from 194 LAB isolates. tRNA(Ala)-23S rDNA-RFLP was applied to identify isolates. Strain diversity was assessed by (GTG)5 rep-PCR and RAPD(P1)-PCR. Finally, culture-independent LH-PCR (V1-V2 16S-rDNA), was considered to explore structure and dynamic of the microbiota. Grana Padano LAB were represented mainly by Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus helveticus and Pediococcus acidilactici, while the structure and dynamic of microbiota at different localities was specific. The strength of this work is to have focused the study on isolates coming from more than one cheese factories rather than a high number of isolates from one unique production. We provided a valuable insight into inter and intraspecies diversity of typical LAB strains during ripening of traditional PDO Grana Padano, contributing to the understanding of specific microbial ecosystem of this cheese.
TI  - Microencapsulation of Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii using alginate and gellan gum.
AB  - Sodium alginate (SA) at 2% (w/v) and low acylated gellan gum (LAG) at 0.2% (w/v)  were used to microencapsulate Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii spp lactis by employing the internal ionic gelation technique through water-oil emulsions at three different stirring rates: 480, 800 and 1200 rpm. The flow behavior of the biopolymer dispersions, the activation energy of the emulsion, the microencapsulation efficiency, the size distribution, the microcapsules morphology and the effect of the stirring rate on the culture viability were analyzed. All of the dispersions exhibited a non-Newtonian shear-thinning flow behavior because the apparent viscosity decreased in value when the shear rate was increased. The activation energy was calculated using the Arrhenius-like equation; the value obtained for the emulsion was 32.59 kJ/mol. It was observed that at 400 rpm, the microencapsulation efficiency was 92.83%, whereas at 800 and 1200 rpm, the stirring rates reduced the efficiency to 15.83% and 4.56%, respectively, evidencing the sensitivity of the microorganisms to the shear rate (13.36 and 20.05 s(-1)). Both optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed spherical microcapsules with irregular topography due to the presence of holes on its surface. The obtained size distribution range was modified when the stirring rate was increased. At 400 rpm, bimodal behavior was observed in the range of 20-420 mum; at 800 and 1200 rpm, the behavior became unimodal and the range was from 20 to 200 mum and 20 to 160 mum, respectively.
TI  - Diversity in proteinase specificity of thermophilic lactobacilli as revealed by hydrolysis of dairy and vegetable proteins.
AB  - Ability of industrially relevant species of thermophilic lactobacilli strains to  hydrolyze proteins from animal (caseins and beta-lactoglobulin) and vegetable (soybean and wheat) sources, as well as influence of peptide content of growth medium on cell envelope-associated proteinase (CEP) activity, was evaluated. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis (CRL 581 and 654), L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (CRL 454 and 656), Lactobacillus acidophilus (CRL 636 and 1063), and Lactobacillus helveticus (CRL 1062 and 1177) were grown in a chemically defined medium supplemented or not with 1 % Casitone. All strains hydrolyzed mainly beta-casein, while degradation of alphas-caseins was strain dependent. Contrariwise, kappa-Casein was poorly degraded by the studied lactobacilli. beta-Lactoglobulin was mainly hydrolyzed by CRL 656, CRL 636, and CRL 1062 strains. The L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis strains, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 656, and L. helveticus CRL 1177 degraded gliadins in high extent, while the L. acidophilus and L. helveticus strains highly hydrolyzed soy proteins. Proteinase production was inhibited by Casitone, the most affected being the L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis species. This study highlights the importance of proteolytic diversity of lactobacilli for rational strain selection when formulating hydrolyzed dairy or vegetable food products.
TI  - Evaluation of the microbial community, acidity and proximate composition of akamu, a fermented maize food.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Akamu is a lactic acid-fermented cereal-based food that constitutes a major infant complementary food in most West African countries. The identities of LAB populations from DGGE analysis and conventionally isolated LAB and yeasts from traditionally fermented akamu were confirmed by PCR sequencing analysis. The relationships between pH, acidity and lactic acid levels and proximate composition of the akamu samples were investigated. RESULTS: The LAB communities in the akamu samples comprised mainly Lactobacillus species, including Lb. fermentum, Lb. plantarum, Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Lb. helveticus, as well as Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris. Identified yeasts were Candida tropicalis, Candida albicans, Clavispora lusitaniae and Saccharomyces paradoxus. Low pH (3.22-3.95) was accompanied by high lactic acid concentrations (43.10-84.29 mmol kg(-)(1)). Protein (31.88-74.32 g kg(-)(1)) and lipid (17.74-36.83 g kg(-)(1) contents were negatively correlated with carbohydrate content (897.48-926.20 g kg(-)(1), of which </=1 g kg(-)(1) was sugars). Ash was either not detected or present only in trace amounts (</=4 g kg(-)(1)). Energy levels ranged from 17.29 to 18.37 kJ g(-)(1). CONCLUSION: The akamu samples were predominantly starchy foods and had pH < 4.0 owing to the activities of fermentative LAB.
TI  - Diversity of thermophilic bacteria in raw, pasteurized and selectively-cultured milk, as assessed by culturing, PCR-DGGE and pyrosequencing.
AB  - Thermophilic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species, such as Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Lactobacillus helveticus, enjoy worldwide economic importance as dairy starters. To assess the diversity of thermophilic bacteria in milk, milk samples were enriched in thermophilic organisms through a stepwise procedure which included pasteurization of milk at 63 degrees C for 30 min (PM samples) and pasteurization followed by incubation at 42 degrees C for 24 h (IPM samples). The microbial composition of these samples was analyzed by culture-dependent (at 42 degrees C) and culture-independent (PCR-DGGE and pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons) microbial techniques. The results were then compared to those obtained for their corresponding starting raw milk counterparts (RM samples). Twenty different species were scored by culturing among 352 isolates purified from the counting plates and identified by molecular methods. Mesophilic LAB species (Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garvieae) were dominant (87% of the isolates) among the RM samples. However, S. thermophilus and Lb. delbrueckii were found to be the dominant recoverable organisms in both PM and IPM samples. The DGGE profiles of RM and PM samples were found to be very similar; the most prominent bands belonging to Lactococcus, Leuconostoc and Streptococcus species. In contrast, just three DGGE bands were obtained for IPM samples, two of which were assigned to S. thermophilus. The pyrosequencing results scored 95 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 3% sequence divergence in an RM sample, while only 13 were encountered in two IPM samples. This technique identified Leuconostoc citreum as the dominant microorganism in the RM sample, while S. thermophilus constituted more than 98% of the reads in the IPM samples. The procedure followed in this study allowed to estimate the bacterial diversity in milk and afford a suitable strategy for the isolation of new thermophilic LAB strains, among which adequate starters might be selected.
TI  - Development of a multiplex real time PCR to detect thermophilic lactic acid bacteria in natural whey starters.
AB  - A multiplex real time PCR (mRealT-PCR) useful to rapidly screen microbial composition of thermophilic starter cultures for hard cooked cheeses and to compare samples with potentially different technological properties was developed. Novel primers directed toward pheS gene were designed and optimized for multiple detection of Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus fermentum. The assay was based on SYBR Green chemistry followed by melting curves analysis. The method was then evaluated for applications in the specific detection of the 4 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in 29 different natural whey starters for Parmigiano Reggiano cheese production. The results obtained by mRealT-PCR were also compared with those obtained on the same samples by Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) and Length-Heterogeneity PCR (LH-PCR). The mRealT-PCR developed in this study, was found to be effective for analyzing species present in the samples with an average sensitivity down to less than 600 copies of DNA and therefore sensitive enough to detect even minor LAB community members of thermophilic starter cultures. The assay was able to describe the microbial population of all the different natural whey starter samples analyzed, despite their natural variability. A higher number of whey starter samples with S. thermophilus and L. fermentum present in their microbial community were revealed, suggesting that these species could be more frequent in Parmigiano Reggiano natural whey starter samples than previously shown. The method was more effective than LH-PCR and FISH and, considering that these two techniques have to be used in combination to detect the less abundant species, the mRealT-PCR was also faster. Providing a single step sensitive detection of L. helveticus, L. delbrueckii, S. thermophilus and L. fermentum, the developed mRealT-PCR could be used for screening thermophilic starter cultures and to follow the presence of those species during ripening of derived dairy products. A major increase in understanding the starter culture contribution to cheese ecosystem could be harnessed to control cheese ripening and flavor formation.
TI  - Mitogenic response and probiotic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from indigenously pickled vegetables and fermented beverages.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria from indigenous pickled vegetables and fermented beverages (fermented rice and Madhuca longifolia flowers) were isolated and investigated for their functional characteristics in vitro as potential new probiotic strains. Four isolates (all Lactobacillus spp.) selected on the basis of high tolerance to bile (0.2%) were identified by standard and molecular methods (16S rDNA) as L. helveticus, L. casei, L. delbrueckii and L. bulgaricus from pickled vegetables and fermented beverages respectively. These selected strains had antibiotic resistance, tolerance to artificial gastric juice and phenol (0.4%), enzymatic profile, and antagonistic activity against enteric pathogens (Enterobacter sakazakii, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri 2a, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica and Aeromonas hydrophila). All strains survived well in artificial gastric juice at low pH (3.0) values for 4 h, possessed bile salt hydrolase activity and were susceptible to most antibiotics including vancomycin. Additionally, the isolates exhibited high tolerance to phenol, high cell surface hydrophobicity (>60%) and induced proliferation of murine splenocytes. All the four strains of present study suppressed the Con A-stimulated proliferation of the mouse spleen cells, although L. casei had the strongest suppressive effect. The results of this study suggest a potential application of the strains (following human clinical trials), for developing probiotic foods.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of microflora from ovine cheese.
AB  - Strains identified in ovine cheese and bryndza by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis belonged to ten species of non-enterococcal lactic acid bacteria and included Lactobacillus casei/Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Pediococcus acidilactici. The susceptibility toward antibiotics was determined in lactobacilli, lactococci and pediococci and also in Escherichia coli for comparison. Analysis of L. fermentum and pediococci revealed the presence of non-wild-type epidemiological cut-offs in streptomycin, clindamycin or gentamicin. E. coli were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin and florfenicol. No extended spectrum beta-lactamases were detected.
TI  - A survey of the bacterial composition of kurut from Tibet using a culture-independent approach.
AB  - Kurut (fermented yak milk) made by natural fermentation is a very important dairy food for the local people in Tibet (China). It is important to fully understand the bacterial composition of kurut for quality improvement and industrial production. Because more than 99% of prokaryotes cannot be cultured and identified by methods currently used in taxonomy, we applied a culture-independent approach to explore the microbial biodiversity of this traditional food. In this study, a bacterial 16S rRNA gene clone library, including 460 clones, was constructed using total DNA extracted from 30 samples of kurut. After screening by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, 56 operational taxonomic units (OTU) with unique RFLP patterns were obtained. Then, 1 representative sequence of every OTU was sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. The representative phylotypes were affiliated with 5 groups, including Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus helveticus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and Acetobacter. In addition, nearly one-third of the representative clones (132 clones) had low similarity to species in GenBank (<97%), and these phylotypes were regarded as unknown bacteria. The characteristics of kurut are determined not only by lactic acid bacteria well known by the culture-dependent approach but also by bacteria that have not yet been identified.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of different lactic acid bacteria strains.
AB  - Five lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains belonging to species Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus were tested for their susceptibility to 27 antibiotics. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of each antimicrobial were determined using a microdilution test. Among the strains a high susceptibility was detected for most of the cell-wall synthesis inhibitors (penicillins, cefoxitin and vancomycin) and resistance toward inhibitors of DNA synthesis (trimethoprim/sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones). Generally, the Lactobacillus strains were inhibited by antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, erythromycin and tetracycline at breakpoint levels lower or equal to the levels defined by the European Food Safety Authority. Despite the very similar profile of S. thermophilus LC201 to lactobacilli, the detection of resistance toward erythromycin necessitates the performance of additional tests in order to prove the absence of transferable resistance genes.
TI  - The investigation of probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional Mongolian dairy products.
AB  - The aims of this study were to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  (LAB) isolated from traditional Mongolian dairy products, and to estimate the probiotic potential of the isolated strains. We collected 66 samples of the traditional Mongolian dairy products tarag (n = 45), airag (n = 7), aaruul (n = 8), byasulag (n = 1) and eezgii (n = 5), from which 543 LAB strains were isolated and identified based on 16S ribosomal DNA sequence. The predominant species of those products were Lactobacillus (L.) delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, L. helveticus, L. fermentum, L. delbrueckii ssp. lactis and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. However, we could not detect any LAB strains from eezgii. All LAB isolates were screened for tolerance to low pH and to bile acid, gas production from glucose, and adherence to Caco-2 cells. In vitro, we found 10 strains possess probiotic properties, and almost identified them as L. plantarum or L. paracasei subspecies, based on 16S ribosomal DNA and carbohydrate fermentation pattern. These strains were differentiated from each other individually by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis. Additionally, it was notable that 6/10 strains were isolated from camel milk tarag from the Dornogovi province.
TI  - Characterization of the cysK2-ctl1-cysE2 gene cluster involved in sulfur metabolism in Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - The up- and downstream regions of ctl1 and ctl2 that encode a cystathionine lyase were analyzed in various Lactobacillus casei strains. ctl1 and ctl2 were found to be part of a gene cluster encoding two other open reading frames. One of the two open reading frames precedes ctl1 and encodes a putative cysteine synthase. The other open reading frame lies downstream of ctl1 and encodes a putative serine acetyltransferase. The gene cluster is not present in the publicly available genome sequences of L. casei ATCC 334, BL23 and Zhang. Apparently, the gene cluster was acquired by a horizontal gene transfer event and can also be found in other lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. RT-PCR was used to analyze the expression of the gene cluster. Additionally, an mass spectrometry-based selected reaction monitoring method was developed for quantifying Ctl1 in a cell-free extract of lactic acid bacteria. The gene cluster cysK2-ctl1-cysE2 was expressed as single transcript, and expression was down-regulated by cysteine. In addition, cystathionine lyase activity present in cell-free extracts disappeared when L. casei was grown in the presence of cysteine. Whereas the transcript and the gene product of ctl1 protein were found in all studied ctl1(+)L. casei strains, only the transcript but not the protein or cystathionine lyase activity was detected in L. helveticus FAM2888, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus ATCC 11842 and S. thermophilus FAM17014, which actually possess a homolog of the cysK2-ctl1-cysE2 gene cluster.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in Mongolia.
AB  - Spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in Mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. The objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in Mongolia. The LAB counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/mL. Fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of LAB, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. In total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar and M17 agar. Each isolate was considered to be presumptive LAB based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multiplex PCR assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. All isolates from Mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), Enterococcus durans (3 strains), Lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), Lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), Lactobacillus casei (16 strains), Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), Lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), Lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), Lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), Lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), Lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), Leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), Streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and Weissella cibaria (1 strain). The predominant LAB were Strep. thermophilus and Lb. helveticus, which were isolated from all sampling sites. The results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of Mongolia have complex compositions of LAB species. Such diversity of LAB provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.
TI  - Development of a pentaplex PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, L. helveticus, L. fermentum in whey starter for Grana Padano cheese.
AB  - A pentaplex PCR assay for the rapid, selective and simultaneous detection of Lactobacillus helveticus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and L. fermentum, was developed. The target sequences were a group of genes coding for beta-galactosidase production (S. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), for cell-enveloped associated proteinase synthesis (L. helveticus), for dipeptide transport system production (L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis) and for arginine-ornithine antiporter protein production (L. fermentum). The analytical specificity of the assay was evaluated with 5 reference strains and 140 lactic acid bacterial strains derived from raw milk cheeses and belonging to the Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Lactococcus and Enterococcus genera. The identification limit for each target strain was 10(3)CFU/ml. This new molecular assay was used to investigate the LAB population by direct extraction of DNA from the 12 whey cultures for Grana Padano. The pentaplex PCR assay revealed a good correspondence with microbiological analyses and allowed to identify even minor LAB community members which, can be out-competed in vitro by numerically more abundant microbial species.
TI  - Phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. However, the phylogenetic relationships among LAB species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. RESULTS: We performed a phylogenetic analysis of LAB species based on 232 genes from 28 LAB genome sequences. Regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. The LAB species examined were divided into two groups. Group 1 included families Enterococcaceae and Streptococcaceae. Group 2 included families Lactobacillaceae and Leuconostocaceae. Within Group 2, the LAB species were divided into two clades. One clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus Lactobacillus and two other species, Lb. sakei and Lb. casei. In the acidophilus complex, Lb. delbrueckii separated first, while Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus and Lb. gasseri/Lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. The other clade within Group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, Lb. salivarius, Lb. plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. reuteri, Lb. fermentum, and the genera Pediococcus, Oenococcus, and Leuconostoc. In this clade, Lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to Lb. plantarum/Lb. brevis pair and Pediococcus, and the other including Oenococcus/Leuconostoc pair and Lb. reuteri/Lb. fermentum pair. In addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be more useful than others. The genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (TRSB), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein B (uvrB), DNA polymerase III (polC) and penicillin binding protein 2B (pbpB). CONCLUSIONS: Our phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of LAB species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. We infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in LAB species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. Further analyses of more genes from additional, representative LAB species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of LAB species to various environmental niches.
TI  - [Classification of domestic probiotic cultures of Lactobacillus genus].
AB  - AIM: To study strains of bacteria from Lactobacillus genus using combination of microbiological and molecular biological methods in order to define more accurately their systematic position and biochemical characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen cultures of Lactobacillus bacteria isolated from stool of healthy persons were studied: L. plantarum CS 396, L. plantarum 8-PA-3, L. plantarum 421-2, L. fermentum 90-TC-4, L. delbrueckii gKNM 101, L. delbrueckii gKNM 526, L. acidophilus Er 317/402 NARINE, L. acidophilus 100 ash, L. acidophilus NK-1, L. acidophilus NNIE, L. acidophilus K3sh24, L. brevis gKNM 23 11, L. casei gKNM 577. Their enzymatic activity relative to 50 sugars was studied using API-50 system. Structure of proximal region of 16S rRNA gene was studied also. RESULTS: According to results of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis strains were divided on 2 groups: 1) L. casei gKNM 577, L. plantarum 8-PA-3, L. plantarum CS 396, which species belonging corresponded to stated description. Comparison of nucleotide sequence of 16S rRNA gene of group 2 strains with nucleotide sequences database revealed that cultures NK-1, Er315/402 NARINE, 100 ash, NNIE identified early as L. acidophilus belong to species L. helveticus; L. brevis gKNM 23 and L. acidophilus K3sh24--to group L. casei/paracasei, L. delbrueckii gKNM 101 and L. fermentum 90-TC-4--to L. plantarum, L. delbrueckii gKNM 526--to L. fermentum, and L. plantarum 421-2--to L. rhamnosus. CONCLUSION: Obtained data allowed to perform taxonomic reclassification of species belonging of studied probiotic cultures of lactobacilli according to modem level of systematic of bacteria.
TI  - The effect of selected microbial strains on internal milieu of broiler chickens after peroral administration.
AB  - The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of probiotic preparation with  multi-strains composition (Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus LAT 187, Lactobacillus acidophilus LAT 180, Lactobacillus helveticus LAT 179, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis LAT 182, Streptococcus thermophilus LAT 205 and Enterococcus faecium E 253) on internal milieu, antioxidant status and body weight of broiler chickens. Chickens were divided into three groups (C, control; E1 and E2, experimental groups). Experimental chickens received the probiotic preparation in drinking water. Probiotic preparation caused a significant increase of serum calcium and potassium content. In the group with higher dose of probiotic strains serum triglycerides level decreased. Total antioxidant status in groups with addition of probiotic strains showed higher values in comparison to control group. Serum albumin level was found to increase after consumption of probiotic preparation in group with higher dose of probiotic strains. Probiotic strains improved body weight in last observed weeks of feeding.
TI  - Effect of size, quaternary structure and translational error on the static and dynamic heterogeneity of beta-galactosidase and measurement of electrophoretic dynamic heterogeneity.
AB  - Single enzyme molecule assays were performed using capillary electrophoresis-based protocols on beta-galactosidase from Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus helveticus and Bacillus circulans. The enzyme was found to show static heterogeneity with respect to catalytic rate and the variance in rate increased with protein size. This is consistent with the proposal that random errors in translation may be an important underlying component of enzyme heterogeneity. Additionally these enzymes were found to show static heterogeneity with respect to electrophoretic mobility. Comparison of wild-type and rpsL E. coli beta-galactosidase expressed in the presence and absence of streptomycin suggested that increases in error do not result in detectable increases in the dynamic heterogeneity of activity with increasing temperature. Finally, a method was developed to measure the dynamic heterogeneity in electrophoretic mobility.
TI  - Characterization of a novel LysM domain from Lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The endolysin Lyb5, from Lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phiPYB5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative bacteria. Sequence analysis revealed that the C terminus of the endolysin Lyb5 (Ly5C) contained three putative lysin motif (LysM) repeat regions, implying that Ly5C was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. To investigate the potential of Ly5C for surface display, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to Ly5C at its N or C terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. After being mixed with various cells in vitro, GFP was successfully displayed on the surfaces of Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lb. brevis, Lb. plantarum, Lb. fermentum, Lb. delbrueckii, Lb. helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus cells. Increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated L. lactis and Lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for Ly5C. Moreover, the pH and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of GFP-Ly5C, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. All results suggested that Ly5C was a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (LAB). To demonstrate the applicability of the Ly5C-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) from Paenibacillus sp. strain K1, replacing GFP, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of LAB cells via Ly5C. The success in surface display of GFP and beta-Gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in LAB.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance of lactobacilli isolated from two italian hard cheeses.
AB  - One hundred forty-one lactobacilli strains isolated from natural whey starter cultures and ripened Grana Padano and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses were tested for their susceptibility to 13 antibiotics, in particular, penicillin G, ampicillin, amoxicillin, oxacillin, cephalotin, cefuroxime, vancomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin, co-trimoxazole, and nitrofurantoin. The strains belonged to the species Lactobacillus helveticus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, L. rhamnosus, and L. casei. The strains of the first two species were isolated from whey starter cultures, and the strains of the last two species were from the ripened cheeses. Significant differences among the strains in their antibiotic resistance were found in relation to the type of cheese and, especially, the strains from Parmigiano Reggiano were more resistant to gentamicin and penicillin G. The strains isolated in the ripened cheese were generally more resistant than those isolated from natural whey starter cultures; in particular, significant differences regarding oxacillin, vancomycin, cephalotin, and co-trimoxazole were observed. Finally, no significant difference in relation to the type of cheese was found among the thermophilic lactobacilli isolated from whey cultures, while the facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli isolated from Parmigiano Reggiano showed higher resistance toward gentamicin and penicillin G than did the same species isolated from Grana Padano.
TI  - Isolation of cultivable thermophilic lactic acid bacteria from cheeses made with  mesophilic starter and molecular comparison with dairy-related Lactobacillus helveticus strains.
AB  - AIMS: To isolate cultivable thermophilic lactic acid bacteria from cheeses made with mesophilic starter and compare them with dairy-related Lactobacillus helveticus strains using molecular typing methods. METHODS AND RESULTS: The number of thermophilic bacteria in seven commercial cheeses manufactured with mesophilic starters was estimated to be <10 CFU g(-1). Implementation of an enumeration step in the isolation method made it possible to isolate one thermophilic strain from each of five of seven cheeses. Comparing repetitive sequence PCR (rep-PCR) profiles of the isolates with dairy-related Lact. helveticus strains indicated that one isolate was a Lact. helveticus. Partial sequencing of 16S rRNA confirmed this, and the remaining four strains were identified as Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum and Enterococcus faecium. The rep-PCR profile of the isolated Lact. helveticus was identical to the rep-PCR profile of the Lact. helveticus adjunct culture used in the specific cheese, but their pulsed field gel electrophoresis profiles differed slightly. CONCLUSION: It was possible to isolate cultivable thermophilic bacteria from ripened cheeses manufactured with mesophilic starter and thermophilic adjunct cultures by using an enumeration step. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Isolation of cultivable thermophilic bacteria from ripened cheeses made with mesophilic starters offers an original source for new dairy-relevant cultures.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a strain-dependent cystathionine beta/gamma-lyase in Lactobacillus casei potentially involved in cysteine biosynthesis.
AB  - The trans-sulfuration pathways allow the interconversion of cysteine and methionine with the intermediary formation of cystathionine and homocysteine. The genome database of Lactobacillus casei ATCC 334 provides evidence that this species cannot synthesize cysteine from methionine via the trans-sulfuration pathway. However, several L. casei strains use methionine as the sole sulfur source, which implies that these strains can convert methionine to cysteine. Cystathionine synthases and lyases play a crucial role in the trans-sulfuration pathway. By applying proteomic techniques, we have identified a protein in cell-free extracts of L. casei, which showed high homology to a gene product encoded in the genome of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus but not in the genome of L. casei ATCC 334. The presence of the gene was only found in strains able to grow on methionine as the sole sulfur source. Moreover, two gene variants were identified. Both gene variants were cloned and expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzymes exhibited cystathionine lyase activity in vitro and also cleaved cysteine, homocysteine and methionine releasing volatile sulfur compounds.
TI  - A qualified presumption of safety approach for the safety assessment of Grana Padano whey starters.
AB  - A Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS) approach was applied to dominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) associated with Grana Padano cheese whey starters. Thirty-two strains belonging to Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus fermentum, and representing the overall genotypic LAB diversity associated with 24 previously collected whey starters [Rossetti, L., Fornasari, M.E., Gatti, M., Lazzi, C., Neviani, E., Giraffa, G., 2008. Grana Padano cheese whey starters: microbial composition and strain distribution. International Journal of Food Microbiology 127, 168-171], were analyzed. All L. helveticus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and S. thermophilus isolates were susceptible to four (i.e. vancomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and erythromycin) of the clinically most relevant antibiotics. One L. fermentum strain displayed phenotypic resistance to tetracycline (Tet(R)), with MIC of 32 microg/ml, and gentamycin (Gm(R)), with MIC of 32 microg/ml. PCR was applied to this strain to test the presence of genes tet(L), tet(M), tet(S), and aac(6')-aph(2')-Ia, which are involved in horizontal transfer of Tet(R) and Gm(R), respectively but no detectable amplification products were observed. According to QPS criteria, we conclude that Grana cheese whey starters do not present particular safety concerns.
TI  - Effects of copper supplement on growth and viability of strains used as starters  and adjunct cultures for Emmental cheese manufacture.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the effects of supplemented copper (Cu2+) on growth and viability of strains used as starters and adjunct cultures for Emmental cheese manufacture. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirteen strains belonging to Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Streptococcus thermophilus or Propionibacterium freudenreichii species were exposed to various copper concentrations in the proper growth medium at relevant growth temperatures, and the effects of supplemented copper on bacterial growth and cell viability were determined by optical density and pH measurements, also by platings. Among the species considered, L. delbrueckii was the most copper resistant and S. thermophilus the most sensitive to copper. Anaerobic conditions increased this sensitivity significantly. There was also a considerable amount of variation in copper resistance at strain level. CONCLUSIONS: Copper resistance is both a species- and strain-dependent property and may reflect variability in copper-binding capacities by cell wall components among species and strains. In addition, the chemical state of copper may be involved. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study revealed that copper resistance is a highly variable property among starter and adjunct strains, and this variability should be considered when strains are selected for Emmental cheese manufacture.
TI  - Multiple interactions between Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii strongly affect their growth kinetics during the making of hard cooked cheeses.
AB  - In hard cooked cheeses, any interactions between the thermophilic starters as they grow during the cheese-making are critical, since they modify bacterial growth kinetics and acidification kinetics, so affecting the ripening process and the final characteristics of the cheese. Twenty-four experimental hard cooked cheeses were made under controlled conditions, the milk being inoculated with various combinations of thermophilic strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii. Over the first day of manufacturing we recorded a wide range of different growth kinetics for each starter species used, and a wide range of pH kinetics, depending on the starter combination. Most of the bacterial variability could be statistically explained by the nature, quantity, and/or presence or absence of the different strains inoculated. Four main interactions between the three species were evidenced during cheese-making. There was antagonism between L. helveticus and L. delbrueckii. The lactobacilli had a positive effect on S. thermophilus, which was reciprocal for L. helveticus. L. helveticus had a negative effect on S. thermophilus cultivability. And the combination of S. thermophilus inoculated in large quantities and L. helveticus strain H2 had a negative effect on the growth of the L. delbrueckii strain D2. While the positive effect of L. delbrueckii on S. thermophilus probably corresponds to interactions in milk that have already been described and published, the other interactions were hitherto unknown. These interactions are of major importance for the growth kinetics of streptococci and thermophilic lactobacilli during cheese-making.
TI  - Grana Padano cheese whey starters: microbial composition and strain distribution.
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the species composition and the genotypic strain heterogeneity of dominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from whey starter cultures used to manufacture Grana Padano cheese. Twenty-four Grana Padano cheese whey starters collected from dairies located over a wide geographic production area in the north of Italy were analyzed. Total thermophilic LAB streptococci and lactobacilli were quantified by agar plate counting. Population structure of the dominant and metabolically active LAB species present in the starters was profiled by reverse transcriptase, length heterogeneity-PCR (RT-LH-PCR), a culture-independent technique successfully applied to study whey starter ecosystems. The dominant bacterial species were Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus fermentum. Diversity in the species composition allowed the whey cultures to be grouped into four main typologies, the one containing L. helveticus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and S. thermophilus being the most frequent one (45% of the cultures analyzed), followed by that containing only the two lactobacilli (40%). Only a minor fraction of the cultures contained L. helveticus alone (4%) or all the four LAB species (11%). Five hundred and twelve strains were isolated from the 24 cultures and identified by M13-PCR fingerprinting coupled with 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Most of the strains were L. helveticus (190 strains; 37% of the total), L delbrueckii subsp. lactis (90 strains; 18%) and S. thermophilus (215 strains; 42%). This result was in good agreement with the qualitative whey starter composition observed by RT-LH-PCR. M13-PCR fingerprinting indicated a markedly low infra-species diversity, i.e. the same biotypes were often found in more than one culture. The distribution of the biotypes into the different cultures was mainly dairy plant-specific rather than correlated with the different production areas.
TI  - Molecular methods for identification of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus using methionine biosynthesis and 16S rRNA genes.
AB  - Yoghurt and starter culture producers are still searching strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus to produce healthier yogurt with longer shelf life, better texture, taste and quality. However, selective identification of Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus from a mixed population using microbiological and biochemical methods is difficult, time consuming and may not be accurate. In this study, a quick, sensitive and accurate method is proposed to identify both Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus using PCR. The method is comprised of two parts. In the first part, methionine biosynthesis genes, known to be present in both species were partially amplified by designed primers (cysmet2F and cysmet2R). Partial amplification of the methionine biosynthesis gene which gives 700 bp fragment resulted in selective identification of Lb. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus. All 16 Lb. bulgaricus and 6 Strep. thermophilus isolates assessed by this method gave the expected amplification. On the other hand, further analysis of other closely related species with the same primers have indicated that the same product was also amplified in two more lactobacilli namely, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lb. helveticus species. Thus, in the second part of the method, further differentiation of Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus from each other and these species was achieved using restriction analysis of 16S rRNA gene with EcoRI.
TI  - Selection and use of autochthonous multiple strain cultures for the manufacture of high-moisture traditional Mozzarella cheese.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum 18A, Lactobacillus helveticus 2B, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis 20F, Streptococcus thermophilus 22C, Enterococcus faecalis 32C and Enterococcus durans 16E were the most acidifying strains within 146 isolates for natural whey starters. The effect of media and temperature on 2 autochthonous multiple strain cultures (AMSI: 18A, 2B, 20F and 22C, 32C and 16E and AMSII: 18A, 2B, 20F and 22C) was studied. Genomic analysis showed a constant cell numbers for AMSII during 16 days of propagation in whey milk. Mozzarella cheese was made by using AMSII, commercial starter (CS) or citric acid (DA). Compared to other cheeses, the DA had a lower level of protein, ash, Ca, free amino acids and a higher level of moisture. Based on confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis, AMSII cheese showed the lowest microstructural variations during the period of storage compared to other cheeses. All the sensory attributes were scored highest for AMSII cheese. ASMII extend the shelf-life to ca. 12-15 days instead of the 5-7 days of traditional high-moisture Mozzarella cheese.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria population in ripened Parmigiano Reggiano cheese.
AB  - The diversity of dominant lactic acid bacteria population in 12 months ripened Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses was investigated by a polyphasic approach including culture-dependent and independent methods. Traditional plating, isolation of LAB and identification by 16S rDNA analysis showed that strains belonging to Lactobacillus casei group were the most frequently isolated. Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus parabuchneri, and Lactobacillus buchneri species were detected with lower frequency. PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) applied to DNA extracted directly from cheese samples and sequencing of rDNA amplicons confirmed the complex microbiological pattern of LAB in ripened Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses, with the significant exception of the Lactobacillus fermentum species, which dominated in several samples, but was not detected by cultivation. The present combination of different approaches can effectively describe the lactic acid bacteria population of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese in advanced stages of ripening, giving useful information for elucidating the role of LAB in determining the final cheese quality.
TI  - Microbial diversity in natural whey cultures used for the production of Caciocavallo Silano PDO cheese.
AB  - The microbial diversity of sixty-three Natural Whey Cultures (NWCs) for the manufacture of Caciocavallo Silano cheese PDO was studied. The NWCs were collected from different dairies covering the whole territory of PDO production including five different regions of southern Italy. The microbial species diversity was determined by direct DNA extraction from NWCs and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification of variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). DGGE and DHPLC fingerprinting yielded the same results in terms of number of bands/peaks and specific migration/retention time of the amplicons. The DHPLC technique was used in this study for the first time to assess a food-related mixed microbial community by a culture-independent approach and proved to be at least as effective as DGGE in profiling species diversity in NWCs. Cluster analysis of DGGE and DHPLC data revealed that the species-related groups of similarity were not dependent on the geographical origin of the NWCs. The presence of three groups of 10-14 NWCs at 100% of species similarity indicated that some species associations are very commonly occurring in the NWCs for Caciocavallo Silano cheese PDO. A RAPD-PCR analysis of the NWCs was also performed for the members of the above groups and it showed that, though characterized by the same species diversity, most of the identical NWCs included different biotypes. The sequences of DGGE bands and DHPLC peaks revealed the occurrence of mainly thermophilic lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus delbrueckii, L. helveticus and Streptococcus thermophilus even though the mesophilic Lactococcus lactis also occurred in some NWCs. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the microbial diversity of NWCs used for the Caciocavallo Silano PDO cheese is not high, it is not dependent on the geographical origin and the same microbial species occur within the territory examined. The microbiota of fermented PDO products and its possible link with territory should be studied case by case in order to have useful evidences for the assessment of product quality and authenticity.
TI  - Diversity and dynamics of lactobacilli populations during ripening of RDO Camembert cheese.
AB  - The diversity and dynamics of Lactobacillus populations in traditional raw milk Camembert cheese were monitored throughout the manufacturing process in 3 dairies. Culture-dependent analysis was carried out on isolates grown on acidified de Man - Rogosa - Sharpe agar and Lactobacillus anaerobic de Man Rogosa Sharpe agar supplemented with vancomycin and bromocresol green media. The isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction - temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-TGGE) and (or) species-specific PCR and (or) sequencing, and Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactobacillus plantarum isolates were characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Milk and cheese were subjected to culture-independent analysis by PCR-TGGE. Presumed lactobacilli were detected by plate counts throughout the ripening process. However, molecular analysis of total DNA and DNA of isolates failed to detect Lactobacillus spp. in certain cases. The dominant species in the 3 dairies was L. paracasei. PFGE analysis revealed 21 different profiles among 39 L. paracasei isolates. Lactobacillus plantarum was the second most isolated species, but it occurred nearly exclusively in one dairy. The other species isolated were Lactobacillus parabuchneri, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, a Lactobacillus psittaci/delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus/gallinarum/crispatus group, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus kefiri, and Lactobacillus perolens. Lactobacilli diversity at the strain level was high. Dynamics varied among dairies, and each cheese exhibited a specific picture of species and strains.
TI  - Whey starter for Grana Padano cheese: effect of technological parameters on viability and composition of the microbial community.
AB  - This work aimed to investigate the effects of thermal treatments and yeast extract addition on the composition of the microbial community of natural whey starters for Grana Padano cheese. Different natural whey starter samples were held at 4 degrees C for 24 h (cooling treatment), or at -20 degrees C for 24 h (freezing treatment) to evaluate the possibility of conservation, or at 54 degrees C for 1 h (heat treatment) to evaluate the effect of the temperature commonly used during curd cooking. Separately, another set of samples was enriched with 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0% (wt/vol) of yeast extract to study its effect on the growth of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the starter. The new approach in this study is the use of 2 culture-independent methods: length heterogeneity (LH)-reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and fluorescence microscopy. These techniques allowed us to easily, quickly, and reproducibly assess metabolically active LAB in the control and treated samples. The LH-RT-PCR technique distinguished microorganisms based on natural variations in the length of 16S rRNA amplified by RT-PCR, as analyzed by using an automatic gene sequencer. Fluorescence microscopy counts were performed by using a Live/Dead BacLight bacterial viability kit. The repeatability of LH-RT-PCR showed that this technique has great potential to reveal changes in the microbial community of natural whey starters for Grana Padano cheese. All species showed low sensitivity to cold (4 degrees C). However, after the freezing (-20 degrees C) and heating (54 degrees C) treatments, different behaviors of the species were reported, with significant changes in their viability and relative composition. Heating treatment during curd cooking profoundly affected the viability and composition of the community that remained in the cheese and that consequently modified the microbial population. At the same time, this treatment produced the selection of LAB in whey and could be considered as the first step in natural whey starter production. Addition of yeast extract stimulated the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis to the detriment of Lactobacillus helveticus species. Because the yeast extract altered the microflora balance, whey starter conservation at -20 degrees C and yeast extract addition cannot be suggested as technological innovations.
TI  - Lactic acid production by mixed cultures of Kluyveromyces marxianus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  - Lactic acid production using Kluyveromyces marxianus (IFO 288), Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (ATCC 11842) and Lactobacillus helveticus (ATCC 15009) individually or as mixed culture on cheese whey in stirred or static fermentation conditions was evaluated. Lactic acid production, residual sugar and cell biomass were the main features examined. Increased lactic acid production was observed, when mixed cultures were used in comparison to individual ones. The highest lactic acid concentrations were achieved when K. marxianus yeast was combined with L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and when all the strains were used revealing possible synergistic effects between the yeast and the two lactic acid bacteria. The same synergistic effects were further observed and verified when the mixed cultures were applied in sourdough fermentations, proving that the above microbiological system could be applied in the food fermentations where high lactic acid production is sought.
TI  - Redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from traditional Italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Pediococcus pentosaceus. It was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential before the lactobacilli. The reduction rate of Enterococcus spp. and L. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and Lactobacillus spp. All the P. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The reduction aptitude of strains might be used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.
TI  - Evaluation in vitro of the antagonistic substances produced by Lactobacillus spp. isolated from chickens.
AB  - To determine the inhibitory capacity of lactic acid bacteria due to the action of antagonistic substances, we tested 474 isolates of Lactobacillus from the crop and cecum of chickens against gram-positive and gram-negative indicator microorganisms by the spot-on-the-lawn and well-diffusion antagonism methods. Of the 474 isolates, 265 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the indicator microorganisms. Isolates identified as L. reuteri, L. salivarius, or Lactobacillus spp. inhibited Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella spp. but not L. casei, L. delbrueckii, L. fermentum, or L. helveticus by the well-diffusion simultaneous antagonism method under anaerobic incubation conditions. The antagonistic substances produced by some of the Lactobacillus isolates were inactivated after treatment by proteolytic enzymes, which suggested that the substances could be antimicrobial peptides or bacteriocins.
TI  - Diversity and mechanisms of alkali tolerance in lactobacilli.
AB  - We determined the maximum pH that allows growth (pHmax) for 34 strains of lactobacilli. High alkali tolerance was exhibited by strains of Lactobacillus casei, L. paracasei subsp. tolerans, L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, L. curvatus, L. pentosus, and L. plantarum that originated from plant material, with pHmax values between 8.5 and 8.9. Among these, L. casei NRIC 1917 and L. paracasei subsp. tolerans NRIC 1940 showed the highest pHmax, at 8.9. Digestive tract isolates of L. gasseri, L. johnsonii, L. reuteri, L. salivarius subsp. salicinius, and L. salivarius subsp. salivarius exhibited moderate alkali tolerance, with pHmax values between 8.1 and 8.5. Dairy isolates of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and L. helveticus exhibited no alkali tolerance, with pHmax values between 6.7 and 7.1. Measurement of the internal pH of representative strains revealed the formation of transmembrane proton gradients (DeltapH) in a reversed direction (i.e., acidic interior) at alkaline external-pH ranges, regardless of their degrees of alkali tolerance. Thus, the reversed DeltapH did not determine alkali tolerance diversity. However, the DeltapH contributed to alkali tolerance, as the pHmax values of several strains decreased with the addition of nigericin, which dissipates DeltapH. Although neutral external-pH values resulted in the highest glycolysis activity in the presence of nigericin regardless of alkali tolerance, substantial glucose utilization was still detected in the alkali-tolerant strains, even in a pH range of between 8.0 and 8.5, at which the remaining strains lost most activity. Therefore, the alkali tolerance of glycolysis reactions contributes greatly to the determination of alkali tolerance diversity.
TI  - Characterization of dominant microbiota of a Ghanaian fermented milk product, nyarmie, by culture- and nonculture-based methods.
AB  - AIMS: To characterize the predominant micro-organisms in a Ghanaian traditional fermented dairy product, nyarmie, made from cows' milk, using both culture- and nonculture-based methods. METHODS AND RESULTS: Samples of nyarmie were analysed from three production sites in Accra, by determining the counts on selective culture media. The microbial diversity occurring in nyarmie was also evaluated by 16S/18S ribosomal DNA PCR amplification and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Results showed that nyarmie contained lactococci and lactobacilli in the range of 10(8) and 10(10) CFU ml(-1), respectively, and yeasts at around 10(7) CFU ml(-1). The pH ranged between 3.49 and 4.25. The predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in nyarmie were Leuconostocmesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lact.helveticus, Lact. delbrueckii ssp. lactis and Lactococcus lactis, while Saccharomyces cerevisiae was the predominant yeast species. Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. delbrueckii was not detected by cultivation but its predominance was revealed by PCR-DGGE analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The flora in products from different producers varied in the LAB composition present and may result in variations in product quality. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Development and use of starter cultures for nyarmie may be beneficial in improving the consistency of product quality.
TI  - Effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  - Fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. In this study, three sourdough yeasts, Candida milleri CBS 8195, Saccharomyces cerevisiae TS 146, and Torulaspora delbrueckii TS 207; a control, baker's yeast S. cerevisiae ALKO 743; and four Lactobacillus spp., L. acidophilus TSB 262, L. brevis TSB 307, L. plantarum TSB 304, and L. sanfranciscensis TSB 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. The microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. Total folate contents were determined using Lactobacillus rhamnosus (ATCC 7469) as the growth indicator organism. The microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. Yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. Strains of Lactobacillus bulgaricus, L. casei, L. curvatus, L. fermentum, L. helveticus, Pediococcus spp., and Streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. Although the four Lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal. It was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. Fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. Two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as Enterobacter cowanii and Pantoea agglomerans.
TI  - Rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by M13-generated, RAPD-PCR fingerprint databases.
AB  - About a thousand lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific PCR and RAPD-PCR, respectively. RAPD-PCR profiles, which were obtained by using the M13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by BioNumerics software. Cluster analysis of the combined RAPD-PCR fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library, which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. A library unit, in this case, can be considered to be a definable taxon. The strains belonged to 11 main RAPD-PCR fingerprinting library units identified as Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis. The possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. The proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful LAB strain collection. The same approach could also be applied to identify LAB strains isolated from other food ecosystems.
TI  - Ability of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria to produce aroma compounds from amino acids.
AB  - Although a large number of key odorants of Swiss-type cheese result from amino acid catabolism, the amino acid catabolic pathways in the bacteria present in these cheeses are not well known. In this study, we compared the in vitro abilities of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus to produce aroma compounds from three amino acids, leucine, phenylalanine, and methionine, under mid-pH conditions of cheese ripening (pH 5.5), and we investigated the catabolic pathways used by these bacteria. In the three lactic acid bacterial species, amino acid catabolism was initiated by a transamination step, which requires the presence of an alpha-keto acid such as alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) as the amino group acceptor, and produced alpha-keto acids. Only S. thermophilus exhibited glutamate dehydrogenase activity, which produces alpha-KG from glutamate, and consequently only S. thermophilus was capable of catabolizing amino acids in the reaction medium without alpha-KG addition. In the presence of alpha-KG, lactobacilli produced much more varied aroma compounds such as acids, aldehydes, and alcohols than S. thermophilus, which mainly produced alpha-keto acids and a small amount of hydroxy acids and acids. L. helveticus mainly produced acids from phenylalanine and leucine, while L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis produced larger amounts of alcohols and/or aldehydes. Formation of aldehydes, alcohols, and acids from alpha-keto acids by L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis mainly results from the action of an alpha-keto acid decarboxylase, which produces aldehydes that are then oxidized or reduced to acids or alcohols. In contrast, the enzyme involved in the alpha-keto acid conversion to acids in L. helveticus and S. thermophilus is an alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase that produces acyl coenzymes A.
TI  - Use of RAPD-PCR and TTGE for the evaluation of biodiversity of whey cultures for  Grana Padano cheese.
AB  - AIMS: This work was carried out in order to evaluate the microbial diversity of whey cultures collected from different Grana Padano cheese plants in Veneto region (north-east Italy) by means of RAPD-PCR and Temporal Temperature Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (TTGE) analysis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lactobacillus helveticus was the dominant species among isolated thermophilic lactobacilli. RAPD-PCR with primers M13 and D8635 resulted a suitable method for typing Lact. helveticus at strain level. Thirteen different Lact. helveticus biotypes were detected in the seven whey cultures studied with one biotype present in all the whey cultures. Besides Lact. helveticus, Lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis was the main microbial species detected by TTGE. CONCLUSIONS: RAPD-PCR resulted very useful in studying Lact. helveticus biodiversity; furthermore, TTGE analysis allowed to detect the dominant thermophilic microflora characteristic of Grana Padano cheese whey cultures. IMPACT OF THE STUDY: By the combined used of RAPD-PCR and TTGE it could be possible to follow the behaviour in strain or species composition of whey cultures during time.
TI  - Changes in galactose and lactic acid content of sweet whey during storage.
AB  - Whey is often stored or transported for a period of time prior to processing. During this time period, galactose and lactic acid concentrations may accumulate, reducing the quality of spray-dried whey powders in regard to stickiness and agglomeration. This study surveyed industry samples of Cheddar and mozzarella cheese whey streams to determine how galactose and lactic acid concentrations changed with storage at appropriate (4 degrees C) and abuse (37.8 degrees C) temperatures. Samples stored at 4 degrees C did not exhibit significant increases in levels of lactic acid or galactose. Mozzarella whey accumulated the greatest amount of galactose and lactic acid with storage at 37.8 degrees C. Whey samples derived from cheese made from single strains of starter culture were also evaluated to determine each culture's contribution to galactose and lactic acid production. Starter cultures evaluated included Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. Whey derived from L. helveticus accumulated a significantly greater amount of lactic acid upon storage at 37.8 degrees C as compared with the other cultures. Galactose accumulation was significantly decreased in whey from L. lactis ssp. lactis stored at 37.8 degrees C in comparison with the other cultures. Results from this study indicate that proper storage conditions (4 degrees C) for whey prevent accumulation of galactose and lactic acid while the extent of accumulation during storage at 37.8 degrees C varies depending on the culture(s) used in cheese production.
TI  - Evaluation of bacterial communities belonging to natural whey starters for Grana  Padano cheese by length heterogeneity-PCR.
AB  - AIMS: To detect bacteria present in controlled dairy ecosystems with defined composition by length-heterogeneity (LH)-PCR. LH-PCR allows to distinguish different organisms on the basis of natural variations in the length of 16S rRNA gene sequences. METHODS AND RESULTS: LH-PCR was applied to depict population structure of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species recoverable from Grana Padano cheese whey starters. Typical bacterial species present in the LAB community were evidenced and well discriminated. Small differences in species composition, e.g. the frequent finding of Streptococcus thermophilus and the constant presence of thermophilic lactobacilli (Lactobacillus helveticus, Lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis/bulgaricus and Lact. fermentum) were reliably highlighted. Specificity of LH-PCR was confirmed by species-specific PCR from total DNA of the cultures. CONCLUSIONS: LH-PCR is a useful tool to monitor microbial composition and population dynamics in dairy starter cultures. When present, non-dominant bacterial species present in the whey starters, such as Strep. thermophilus, can easily be visualized and characterized without isolating and cultivating single strains. A similar approach can be applied to more complex dairy ecosystems such as milk or cheese curd. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Community members and differences in population structure of controlled dairy ecosystems such as whey starters for hard cheeses can be evaluated and compared in a relative easy, fast, reliable and highly reproducible way.
TI  - Peptidase activity in various species of dairy thermophilic lactobacilli.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the present work was to evaluate the enzymatic potential manifested by aminopeptidase activity of different thermophilic Lactobacillus biotypes and to measure the influence of cell growth phase on enzyme expression. METHODS AND RESULTS: The activities were evaluated by the hydrolysis of beta-naphthylamide substrates for both whole and mechanically disrupted cells of L. helveticus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis strains, collected from both the exponential and the stationary growth phase. In general, activities were higher for cells in the exponential rather than in the stationary phase and the disrupted cells showed higher activities than the whole cells. The highest activity expressed by all strains corresponded to X-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidase while a moderate activity was observed towards Arg-betaNa, Lys-betaNa and Leu-betaNa. The lowest activity was observed for Pro-betaNa. CONCLUSIONS: It may be inferred that the cell structure and the cell physiology are crucial to define the level of efficiency of expression for aminopeptidase activity. The two species may be characterized by a different enzymatic system that hydrolyses N-terminal leucine. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The differences of peptidase activities in L. helveticus and L. delbrueckii species acquires an importance to comprehend their role in the biochemical events occurring in cheese ripening.
TI  - Lactobacillus kitasatonis sp. nov., from chicken intestine.
AB  - Four strains isolated from chicken small intestine and strains JCM 1038 and JCM 1039 (designated as Lactobacillus acidophilus) were characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. They were Gram-positive, catalase-negative, facultatively anaerobic rods that did not produce gas from glucose. These strains had similar phenotypic characteristics and exhibited intergroup DNA relatedness values of >77 %, indicating that they comprised a single species. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of a representative strain, JCM 1039(T) (designated as type strain in this study), was determined and aligned with those of other Lactobacillus species. JCM 1039(T) was placed in the Lactobacillus delbrueckii cluster of the genus Lactobacillus on the basis of phylogenetic analysis and formed an independent cluster that was distinct from its closest neighbours, Lactobacillus amylovorus, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus gallinarum, L. acidophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus. Results of DNA-DNA hybridization experiments and whole-cell protein profiles clearly indicated that these strains represent a novel Lactobacillus species, for which the name Lactobacillus kitasatonis sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain of this species is JCM 1039(T).
TI  - Three new insertion sequence elements ISLdl2, ISLdl3, and ISLdl4 in Lactobacillus delbrueckii: isolation, molecular characterization, and potential use for strain identification.
AB  - A group of new insertion sequence (IS) elements, ISLdl2, ISLdl3, and ISLdl4, from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis ATCC 15808 was isolated, characterized, and used for strain identification together with ISLdl1, recently characterized as an L. delbrueckii IS element belonging to the ISL3 family. ISLdl2 was 1367 bp in size and had a 24 bp IR and an 8 bp DR. The single ORF of ISLdl2 encoded a protein of 392 aa similar to transposases of the IS256 family. ISLdl3 had a single ORF encoding a protein of 343 aa similar to transposases of the IS30 family. Finally, ISLdl4 had a single ORF encoding a protein of 406 aa and displayed homology to the transposases of the IS110 family. ISLdl4 was only slight different from ISL4 (Accession No. AY040213). ISLdl1, ISLdl2, and ISLdl4 were present in all of the 10 L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis and subsp. delbrueckii strains tested, as well as in three of the 11 L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains tested. ISLdl3 was present only in four closely related strains of L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis. These IS elements were not observed in Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, or Lactobacillus plantarum. A cluster of IS elements, ISLdl1, ISLdl2, ISLdl3, ISLdl4, and ISL6, was observed in L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis strain ATCC 15808. Within this cluster, ISLdl4 was inserted into ISLdl1 between the left IR and the start codon of ORF455, encoding a putative transposase. Most of the integration sites of the IS elements were strain-specific. We have observed that IS elements can migrate from one strain to another as integral parts of bacterial DNA by using phage LL-H as a vehicle. We demonstrate for the first time that inverse PCR and vectorette PCR methods with primers based on sequences of the IS elements could be used for identification of L. delbrueckii strains.
TI  - Autolytic activity and pediocin-induced lysis in Pediococcus acidilactici and Pediococcus pentosaceus strains.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the autolytic phenotype of Pediococcus acidilactici and P. pentosaceus, the peptidoglycan hydrolases content and the effect of pediocin AcH/PA-1 and autolysins on cell lysis. METHODS AND RESULTS: The autolytic phenotype of Pediococcus strains was evaluated under starvation conditions in potassium phosphate buffer. The strains tested showed an extent of autolysis ranging between 40 and 90% after 48 h of starvation at 37 degrees C. Peptidoglycan hydrolase content was evaluated by renaturing sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using cells of Micrococcus lysodeikticus as a target for the enzymatic activity and a major activity band migrating at about 116 kDa was detected. Additional secondary lytic bands migrating in a range of molecular weight between 45 and 110 kDa were also detected. The lytic activity, evaluated in the presence of different chemicals, was retained in 15 mM CaCl2 and in a range of pH between 5 and 9.5 but was strongly reduced in presence of 8% NaCl and in the presence of protease inhibitors. The substrate specificity of peptidoglycan hydrolases of Pediococcus strains was evaluated in renaturing SDS-PAGE incorporating cells of different bacterial species. Lytic activity was detected against cells of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Listeria monocytogenes. The interaction between pediocin AcH/PA-1 and autolysis was evaluated and a relevant effect of bacteriocin in cell-induced lysis was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The autolytic phenotype is widely distributed among P. acidilactici and P. pentosaceus and the rate of autolysis is high in the majority of the analysed strains. Several autolytic bands, detected by renaturing SDS-PAGE, retained their activity against several lactic acid bacteria and L. monocytogenes. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The characterization of the autolytic phenotype of Pediococcus acidilactici and P. pentosaceus strains should expand the knowledge of their role in fermentation processes where these species occur as primary or secondary bacterial population.
TI  - Exopolysaccharides produced by lactic acid bacteria of kefir grains.
AB  - A Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus HP1 strain with high exopolysaccharide activity was selected from among 40 strains of lactic acid bacteria, isolated from kefir grains. By associating the Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus HP1 strain with Streptococcus thermophilus T15, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis C15, Lactobacillus helveticus MP12, and Sacharomyces cerevisiae A13, a kefir starter was formed. The associated cultivation of the lactobacteria and yeast had a positive effect on the exopolysaccharide activity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus HP1. The maximum exopolysaccharide concentration of the starter culture exceeded the one by the Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus HP1 monoculture by approximately 1.7 times, and the time needed to reach the maximum concentration (824.3 mg exopolysacharides/l) was shortened by 6 h. The monomer composition of the exopolysaccharides from the kefir starter culture was represented by glucose and galactose in a 1.0:0.94 ratio, which proves that the polymer synthesized is kefiran.
TI  - Production of pyroglutamic acid by thermophilic lactic acid bacteria in hard-cooked mini-cheeses.
AB  - Pyroglutamic acid is present in high amounts (0.5g/ 100g) in many cheese varieties-and particularly in extensively ripened Italian cheeses such as Grana Padano and Parmigiano Reggiano. An in vivo model system for cooked mini-cheese production and ripening acceleration was set up to demonstrate the ability of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria, used as a starter, to produce pyroglutamic acid (pGlu). In mini-cheeses stored at 38 and 30 degrees C for up to 45 d, all starters tested produced different amounts of pGlu. In descending order of pGlu production, the bacteria analyzed were: Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis. Evidence for the presence of glutamine to pGlu cyclase activity in lactic acid bacteria was provided. Cell lysates obtained from cultures of L. helveticus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and S. thermophilus showed the ability to cyclize glutamine to pGlu, resulting in processing yields from 1.4 to 30.3%, depending on the subspecies. Formation of pGlu from free glutamine appeared to be similar to that observed using a glutamine-glutamine dipeptide substrate. Under the experimental conditions applied, pGlu aminopeptidase activity was only detected in L. helveticus. Thus, pGlu formation in long-ripened cooked cheese may depend on the activity of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Modulation of the cell-surface proteinase activity of thermophilic lactobacilli by the Peptide supply.
AB  - The proteolytic system of thermophilic lactobacilli is considered important for bacterial nutrition as well as for the formation of flavor and texture in fermented products. We investigated the influence of peptide content on the cell surface proteinase and intracellular aminopeptidase activities from seven thermophilic lactobacilli strains. The proteinase activities were remarkably reduced in cells grown in the peptide-rich medium MRS or in a chemically defined medium supplemented with Casitone compared with those found in a synthetic medium. The degree of inhibition observed was strain dependent. When proteinase activities were analyzed by their hydrolytic patterns of alpha- and beta-casein degradation, four types of P(III)-caseinolytic cleavage specificity were distinguished. Lactobacillus helveticus strains possessed aminopeptidase activities with broader specificity than those found in L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis strains. However, the aminopeptidase activities were not influenced by the peptide content of the medium.
TI  - Differentiation of Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus, subsp lactis and subsp delbrueckii using physiological and genetic tools and reclassification of some strains from the ATCC collection.
AB  - Several physiological tests of glucose metabolism and genetic tools including species specific probes and 16S rDNA sequences were used to identify strains of L. helveticus and the group of L. delbrueckii with its three subspecies lactis, bulgaricus, and delbrueckii. These species are important for the milk industry as fermenting lactic acid bacteria. The identification procedure was applied to the different strains of these species available from the ATCC collection and allowed to reclassify part of them.
TI  - Use of PCR-based methods and PFGE for typing and monitoring homofermentative lactobacilli during Comte cheese ripening.
AB  - This study investigated the genotypic characteristics of selected and wild homofermentative thermophilic lactobacilli strains during ripening of Comte cheeses, made into two cheese plants. Both amplification and restriction analysis of the 16S rRNA gene (PCR-ARDRA) and classical biochemical tests were used to identify isolates. Diversity within homofermentative lactobacilli was not found in their species composition since the same two species Lactobacillus helveticus and L. delbrueckii susbp. lactis were isolated from cheeses. In cheeses made with natural whey starter, it appeared that the most likely sources of L. helveticus and L. delbrueckii susbp. lactis were the starter and raw milk, respectively. The examination of RAPD profiles of lactobacilli strains revealed 19 RAPD groups among 50 isolates, which were different from selected starter strains. Using RAPD, REP-PCR, and PFGE to identify selected starter strains during cheese ripening, we showed that L. helveticus decreased quickly while L. delbrueckii susbp. lactis sustained high viability during ripening. The use of selected L. delbrueckii susbp. lactis strains diminished the genetic diversity among strains isolated from cheese, probably in preventing the raw milk microflora from growing.
TI  - Diversity in specificity of the extracellular proteinases in Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the diversity in specificity of cell-bound extracellular proteinases in Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. METHODS AND RESULTS: HPLC analysis of whole-cell preparations of 14 Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and eight Lact. helveticus strains incubated with alpha (s1)-casein (f 1-23) detected at least six distinct proteolytic patterns. Differences between groups were found in both the primary and secondary specificity toward alpha(s1)-casein (f 1-23) and its breakdown products. No correlation was found between the o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) general proteolysis analysis and alpha(s1)-casein (f 1-23) cleavage profiles. CONCLUSIONS, SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: Using the alpha(s1)-CN (f 1-23) method, six patterns of proteolysis were found in the dairy lactobacilli tested. Understanding the influence of Lactobacillus proteinase specificity on casein degradation should facilitate efforts to develop starter cultures that predictably improve the functional properties of Mozzarella cheese.
TI  - Autolytic phenotype of Lactococcus lactis strains isolated from traditional Tunisian dairy products.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the autolytic properties of Lactococcus lactis strains isolated from artisan Tunisian dairy products, their peptidoglycan hydrolase content and their activity spectrum. METHODS AND RESULTS: The autolytic phenotype of Lactococcus strains was evaluated under starvation conditions in potassium phosphate buffer. The results obtained highlighted a high degree of diversity among the strains analysed, allowing the identification of high and low autolytic Lactococcus lactis strains. Peptidoglycan hydrolase content was evaluated by renaturing SDS-PAGE using cells of Micrococcus lysodeikticus as a target for the enzymatic activity. A major activity band migrating at about 45 kDa was observed. The lytic activity, evaluated in the presence of different chemicals, was retained in 8% NaCl, 15 mmol l(-1) CaCl2, and in a pH range between 5 and 9.5. The substrate specificity of peptidoglycan hydrolase from Lactococcus strains was evaluated in renaturing SDS-PAGE incorporating cells of different bacterial species. The major autolysin of Lactococcus lactis was active against cells of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Listeria monocytogenes. CONCLUSIONS: Autolytic activity is widely distributed in Lactococcus lactis and the rate of autolysis is strain-dependent. The major peptidoglycan hydrolase showed a wide spectrum of activity against several lactic acid bacteria and bacterial species involved in food-related infection. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The autolytic phenotype of Lactococcus lactis strains isolated from Tunisian artisan dairy products has been determined, and the data obtained should allow the selection of strains of technological interest in the cheese-ripening process.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in kefir grains and kefir made from them.
AB  - In an investigation of the changes in the microflora along the pathway: kefir grains (A)-->kefir made from kefir grains (B)-->kefir made from kefir as inoculum (C), the following species of lactic acid bacteria (83-90%) of the microbial count in the grains) were identified: Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum and Lactobacillus brevis. Yeasts (10-17%) identified were Kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida inconspicua and Candida maris. In the microbial population of kefir grains and kefir made from them the homofermentative lactic streptococci (52-65% and 79-86%, respectively) predominated. Within the group of lactobacilli, the homofermentative thermophilic species L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and L. helveticus (70-87% of the isolated bacilli) predominated. Along the pathway A-->B-->C, the streptococcal proportion in the total kefir microflora increased by 26-30% whereas the lactobacilli decreased by 13-23%. K. marxianus var. lactis was permanently present in kefir grains and kefirs, whereas the dominant lactose-negative yeast in the total yeast flora of the kefir grains dramatically decreased in kefir C.
TI  - Unique properties of four lactobacilli in amino acid production and symbiotic mixed culture for lactic acid biosynthesis.
AB  - With four Lactobacilli--L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis (ATCC 12315), L. casei (NRRL-B1445), L. delbrueckii (NRRL-B445), and L. heveticus (NRRL-B1937)--the characteristics of cell growth and production of lactate and amino acids were investigated. Especially, the time-course variation in concentration of amino acids (classified into alanine, serine, aspartate, glutamate, aromatic amino acid, and histidine families) was estimated in detail, and the results were systematically compared. It was elucidated that L. delbrueckii (NRRL-B445) and L. helveticus (NRRL-B1937) had quite different characteristics in growth, lactic acid synthesis, and amino acid production. L. helveticus (NRRL-B1937) was superior in the production of amino acids as well as in cell growth, but showed very poor ability in lactic acid production. However, L. delbrueckii (NRRL-B445) showed higher yield of lactic acid despite repressed cell growth, but suffered from severe amino acid deficiency in culture. By modulating the initial concentration of each strain in the mixed culture containing both L. delbrueckii (NRRL-B445) and L. helveticus (NRRL-B1937), the lactic acid production (i.e., the amount of lactic acid produced and lactic acid yield to glucose consumed) was significantly improved, presumably via symbiotic interaction between the two strains.
TI  - Molecular discrimination of lactobacilli used as starter and probiotic cultures by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus helveticus, L. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, and L. casei related taxa which are widely used as starter or probiotic cultures can be identified by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). The genetic discrimination of the related species belonging to these groups was first obtained by PCR amplifications by using group-specific or species-specific 16S rDNA primers. The numerical analysis of the ARDRA patterns obtained by using CfoI, HinfI, Tru9I, and ScrFI was an efficient typing tool for identification of species of the L. acidophilus and L. casei complex. ARDRA by using CfoI was a reliable method for differentiation of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis. Finally, strains ATCC 393 and ATCC 15820 exhibited unique ARDRA patterns with CfoI and Tru9I restriction enzymes as compared with the other strains of L. casei, L. paracasei, and L. rhamnosus.
TI  - Hydrolysis of sequenced beta-casein peptides provides new insight into peptidase  activity from thermophilic lactic acid bacteria and highlights intrinsic resistance of phosphopeptides.
AB  - The peptidases of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria have a key role in the proteolysis of Swiss cheeses during warm room ripening. To compare their peptidase activities toward a dairy substrate, a tryptic/chymotryptic hydrolysate of purified beta-casein was used. Thirty-four peptides from 3 to 35 amino acids, including three phosphorylated peptides, constitute the beta-casein hydrolysate, as shown by tandem mass spectrometry. Cell extracts prepared from Lactobacillus helveticus ITG LH1, ITG LH77, and CNRZ 32, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis ITG LL14 and ITG LL51, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CNRZ 397 and NCDO 1489, and Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ 385, CIP 102303, and TA 060 were standardized in protein. The peptidase activities were assessed with the beta-casein hydrolysate as the substrate at pH 5.5 and 24 degrees C (conditions of warm room ripening) by (i) free amino acid release, (ii) reverse-phase chromatography, and (iii) identification of undigested peptides by mass spectrometry. Regardless of strain, L. helveticus was the most efficient in hydrolyzing beta-casein peptides. Interestingly, cell extracts of S. thermophilus were not able to release a significant level of free proline from the beta-casein hydrolysate, which was consistent with the identification of numerous dipeptides containing proline. With the three lactic acid bacteria tested, the phosphorylated peptides remained undigested or weakly hydrolyzed indicating their high intrinsic resistance to peptidase activities. Finally, several sets of peptides differing by a single amino acid in a C-terminal position revealed the presence of at least one carboxypeptidase in the cell extracts of these species.
TI  - Characterization of natural isolates of Lactobacillus strains to be used as starter cultures in dairy fermentation.
AB  - The technological relevant characteristics of five homofermentative lactobacilli  strains, isolated from natural fermented hard cheeses, were studied. Isolates CRL 581 and CRL 654, from Argentinian artesanal hard cheeses, and isolates CRL 1177, CRL 1178, and CRL 1179, from Italian Grana cheeses, were identified as Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus helveticus, respectively, by physiological and biochemical tests, SDS-PAGE of whole-cell proteins and sequencing of the variable (V1) region of the 16S ribosomal DNA. All strains showed high levels of beta-galactosidase activity. However, proteolytic activity varied widely among isolates. Strains CRL 581, CRL 654, and CRL 1177 hydrolyzed alpha- and beta-caseins and were able to coagulate reconstituted skim milk in less than 16 h at 42 degrees C. According to the substrate specificity, these proteinases have a caseinolytic activity comparable to that of the P(III)-type of lactococcal proteinases. No strains produced inhibitor substances (bacteriocin) and all were insensitive to attack by 14 L. helveticus- and L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis-specific bacteriophages.
TI  - Expression of the phospho-beta-glycosidase ArbZ from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis in Lactobacillus helveticus: substrate induction and catabolite repression.
AB  - ArbZ from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis was previously shown to enable  utilization of the beta-glucoside arbutin by Escherichia coli. The arbZ gene was cloned and expressed in the industrially used beta-glucoside-negative strain Lactobacillus helveticus 3036(62). The transformants were able to ferment not only arbutin, but also cellobiose, salicin and methyl-beta-glucoside (MbetaGlc). Cleavage of beta-glucosides by the transformants depended on the integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane, whereas in cell-free extracts only C(6)-phosphorylated substrates were hydrolysed. This suggested that ArbZ is a phospho-beta-glycosidase. ArbZ activity in transformants of Lb. helveticus was subject to substrate induction mediated by the beta-glucosides arbutin, salicin and MbetaGlc, whereas cellobiose or the beta-galactoside lactose had no inducing effect. Northern blot analysis proved that induction by MbetaGlc was due to enhanced transcription of arbZ. Catabolite repression of arbZ induction was observed with glucose, mannose, fructose and galactose. The induction kinetics observed in the presence of these sugars indicated that at least two different mechanisms are operative in catabolite repression of arbZ in Lb. helveticus.
TI  - Lactobacillus fornicalis sp. nov., isolated from the posterior fornix of the human vagina.
AB  - Twelve strains isolated from the posterior fornix fluid of the human vagina were  identified as Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gallinarum and Lactobacillus crispatus based on numerical analyses of total soluble cell protein profiles and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR banding patterns. Five strains grouped with the type strains of Lactobacillus gasseri (DSM 20077T) and Lactobacillus jensenii (DSM 20557T) at r > or = 0.83 in one protein profile cluster, well separated from the other species included in this study. However, numerical analysis of the RAPD-PCR banding patterns of representative strains selected from the L. gasseri-L. jensenii protein cluster clearly indicated that they belong to two different species. Four strains (TV 1010, TG 1013, TV 1018T and TV 1045) grouped into another well separated protein profile cluster at r > or = 0.87. Strains selected from this cluster displayed very similar RAPD-PCR banding patterns and clustered at R2 > or = 0.78, separate from the other strains examined. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA of two representative strains, TV 1018T and TG 1013, of this group indicated that it represents a new member of rRNA group I Lactobacillus, which includes Lactobacillus delbrueckii, the type of the genus, and close relatives Lactobacillus acetotolerans, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, Lactobacillus iners, L. jensenii, L. crispatus, L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus amylovorus, Lactobacillus hamsteri, L. johnsonii, L. gasseri and Lactobacillus amylolyticus. The name Lactobacillus fornicalis sp. nov. is proposed for strains TV 1010 (DSM 13172), TG 1013, TV 1018T and TV 1045, with strain TV 1018T (= DSM 13171T = ATCC 700934T) as the type.
TI  - Fatty acid composition and freeze-thaw resistance in lactobacilli.
AB  - The fatty acid composition and freeze-thaw resistance of eight strains of thermophilic lactobacilli were studied. Seven of these contained the same polar and neutral lipids, the five major components making up 90% of the cellular fatty acid pool being 14:0, 16:0, 16:1, 18:1 and C19 cyclopropane (cyc19:0). Strain comparison by means of cluster analysis based on the fatty acid ratios using the overlap coefficient revealed two well defined clusters. One was formed by three strains of species Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, the other included five strains of the species Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lb. acidophilus and Lb. helveticus. Resistance of strains with a high content of unsaturated fatty acids (66-70%) decreased with increasing cyc19:0 concentrations. In contrast, in strains with a low concentration of unsaturated fatty acids (42-49%), increasing cyc19:0 levels were associated with increased freeze-thaw resistance.
TI  - X-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase gene (pepX) is part of the glnRA operon in Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  - A peptidase gene expressing X-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (PepX) activity was cloned from Lactobacillus rhamnosus 1/6 by using the chromogenic substrate L-glycyl-L-prolyl-beta-naphthylamide for screening of a genomic library in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of a 3.5-kb HindIII fragment expressing the peptidase activity revealed one complete open reading frame (ORF) of 2,391 nucleotides. The 797-amino-acid protein encoded by this ORF was shown to be 40, 39, and 36% identical with PepXs from Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Lactococcus lactis, respectively. By Northern analysis with a pepX-specific probe, transcripts of 4.5 and 7.0 kb were detected, indicating that pepX is part of a polycistronic operon in L. rhamnosus. Cloning and sequencing of the upstream region of pepX revealed the presence of two ORFs of 360 and 1,338 bp that were shown to be able to encode proteins with high homology to GlnR and GlnA proteins, respectively. By multiple primer extension analyses, the only functional promoter in the pepX region was located 25 nucleotides upstream of glnR. Northern analysis with glnA- and pepX-specific probes indicated that transcription from glnR promoter results in a 2.0-kb dicistronic glnR-glnA transcript and also in a longer read-through polycistronic transcript of 7.0 kb that was detected with both probes in samples from cells in exponential growth phase. The glnA gene was disrupted by a single-crossover recombinant event using a nonreplicative plasmid carrying an internal part of glnA. In the disruption mutant, glnRA-specific transcription was derepressed 10-fold compared to the wild type, but the 7.0-kb transcript was no longer detectable with either the glnA- or pepX-specific probe, demonstrating that pepX is indeed part of glnRA operon in L. rhamnosus. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis further supported this operon structure. An extended stem-loop structure was identified immediately upstream of pepX in the glnA-pepX intergenic region, a sequence that showed homology to a 23S-5S intergenic spacer and to several other L. rhamnosus-related entries in data banks.
TI  - Multi-domain, cell-envelope proteinases of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The multi-domain, cell-envelope proteinases encoded by the genes prtB of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, prtH of Lactobacillus helveticus, prtP of Lactococcus lactis, scpA of Streptococcus pyogenes and csp of Streptococcus agalactiae have been compared using multiple sequence alignment, secondary structure prediction and database homology searching methods. This comparative analysis has led to the prediction of a number of different domains in these cell-envelope proteinases, and their homology, characteristics and putative function are described. These domains include, starting from the N-terminus, a pre-pro-domain for secretion and activation, a serine protease domain (with a smaller inserted domain), two large middle domains A and B of unknown but possibly regulatory function, a helical spacer domain, a hydrophilic cell-wall spacer or attachment domain, and a cell-wall anchor domain. Not all domains are present in each cell-envelope proteinase, suggesting that these multi-domain proteins are the result of gene shuffling and domain swapping during evolution.
TI  - Note: identification of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subspecies bulgaricus and subspecies lactis dairy isolates by amplified rDNA restriction analysis.
AB  - Amplification and restriction analysis of the 16S rRNA gene (PCR-ARDRA) was used  to identify Lactobacillus delbrueckii dairy isolates and to assign them to its three subspecies (delbrueckii, lactis and bulgaricus). PCR-ARDRA allowed confirmation of predictions from the DNA database regarding the restriction mapping of the 16S sequence to be verified in practice. PCR-ARDRA was shown to be a reliable and rapid method for identifying Lact. delbrueckii isolates at the subspecies level and for differentiating this species from Lact. helveticus and Lact. acidophilus.
TI  - Molecular identification and cluster analysis of homofermentative thermophilic lactobacilli isolated from dairy products.
AB  - Twenty-five strains of thermophilic lactobacilli isolated from yoghurt and from semi-hard and hard cheeses (in parallel with nine type or reference strains) were identified and grouped according to their genetic relatedness. Strains were identified by sugar fermentation patterns using the "API 50 CHL" galleries, by species-specific DNA probes in dot-blot hybridization experiments, by amplification and restriction analysis of the 16S rRNA gene (ARDRA) and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using species-specific oligonucleotide primers. Strains were classified as Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and subsp. bulgaricus, L. helveticus, and L. acidophilus. Strains which were atypical by sugar fermentation patterns were also identified. Most of the strains could not be grouped using carbohydrate fermentation profiles. PCR fingerprinting was used to identify DNA profiles for the 25 lactobacilli. Experimentally obtained PCR profiles enabled discrimination of all strains, which were grouped according to the similarities in their combined patterns. In general, the clustering of the strains corresponded well with species delineation obtained by molecular identification. The dendrogram of genetic relatedness enabled the unambiguous identification of most of the strains which were shown to be atypical by the sugar fermentation profile, except for a discrepancy in one L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis strain and one atypical Lactobacillus sp. strain.
TI  - 16S-23S and 23S-5S intergenic spacer regions of lactobacilli: nucleotide sequence, secondary structure and comparative analysis.
AB  - Lactobacilli have been used as industrial starters for a long time, but in several cases their identification was, and still is, neither easy nor reliable. The aim of the present work was to examine whether the intergenic spacer regions could be of value in the identification of Lactobacillus species. For that purpose, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify 16S-23S and 23S-5S spacer regions of Lactobacillus (L.) acidophilus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. helveticus and L. curvatus. The PCR products were directly sequenced, and two forms of ribosomal RNA (rrn) operons were identified in each species studied: one with tandem tRNA(Ile)/tRNA(Ala) genes and the other one without tRNA genes. Our study revealed that the rrn operons of Lactobacillus species studied comprise the genes of 16S, 23S and 5S rRNA, in that order. Only the tRNA genes and the rRNA processing stems are highly conserved in spacer regions of lactobacilli. The divergence between the lactobacilli spacer region sequences arises from insertions and deletions of short sequences. These sequences could be interesting candidates for the development of species-specific probes. Theoretical RNA/RNA secondary structure models of the interaction between the two spacer region sequences were constructed. In conclusion, the two spacer region sequences may prove to be a useful alternative to 16S and 23S rDNA sequencing for designing species-specific probes and for establishing phylogenetic relationships between closely related species such as L. curvatus and L. casei or L. acidophilus and L. helveticus.
TI  - Characterization of bacteriocins produced by strains from traditional Bulgarian dairy products.
AB  - A result of extensive screening of over 300 strains from the Collection of ELBY Bulgaricum, PLC, thirty six strains were selected as producers of bacteriocins, active closely related lactic acid bacterial species and some food spoilage bacteria. The selected strains belong to L. helveticus, L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, which are rare bacteriocin producers. Nineteen nonidentified producers were characterized by molecular taxonomic approaches--M13 fingerprinting, repetitive PCR, ribotyping and hybridization with species-specific probes, which allowed to affiliate them to the species L. delbrueckii. Several strains were found to harbour plasmids of different size. The estimated activity against food borne pathogens makes the isolated substances perspective as safe food preservatives and the producing strains could be used as components of starters with improved quality.
TI  - Preliminary characterization of microflora of Comte cheese.
AB  - The evolution of the microflora of three Comte cheeses made in duplicate with raw milk from three different sources was followed during ripening. The same starter was used with each type of milk. The comparison of the cheeses did not reveal any significant difference in the development of the microflora. Starter lactic acid bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus), which are added at the beginning of manufacture, decreased quickly in the first stages of ripening supporting the hypothesis of cell autolysis. Other microorganisms, i.e. homofermentative and heterofermentative lactobacilli (Lact. delbrueckii ssp. lactis, Lact. paracasei ssp. paracasei, Lact. rhamnosus and Lact. fermentum), pediococci, enterococci and propionibacteria grew in cheese from small numbers in fresh curd. The characterization of Strep. thermophilus by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that wild strains were also able to grow in the curd. The values for the genome size of 11 Strep. thermophilus strains determined in this investigation were in the range of 1.8-2.3 Mbp. The potential role of starter and raw milk microflora in cheese flavour development was considered.
TI  - Role of Streptococcus thermophilus MR-1C capsular exopolysaccharide in cheese moisture retention.
AB  - Recent work by our group has shown that an exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing starter pair, Streptococcus thermophilus MR-1C and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus MR-1R, can significantly increase moisture retention in low-fat mozzarella (D. B. Perry, D. J. McMahon, and C. J. Oberg, J. Dairy Sci. 80:799-805, 1997). The objectives of this study were to determine whether MR-1C, MR-1R, or both of these strains are required for enhanced moisture retention and to establish the role of EPS in this phenomenon. Analysis of low-fat mozzarella made with different combinations of MR-1C, MR-1R, and the non-EPS-producing starter culture strains S. thermophilus TA061 and Lactobacillus helveticus LH100 showed that S. thermophilus MR-1C was responsible for the increased cheese moisture level. To investigate the role of the S. thermophilus MR-1C EPS in cheese moisture retention, the epsE gene in this bacterium was inactivated by gene replacement. Low-fat mozzarella made with L. helveticus LH100 plus the non-EPS-producing mutant S. thermophilus DM10 had a significantly lower moisture content than did cheese made with strains LH100 and MR-1C, which confirmed that the MR-1C capsular EPS was responsible for the water-binding properties of this bacterium in cheese. Chemical analysis of the S. thermophilus MR-1C EPS indicated that the polymer has a novel basic repeating unit composed of D-galactose, L-rhamnose, and L-fucose in a ratio of 5:2:1.
TI  - Lactobacilli carry cryptic genes encoding peptidase-related proteins: characterization of a prolidase gene (pepQ) and a related cryptic gene (orfZ) from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.
AB  - Two genes, pepQ and orfZ, encoding a prolidase and a prolidase-like protein, respectively, were cloned and characterized from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. The identity of the pepQ and orfZ genes with the Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis prolidase gene (pepQ) was shown to be 98% and 60%, respectively. Both pepQ and orfZ were preceded by a putative promoter region. Northern analysis of pepQ mRNA revealed a 1.1 kb transcript indicating that pepQ forms a monocistronic transcriptional unit. Under the growth conditions used, no evidence was obtained that orfZ was expressed, either by mRNA size determination in Northern analysis or by primer extension analysis. With reverse transcription-PCR, however, the presence of monocistronic orfZ transcripts was established. The orfZ gene could also be overexpressed in E. coli using the vector pKK223-3. The size of the protein synthesized, 41 kDa, confirmed the molecular mass of OrfZ calculated according to DNA sequence analysis. In contrast to PepQ, which showed a substrate specificity characteristic of prolidase enzymes, no enzymic activity for the orfZ-encoded protein was found with the peptide substrates tested. These results indicate that orfZ is a cryptic gene, which is expressed at a very low level under the growth conditions used. It is noteworthy that homologues of the Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus orfZ and pepQ genes appeared to be present in both Lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus helveticus.
TI  - Cell-wall protein profiles of dairy thermophilic lactobacilli.
AB  - SDS-PAGE fingerprinting of cell-wall proteins extracted from 119 strains belonging to different species of lactic acid bacteria have been compared. The method of extraction and electrophoretic separation utilized in this work was found to be a reliable and rapid way for characterizing thermophilic lactobacilli species and strains. A protein of approximately 50 kDa was found to be characteristic for all the Lact. helveticus strains, and two cell-wall proteins of about 20 and 30 kDa were typical of the species Lact. delbrueckii, but the discrimination between the subspecies lactis and bulgaricus was not possible by the electrophoretic technique used. The other thermophilic species studied in this work presented cell-wall protein patterns that permitted their differentiation from both Lact. helveticus and Lact. delbrueckii.
TI  - Lactose hydrolysis and beta-galactosidase activity in sonicated fermentation with Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - Milk fermentation with four Lactobacillus strains, including L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus B-5b, L. helveticus LH-17, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis SBT-2080 and L. acidophilus SBT-2068, was carried out under sonicated conditions. Under continuous sonication, viable cell count decreased or grew less than in conventional fermentation, but it increased considerably in static incubation after sonication. Sonication caused beta-galactosidase release from lactic acid bacteria cells to the culture medium, thus resulting in higher total beta-galactosidase activity. However, lactose hydrolysis was enhanced only when beta-alactosidase was effectively released. With L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus B-5b and L. helveticus LH-17. the degrees of lactose hydrolysis achieved were about 75% which is much higher than those in conventional fermentation (below 40%). Results presented here showed that a high viable cell count and a high degree of lactose hydrolysis could be simultaneously achieved by a suitable sonication method.
TI  - Electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases, a new tool for bacterial species identification: application to 10 Lactobacillus species.
AB  - Lactobacilli have been used as industrial starters for a long time, but in many cases their phenotypic identification is still neither easy nor reliable. Previously we observed that the cell wall peptidoglycan hydrolases of Lactobacillus helveticus were highly conserved enzymes; the aim of the present work was to determine whether peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns obtained by renaturing SDS-PAGE could be of interest in the identification of lactobacilli species. For that purpose, the peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns of 94 strains of lactobacilli belonging to 10 different species were determined; most of the species studied are used either in dairy, meat, bakery or vegetable fermentations: L. helveticus, L. acidophilus, L. delbrueckii, L. brevis, L. fermentum, L. jensenii, L. plantarum, L. sake, L. curvatus and L. reuteri. Within a species, the strains exhibited highly similar patterns: the apparent molecular weights of the lytic bands were identical, with only slight variations of intensity. Moreover, each species, including phylogenetically close species such as L. sake and L. curvatus, or L. acidophilus and L. helveticus, gave a different pattern. Interestingly, the closer the species were phylogenetically, the more related were their patterns. The sensitivity of the method was checked using various quantities of L. acidophilus cells: a peptidoglycan hydrolase extract of 5 x 10(6) cells was sufficient to obtain an informative pattern, as was a single colony. Finally, the method was also successfully applied to distinguish two Carnobacterium species. In conclusion, the electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases is proposed as a new tool for lactobacilli identification: it is rapid, sensitive and effective even for phylogenetically close species. Furthermore, this work provides the first evidence of the potential overall taxonomic value of bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases.
TI  - Use of RAPD and 16S rDNA sequencing for the study of Lactobacillus population dynamics in natural whey culture.
AB  - The development of communities of the thermophilic microflora of natural whey culture for Parmigiano Reggiano cheese production was studied by means of molecular techniques. RAPD analysis facilitates the identification of the Lactobacillus strains involved in this microbial association and permitted the study of population dynamics during two cycles of whey fermentation. Analysis of RAPD fingerprints revealed the presence of four biotypes that dominate the whey fermentation process. Sequence analysis of 16S rDNA demonstrated that the strains isolated from whey belong to Lact. helveticus and Lact. delbrueckii ssp. lactis species.
TI  - Characterization of a thiol-dependent endopeptidase from Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ32.
AB  - An endopeptidase gene (pepE) was isolated from a previously constructed genomic library of Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ32. The pepE gene consisted of a 1,314-bp open reading frame encoding a putative peptide of 52.1 kDa. Significant identity was found between the deduced amino acid sequence of pepE and the sequences for aminopeptidase C from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis DSM7290, L. helveticus CNRZ32, Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ302, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris AM2. A recombinant PepE fusion protein containing an N-terminal six-histidine tag was constructed and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. Characterization of PepE revealed that it was a thiol-dependent protease having a monomeric mass of 50 kDa, with optimum temperature, NaCl concentration, and pH for activity at 32 to 37 degrees C, 0.5%, and 4.5, respectively. PepE had significant activity under conditions which simulate those of ripening cheese (10 degrees C, 4% NaCl, pH 5.1). PepE hydrolyzed internal peptide bonds in Met-enkephalin and bradykinin; however, hydrolysis of alpha-, beta-, and kappa-caseins was not detected.
TI  - Development of oligonucleotide primers from the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic sequences for identifying different dairy and probiotic lactic acid bacteria by PCR.
AB  - Spacer regions between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes of different dairy and probiotic lactic acid bacteria were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with conserved primers and the nucleotide sequences of these spacer regions were determined. Amplification/oligonucleotide primer pairs were designed for Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Streptococcus thermophilus based on the differences in the nucleotide sequences of the 16S-23S rRNA spacer regions. Also a primer pair identifying both Lb. paracasei and Lb. rhamnosus was designed. In addition to conventional PCR in a heat block a rapid PCR method in an Air Thermocycler (ATC) with glass capillaries was used.
TI  - An operon from Lactobacillus helveticus composed of a proline iminopeptidase gene (pepI) and two genes coding for putative members of the ABC transporter family of proteins.
AB  - A proline iminopeptidase gene (pepI) of an industrial Lactobacillus helveticus strain was cloned and found to be organized in an operon-like structure of three open reading frames (ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3). ORF1 was preceded by a typical prokaryotic promoter region, and a putative transcription terminator was found downstream of ORF3, identified as the pepI gene. Using primer-extension analyses, only one transcription start site, upstream of ORF1, was identifiable in the predicted operon. Although the size of mRNA could not be judged by Northern analysis either with ORF1-, ORF2- or pepI-specific probes, reverse transcription-PCR analyses further supported the operon structure of the three genes. ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3 had coding capacities for 50.7, 24.5 and 33.8 kDa proteins, respectively. The ORF3-encoded PepI protein showed 65% identity with the PepI proteins from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis. The ORF1-encoded protein had significant homology with several members of the ABC transporter family but, with two distinct putative ATP-binding sites, it would represent an unusual type among the bacterial ABC transporters. ORF2 encoded a putative integral membrane protein also characteristic of the ABC transporter family. The pepI gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Purified PepI hydrolysed only di and tripeptides with proline in the first position. Optimum PepI activity was observed at pH 7.5 and 40 degrees C. A gel filtration analysis indicated that PepI is a dimer of M(r) 53,000. PepI was shown to be a metal-independent serine peptidase having thiol groups at or near the active site. Kinetic studies with proline-p-nitroanilide as substrate revealed Km and Vmax values of 0.8 mM and 350 mmol min-1 mg-1, respectively, and a very high turnover number of 135,000 s-1.
TI  - The presence of two S-layer-protein-encoding genes is conserved among species related to Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Previously we have shown that the type strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus possesses two S-protein-encoding genes, one of which is silent, on a chromosomal segment of 6 kb. The S-protein-encoding gene in the expression site can be exchanged for the silent S-protein-encoding gene by inversion of this slp segment. In this study the presence of S-protein and corresponding S-protein-encoding genes of strains belonging to species that are closely related to L. acidophilus was determined. All strains investigated were identified by numerical comparison of highly standardized one-dimensional SDS-PAGE whole-cellular-protein patterns. Western blot and Southern blot methods were used to identify the presence of, and homology between, S-proteins and S-protein-encoding genes. From these analyses we conclude that strains of L. acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. amylovorus and L. gallinarum possess an S-layer and contain two slp genes. Strains of L. helveticus possess an S-layer but have only one intact slp gene. Strains of L. gasseri, L. johnsonii and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus have neither an S-layer nor S-protein-encoding genes hybridizing with probes derived from the L. acidophilus slpA or slpB region. The presence of a highly conserved 5' region in the slp genes of strains of L. acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. amylovorus and L. gallinarum suggests that S-layer variation is a common feature for strains of these species.
TI  - An X-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (pepX) gene from Lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  - The X-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase gene (pepX) of an industrially used Lactobacillus helveticus strain has been detected by nucleic acid hybridization, cloned, characterized and sequenced. One ORF of 2379 bp with coding capacity for a 90.6 kDa protein (PepX) was found. The ORF was preceded by a typical prokaryotic promoter region. An inverted repeat structure with delta G of -84.1 kJ mol-1 was found downstream of the coding region. The deduced amino acid sequence of the 90.6 kDa protein showed 49.3, 49.4 and 77.7% homology with the PepX proteins from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, respectively. Northern blotting revealed a 2.6 kb transcript and one transcription start site was identified via primer extension analysis using an A.L.F. sequencer. In a bioreactor study, the expression of pepX in Lb. helveticus was studied as a function of growth. Transcription of pepX was typical of exponential growth phase expression. The pepX gene has been cloned into pKK223-3 and expressed at a high level in Escherichia coli JM105. PepX was purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Optimum PepX activity was observed at pH 6.5 and 45 degrees C. According to gel filtration analysis, PepX is a dimer of 165 kDa. The enzyme was inactivated by heavy metal ions such as Cu2+, Cd2+ and Zn2+. EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline did not decrease PepX activity significantly. It was completely inhibited by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate and reactivated by adding DTT, and strongly inhibited by PMSF. PepX is thus a metal-independent serine peptidase having functional sulfhydryl groups at or near the active site.
TI  - Comparison of proteolytic activities in various lactobacilli.
AB  - A total of 169 Lactobacillus strains from 12 species (Lb. acidophilus, Lb. brevis, Lb. buchneri, Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lb. fermentum, Lb. helveticus, Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, Lb. plantarum and Lb. rhamnosus), isolated from raw milk and various milk products, and 9 Lactococcus lactis strains were evaluated for peptidase activities with five chromogenic substrates and a tryptic digest of casein. Within each species, the peptidase activity of the cell-free extracts of the strains varied. Furthermore, differences were observed between the Lactobacillus species and Lc. lactis. Lb. helveticus had by far the highest hydrolysing activities towards all substrates, indicating the presence of powerful aminopeptidases, X-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidases and proline iminopeptidases. Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus possessed high hydrolysing activities towards substrates containing proline, alanyl-prolyl-p-nitroanilide and prolyl-p-nitroanilide. On the other hand, Lb. fermentum and Lb. brevis could be considered as weakly proteolytic species. A more detailed study with highly proteolytic Lactobacillus strains indicated that at least three different proteinases or endopeptidases were present. Compared with Lc. lactis, the Lactobacillus strains had a much lower hydrolytic action on glutamyl-glutamic acid, suggesting that glutamyl aminopeptidase was absent in lactobacilli.
TI  - Genetic and biochemical characterization of the Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.  lactis bacteriophage LL-H lysin.
AB  - LL-H, a virulent phage of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, produces a peptidoglycan-degrading enzyme, Mur, that is effective on L. delbrueckii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Pediococcus damnosus cell walls. In this study, the LL-H gene mur was cloned into Escherichia coli, its nucleotide sequence was determined, and the enzyme produced in E. coli was purified and biochemically characterized. Mur was purified 112-fold by means of ammonium sulfate precipitation and cation-exchange chromatography. The cell wall-hydrolyzing activity was found to be associated with a 34-kDa protein. The C-terminal domain of Mur is not essential for catalytic activity since it can be removed without destroying the lytic activity. The N-terminal sequence of the purified lysin was identical to that deduced from the nucleotide sequence, but the first methionine is absent from the mature protein. The N-terminal part of this 297-amino-acid protein had homology with several Chalaropsis-type lysozymes. Reduction of purified and Mur-digested L. delbrueckii cell wall material with labeled NaB3H4 indicated that the enzyme is a muramidase. The temperature optimum of purified Mur is between 30 and 40 degrees C, and the pH optimum is around 5.0. The LL-H lysin Mur is stable at temperatures below 60 degrees C.
TI  - Sequence analysis, distribution and expression of an aminopeptidase N-encoding gene from Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ32 [gene 155 (1995) 89-93].
AB  - Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus CNRZ32 possesses a 97-kDa metalloenzyme with aminopeptidase activity (PepN; EC 3.4.11.2). A 3.8-kb fragment encoding PepN was cloned into pIL253 and designated pSUW34. Transformation of Lactococcus (Lc.) lactis LM0230 with pSUW34 resulted in > 180-fold increase in general aminopeptidase (AP) activity using L-lysine-p-nitroanilide. Southern hybridization was conducted to determine the distribution of homology to the CNRZ32 pepN gene among lactic-acid bacteria (LAB). Hybridization was observed with strains of lactobacilli, pediococci, leuconostoc, streptococci and lactococci. The pepN gene was sequenced and found to encode a protein containing 844 amino acid (aa) residues. A comparison of Lb. helveticus CNRZ32 pepN to Lb. delbrueckii ssp. lactis DSM7290 pepN indicated 69.5% nucleotide (nt) identity and 71.8% aa identity, while comparison to pepN from Lc. lactis ssp. cremoris MG1363 indicated 61.1% nt identity and 49.2% aa identity. Alignment of peptidase aa sequences of LAB, Escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian origin display homology in the zinc-binding domain, as well as a conserved region upstream from the putative active site.

TI  - Molecular cloning and DNA sequence analysis of pepL, a leucyl aminopeptidase gene from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis DSM7290.
AB  - A genomic library of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis DSM7290 DNA fragments from a Sau3A partial digestion in the low-copy-number vector pLG339, was used to screen Escherichia coli for the presence of peptidases. Using the chromogenic substrate leucine-beta-naphthylamide (Leu-NH-Nap) and E. coli strain CM89 lacking the corresponding enzyme activity in an enzymic plate assay, allowed the isolation of two peptidase genes; the newly described pepL and the recently cloned and sequenced pepN. Clones could be distinguished not only by the restriction pattern of isolated plasmids but also by the rate and intensity of their colour reaction with Leu-NH-Nap. Three out of five clones were identified to express the Lactobacillus pepN gene; the others were shown to express a second aminopeptidase gene, designated pepL. This gene, together with 200 bp upstream of the proposed AUG initiation codon, was further subcloned and sequenced. The corresponding open reading frame of 897 nucleotides is predicted to encode a protein of 299 amino acids (34,541 Da). Searching the EMBL database revealed similarity to the prolinase of Lactobacillus helveticus (45.8% identity), to the iminopeptidases of Lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (25.5%), and to the Bacillus coagulans prolinase (21.5%). Minor similarities were detected for hydrolytic enzymes with serine active sites. The product encoded by the pepL gene was functional but could not be visualized on Coomassie-blue-stained polyacrylamide gels. High level expression of peptidase L in E. coli was achieved by placing the gene under the control of the T7 promoter.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis of the Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis DSM7290 cysteine aminopeptidase gene pepC.
AB  - A genomic library of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis DSM7290 in the low copy number vector pLG339, was screened for the presence of peptidase genes. Using the chromogenic substrate gly-ala-beta-naphthylamide, which is not a substrate for any of the recently cloned peptidases of DSM7290, and the multiple peptidase deficient Escherichia coli strain CM89, allowed the isolation of clones, which contained the equivalent hydrolytic activity. To identify genes encoding the conserved catalytic active site of cysteine proteases, partial nucleotide sequencing with a degenerate oligonucleotide was performed on recombinant plasmids isolated from such clones. This allowed to identify two out of nine clones to carry the Lactobacillus pepC gene. A total of 2026 nucleotides were determined, and sequence analysis revealed a gene with strong homology to the recently cloned Lb. helveticus (73.2%) and Lactococcus lactis (51.03%) pepC genes, and the derived protein showed homology with the active site of a large number of cysteine proteases. The predicted open reading frame consists of 449 codons, coding for a protein of 50,909 Da. The enzyme is functional and extremely overexpressed in E. coli.
TI  - Antimutagenicity of fermented milk.
AB  - Reconstituted nonfat dry milk was fermented by Lactobacillus helveticus CH65, Lactobacillus acidophilus BG2FO4, Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus CH3, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191R, and by a mixture of the latter two organisms. The fermented milks were then freeze-dried, extracted in acetone, dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, and assayed for antimutagenicity in the Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium TA 100) against N-methyl, N'-nitro, N-nitroso-guanidine, and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl. Dose-dependent activity was significant against both mutagens in all extracts. Maximal inhibitory activity against 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl and N-methyl, N'-nitro, N-nitroso-guanidine was 2- and 2.7-fold greater, respectively, than that exhibited by extracts of unfermented milk. Extracts of milk fermented by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191R were examined further. Compounds that were responsible for activity against both mutagens were less soluble in aqueous solutions than in dimethylsulfoxide. Adjustment of milk fermented by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191R to pH 3, 7.6, or 13 prior to freeze-drying and acetone extraction did not significantly alter the activity specific for 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl. In contrast, compounds with activity specific for N-methyl, N'-nitro, N-nitrosoguanidine were less extractable at pH 7.6. The weak antimutagenicity of unfermented milk was not increased by addition of 2% L-lactic acid.
TI  - Kinetic studies of the action of lactacin F, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus johnsonii that forms poration complexes in the cytoplasmic membrane.
AB  - The bacteriocin lactacin F is bactericidal against Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Activity against L. delbrueckii was recently shown to be dependent on two peptides, LafA and LafX, which are encoded within the lactacin F operon (T. R. Klaenhammer, FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 12:39-87, 1993). It has been proposed that two peptides form an active lactacin F complex. In this study, the action of lactacin F against E. faecalis ATCC 19443 and the effects of various environmental parameters were investigated in detail. Addition of lactacin F induced the loss of K+ from cells of L. delbrueckii, Lactobacillus johnsonii 88-4, and E. faecalis, while the lactacin F producer L. johnsonii VPI 11088 was not affected by the bacteriocin. Lactacin F caused an immediate loss of cellular K+, depolarization of the cytoplasmic membrane, and hydrolysis of internal ATP in E. faecalis. Lactacin F induced loss of K+ in 3,3',4',5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide-treated cells, indicating that pores are formed in the absence of a proton motive force. ATP hydrolysis was not due to dissipation of the proton motive force but was most likely caused by efflux of inorganic phosphate, resulting in a shift of the ATP hydrolysis equilibrium. Action of lactacin F was optimal at acidic pH values and was reduced in the presence of di- and trivalent cations. The lanthanide gadolinium (Gd3+) prevented action of lactacin F completely at a concentration of 0.2 mM. Lactacin F-induced loss of cell K+ was severely reduced at low temperatures, presumably as a result of increased ordering of the lipid hydrocarbon chains in the cytoplasmic membrane.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - A Lactobacillus helveticus-Specific DNA Probe Detects Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms in This Species.
AB  - A cloned 2-kb EcoRI fragment (fragment f) from a 34-kb plasmid of Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ 1094 was shown by dot blot to specifically hybridize to total DNAs of 75 L. helveticus strains. No hybridization was found with L. acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, L. gasseri, or L. intestinalis strains. When Southern blots of EcoRI digests of L. helveticus strains were probed with fragment f, these strains displayed restriction fragment length polymorphisms on the basis of which they could be grouped into several clusters.
TI  - M13 DNA fingerprinting, a new tool for classification and identification of Lactobacillus spp.
AB  - The optimal conditions for the application of M13 DNA fingerprinting to the genus Lactobacillus were determined. Comparative fingerprint analysis of representative strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, Lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lact. helveticus and Lact. casei permitted the differentiation of species, subspecies and individual strains and the quantitative determination of their genetic relatedness. The results confirm the high specificity of M13 DNA fingerprinting and indicate that it might be used in the classification of Lactobacillus spp.
TI  - Identification and characterization of helveticin V-1829, a bacteriocin produced  by Lactobacillus helveticus 1829.
AB  - Lactobacillus helveticus 1829 produced an antimicrobial agent, designated helveticin V-1829, that demonstrated antagonistic activity against closely-related species. The agent was excreted into MRS agar, and was present in the supernatant fluids from both overnight broth and clotted milk cultures. It was heat labile (inactivated by 50 degrees C for 30 min) and was stable over the pH range 2.5 to 6.5. Production of the substance was pH-dependent and maximum yields were obtained in MRS broth cultures maintained at pH 5.5. Helveticin V-1829 was partially purified following growth of the producing strain in a semi-defined MRS medium and precipitating the cell-free filtrate with ammonium sulphate to 30% saturation. The cleared supernatant fluid was then brought to 60% saturation and the resulting precipitate pelleted and dialysed in 0.3 mol/l phosphate buffer. The partially purified inhibitor was sensitive to several proteolytic enzymes, and it was bactericidal in its mode of action against indicator cells of Lact. helveticus 1844 and Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 1489, indicating that it was a bacteriocin. A DNA probe specific for the helveticin J structural gene failed to hybridize to total genomic DNA of Lact. helveticus 1829, indicating that helveticin V-1829 is not significantly related to helveticin J.
TI  - Molecular taxonomy of Lactobacillus phages.
AB  - Forty-eight strains of lactobacilli used as starter strains in the dairy industry were examined for lysogeny after treatment with mitomycin C. Two strains of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus were able to produce active phages. These temperate phages as well as 4 virulent phages isolated during abnormal fermentations were compared to a previously characterized phage mv4 which is temperate. All these phages were shown to be partially homologous by DNA-DNA hybridization. Genes that code for viral proteins seem to be well conserved since 2 major virion polypeptides of 18 (or 19) kD and 34 kD could be detected in the protein composition of each phage. Immunoblotting studies of the 7 phages using serum raised against phage mv4 confirmed that the proteins of the different phages were related. All these phages can be classified in the previously constituted group a, which now comprises 4 temperate and 15 virulent phages. These results show that some virulent phages appearing during abnormal fermentations and some temperate phages isolated by appearing during abnormal fermentations and some temperate phages isolated by induction of starter strains can be closely related genetically. Five virulent phages of L. helveticus were also compared according to their restriction pattern and their DNA homology. They were shown to be related to one another, but unrelated to phages of other lactic acid bacteria species.
TI  - An introduction to rod-shaped lactic-acid bacteria.
AB  - The genus Lactobacillus is mainly found in the intestinal tract of healthy humans and animals as well as in fermenting vegetables or plant materials, such as silage. It has a moderate diffusion in meat products and is rarely found in wines and beers. On the other hand, rod-shaped lactic-acid bacteria are largely used in the preparation of a variety of foods and feed products. As starter cultures, they are omnipresent in cheeses and dairy manufacturing. Specific fermentation processes have been developed in order to encourage the growth of the desired species, some of which are fastidious organisms such as L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, L. helveticus and L. sanfrancisco. In addition, a promising and interesting perspective is the use of rod-shaped lactic-acid bacteria, primarily L. acidophilus, L. reuteri and L. salivarius as probiotic starters to preserve the natural biological equilibrium of the intestinal tract.
TI  - Fermentation of aqueous plant seed extracts by lactic Acid bacteria.
AB  - The effects of lactic acid bacterial fermentation on chemical and physical changes in aqueous extracts of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), peanut (Arachis hypogea), soybean (Glycine max), and sorghum (Sorghum vulgare) were studied. The bacteria investigated were Lactobacillus helveticus, L. delbrueckii, L. casei, L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. Organisms were inoculated individually into all of the seed extracts; L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus were also evaluated together as inocula for fermenting the legume extracts. During fermentation, bacterial population and changes in titratable acidity, pH, viscosity, and color were measured over a 72-h period at 37 degrees C. Maximum bacterial populations, titratable acidity, pH, and viscosity varied depending upon the type of extract and bacterial strain. The maximum population of each organism was influenced by fermentable carbohydrates, which, in turn, influenced acid production and change in pH. Change in viscosity was correlated with the amount of protein and titratable acidity of products. Color was affected by pasteurization treatment and fermentation as well as the source of extract. In the extracts inoculated simultaneously with L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, a synergistic effect resulted in increased bacterial populations, titratable acidity, and viscosity, and decreased pH in all the legume extracts when compared to the extracts fermented with either of these organisms individually. Fermented extracts offer potential as substitutes for cultured dairy products.
TI  - Nucleic acids of species of Lactobacillus.
AB  - Nucleic acid composition of 17 cultures representing the type or neotype strains  of 15 named Lactobacillus species was studied. Nucleic acid characterization of these isolates was accompanied by a comparative study of conventional phenotypic reactions. The overall guanine plus cytosine mean deoxyribonucleic acid base composition ranged from 33 to 50% and genome sizes varied between 700 and 1500 X 10(6) daltons. Sporolactobacillus inulinus contained 2500 X 10(6) daltons of chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and was therefore similar in size to members of the genus Bacillus. Deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization at a temperature 15 degrees C below the thermal melting temperature confirmed the extreme molecular heterogeneity of many species. The genus can be divided into three major groups, each containing four or more species based on a combination of nucleic acid characteristics and conventional phenotypic reactions. Group I (33 to 39% guanine plus cytosine) contains Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus helveticus nov. ssp. jugurt, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Lactobacillus sanfrancisco. Group II (42 to 48% guanine plus cytosine contains Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus brevis, and Group III (48 to 50% guanine plus cytosine) contains Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. leichmanii, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus fermentum nov. ssp. cellobiosis.
TI  - Metabolism of pyruvate and citrate in lactobacilli.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. delbrueckii , L. lactis and L. plantarum contained a pyruvate oxidase for the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl phosphate and acetate. The presence of an acetate kinase converted the acetyl phosphate to acetate. L. casei and L. plantarum produced lactate and acetoin, in addition to acetate, under the conditions used while L. casei also produced diacetyl. L. casei and L. plantarum were the only species to utilize citrate. L. helveticus and L. helveticus subsp. jugurti did not utilize pyruvate under the conditions used.
TI  - [Sensitivity of lactobacilli of the subgenus Thermobacterium to the action of bacteriocins].
AB  - Sensitivity of 278 cultures of Thermobacterium to 30 types of bacteriocins produced by L. acidophilus, L. salivarius, L. jugurti, L. casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. brevis and L. buchneri was studied with the method of delayed antagonism. It was shown that all cultures of L. Salivarius, L. jugurti, L. helveticus, L. lactis, L. leichmannii, L. bulgaricus and L. delbrueckii and 94.1 per cent of L. acidophilus were sensitive to one or several bacteriocin types. The cultures of L. acidophilus, L. salivarius and L. jugurti, L. helveticus, L. lactis, L. bulgaricus and L. delbrueckii were sensitive to 26, 15, 28, 2 and 29 lactocin types respectively.
TI  - Pure Culture Fermentation of Brined Cucumbers.
AB  - The relative abilities of Pediococcus cerevisiae, Lactobacillus plantarum, L. brevis, and several other species of lactic acid bacteria to grow and produce acid in brined cucumbers were evaluated in pure culture fermentations. Such fermentations were made possibly by the use of two techniques, gamma radiation (0.83 to 1.00 Mrad) and hot-water blanching (66 to 80 C for 5 min), designed first to rid the cucumbers of naturally occurring, interfering, and competitive microbial groups prior to brining, followed by inoculation with the desired lactic acid bacteria. Of the nine species tested, strains of the three common to cucumber fermentations, P. cerevisiae, L. plantarum, and L. brevis, grew to the highest populations, and produced the highest levels of brine acidity and the lowest pH values in fermentations at 5.4 to 5.6% NaCl by weight; also, their sequence of active development in fermentations, with the use of a three-species mixture for inoculation, was in the species order just named. This sequence of occurrence was similar to that estimated by others for natural fermentations. The rates of growth and acid production in fermentations with a mixture of P. cerevisiae, L. plantarum, and L. brevis increased as the incubation temperature was increased from 21 to 27 to 32 C; however, the maximal populations and acidities attained were essentially the same for fermentations at each temperature. Further, these same three species were found to be the most salt tolerant of those tested; their upper limit for appreciable growth and measurable acid production was about 8% salt, whereas thermophilic species such as L. thermophilus, L. lactis, L. helveticus, L. fermenti, and L. delbrueckii exhibited a much lower salt tolerance, ranging from about 2.5 to 4.0%. However, certain strains of L. delbrueckii grew very rapidly in cucumbers brined at 2.5 to 3.0% salt, and produced sufficient acid in about 30 hr at 48 C to reduce the brine pH from above 7.0 to below 4.0. An inexpensive, pure culture fermentor which was suitable for gamma radiation, resistant to salt and acid, and which permitted repeated aseptic sampling of the fermenting brine, is illustrated and the specifications are given.
