TI  == use of a modified bacteroides-prevotella shuttle vector to transfer a reconstructed beta-1,4-d-endoglucanase gene into bacteroides uniformis and prevotella ruminicola b(1)4.
AB  == a carboxymethyl cellulase (cmcase) gene from prevotella ruminicola b(1)4 was reconstructed by adding a cellulose binding domain from a thermomonospora fusca cellulase and was conjugally transferred from escherichia coli to bacteroides uniformis 0061 by using a chloramphenicol and tetracycline resistance shuttle vector (ptc-cow). ptc-cow was specifically constructed to facilitate conjugal transfer of vectors from b. uniformis donors to p. ruminicola recipients. b. uniformis transconjugants containing cmcase constructs cloned into ptc-cow expressed cmr, but they did not produce the reconstructed cmcase until a xylanase promoter from p. ruminicola 23 was added upstream of the cmcase (ptc-xrcmc). the  xylanase promoter allowed the b. uniformis transconjugants to produce large amounts of the reconstructed cmcase, which was present on the outside surface of  the cells. although the reconstructed cmcase alone did not allow b. uniformis to  grow on acid-swollen cellulose, rapid growth was observed when two exocellulases  were added to the culture supernatant. under these conditions, the reconstructed  cmcase permitted faster growth than the wild-type cmcase. the frequency of transfer of ptc-xrcmc from b. uniformis to p. ruminicola b(1)4 was increased 100-fold when strictly anaerobic conditions, nitrocelluose filters (cell immobilization), and more stringent selections were employed. although the p. ruminicola b(1)4 (ptc-xrcmc) transconjugates expressed tcr and had dna that hybridized with a probe to the shuttle vector, these transconjugants did not produce detectable levels of the reconstructed cmcase even when xylan was the carbon source. on the basis of these results, it appears that not all of the promoters recognized by b. uniformis and p. ruminicola 23 are functional in p. ruminicola b(1)4. however, the results with b. uniformis suggest that the introduction of a p. ruminicola b(1)4 promoter should allow expression of the reconstructed cmcase in p. ruminicola b(1)4.

TI  == expression of a cloned cellulase/xylanase gene from prevotella ruminicola in bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides uniformis and prevotella ruminicola.
AB  == a new shuttle vector, prh3 (8.7 kb), was constructed for use in prevotella/bacteroides host strains. this vector combines the prri2 replicon from p. ruminicola, pbluescript sequences and a tetq marker gene for selection in prevotella/bacteroides hosts. following insertion of a fragment carrying an endoglucanase/xylanase gene from p. ruminicola 23 into the multiple cloning site, the resulting construct, prh3x, was introduced into b. vulgatus 1447, b. uniformis 1100 and p. ruminicola 2202. this resulted in increases of between 4 and 50-fold in cm-cellulase and xylanase activities in cells grown with glucose.  in contrast activities were barely detectable for the same construct in e. coli dh5 alpha. most of the total xylanase activity produced was found within the cell in p. ruminicola 2202 and b. vulgatus 1447 transformed with prh3x, and in p. ruminicola 23. an osmotic shock experiment indicated that a significant proportion of the xylanase activity in b. vulgatus 1447 cells carrying prh3x was  periplasmic.

TI  == transfer of hybrid plasmids based on the replicon prri7 from escherichia coli to  bacteroides and prevotella strains.
AB  == new shuttle vectors based on a prevotella ruminicola 9.5 kb cryptic plasmid (prri7) inserted within the escherichia coli vector pkc71, carrying the ccr/emr bacteroides marker, were constructed. these constructs (pkbr23-1 and pkbr23-2) were transferred into bacteriodes distasonis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and into p. ruminicola ncfb 2202 either by conjugal mobilization or by electroporation. another prri7 derivative based on pkc72, pkbr23-3, was smaller (13.1 kb) and non-mobilizable. by electroporation, it was transferred to bact. distasonis and p. ruminicola. being derived from prri7 which is compatible with the shuttle plasmid prri207, the host/vector combination involving p. ruminicola ncfb 2202 and pkbr23-3 offers new possibilities for genetic investigations in rumen anaerobic bacteria after further introduction of  a second readily selectable marker within prri207 or pkbr23-3.

TI  == evidence for natural transfer of a tetracycline resistance gene between bacteria  from the human colon and bacteria from the bovine rumen.
AB  == previously, we demonstrated conjugal transfer of a specially constructed shuttle  vector, prdb5, from the human colonic anaerobe bacteroides uniformis to the ruminal anaerobe prevotella (bacteroides) ruminicola b(1)4. we have now shown that naturally occurring gene transfer elements in bacteroides species and prevotella ruminicola can also be transferred between these two genera. a self-transmissible chromosomal element originally found in a clinical isolate of  bacteroides fragilis (tcr emr 12256) was transferred from b. uniformis 0061 to p. ruminicola b(1)4 and from p. ruminicola b(1)4 back to b. uniformis or to another  human colonic species, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. similarly, a conjugative plasmid (prri4) originally found in p. ruminicola 223 was transferred from p. ruminicola b(1)4 to b. uniformis or b. thetaiotaomicron. prri4 could be transferred from the colonic bacteroides species only if the donor strain contained the tcr emr 12256 element in its chromosome. these results show that transfer of naturally occurring elements can be demonstrated under laboratory conditions. evidence that such transfers may actually have occurred in nature came from our finding that the tetracycline resistance (tcr) gene on the p. ruminicola plasmid prri4 hybridized on high-stringency southern blots with the tcr gene found on the bacteroides tcr elements. the presence of the same gene in  such distantly related genera of bacteria is most likely to have occurred as a result of horizontal transfer.

TI  == conjugal transfer of a shuttle vector from the human colonic anaerobe bacteroides uniformis to the ruminal anaerobe prevotella (bacteroides) ruminicola b(1)4.
AB  == prevotella ruminicola (formerly bacteroides ruminicola) is an anaerobic, gram-negative, polysaccharide-degrading bacterium which is found in the rumina of cattle. since p. ruminicola is thought to make an important contribution to digestion of plant material in rumina, the ability to alter this strain genetically might help improve the efficiency of rumen fermentation. however, previously there has been no way to introduce foreign dna into p. ruminicola strains. in this study we transferred a shuttle vector, prdb5, from the colonic species bacteroides uniformis to p. ruminicola b(1)4. the transfer frequency was  10(-6) to 10(-7) per recipient. prdb5 contains sequences from pbr328, a cryptic colonic bacteroides plasmid pb8-51, and a colonic bacteroides tetracycline resistance (tcr) gene. prdb5 was mobilized out of b. uniformis by a self-transmissible bacteroides chromosomal element designated tcr emr 12256. prdb5 replicated in escherichia coli as well as in bacteroides spp. and was also  mobilized from e. coli to b. uniformis by using incp plasmid r751. however, direct transfer from e. coli to p. ruminicola b(1)4 was not detected. thus, to introduce cloned dna into p. ruminicola b(1)4, it was necessary first to mobilize the plasmid from e. coli to b. uniformis and then to mobilize the plasmid from b. uniformis to p. ruminicola b(1)4.
