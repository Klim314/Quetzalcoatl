TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - special references to bacteria isolated between april 2011 and march 2012].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2011 to march 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus  spp., in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by parvimonas micra, collinsella aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus and finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, e. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by p micra and l. acidophilus, in this order. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides caccae, b. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus and b. wadsworthia, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus  spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.

TI  == prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of bacteroides fragilis group isolated from stool samples in north lebanon.
AB  == fifty one strains of the bacteroides fragilis group were isolated from 45 fecal samples. classical phenotypic identification showed that 16 isolates were b. thetaiotaomicron, 12 b. uniformis, 9 b. eggerthii, 7 b. vulgatus, 3 b. caccae, 2  parabacteroides distasonis with 1 identified b. ovatus and 1 b. fragilis. the 51  strains were tested for susceptibility against 16 antimicrobial agents and the mics for metronidazole were determined. the tests showed that imipenem, meropenem and chloramphenicol were the most effective antibiotics (98%, 98% and 92.16% of susceptibility, respectively) followed by ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam, rifampin (88.24% susceptibility), moxifloxacin 86.27% and tigecycline 84.31%. ofloxacin and cefotaxime were the least effective antibiotics with 27.45% and 0% of activity respectively. only six of the 51 isolated strains were resistant to metronidazole with mics = 64 mg/l (1 strain) and > 256 mg/l (5 strains).

TI  == mucosa-associated bacteria in two middle-aged women diagnosed with collagenous colitis.
AB  == aim: to characterize the colon microbiota in two women histologically diagnosed with collagenous colitis using a culture-independent method. methods: biopsies were taken from the ascending colon and the total dna was extracted. universal bacterial primers were used to amplify the bacterial 16s rrna genes. the amplicons were then cloned into competent escherichia coli cells. the clones were sequenced and identified by comparison to known sequences. results: the clones could be divided into 44 different phylotypes. the microbiota was dominated by firmicutes and bacteroidetes. seven phylotypes were found in both patients and constituted 47.5% of the total number of clones. of these, the most dominating were clones similar to bacteroides cellulosilyticus, bacteroides caccae, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides dorei within  bacteroidetes. sequences similar to faecalibacterium prausnitzii and clostridium  citroniae were also found in both patients. conclusion: a predominance of potentially pathogenic bacteroides spp., and the presence of clones showing similarity to clostridium clostridioforme were found but the overall colon microbiota showed similarities to a healthy one. etiologies for collagenous colitis other than an adverse bacterial flora must also be considered.

TI  == influence of environmental and genetic factors linked to celiac disease risk on infant gut colonization by bacteroides species.
AB  == celiac disease (cd) is an immune-mediated enteropathy involving genetic and environmental factors whose interaction might influence disease risk. the aim of  this study was to determine the effects of milk-feeding practices and the hla-dq  genotype on intestinal colonization of bacteroides species in infants at risk of  cd development. this study included 75 full-term newborns with at least one first-degree relative suffering from cd. infants were classified according to milk-feeding practice (breast-feeding or formula feeding) and hla-dq genotype (high or low genetic risk). stools were analyzed at 7 days, 1 month, and 4 months by pcr and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). the bacteroides species diversity index was higher in formula-fed infants than in breast-fed infants. breast-fed infants showed a higher prevalence of bacteroides uniformis at 1 and 4 months of age, while formula-fed infants had a higher prevalence of b. intestinalis at all sampling times, of b. caccae at 7 days and 4 months, and of b. plebeius at 4 months. infants with high genetic risk showed a higher prevalence of b. vulgatus, while those with low genetic risk showed a higher prevalence of b. ovatus, b. plebeius, and b. uniformis. among breast-fed infants, the prevalence of b. uniformis was higher in those with low genetic risk than in  those with high genetic risk. among formula-fed infants, the prevalence of b. ovatus and b. plebeius was increased in those with low genetic risk, while the prevalence of b. vulgatus was higher in those with high genetic risk. the results indicate that both the type of milk feeding and the hla-dq genotype influence the colonization process of bacteroides species, and possibly the disease risk.

TI  == application of quantitative real-time pcr for rapid identification of bacteroides fragilis group and related organisms in human wound samples.
AB  == our goal was to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qrt-pcr) method to detect bacteroides fragilis group and related organisms from clinical specimens. compared to conventional anaerobic culture, qrt-pcr can provide accurate and more rapid detection and identification of b. fragilis group and similar species. b. fragilis group and related organisms are the most frequently isolated anaerobic pathogens from clinical samples. however, culture and phenotypic identification is quite time-consuming. we designed specific primers and probes based on the 16s rrna gene sequences of bacteroides caccae, bacteroides eggerthii, b. fragilis, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides stercoris, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides vulgatus, odoribacter splanchnicus (bacteroides splanchnicus), parabacteroides distasonis (bacteroides distasonis) and parabacteroides merdae (bacteroides merdae), and detected these species by means of qrt-pcr in 400 human surgical wound infection samples or closed abscesses. the target bacteria were detected from 31 samples (8%) by culture, but from 132 samples (33%) by qrt-pcr (p-value < 0.001). b. uniformis was the most common species (44 positive samples) according to qrt-pcr while culture showed it to be b. fragilis (16 positive samples). additionally, for each species qrt-pcr detected higher counts than culture did; this may reflect detecting dna of dead organisms by qrt-pcr. qrt-pcr is a rapid and sensitive method which has great potential for detection of b. fragilis group and related organisms in wound samples.

TI  == lessons learned from the anaerobe survey: historical perspective and review of the most recent data (2005-2007).
AB  == background: the rationale and lessons learned through the evolution of the national survey for the susceptibility of bacteroides fragilis group from its initiation in 1981 through 2007 are reviewed here. the survey was conceived in 1980 to track emerging antimicrobial resistance in bacteroides species. methods:  data from the last 11 years of the survey (1997-2007), including 6574 isolates from 13 medical centers, were analyzed for in vitro antimicrobial resistance to both frequently used and newly developed anti-anaerobic agents. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the antibiotics were determined using agar dilution  in accordance with clinical and laboratory standards institute recommendations. results: the analyses revealed that the carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, and doripenem) and piperacillin-tazobactam were the most active agents against these pathogens, with resistance rates of 0.9%-2.3%. in the most recent 3 years of the survey (2005-2007), resistance to some agents was shown to depend on the species, such as ampicillin-sulbactam against bacteroides distasonis (20.6%)  and tigecycline against bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides eggerthii ( approximately 7%). very high resistance rates (>50%) were noted for moxifloxacin  and trovafloxacin, particularly against bacteroides vulgatus. during that period  of study, non-b. fragilis bacteroides species had >40% resistance to clindamycin. metronidazole-resistant bacteroides strains were also first reported during that  period. conclusions: in summary, resistance to antibiotics was greater among non-b. fragilis bacteroides species than among b. fragilis and was especially greater among species with a low frequency of isolation, such as bacteroides caccae and b. uniformis. the emergence of resistance among the non-b. fragilis bacteroides species underscores the need for speciation of b. fragilis group isolates and for clinicians to be aware of associations between species and drug  resistance.

TI  == relative abundance of bacteroides spp. in stools and wastewaters as determined by hierarchical oligonucleotide primer extension.
AB  == a molecular method, termed hierarchical oligonucleotide primer extension (hope),  was used to determine the relative abundances of predominant bacteroides spp. present in fecal microbiota and wastewaters. for this analysis, genomic dna in feces of healthy human adults, bovines, and swine and in wastewaters was extracted and total bacterial 16s rrna genes were pcr amplified and used as the dna templates for hope. nineteen oligonucleotide primers were designed to detect  14 bacteroides spp. at different hierarchical levels (domain, order, cluster, and species) and were arranged into and used in six multiplex hope reaction mixtures. results showed that species like b. vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. caccae, b.  uniformis, b. fragilis, b. eggerthii, and b. massiliensis could be individually detected in human feces at abundances corresponding to as little as 0.1% of pcr-amplified 16s rrna genes. minor species like b. pyogenes, b. salyersiae, and  b. nordii were detected only collectively using a primer that targeted the b. fragilis subgroup (corresponding to approximately 0.2% of pcr-amplified 16s rrna  genes). furthermore, bac303-related targets (i.e., most bacteroidales) were observed to account for 28 to 44% of pcr-amplified 16s rrna genes from human fecal microbiota, and their abundances were higher than those detected in the bovine and swine fecal microbiota and in wastewaters by factors of five and two,  respectively. these results were comparable to those obtained by quantitative pcr and to those reported previously from studies using whole-cell fluorescence hybridization and 16s rrna clone library methods, supporting the conclusion that  hope can be a sensitive, specific, and rapid method to determine the relative abundances of bacteroides spp. predominant in fecal samples.

TI  == rapid identification of the species of the bacteroides fragilis group by multiplex pcr assays using group- and species-specific primers.
AB  == we report a rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay to identify the 10 bacteroides fragilis group species - bacteroides caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. fragilis, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b. stercoris, b.  thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis and b. vulgatus. these 10 species were first divided into three subgroups by multiplex pcr-g, followed by three multiplex pcr  assays with three species-specific primer mixtures for identification to the species level. the primers were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s rrna, the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and part of the 23s rrna gene. the established two-step multiplex pcr identification scheme was applied to the identification of 155 clinical isolates of the b. fragilis group that were previously identified to the species level by phenotypic tests. the new scheme was more accurate than phenotypic identification, which was accurate only 84.5% of the time. the multiplex pcr scheme established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of the b. fragilis group species. this will permit more accurate assessment of the role of various b. fragilis group members in infections and of the degree of antimicrobial resistance in each of the group members.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin (sb 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  == gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) cfu/spot. comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (du-6859a), penicillin g, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. the mic(50) and mic(90) (mics at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for  clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for fusobacterium varium  (13), 0.5 and 1; for fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for prevotella melaninogenica (11),  1 and 1. gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than  trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were  equivalent against clostridia and p. asaccharolytica. gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (du 6859a) against peptostreptococci, c. perfringens, and c. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria.  sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.

TI  == evaluation of the rapid id 32a system for the identification of the bacteroides fragilis group.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the use of a rapid identification system, rapid id 32a (biomerieux), for the identification of clinically important species in the b. fragilis group. methods: the use of rapid id 32a was validated on 249 clinical isolates, all of which were tested by conventional techniques, and in selected instances api 20a. rapid id 32a (and api 20a as appropriate) was then applied in  a central laboratory to the identification of 1289 b. fragilis group clinical isolates from 22 laboratories in 15 european countries. results: improvements in  the initial database permitted the accurate identification of isolates of b. fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron and b. vulgatus, but further tests, especially for  catalase production, were required to distinguish between b. ovatus and b. uniformis, while an identification of b. distasonis could be accepted only after  careful review of results. there were too few isolates of b. caccae, b. merdae and b. stercoris for us to reach satisfactory conclusions, but further tests are  clearly necessary. conclusions: the study emphasizes the importance of including  sufficient numbers of isolates of different species in the validation of identification methods. rapid id 32a is a reliable system for the identification  of the common species in the b. fragilis group, especially b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron.

TI  == sphingolipid composition in bacteroides species.
AB  == sphingolipid profiles of strains from species of genus bacteroides, and representative strains from prevotella and porphyromonas, were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography and infrared spectrophotometry. two major types of phosphosphingolipid, ceramide phosphorylethanolamine and ceramide phosphorylglycerol, were detected in b. fragilis, b. ovatus, b. uniformis, b. caccae, b. eggerthii, b. thetaiotaomicron, and b. stercoris, but not in b. merdae, b. distasonis, and b. vulgatus. strains from the genera prevotella and porphyromonas also contained these two sphingolipids. these sphingolipid profiles were conserved within the species tested, and may be useful for differentiation and recognition of relationships within the genera bacteroides, prevotella and porphyromonas.

TI  == rapid differentiation of the species of the genus bacteroides sensu stricto by capillary gas chromatography of cellular carbohydrates.
AB  == whole-cell hydrolysates of bacteroides fragilis, the type species of the genus bacteroides castellani and chalmers 1919, and the genetical closely related species b. vulgatus, b. ovatus, b. eggerthii, b. distasonis, b. uniformis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. stercoris, b. merdae, and b. caccae were used to determine characteristic carbohydrate patterns by capillary gas chromatography. on the basis of the chemical derivatization of the carbohydrates seven characteristic peaks for peracetylated aldononitriles and nine characteristic peaks for peracetylated o-methyloximes were selected from the carbohydrate fingerprints of  the reference strains to prepare a dichotomous identification key. the classification of an unknown strain supposed to belong to the formerly called 'bacteroides fragilis group' is possible with this key. some of the advantages of the technique were that the identification of bacteroides fragilis-like strains requires only 4-5 h after primary isolation and that the bacteria can be exposed  to oxygen because viability of the organisms is not necessary. sophisticated anaerobic techniques can therefore be avoided for identification.

TI  == beta-lactamase production, beta-lactam sensitivity and resistance to synergy with clavulanate of 737 bacteroides fragilis group organisms from thirty-three us centres.
AB  == beta-lactamase production and agar dilution sensitivities to amoxycillin, amoxycillin/clavulanate, ticarcillin, ticarcillin/clavulanate, cefoxitin, imipenem and metronidazole were determined for 737 bacteroides fragilis group strains isolated between 1986 and 1988 from 33 us centres. the strains comprised  441 b. fragilis, 114 b. thetaiotaomicron, 35 b. ovatus, 58 b. distasonis, 58 b. vulgatus, 26 b. uniformis and five b. caccae. overall, addition of clavulanate lowered the geometric mean mics of of amoxycillin from 46.7 to 0.6 mg/l, and of ticarcillin from 37.2 to 1.3 mg/l. addition of clavulanate increased the number of strains sensitive to amoxycillin from 9.5% to 90.0%, and to ticarcillin from 68.0% to 98.6%. however, synergy was not observed following addition of clavulanate to amoxycillin and ticarcillin for 48 strains (6.5%). these comprised 15 b. fragilis, two b. ovatus, 21 b. distasonis, six b. vulgatus and four b. uniformis strains. ten of the 15 non-synergic b. fragilis isolates had the features of b. fragilis homology group ii and were susceptible to amoxycillin alone; the other five strains were resistant to amoxycillin and ticarcillin. geometric mean mics (% susceptibility) of the non-synergic strains were as follows: amoxycillin, 6.2 mg/l (68.8); amoxycillin/clavulanate, 4.8 mg/l (72.9);  ticarcillin, 11.8 mg/l (75.0); ticarcillin/clavulanate, 9.4 mg/l (77.1). twenty-six strains (3.5% were resistant (greater than 32 mg/l) to cefoxitin, and  two strains (0.3%) were resistant (4 mg/l) to imipenem. all were susceptible to metronidazole. thus, on the basis of in-vitro activity, metronidazole, imipenem,  ticarcillin/clavulanate, cefoxitin and amoxycillin/clavulanate are indicated for  treatment of infections with b. fragilis strains. the clinical significance of the lack of synergy with clavulanate in the b. fragilis group is unclear; relatively low beta-lactam mics for most of these strains suggests that they may  be amenable to therapy with high doses of beta-lactams. results of this study indicate that it cannot be assumed that clavulanate will uniformly inhibit beta-lactamases in the b. fragilis group (especially b. distasonis) and indicate  the need for identification and susceptibility testing, especially in cases of serious infections with these strains.

TI  == prevotella, a new genus to include bacteroides melaninogenicus and related species formerly classified in the genus bacteroides.
AB  == it was recently proposed that the genus bacteroides should be restricted to bacteroides fragilis (the type species) and closely related organisms (viz., b. caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b. stercoris, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, and b. vulgatus). by contrast, the moderately saccharolytic, predominantly oral bacteroides species, which include b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, and related species, form a phenotypically and phylogenetically coherent group of species which differ so significantly from the emended description of the genus bacteroides that they should not be classified in the same genus. therefore, we formally propose that these species be reclassified in a new genus, prevotella. the type species is prevotella melaninogenica.
