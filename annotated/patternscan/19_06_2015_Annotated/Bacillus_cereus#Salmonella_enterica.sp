TI  == purification and characterization of a novel plantaricin, kl-1y, from lactobacillus plantarum kl-1.
AB  == three bacteriocins from lactobacillus plantarum kl-1 were successfully purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase hplc. the bacteriocin peptides kl-1x, -1y and -1z had molecular masses of 3053.82, 3498.16 and 3533.16 da, respectively. all three peptides were  stable at ph 2-12 and 25 degrees c and at high temperatures of 80 and 100 degrees c for 30 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min. however, they differed in their susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and their inhibition spectra. kl-1y showed  broad inhibitory activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis dmst 17368, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 15442, p. aeruginosa atcc 9027, escherichia coli o157:h7 and e. coli atcc 8739. kl-1x and -1z inhibited only gram-positive bacteria. kl-1x, kl-1y and kl-1z exhibited synergistic activity. the successful amino acid sequencing of kl-1y had a hydrophobicity of approximately 30 % and no cysteine residues suggested its novelty, and it was designated "plantaricin kl-1y". plantaricin kl-1y exhibited bactericidal activity against bacillus cereus jcm 2152(t). compared to nisin, kl-1y displayed broad inhibitory activities of 200, 800, 1600, 800, 400 and 400 au/ml against the growth of bacillus coagulans jcm 2257(t), b. cereus jcm 2152(t), listeria innocua atcc 33090(t), staphylococcus aureus tistr 118, e. coli o157:h7 and e. coli atcc 8739, respectively, whereas nisin had similar activities against only b. coagulans jcm 2257(t) and b. cereus jcm 2152(t). therefore, the novel plantaricin kl-1y is a promising antimicrobial substance for food safety uses in the future.

TI  == antibiotic-resistant bacteria: prevalence in food and inactivation by food-compatible compounds and plant extracts.
AB  == foodborne antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria such as campylobacter jejuni,  bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica,  staphylococcus aureus, vibrio cholerae, and vibrio parahemolyticus can adversely  affect animal and human health, but a better understanding of the factors involved in their pathogenesis is needed. to help meet this need, this overview surveys and interprets much of our current knowledge of antibiotic (multidrug)-resistant bacteria in the food chain and the implications for microbial food safety and animal and human health. topics covered include the origin and prevalence of resistant bacteria in the food chain (dairy, meat, poultry, seafood, and herbal products, produce, and eggs), their inactivation by  different classes of compounds and plant extracts and by the use of chlorine and  physicochemical methods (heat, uv light, pulsed electric fields, and high pressure), the synergistic antimicrobial effects of combinations of natural antimicrobials with medicinal antibiotics, and mechanisms of antimicrobial activities and resistant effects. possible areas for future research are suggested. plant-derived and other safe natural antimicrobial compounds have the  potential to control the prevalence of both susceptible and resistant pathogens in various environments. the collated information and suggested research will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of approaches that could be used to minimize the presence of resistant pathogens in animal feed and human food, thus reducing adverse effects, improving microbial food safety, and helping to prevent or treat animal and human infections.

TI  == biosynthesis, characterization, and antimicrobial applications of silver nanoparticles.
AB  == in the present study, the strain brevibacterium frigoritolerans dc2 was explored  for the efficient and extracellular synthesis of silver nanoparticles. these biosynthesized silver nanoparticles were characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry, which detected the formation of silver nanoparticles in the reaction mixture and showed a maximum absorbance at 420 nm. in addition, field emission transmission electron microscopy revealed the spherical shape of the nanoparticles. the dynamic light scattering results indicated the average particle size of the product was 97 nm with a 0.191 polydispersity index. furthermore, the product was analyzed by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and elemental mapping, which displayed the presence of elemental silver in the product. moreover, on a medical platform, the product was checked against pathogenic microorganisms including vibrio parahaemolyticus, salmonella enterica, bacillus anthracis, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, and candida albicans. the nanoparticles demonstrated antimicrobial activity against all of these pathogenic microorganisms. additionally, the silver nanoparticles were evaluated for their combined effects with the commercial antibiotics lincomycin, oleandomycin, vancomycin, novobiocin, penicillin g, and rifampicin against these pathogenic microorganisms. these results indicated that the combination of antibiotics with biosynthesized silver nanoparticles enhanced the  antimicrobial effects of antibiotics. therefore, the current study is a demonstration of an efficient biological synthesis of silver nanoparticles by b.  frigoritolerans dc2 and its effect on the enhancement of the antimicrobial efficacy of well-known commercial antibiotics.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of active component isolated from lawsonia inermis leaves and structure-activity relationships of its analogues against food-borne bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of lawsonia inermis leaf extract and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone analogues against food-borne bacteria. the antimicrobial activities of five fractions derived from the methanol extract of lawsonia inermis leaves were evaluated against 7 food-borne bacteria. 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone was isolated by chromatographic analyses. 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone showed the strong activities against bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus epidermidis, and s. intermedius, but exerted no growth-inhibitory  activities against s. typhimurium. the antimicrobial activities of the 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone analogues were tested against 7 food-borne bacteria  to establish structure-activity relationships. hydroxyl (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone and 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), methoxy (2-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), and methyl (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, and 5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) functional groups on the 1,4-naphthoquinone skeleton possessed potent activities, whereas bromo (2-bromo-1,4-naphthoquinone and 2,3-dibromo-1,4-naphthoquione) and chloro (2,3-dichloro-1,4-naphthoquinone) exhibited no activity against 7 food-borne bacteria. the l. inermis leaf extract and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone analogues  should be useful as natural antimicrobial agents against food-borne bacteria.

TI  == improved in vitro assay for determining the mucin adherence of bacteria sensitive to triton x-100 treatment.
AB  == mucin-associated microbiota are in relatively close contact with the intestinal epithelium and may thus have a more pronounced effect on host health. we have previously developed a simple mucin agar assay to simulate initial mucus colonization by intestinal microbial communities. adherence of microbiota was estimated using flow cytometry after detachment with triton x-100. in this study, the effect of this detergent on the cultivability of both virulent and commensal  strains was investigated. mucin attachment of selected strains was evaluated using the mucin adhesion assay. bacteria were dislodged from the mucin surface by incubation with triton or from the whole mucin agar layer using a stomacher. mechanical extraction resulted in 1.24 +/- 0.42, 2.69 +/- 0.44, and 1.56 +/- 0.85 log cfu/ml higher plate counts of lactobacillus rhamnosus, bacillus cereus, and escherichia coli strains, respectively, than the chemical method. the sensitivity of bacteria to triton varied among microbial species and strains. among others, triton inhibited the growth of salmonella enterica lmg 10396 and pseudomonas aeruginosa lmg 8029 on laboratory media, although these bacteria maintained their viability during this treatment. only gram-positive strains, enterococcus hirae lmg 6399 and l. rhamnosus gg, were not affected by this detergent. therefore, the mechanical method is recommended for the extraction of mucin-adhered bacteria that are sensitive to triton, especially when followed by traditional cultivation techniques. however, this approach can also be recommended for strains that are not affected by this detergent, because it resulted in higher recovery of adhered l. rhamnosus gg compared to the chemical extraction.

TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in seri kembangan, malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  == this study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around seri kembangan, a city in malaysia. pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of otus with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (otus) observed across all samples. the highest appearance frequencies (100%) were otus closely related to enterobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas sp. and pseudomonas putida. several otus were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, cronobacter sakazaki, cronobacter turisensis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, hafnia alvei, kurthia gibsonii, salmonella bongori, salmonella enterica, salmonella paratyphi, salmonella tyhpi, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. the condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.

TI  == antimicrobial potential of cauliflower, broccoli, and okara byproducts against foodborne bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial potential of cauliflower, broccoli, and okara byproducts was assessed against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, escherichia coli o157:h7, bacillus cereus, and listeria monocytogenes serovar 4b growth behavior was assessed under exposure to 5% vegetable byproducts added to the reference medium, buffered peptone water (0.1%  [wt/vol]), at 37 degrees c. although the byproducts were not effective against l. monocytogenes, they were bactericidal against salmonella typhimurium, e. coli o157:h7, and b. cereus. the most promising results were achieved with the cauliflower-salmonella typhimurium combination, because the bacterial population  was reduced by 3.11 log10 cycles after 10 h of incubation at 37 degrees c as a result of 5% cauliflower addition. further studies were carried out for this combination, at different cauliflower concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, and 15%)  and at temperatures in the range of 5-37 degrees c. the greatest inactivation level (6.11 log10 cycles) was achieved at refrigeration temperature (5 degrees c) using 15% cauliflower addition. both temperature and cauliflower concentration significantly (p</=0.05) influenced the salmonella typhimurium inactivation level. the kinetic parameters were adjusted to mathematical models. the modified  gompertz mathematical model provided an accurate fit (root-mean-square error (rmse) [0.00009-0.21] and adjusted-r(2) [0.81-0.99]) to experimental salmonella typhimurium survival curves describing inactivation kinetics of the pathogen to the antimicrobial effect of cauliflower byproduct.

TI  == propidium monoazide combined with real-time pcr for selective detection of viable staphylococcus aureus in milk powder and meat products.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is a spherical, gram-positive, pathogenic bacterium commonly associated with bovine mastitis and clinical infections. it is also recognized as a pathogen that causes outbreaks of food poisoning. the objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a rapid and reliable technique that combines propidium monoazide (pma) staining with real-time quantitative (q)pcr to detect and quantify viable cells of staph. aureus in milk powder and meat products. the inclusivity and exclusivity of the assay were evaluated using 58 strains belonging to 14 species. serial dilutions of staph. aureus cells were used to establish a standard curve and to confirm the effect of pma treatment. milk powder and meat products were used as the spiked foods, and the ability of pma-qpcr to eliminate nonviable cells was determined in milk powder. furthermore, meat products were inoculated with different concentrations of staph. aureus and  10(5) cfu/g of bacillus cereus and salmonella enterica to test the interference by nontarget microorganisms. when pma treatment was applied before dna extraction, we were able to eliminate false-positive results with little effect on viable cells. the pma-qpcr assay was specific and more sensitive than conventional pcr, and the level of detection was 3.0x10(2) cfu/g in spiked milk powder. additionally, we observed no significant interference for the detection of viable staph. aureus from other nontarget bacteria. the pma-qpcr protocol is an effective and rapid method to quantify viable cells of staph. aureus in food samples. the pma-qpcr assay is specific and reliable, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for routine analysis in food and clinical diagnostic research at  a reasonable cost.

TI  == the cyclic antibacterial peptide enterocin as-48: isolation, mode of action, and  possible food applications.
AB  == enterocin as-48 is a circular bacteriocin produced by enterococcus. it contains a 70 amino acid-residue chain circularized by a head-to-tail peptide bond. the conformation of enterocin as-48 is arranged into five alpha-helices with a compact globular structure. enterocin as-48 has a wide inhibitory spectrum on gram-positive bacteria. sensitivity of gram-negative bacteria increases in combination with outer-membrane permeabilizing treatments. eukaryotic cells are bacteriocin-resistant. this cationic peptide inserts into bacterial membranes and causes membrane permeabilization, leading ultimately to cell death. microarray analysis revealed sets of up-regulated and down-regulated genes in bacillus cereus cells treated with sublethal bacteriocin concentration. enterocin as-48 can be purified in two steps or prepared as lyophilized powder from cultures in whey-based substrates. the potential applications of enterocin as-48 as a food biopreservative have been corroborated against foodborne pathogens and/or toxigenic bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica) and spoilage bacteria (alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, bacillus spp., paenibacillus spp., geobacillus stearothermophilus, brochothrix thermosphacta, staphylococcus carnosus, lactobacillus sakei and other spoilage lactic acid bacteria). the efficacy of enterocin as-48 in food systems increases greatly in combination with chemical preservatives, essential oils, phenolic compounds, and physico-chemical treatments such as sublethal heat, high-intensity pulsed-electric fields or high  hydrostatic pressure.

TI  == effect of white mustard essential oil on the growth of foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms and the effect of food components on its efficacy.
AB  == antimicrobial preservative compounds are added to foods to target specific pathogens and spoilage organisms. white mustard essential oil (wmeo) is an extract that contains 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate, a compound which has been demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity in limited studies. the objective of  this research was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of wmeo against gram-positive and gram-negative spoilage and pathogenic bacteria and determine the effect of food components on the antimicrobial activity. the bacteria escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, enterobacter  aerogenes, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, and lactobacillus fermentum, as well as the acid- and preservative-resistant yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe, were evaluated. all microorganisms were inhibited by wmeo at 8.3 g/liter (equivalent to 1,000 mg/liter 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate). in general, wmeo was more effective against gram-negative than against gram-positive bacteria. salmonella enteritidis and s. pombe were the most sensitive, with inhibition at as low as 2.1 g/liter. the effects on growth profiles varied but included increased lag phases and lethality, indicating both  bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity. soybean oil had a negative effect on the efficacy of wmeo against l. monocytogenes, and at 5% soybean oil, the antimicrobial activity against salmonella enteritidis was eliminated after 48 h.  sodium caseinate at 1% also negated the antimicrobial effect of wmeo against salmonella enteritidis and decreased its effectiveness against l. monocytogenes.  the presence of starch had no significant effect on the antimicrobial activity of wmeo against l. monocytogenes and salmonella enteritidis. thus, wmeo is effective against a wide range of microorganisms and has potential to be used in foods, depending upon the target microorganism and food components present.

TI  == synthesis, characterization and antibacterial activity of biodegradable films prepared from schiff bases of zein.
AB  == pure zein is known to be very hydrophobic, but is still inappropriate for coating and film applications because of their brittle nature. in an attempt to improve the flexibility and the antimicrobial activity of these coatings and films, chemical modification of zein through forming schiff bases with different phenolic aldhydes was tried. influence of this modifications on mechanical, topographical, wetting properties and antimicrobial activity of zein films were evaluated. the chemical structure of the schiff bases films were characterized by atr-ftir spectroscopy. the results indicate an improvement in mechanical properties with chemically modification of zein to form schiff bases leading to a reduction in the elastic modulus. an increase in the elongation at break has been observed, but with slight influence on tensile strength. plasticized zein films have similar initial contact angle ( approximately 40 degrees ). an increase in reaction temperature and time increases film's affinity towards water. as shown by contact angle measurements, a noticeable relation was found between film composition and the hydrophilicity. surface topography also varied by forming schiff bases, becoming rougher than zein-based films. the antibacterial activities of zein and schiff bases of zein-based films were investigated against gram-positive bacteria (listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus and clostridium sporogenes) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica and salmonella enterica). it was found that the antibacterial activity of the schiff bases-based films was more effective than that of zein-based films.

TI  == enhancement of mechanical properties, microstructure, and antimicrobial activities of zein films cross-linked using succinic anhydride, eugenol, and citric acid.
AB  == zein constitutes about half of the endosperm proteins in corn. recently, attempts have been made to utilize zein for food coatings and biodegradable materials, which require better physical properties, using chemical modification of zein. in this study, zein proteins were modified using citric acid, succinic anhydride, and eugenol as natural cross-linking agents in the wet state. the cross-linkers were added either separately or combined in increment concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4%). the effects of those agents on the mechanical properties, microstructure, optical properties, infrared (ir) spectroscopy, and antibacterial activities of zein were investigated. the addition of cross-linking agents promoted changes in the arrangement of groups in zein film-forming particles. regarding the film properties, incorporation of cross-linking agents into zein films prepared in ethanol resulted in two- to three-fold increases in tensile strength (ts) values. according to the fourier-transform infrared (ftir) spectra  and hunter parameters there were no remarkable changes in the structure and color of zein films. transparency of zein films was decreased differentially according  to the type and cross-linker concentration. the mechanical and optical properties of zein films were closely related to their microstructure. all cross-linked films showed remarkable antibacterial activities against bacillus cereus atcc 49064 and salmonella enterica atcc 25566. food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria were affected in a film-dependent manner. our experimental results show that even with partial cross-linking the mechanical properties and antipathogen activities  of zein films were significantly improved, which would be useful for various industrial applications.

TI  == unsaturated fatty acid, cis-2-decenoic acid, in combination with disinfectants or antibiotics removes pre-established biofilms formed by food-related bacteria.
AB  == biofilm formation by food-related bacteria and food-related pathogenesis are significant problems in the food industry. even though much disinfection and mechanical procedure exist for removal of biofilms, they may fail to eliminate pre-established biofilms. cis-2 decenoic acid (cda), an unsaturated fatty acid messenger produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa, is reportedly capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms by multiple types of microorganisms. however, whether cda has potential to boost the actions of certain antimicrobials is unknown. here, the activity of cda as an inducer of pre-established biofilms dispersal, formed by four main food pathogens; staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, salmonella enterica and e. coli, was measured using both semi-batch and continuous cultures bioassays. to assess the ability of cda combined biocides treatments to remove pre-established biofilms formed on stainless steel discs, cfu counts were performed for both treated and untreated cultures. eradication of the biofilms by cda combined antibiotics was evaluated using crystal violet staining. the effect of cda combined treatments (antibiotics and disinfectants) on biofilm surface area and bacteria viability was evaluated using fluorescence microscopy, digital image analysis and live/dead staining. mics were also determined to assess the probable inhibitory effects of cda combined treatments on the growth of tested microorganisms' planktonic cells. treatment of pre-established biofilms with only 310 nm cda resulted in at least two-fold increase in the number of planktonic cells in all cultures. while antibiotics or  disinfectants alone exerted a trivial effect on cfu counts and percentage of surface area covered by the biofilms, combinational treatments with both 310 nm cda and antibiotics or disinfectants led to approximate 80% reduction in biofilm  biomass. these data suggests that combined treatments with cda would pave the way toward developing new strategies to control biofilms with widespread applications in industry as well as medicine.

TI  == antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties of wines and winery byproducts in relation to their flavonoid content.
AB  == grapes produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of the plants against invading phytopathogens. these metabolites include numerous phenolic compounds that are also active against human pathogens. grapes are used  to produce a variety of wines, grape juices, and raisins. grape pomace, seeds, and skins, the remains of the grapes that are a byproduct of winemaking, also contain numerous bioactive compounds that differ from those found in grapes and wines. this overview surveys and interprets our present knowledge of the activities of wines and winery byproducts and some of their bioactive components  against foodborne (bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae, vibrio vulnificus), medical (helicobacter pylori, klebsiella pneumoniae), and oral pathogenic bacteria, viruses (adeno, cytomegalo, hepatitis, noro, rota), fungi (candida albicans, botrytis cinerea), parasites (eimeria tenella, trichomonas vaginalis), and microbial toxins (ochratoxin a, shiga toxin) in culture, in vivo, and in/on food (beef, chicken, frankfurters, hot dogs, lettuce, oysters, peppers, pork, sausages, soup, spinach) in relation to composition and sensory properties. also covered are antimicrobial wine marinades, antioxidative and immunostimulating aspects, and adverse effects  associated with wine consumption. the collated information and suggested research needs might facilitate and guide further studies needed to optimize the use of wines and byproducts to help improve microbial food safety and prevent or treat animal and human infections.

TI  == water-based oligochitosan and nanowhisker chitosan as potential food preservatives for shelf-life extension of minced pork.
AB  == water-based chitosans in the forms of oligochitosan (oligocs) and nanowhisker chitosan (cswk) are proposed as a novel food preservative based on a minced pork  model study. the high surface area with a positive charge over the neutral ph range (ph 5-8) of oligocs and cswk lead to an inhibition against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and bacillus cereus) and gram-negative microbes (salmonella enteritidis and escherichia coli o157:h7). in  the minced pork model, oligocs effectively performs a food preservative for shelf-life extension as clarified from the retardation of microbial growth, biogenic amine formation and lipid oxidation during the storage. oligocs maintains almost all myosin heavy chain protein degradation as observed in the electrophoresis. the present work points out that water-based chitosan with its unique morphology not only significantly inhibits antimicrobial activity but also maintains the meat quality with an extension of shelf-life, and thus has the potential to be used as a food preservative.

TI  == survival of foodborne pathogenic bacteria (bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria monocytogenes) and bacillus cereus spores in fermented alcoholic beverages (beer and refined rice wine).
AB  == only limited information is available on the microbiological safety of fermented  alcoholic beverages because it is still a common belief that such beverages do not provide a favorable environment for bacterial growth and survival. thus, in this study, we examined the survival of major foodborne pathogens and spores in fermented alcoholic beverages. foodborne pathogens (bacillus cereus, escherichia  coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus) and b. cereus spores (initial population, 3 to 4 log cfu/ml) were inoculated separately into three types of beer and refined rice wine, which were then stored at 5 and 22 degrees c. bacterial counts were assayed periodically for up to 28 days. vegetative b. cereus counts decreased rapidly, whereas b. cereus spore counts remained constant (p > 0.05) for a long period of  time in all beverages. vegetative b. cereus cells formed spores in beer at 5 and  22 degrees c, and the spores survived for long periods. among vegetative cells, e. coli o157:h7 had the highest survival (only 1.49 to 1.56 log reduction during  28 days in beer at 5 degrees c). beer and refined rice wine supported microbial survival from several days to several weeks. our results appear to contradict the common belief that pathogens cannot survive in alcoholic beverages. long-term survival of pathogens (especially b. cereus and e. coli o157:h7) in beer and refined rice wine should be taken into consideration by the manufacturers of these beverages. this study provides basic information that should help further research into microbial survival in alcoholic beverages and increase the microbiological safety regulation of fermented alcoholic beverages.

AB  == binary nylon-3 copolymers containing cationic and hydrophobic subunits can mimic  the biological properties of host-defense peptides, but relationships between composition and activity are not yet well understood for these materials. hydrophobic subunits in previously studied examples have been limited mostly to cycloalkane-derived structures, with cyclohexyl proving to be particularly promising. the present study evaluates alternative hydrophobic subunits that are  isomeric or nearly isomeric with the cyclohexyl example; each has four sp(3) carbons in the side chains. the results show that varying the substitution pattern of the hydrophobic subunit leads to relatively small changes in antibacterial activity but causes significant changes in hemolytic activity. we hypothesize that these differences in biological activity profile arise, at least in part, from variations among the conformational propensities of the hydrophobic subunits. the alpha,alpha,beta,beta-tetramethyl unit is optimal among the subunits we have examined, providing copolymers with potent antibacterial activity and excellent prokaryote vs eukaryote selectivity. bacteria do not readily develop resistance to the new antibacterial nylon-3 copolymers. these findings suggest that variation in subunit conformational properties could be generally valuable in the development of synthetic polymers for biological applications.

TI  == the first report on flavonoid isolation from annona crassiflora mart.
AB  == annona crassiflora, a native tree from brazilian cerrado, is reported to possess  several ethnomedical uses. here, we report the isolation and unambiguous characterisation of the flavonoids quercetin-3-o-beta-d-glucopyranosil(1 --> 6)-o-alpha-l-arabinoside (1), known as peltatoside, kaempferol-3-o-beta-d-galactopyranoside (2), quercetin-3-o-beta-d-galactopyranoside (3), quercetin-3-o-beta-l-arabinopiranoside (4) and the ( - )-epicatechin (5) from the hydroalcoholic portion of the leaf ethanolic extract. their structures were elucidated by using 1d and 2d nmr, esi-ms, uv/vis spectroscopy, optical rotation  analysis and literature data comparison. the leaf ethanolic extract and its isolated compounds were evaluated by using antimicrobial, antioxidant and larvicidal assays, expressing antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. this is the first report on flavonoid isolation from a. crassiflora.

TI  == trifolium pratense l. as a potential natural antioxidant.
AB  == the essential oils of three different growth stages of trifolium pratense l. (tp1, tp2 and tp3) were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and  tested for their antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. the highest content of volatile compounds was found in the essential oil sample tp1, where terpenes such as beta-myrcene (4.55%), p-cymene (3.59%), limonene (0.86%), tetrahydroionone (1.56%) were highlighted due to their biological activity. the antioxidant activity was determined by following the scavenging capacity of the essential oils for the free radicals dpph., no. and o2.-, as well as effects of the investigated oils on lipid peroxidation (lp). in all three cases, the sample tp1  showed the best radical-capturing capacity for dpph. (27.61+/-0.12 microg/ml), no. (16.03+/-0.11 microg/ml), o2.- (16.62+/-0.29 microg/ml) and also had the best lipid peroxidation effects in the fe2+/ascorbate induction system (9.35+/-0.11 microg/ml). antimicrobial activity was evaluated against the following bacteria cultures: escherichia coli (atcc10526), salmonella typhimurium (atcc 14028), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 11632) and bacillus cereus (atcc 10876). none of the  examined essential oil samples showed inhibitory effects on the tested bacterial  strains.

TI  == a large outbreak of salmonellosis associated with sandwiches contaminated with multiple bacterial pathogens purchased via an online shopping service.
AB  == food sold over the internet is an emerging business that also presents a concern  with regard to food safety. a nationwide foodborne disease outbreak associated with sandwiches purchased from an online shop in july 2010 is reported. consumers were telephone interviewed with a structured questionnaire and specimens were collected for etiological examination. a total of 886 consumers were successfully contacted and completed the questionnaires; 36.6% had become ill, with a median incubation period of 18 h (range, 6-66 h). the major symptoms included diarrhea (89.2%), abdominal pain (69.8%), fever (47.5%), headache (32.7%), and vomiting (17.3%). microbiological laboratories isolated salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, salmonella virchow, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli from the contaminated sandwiches, salmonella enteritidis and salmonella virchow from the patients, and salmonella enteritidis  and staphylococcus aureus from food handlers. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis genotyping suggested a common origin of salmonella bacteria recovered from the patients, food, and a food handler. among the pathogens detected, the symptoms and incubation period indicated that salmonella, likely of egg origin, was the probable causative agent of the outbreak. this outbreak illustrates the importance of meticulous hygiene practices during food preparation and temperature control during food shipment and the food safety challenges posed by  online food-shopping services.

TI  == novel highly thermostable endolysin from thermus scotoductus mat2119 bacteriophage ph2119 with amino acid sequence similarity to eukaryotic peptidoglycan recognition proteins.
AB  == in this study, we present the discovery and characterization of a highly thermostable endolysin from bacteriophage ph2119 infecting thermus strain mat2119 isolated from geothermal areas in iceland. nucleotide sequence analysis of the 16s rrna gene affiliated the strain with the species thermus scotoductus. bioinformatics analysis has allowed identification in the genome of phage 2119 of an open reading frame (468 bp in length) coding for a 155-amino-acid basic protein with an mr of 17,555. ph2119 endolysin does not resemble any known thermophilic phage lytic enzymes. instead, it has conserved amino acid residues (his(30), tyr(58), his(132), and cys(140)) that form a zn(2+) binding site characteristic of t3 and t7 lysozymes, as well as eukaryotic peptidoglycan recognition proteins, which directly bind to, but also may destroy, bacterial peptidoglycan. the purified enzyme shows high lytic activity toward thermophiles, i.e., t. scotoductus (100%), thermus thermophilus (100%), and thermus flavus (99%), and also, to a lesser extent, toward mesophilic gram-negative bacteria, i.e., escherichia coli (34%), serratia marcescens (28%), pseudomonas fluorescens  (13%), and salmonella enterica serovar panama (10%). the enzyme has shown no activity against a number of gram-positive bacteria analyzed, with the exception  of deinococcus radiodurans (25%) and bacillus cereus (15%). ph2119 endolysin was  found to be highly thermostable: it retains approximately 87% of its lytic activity after 6 h of incubation at 95 degrees c. the optimum temperature range for the enzyme activity is 50 degrees c to 78 degrees c. the enzyme exhibits lytic activity in the ph range of 6 to 10 (maximum at ph 7.5 to 8.0) and is also  active in the presence of up to 500 mm nacl.

TI  == physicochemical properties of gelatin/silver nanoparticle antimicrobial composite films.
AB  == active nanocomposite films were prepared by blending aqueous solutions of gelatin with different concentrations of silver nanoparticles (agnps) using a solvent casting method. formation of silver nanoparticles in the solution and films was confirmed with the surface plasmon resonance (spr) band at 400-450 nm, measured by uv-vis absorption spectroscopy. the incorporation of agnps slightly affected the physical and mechanical properties of the films. increase in the concentration of agnps resulted in a substantial decrease in water vapour permeability (wvp) and tensile strength (ts) of the gelatin films. energy dispersive x-ray (edx) spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction (xrd) analysis confirmed the presence of elemental silver and crystalline structure of the agnps in the gelatin film. microscopic surface structure and thermal properties of the  films were also examined by fe-sem and thermogravimetric analysis. gelatin/agnps  nanocomposite films exhibited strong antibacterial activity against food-borne pathogens. gelatin/agnps nanocomposite films are expected to have high potential  as an active food packaging system to maintain food safety and to extend the shelf-life of packaged foods.

TI  == bacillus cereus var. toyoi modulates the immune reaction and reduces the occurrence of diarrhea in piglets challenged with salmonella typhimurium dt104.
AB  == a feeding trial with sows and their piglets was performed with the probiotic feed additive bacillus cereus var. toyoi in two consecutive experimental periods. sows (n = 8) were allocated into treatment (bc) and control (co) groups. sows of bc group (n = 4) were fed 3.14 x 10(5) cfu/g bacillus cereus var. toyoi with the diet from d 87 of pregnancy on. their piglets received bacillus cereus var. toyoi supplemented feed (8.7 x 10(5) cfu/g) starting on d 14 of life and further on after weaning (6.5 x 10(5) cfu/g), whereas sows and piglets of the co group remained untreated. one day after weaning, piglets from both groups (n = 24 each) were challenged orally with salmonella typhimurium dt104 (3 x 10(9) viable bacteria). health status, shedding of b. cereus in the feces, and performance of  the piglets were monitored. at 24 h, 72 h, 6 d, and 28 d postinfection (pi), six  piglets from each group were euthanized and cell counts of salmonellae were determined in the colon contents, mesenteric lymph nodes, and tonsils. peripheral blood mononuclear cells and jejunal intraepithelial lymphocytes (iel) were analyzed by flow cytometry. the incidence of scours was lower in the bc group than in the co group (p = 0.004). in addition, the fecal shedding of salmonella was significantly lower in the bc group at 25 d pi (p = 0.004). shortly after infection, the gammadelta t cells were significantly less frequent in the blood of bc piglets. for both cd8-positive gammadelta t cells (p = 0.033) and cd8-negative gammadelta t cells (p = 0.028), significant differences were observed. furthermore, 28 d pi piglets from the treated group showed lower numbers of gammadelta t cells in the jejunal epithelium (p = 0.036). to investigate the role of intestinal gammadelta t cells during the infection with s. typhimurium, iel were gained from six healthy 40-d-old piglets and infected in vitro with s. typhimurium. cd8beta cells and gammadelta t cells were detected by  flow cytometry and the infection rates of both populations in the cell suspensions were compared. the infection rate (ir) of gammadelta t cells was higher in all six cell suspensions than the ir of cd8beta expressing t cells (p = 0.002). in conclusion, b. cereus var. toyoi supplementation of sows and their piglets had a positive impact on the health status of the piglets after a challenge with salmonella, likely due to an altered immune response marked by reduced frequencies of cd8+ gammadelta t cells in the peripheral blood and the jejunal epithelium.

TI  == an hplc-tandem mass spectrometry method for simultaneous detection of alkylated base excision repair products.
AB  == dna glycosylases excise a broad spectrum of alkylated, oxidized, and deaminated nucleobases from dna as the initial step in base excision repair. substrate specificity and base excision activity are typically characterized by monitoring  the release of modified nucleobases either from a genomic dna substrate that has  been treated with a modifying agent or from a synthetic oligonucleotide containing a defined lesion of interest. detection of nucleobases from genomic dna has traditionally involved hplc separation and scintillation detection of radiolabeled nucleobases, which in the case of alkylation adducts can be laborious and costly. here, we describe a mass spectrometry method to simultaneously detect and quantify multiple alkylpurine adducts released from genomic dna that has been treated with n-methyl-n-nitrosourea (mnu). we illustrate the utility of this method by monitoring the excision of n3-methyladenine (3 ma) and n7-methylguanine (7 mg) by a panel of previously characterized prokaryotic and eukaryotic alkylpurine dna glycosylases, enabling a comparison of substrate specificity and enzyme activity by various methods. detailed protocols for these methods, along with preparation of genomic and oligonucleotide alkyl-dna substrates, are also described.

TI  == in vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of chinese crested and yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. thirty seven isolates were identified as lactobacillus or enterococcus. out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (lab) and belonged to the species lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other lab isolates were enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%).  strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (ph 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. all isolates produced low rates of  hydrogen peroxide. based on these results, two lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.

TI  == selection of dna aptamers for capture and detection of salmonella typhimurium using a whole-cell selex approach in conjunction with cell sorting.
AB  == alternative ligands such as nucleic acid aptamers can be used for pathogen capture and detection and offer advantages over antibodies, including reduced cost, ease of production and modification, and improved stability. dna aptamers demonstrating binding specificity to salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium were identified by whole-cell-systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (selex) beginning with a combinatorial library of biotin-labeled single stranded dna molecules. aptamer specificity was achieved using whole-cell  counter-selex against select non-salmonella genera. aptamers binding to salmonella were sorted, cloned, sequenced, and characterized for binding efficiency. out of 18 candidate aptamers screened, aptamer s8-7 showed relatively high binding affinity with an apparent dissociation constant (k d value) of 1.73  +/- 0.54 mum and was selected for further characterization. binding exclusivity analysis of s8-7 showed low apparent cross-reactivity with other foodborne bacteria including escherichia coli o157: h7 and citrobacter braakii and moderate cross-reactivity with bacillus cereus. aptamer s8-7 was successfully used as a ligand for magnetic capture of serially diluted salmonella typhimurium cells, followed by downstream detection using qpcr. the lower limit of detection of the  aptamer magnetic capture-qpcr assay was 10(2)-10(3) cfu equivalents of salmonella typhimurium in a 290-mul sample volume. mean capture efficiency ranged from 3.6 to 12.6 %. unique aspects of the study included (a) the use of selex targeting whole cells; (b) the application of flow cytometry for aptamer pool selection, thereby favoring purification of ligands with both high binding affinity and targeting abundant cell surface moieties; and (c) the use of pre-labeled primers  that circumvented the need for post-selection ligand labeling. taken together, this study provides proof-of-concept that biotinylated aptamers selected by whole-cell selex can be used in a qpcr-based capture-detection platform for salmonella typhimurium.

AB  == manzanilla alorena (or alorena) table olives are naturally fermented traditional  green olives with a denomination of protection (dop). the aim of this study was to search for lactic acid bacteria (lab) with technological properties of interest for possible inclusion in a starter or protective culture preparation or also as probiotics. a collection of 144 lab obtained from alorena green table olives naturally-fermented by four small-medium enterprises (smes) from malaga (spain), including lactobacilli (81.94%), leuconostocs (10.42%) and pediococci (7.64%) were studied. rep-pcr clustering and further identification of strains by sequencing of phes and rpo genes revealed that all lactobacilli from the different smes were lactobacillus pentosus. pediococci were identified as pediococcus parvulus (sme1) and leuconostocs as leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (sme1 and sme4). genotyping revealed that strains were not clonally related and exhibited a considerable degree of genomic diversity specially for lactobacilli and also for leuconostocs. some strains exhibit useful technological properties such as production of antimicrobial substances active against pathogenic bacteria such as listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans and salmonella enterica, utilization of raffinose and stachyose, production of bile salt hydrolase, phytase and haeme-dependent catalase activities, growth at 10 degrees c and in the presence of 6.5% nacl, good acidifying capacity and also resistance to freezing. however, none of the isolates showed protease or amylase activity, and also did not exhibit biogenic amine production from histidine, ornithine, cysteine or tyrosine. on the basis of data obtained, selected strains with potential traits were tested for their survival at low ph and their tolerance to bile salts, and the survival capacity demonstrated by some of the analysed strains are encouraging to further study their potential as probiotics.

AB  == the aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella enterica ser. enteritidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. the tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. in the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the ph values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. the inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. phosphates obviously made the development of most gram-positive bacteria impossible. especially micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. on the other  hand, gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. the exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. it should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates hexa68 and hexa70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. by comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be  concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on ph values.

TI  == modulation of cell surface hydrophobicity and attachment of bacteria to abiotic surfaces and shrimp by malaysian herb extracts.
AB  == the use of simple crude water extracts of common herbs to reduce bacterial attachment may be a cost-effective way to control bacterial foodborne pathogens,  particularly in developing countries. the ability of water extracts of three common malaysian herbs (andrographis paniculata, eurycoma longifolia, and garcinia atroviridis) to modulate hydrophobicity and attachment to surfaces of five food-related bacterial strains (bacillus cereus atcc 14576, escherichia coli atcc 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 10145, salmonella enteritidis atcc 13076, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923) were determined. the bacterial attachment to hydrocarbon assay was used to determine bacterial hydrophobicity. staining and direct microscopic counts were used to determine attachment of bacteria to glass  and stainless steel. plating on selective media was used to determine attachment  of bacteria to shrimp. all extracts were capable of either significantly ( p < 0.05) increasing or decreasing bacterial surface hydrophobicity, depending on the herb extract and bacteria combination. bacterial attachment to all surfaces was either significantly (p < 0.05) increased or decreased, depending on the herb extract and bacteria combination. overall, hydrophobicity did not show a significant correlation (p > 0.05) to bacterial attachment. for specific combinations of bacteria, surface material, and plant extract, significant correlations (r > 0.80) between hydrophobicity and attachment were observed. the  highest of these was observed for s. aureus attachment to stainless steel and glass after treatment with the e. longifolia extract (r = 0.99, p < 0.01). the crude water herb extracts in this study were shown to have the potential to modulate specific bacterial and surface interactions and may, with further work,  be useful for the simple and practical control of foodborne pathogens.

TI  == identification of a new bacillus licheniformis strain producing a bacteriocin-like substance.
AB  == the emergence of antibiotic resistance has spurred a great number of studies for  development of new antimicrobials in the past decade. the purpose of this study was to screen environmental samples for bacillus strains producing potent antimicrobial agents. a new strain, which showed strong antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus and salmonella enterica ser. pullorum, was isolated from soil and designated as b116. this new isolate was identified as bacillus licheniformis by morphological, biochemical and genetic analyses. the production  of bacteriocin-like substance (bls) started at early exponential phase and achieved highest level at early stationary phase. the bls was precipitated by ammonium sulfate and its molecular mass was determined as approximately 4 kda by  sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). culture supernatant of the new isolate exhibited antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, micrococcus luteus, escherichia coli, and salmonella spp. the bls was resistant to heat, acid and alkaline treatment. activity of the bls was totally lost after digestion by pronase and partially lost after digestion by papain and lipase. the new isolate and relevant bls are potentially useful in food and feed applications.

TI  == antibacterial characteristics and activity of water-soluble chitosan derivatives  prepared by the maillard reaction.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of water-soluble chitosan derivatives prepared by maillard reactions against staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, shigella dysenteriae, and salmonella typhimurium was examined. relatively high antibacterial activity against various  microorganisms was noted for the chitosan-glucosamine derivative as compared to the acid-soluble chitosan. in addition, it was found that the susceptibility of the test organisms to the water-soluble chitosan derivative was higher in deionized water than in saline solution. metal ions were also found to reduce the antibacterial activity of the water-soluble chitosan derivative on s. aureus. the marked increase in glucose level, protein content and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) activity was observed in the cell supernatant of s. aureus exposed to the water-soluble chitosan derivative in deionized water. the results suggest that the water-soluble chitosan produced by maillard reaction may be a promising commercial substitute for acid-soluble chitosan.

TI  == protection activity of a novel probiotic strain of bacillus subtilis against salmonella enteritidis infection.
AB  == the activity of 240 bacterial isolates screened from the gastrointestinal tracts  of native chickens were evaluated for use as a potential probiotic in food animal production in order to protect against animal diseases and reduce pathogenic contamination of human food products. in observing the antagonistic activity of 117 bacilli isolates, 10 of these isolates exhibited higher growth inhibition of  seven foodborne pathogens, including salmonella enteritidis, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and vibrio cholerae. beneficial probiotic criteria from these isolates - which included non-pathogenicity, acid and bile salt tolerance, hydrophobicity, and adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells - exhibited that one  isolate of nc11 had the most potential as a probiotic. 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that this nc11 isolate was bacillus subtilis. this b. subtilis nc11 was sensitive to all antibiotics and was not cytotoxic to intestinal epithelial cells. reduction of s. enteritidis attachment to the surfaces of intestinal epithelial cells via action of a cultured medium from b. subtilis nc11 was observed by scanning electron microscopy. b. subtilis nc11 cells, as well as the  bacterial cultured medium or the cultured medium adjusted to ph 7, significantly  inhibited s. enteritidis invasion (p<0.01) of intestinal epithelial cells. this study indicates that b. subtilis nc11 has characteristics of a potential probiotic, and exhibits strong inhibition activity against s. enteritidis infection to intestinal epithelial cells.

TI  == antibacterial activity of chemically defined chitosans: influence of molecular weight, degree of acetylation and test organism.
AB  == chitosans, polysaccharides obtained from the exoskeleton of crustaceans, have been shown to exert antibacterial activity in vitro and their use as a food preservative is of growing interest. however, beyond a consensus that chitosan appears to disrupt the bacterial cell membrane, published data are inconsistent on the chemical characteristics that confer the antibacterial activity of chitosan. while most authors agree that the net charge density of the polymer (reflected in the fraction of positively charged amino groups at the c-2 position of the glucosamine unit) is an important factor in antibacterial activity, conflicting data have been reported on the effect of molecular weight and on the  susceptibility among different bacterial species to chitosan. therefore, we prepared batches of water-soluble hydrochloride salts of chitosans with weight average molecular weights (m(w)) of 2-224kda and degree of acetylation of 0.16 and 0.48. their antibacterial activity was evaluated using tube inhibition assays and membrane integrity assays (n-phenyl-1-naphthylamine fluorescence and potassium release) against bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium and three lipopolysaccharide mutants of e. coli and s. typhimurium. chitosans with lower degree of acetylation (f(a)=0.16) were more active than the  more acetylated chitosans (f(a)=0.48). no trends in antibacterial action related  to increasing or decreasing m(w) were observed although one of the chitosans (m(w) 28.4kda, f(a)=0.16) was more active than the other chitosans, inhibiting growth and permeabilizing the membrane of all the test strains included. the test strains varied in their susceptibility to the different chitosans with wild type  s. typhimurium more resistant than the wild type e. coli. salmonellae lipopolysaccharide mutants were more susceptible than the matched wild type strain. our results show that the chitosan preparation details are critically important in identifying the antibacterial features that target different test organisms.

AB  == chitosan has proven antimicrobial properties against planktonic cell growth. little is known, however, about its effects on already established biofilms. oriented for application in food industry disinfection, the effectiveness of both medium molecular weight (mmw) chitosan and its enzymatically hydrolyzed product was tested against mature biofilms of four pathogenic strains, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus and salmonella enterica, and a food spoilage species, pseudomonas fluorescens. unexpectedly, log reductions were in some cases higher for biofilm than for planktonic cells. one hour exposure to mmw chitosan (1% w/v) caused a 6 log viable cell reduction on l. monocytogenes monospecies mature biofilms and reduced significantly (3-5 log reductions) the attached population of the other organisms tested, except s. aureus. pronase-treated chitosan was more effective than mmw chitosan on all tested microorganisms, also with the exception of s. aureus, offering best results (8 log units) against the attached cells of b. cereus. these treatments open a new possibility to fight against mature biofilms in the food industry.

AB  == this study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-o-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were gram-negative bacteria. the mics of gallotannins against bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium botulinum, campylobacter jejuni,  listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. the use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of s. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. supplementation of lb medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of s. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. hepta-o-galloylglucose sensitized lactobacillus plantarum tmw1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (mdr) transporter hora. carbohydrate metabolism of lactococcus lactis mg1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-o-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. in conclusion, the  inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.

AB  == in this study, an effective substance was isolated from bacillus subtilis sc-8, which was obtained from traditionally fermented soybean paste, cheonggukjang. the substance was purified by hplc, and its properties were analyzed. it had an adequate antagonistic effect on bacilluscereus, and its spectrum of activity was  narrow. when tested on several gram-negative and gram-positive foodborne pathogenic bacteria such as salmonella enterica, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria monocytogenes, no antagonistic effect was observed. applying the derivative from b. subtilis sc-8 within the same genus did not inhibit the growth of major soybean-fermenting bacteria such as bacillus subtilis, bacillus licheniformis, and bacillus amyloquefaciens. the range of ph stability of the purified antagonistic substance was wide (from 4.0 to >10.0), and the substance was thermally stable up to 60 degrees c. in the various enzyme  treatments, the antagonistic activity of the purified substance was reduced with  proteinase k, protease, and lipase; its activity was partially destroyed with esterase. spores of b. cereus did not grow at all in the presence of 5mug/ml of the purified antagonistic substance. the isolated antagonistic substance was thought to be an antibiotic-like lipopeptidal compound and was tentatively named  bsap-254 because it absorbed to uv radiation at 254nm.

TI  == synergistic effects of ethanol and uv radiation to reduce levels of selected foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine whether combined treatments would produce synergistic disinfection effects on food products during food processing  compared with single treatments. we investigated the bactericidal effects of a commercial chemical disinfectant (ethanol) and of uv radiation on bacillus cereus f4810/72, cronobacter sakazakii kctc 2949, staphylococcus aureus atcc 35556, escherichia coli atcc 10536, and salmonella enterica typhimurium no/na in vitro.  various concentrations of ethanol (10, 30, 40, and 50%) were tested with various  exposure doses of uv radiation (6, 96, 216, 360, and 504 mws/cm(2)) with a uv lamp. the combined ethanol-uv treatments resulted in greater reductions in bacterial counts than did either treatment alone. the synergistic effect values for b. cereus, c. sakazakii, s. aureus, s. enterica typhimurium no/na, and e. coli were 0.40 to 1.52, 0.52 to 1.74, 0.20 to 2.32, 0.07 to 1.14, and 0.02 to 1.75 log cfu/ml, respectively. the results of this study suggest that a significant synergistic benefit results from combining ethanol and uv treatments  against foodborne pathogens in vitro.

TI  == antibacterial activity of carvacrol and 2-nitro-1-propanol against single and mixed populations of foodborne pathogenic bacteria in corn flour dough.
AB  == cereal doughs are an important part of human diet, but at the same time can act as vehicles for the transmission of human pathogenic bacteria. in the present study, four pathogenic or toxinogenic bacteria (escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus) were inoculated in a dough made from corn flour in combination with the single antimicrobial compounds carvacrol and 2-nitro-1-propanol (2npoh). survival of single and mixed populations in the treated doughs incubated at 37 degrees c was followed by culture-dependent and independent methods (ttge). all strains were completely inactivated within 24 h by the tested compounds at 5% final concentration, but showed variable inhibition at lower concentrations of 0.5% and 2%. sensitivity to antimicrobial compounds was in general modified when strains were tested in cocultures compared with single cultures. b. cereus was more sensitive to carvacrol (minimum bactericidal concentration, mbc, 0.5%) in coculture with s. aureus. it was also more sensitive to 2npoh in cocultures with  s. aureus and with s. enterica (mbc, 2% in both cases). s. aureus was more resistant to carvacrol (mbc, 5%) in cocultures with b. cereus, e. coli, as well as s. enterica. however, sensitivity to 2npoh was not modified in any of the coculture experiments (mbc, 2%). e. coli was more resistant to carvacrol (mbc, 5%) in cocultures with s. aureus and with s. enterica. resistance of e. coli to 2npoh also increased in cocultures with b. cereus (mbc, 5%) and with s. aureus (mbc, 2%), but not with s. enterica (mbc, 0.5%). s. enterica was more resistant to carvacrol (mbc, 5%) in cocultures with e. coli, but it was more sensitive to 2npoh in cocultures with b. cereus as well as with s. aureus (mbc, 2% in both cases). ttge analysis of survivors from cocultures treated with 2npoh or carvacrol allowed a good estimation of the identity of survivors according to their dna band patterns. results from this study indicate that the efficacy of antimicrobials such as carvacrol and 2npoh is greatly influenced by the complexity of the microbial populations under target and the relationships between individual populations.

TI  == photodynamic antimicrobial activity of avian eggshell pigments.
AB  == pigmentation in avian eggshells appears to be associated with shell strength, temperature regulation, and camouflage. the pigments found in eggshells are mainly porphyrins, which have been utilized therapeutically as photosensitizers.  here, we examined the photoinactivation of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus,  bacillus cereus) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis) by hen eggshells and their pigments. the results indicated that eggshells have a light-dependent antimicrobial activity against gram-positive, but not gram-negative, bacteria. our results indicate the possibility that the natural pigments used therapeutically have evolved in nature as a defence system.

TI  == a pilot study of the microbiological quality of culturally diverse, ready-to-eat  foods from selected retail establishments in melbourne, australia.
AB  == in recent years, there has been an increasing number of foodborne outbreaks linked to the consumption of culturally diverse foods. this appears to be because of the increasing quantity of culturally diverse foods available and a preference to store these foods, some of which are considered potentially hazardous, at ambient temperature. this practice may contravene temperature requirements defined by the food standards code. a lack of understanding of the hazardous nature of some culturally prepared foods also poses difficulties in applying the  australian food safety legislation by regulators. this pilot study examined the normal microbiota of four culturally diverse foods: nem chua, che dau trang, kueh talam, and banh tet nhan man, which are traditionally stored and consumed at ambient temperature. challenge testing was conducted to investigate the ability of these foods to support the growth of foodborne bacterial pathogens. two of the products (kueh talam and che dau) were found to be microbiologically unsatisfactory because of the high standard plate counts. challenge testing indicated that kueh talam, che dau, and banh tet nhan man were able to support the growth of bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and salmonella (1-2 log increases over 6 hours at 25 degrees c), suggesting that these foods may require temperature control during storage. however, nem chua was unable to support the growth of test bacteria, probably because of its acidic nature (ph 4.5), suggesting that ambient storage of this food may be safe. this study provided some preliminary evidence to support the need for further sampling and challenge testing of these products.

TI  == synergistic effects of the lactobacillus acidophilus surface layer and nisin on bacterial growth.
AB  == we have previously described a murein hydrolase activity for the surface layer (s-layer) of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356. here we show that, in combination with nisin, this s-layer acts synergistically to inhibit the growth of pathogenic gram-negative salmonella enterica and potential pathogenic gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus. in addition, bacteriolytic effects were observed for the gram-positive species tested. we postulate that the s-layer enhances the access of nisin into the cell membrane by enabling it to cross the cell wall, while nisin provides the sudden ion-nonspecific dissipation of the proton motive force required to enhance the s-layer murein hydrolase activity.

TI  == antioxidant, anti-microbial and antimutagenicity activities of pistachio (pistachia vera) green hull extract.
AB  == antioxidant, anti-microbial and antimutagenicity activities of pistachio (ahmadaghaei variety) green hull extracts (crude and purified extracts) were studied. at first, different solvents were compared for determining of the best solvent for extraction of phenolic compounds from pistachio green hull. water and acetonitrile with 49.32 and 6.22 (mg of gallic acid equivalents/g sample) were the best and the worst solvent in the extraction of phenolic compounds, respectively. the antioxidant capacity of crude and purified extracts were assessed through abts assay, dpph assay and beta-carotene bleaching (bcb) method. a concentration-dependent antioxidative capacity was verified in abts, dpph assays and bcb method. the anti-microbial capacity was screened against gram positive and gram negative bacteria, and fungi. aqueous and purified extracts inhibited the growth of gram positive bacteria; bacillus cereus was the most susceptible one with mic of 1mg/ml and 0.5mg/ml for the crude and purified extracts, respectively. the results of antimutagenicity test showed that phenolic compounds of pistachio green hull have antimutagenicity activity against direct mutagen of 2-nitrofluorene. the results obtained indicate that pistachio green hull may become important as a cheap and noticeable source of compounds with health protective potential and anti-microbial activity.

TI  == inhibition of salmonella enteritidis by cerein 8a, edta and sodium lactate.
AB  == the ability of the bacteriocin cerein 8a to inhibit salmonella enteritidis in combination with edta and sodium lactate was investigated. salmonella enteritidis was incubated with combinations of cerein 8a (3200au/ml) and edta (20, 50, 100 mmol/l) or sodium lactate (200 mmol/l). all treatments caused a significant reduction in the od(600) values of salmonella enteritidis cultures. the addition  of cerein 8a plus edta resulted in higher inhibition in comparison with the bacteriocin alone; the greater the concentration of edta, the greater the inhibitory effect. the combination of cerein 8a plus 100 mmol/l edta results in a more efficient treatment to reduce the number of viable cells of salmonella enteritidis. the combination of cerein 8a plus sodium lactate also showed significant inhibition of the indicator organism. transmission electron microscopy showed damaged cell walls and loss of protoplasmic material in treated cells. the cells of salmonella enteritidis treated with cerein 8a plus edta appeared more injured. the bacteriocin cerein 8a may be useful to inhibit gram-negative bacteria, with enhanced effect in combination with chelating agents. control of salmonella enteritidis, a gram-negative bacterium constantly linked to food outbreaks, addresses an important aspect of food safety.

TI  == detection of enterobacter sakazakii and other pathogens associated with infant formula powder by use of a dna microarray.
AB  == pathogen detection is critical to the process of generating and testing powdered  infant formula (pif). an obstacle associated with pif microbial surveillance is that most current procedures are time-consuming and labor-intensive. we have developed a rapid, dna microarray-based detection technique to identify 10 different pathogenic bacteria associated with pif contamination based on the 16s-23s rrna gene internal transcribed spacer (its) sequences and wzy (o antigen  polymerase) gene. using this procedure, enterobacter sakazakii, salmonella enterica, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus  aureus, and escherichia coli o157 were identified. one hundred eighty-five strains were used to validate the microarray assay (including 134 target pathogen strains and 51 closely related bacteria). twenty-seven probes reproducibly detected multiple pathogens with high specificity and sensitivity (0.100 ng genomic dna or 10(4) cfu/ml). twenty-one real pif samples were tested by the microarray with 100% accuracy. the data presented reveal that the designed oligonucleotide microarray is a promising method for basic microbiology, clinical diagnosis, food safety, and epidemiological surveillance.

TI  == microbial co-habitation and lateral gene transfer: what transposases can tell us.
AB  == background: determining the habitat range for various microbes is not a simple, straightforward matter, as habitats interlace, microbes move between habitats, and microbial communities change over time. in this study, we explore an approach using the history of lateral gene transfer recorded in microbial genomes to begin to answer two key questions: where have you been and who have you been with? results: all currently sequenced microbial genomes were surveyed to identify pairs of taxa that share a transposase that is likely to have been acquired through lateral gene transfer. a microbial interaction network including almost 800 organisms was then derived from these connections. although the majority of the connections are between closely related organisms with the same or overlapping habitat assignments, numerous examples were found of cross-habitat and cross-phylum connections. conclusions: we present a large-scale study of the  distributions of transposases across phylogeny and habitat, and find a significant correlation between habitat and transposase connections. we observed  cases where phylogenetic boundaries are traversed, especially when organisms share habitats; this suggests that the potential exists for genetic material to move laterally between diverse groups via bridging connections. the results presented here also suggest that the complex dynamics of microbial ecology may be traceable in the microbial genomes.

AB  == we have evaluated bactericidal activities against bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella enterica of several antimicrobial wine recipes, each consisting of red or white wine extracts of oregano leaves with added garlic juice and oregano oil. dose-response plots were  used to determine the percentage of the recipes that resulted in a 50% decrease in colony-forming units (cfu) at 60 min (ba(50)). studies designed to optimize antibacterial activities of the recipes demonstrated that several combinations of the naturally occurring plant-derived ingredients rapidly inactivated the above mentioned 4 foodborne pathogens. we also showed that (a) incubation temperature affected activities in the following order: 37 degrees c > 21 degrees c > 4 degrees c; (b) varying the initial bacterial concentrations from 10(3) to 10(4) to 10(5) cfu/well did not significantly affect ba(50) values; (c) storage of 3 marinades up to 2 mo did not change their effectiveness against salmonella enterica; and (d) polyphenolic compounds isolated by chromatography from red wine exhibited exceptional activity at nanogram levels against 2 strains of bacillus cereus. these observations suggest that antimicrobial wine formulations have the  potential to improve the microbiological safety of foods.

TI  == effectiveness of trisodium phosphate, acidified sodium chlorite, citric acid, and peroxyacids against pathogenic bacteria on poultry during refrigerated storage.
AB  == the effects of dipping treatments (15 min) in potable water or in solutions (wt/vol) of 12% trisodium phosphate (tsp), 1,200 ppm acidified sodium chlorite (asc), 2% citric acid (ca), and 220 ppm peroxyacids (pa) on inoculated pathogenic bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, and yersinia enterocolitica) and skin ph were investigated throughout storage of chicken legs (days 0, 1, 3, and 5) at  3 +/- 1 degrees c. all chemical solutions reduced microbial populations (p < 0.001) as compared with the control (untreated) samples. similar bacterial loads  (p > 0.05) were observed on water-dipped and control legs. type of treatment, microbial group, and sampling day influenced microbial counts (p < 0.001). average reductions with regard to control samples were 0.28 to 2.41 log cfu/g with tsp, 0.33 to 3.15 log cfu/g with asc, 0.82 to 1.97 log cfu/g with ca, and 0.07 to 0.96 log cfu/g with pa. average reductions were lower (p < 0.001) for gram-positive (0.96 log cfu/g) than for gram-negative (1.33 log cfu/g) bacteria.  ca and asc were the most effective antimicrobial compounds against gram-positive  and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. tsp was the second most effective compound for both bacterial groups. average microbial reductions per gram of skin were 0.87 log cfu/g with tsp, 0.86 log cfu/g with asc, 1.39 log cfu/g with ca, and 0.74 log cfu/g with pa for gram-positive bacteria, and 1.28 log cfu/g with tsp, 2.03 log cfu/g with asc, 1.23 log cfu/g with ca, and 0.78 log cfu/g with pa  for gram-negative bacteria. with only a few exceptions, microbial reductions in tsp- and asc-treated samples decreased and those in samples treated with ca increased throughout storage. samples treated with tsp and samples dipped in ca and asc had the highest and lowest ph values, respectively, after treatment. the  ph of the treated legs tended to return to normal (6.3 to 6.6) during storage. however, at the end of storage, the ph of legs treated with tsp remained higher and that of legs treated with ca remained lower than normal.

TI  == nucleoside analogues are activated by bacterial deoxyribonucleoside kinases in a  species-specific manner.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the bactericidal activity of antiviral and anticancer  nucleoside analogues against a variety of pathogenic bacteria and characterize the activating enzymes, deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dnks). methods: several fda-approved nucleoside analogue drugs were screened for their potential bactericidal activity against several clinical bacterial isolates and type strains. we identified and subcloned the genes coding for putative deoxyribonucleoside kinases in escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, salmonella enterica, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and listeria monocytogenes. these genes were tested for their ability to increase the susceptibility of a dnk-deficient e. coli strain to various analogues. we overexpressed, purified and characterized the substrate specificity and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzymes from s. enterica and b. cereus. results: the tested gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (azt) in the concentration range 0.032-31.6 microm except for a single e. coli isolate and two pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates which were resistant to the tested azt concentrations. purified recombinant s. enterica thymidine kinase phosphorylated azt efficiently with a km of 73.3 microm and k(cat)/km of 6.6 x 10(4) s(-1) m(-1) and is the activator of this drug in vivo. 2',2'-difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (gemcitabine) was a potent antibiotic against gram-positive bacteria in the concentration range between 0.001 and 1.0 microm. the b. cereus deoxyadenosine kinase had a km for gemcitabine of 33.5 microm and k(cat)/km of 5.1 x 10(3) s(-1) m(-1) and activates gemcitabine in vivo. s. enterica and b. cereus are now amongst the first bacteria with a completely characterized set of dnk enzymes. conclusions: bacterial dnks efficiently activate nucleoside analogues in a species-specific manner. therefore, nucleoside analogues have a potential to be employed as antibiotics in the fight against emerging multiresistant bacteria.

TI  == a functional homing endonuclease in the bacillus anthracis nrde group i intron.
AB  == the essential bacillus anthracis nrde gene carries a self-splicing group i intron with a putative homing endonuclease belonging to the giy-yig family. here, we show that the nrde pre-mrna is spliced and that the homing endonuclease cleaves an intronless nrde gene 5 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the intron insertion site, producing 2-nt 3' extensions. we also show that the sequence required for efficient cleavage spans at least 4 bp upstream and 31 bp downstream of the cleaved coding strand. the position of the recognition sequence in relation to the cleavage position is as expected for a giy-yig homing endonuclease. interestingly, nrde genes from several other bacillaceae were also susceptible to cleavage, with those of bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis (nrde1), b. anthracis, and bacillus thuringiensis serovar konkukian being better substrates than those of bacillus subtilis, bacillus lichenformis, and s. epidermidis (nrde2). on the other hand, nrde genes from lactococcus lactis, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and corynebacterium ammoniagenes were not cleaved. intervening sequences (ivss) residing in protein-coding genes are often found in enzymes involved in dna metabolism, and the ribonucleotide reductase nrde gene is a frequent target for self-splicing ivss. a comparison of  nrde genes from seven gram-positive low-g+c bacteria, two bacteriophages, and nocardia farcinica showed five different insertion sites for self-splicing ivss within the coding region of the nrde gene.

TI  == detection of vibrio cholerae by real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification.
AB  == a multitarget molecular beacon-based real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (nasba) assay for the specific detection of vibrio cholerae has been developed. the genes encoding the cholera toxin (ctxa), the toxin-coregulated pilus (tcpa; colonization factor), the ctxa toxin regulator (toxr), hemolysin (hlya), and the 60-kda chaperonin product (groel) were selected as target sequences for detection. the beacons for the five different genetic targets were evaluated by serial dilution of rna from v. cholerae cells. rnase treatment of the nucleic acids eliminated all nasba, whereas dnase treatment had  no effect, showing that rna and not dna was amplified. the specificity of the assay was investigated by testing several isolates of v. cholerae, other vibrio species, and bacillus cereus, salmonella enterica, and escherichia coli strains.  the toxr, groel, and hlya beacons identified all v. cholerae isolates, whereas the ctxa and tcpa beacons identified the o1 toxigenic clinical isolates. the nasba assay detected v. cholerae at 50 cfu/ml by using the general marker groel and tcpa that specifically indicates toxigenic strains. a correlation between cell viability and nasba was demonstrated for the ctxa, toxr, and hlya targets. rna isolated from different environmental water samples spiked with v. cholerae was specifically detected by nasba. these results indicate that nasba can be used in the rapid detection of v. cholerae from various environmental water samples. this method has a strong potential for detecting toxigenic strains by using the tcpa and ctxa markers. the entire assay including rna extraction and nasba was completed within 3 h.

TI  == survival and growth of foodborne pathogens during cooking and storage of oriental-style rice cakes.
AB  == fresh cooked rice cakes for retail sale are typically held at room temperature because refrigeration dramatically reduces their quality. room temperature, high  water activity, and a ph of > 4.6 provided an environment conducive to pathogen growth. to date, no studies have been published regarding survival and growth of  foodborne pathogens in fresh cooked rice cakes. this study was undertaken to investigate the effect of steam cooking on foodborne pathogens and their subsequent growth in five varieties of rice cakes made from flours of regular rice, sweet rice, white rice, tapioca, and mung bean. bacillus cereus spores were detected in white rice, tapioca, and mung bean samples. the rice cake flours were inoculated with non-spore-forming foodborne pathogens (escherichia coli o157:h7,  salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus) or spore-forming bacteria (bacillus cereus) and steam cooked (100 degrees c) for 30 min. steam cooking significantly reduced (> 6 log cfu/g) non-spore-forming foodborne pathogens in all samples and inactivated spores of b. cereus by 1 to 2 log cfu/g. although spores of b. cereus survived steam cooking and germinated during 3 days of storage at room temperature, populations in most rice cakes remained below 106 cfu/g, which is the threshold for producing toxin. rice cakes made from mung bean flour supported growth and germination of b. cereus spores above that critical level. in mung bean rice cakes, enterotoxin production was detected by the second day, when b cereus cell  populations reached about 6.9 log cfu/g. the toxin concentration increased with storage time. however, our results suggest that rapid growth of total mesophilic  microorganisms by more than 7 to 8 log cfu/ml during the first day of storage produced off flavors and spoilage before b. cereus was able to grow enough to produce toxins. therefore, steam-cooked rice cakes made from a variety of flours  including mung bean flour are safe for sale for up to 1 day after storage at room temperature and are free of b. cereus toxins.

TI  == ac2-dpd, the bis-(o)-acetylated derivative of 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (dpd) is a convenient stable precursor of bacterial quorum sensing autoinducer ai-2.
AB  == ac2-dpd, the bis-(o)-acetylated derivative of 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (dpd), was prepared both as a racemic mixture and in the optically active form found in naturally occurring dpd. it was shown to exhibit the same ability as dpd to induce bioluminescence in vibrio harveyi and beta-galactosidase activity in salmonella enterica typhimurium, both gram-negative bacteria. likewise, it was also shown to inhibit biofilm formation in gram-positive bacillus cereus. the most likely hypothesis is that ac2-dpd activity is due to the release of dpd by in situ hydrolysis of the ester groups. importantly, by contrast with dpd, ac2-dpd proved to be a stable compound which can be purified and stored.

TI  == rapid separation and concentration of food-borne pathogens in food samples prior  to quantification by viable-cell counting and real-time pcr.
AB  == buoyant density gradient centrifugation has been used to separate bacteria from complex food matrices, as well as to remove compounds that inhibit rapid detection methods, such as pcr, and to prevent false-positive results due to dna  originating from dead cells. applying a principle of buoyant density gradient centrifugation, we developed a method for rapid separation and concentration following filtration and low- and high-speed centrifugation, as well as flotation and sedimentation buoyant density centrifugation, for 12 food-borne pathogens (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter jejuni, vibrio cholerae o139, vibrio parahaemolyticus o3k6, vibrio vulnificus, providencia alcalifaciens, aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus  aureus, and clostridium perfringens) in 13 different food homogenates. this method can be used prior to real-time quantitative pcr (rti-qpcr) and viable-cell counting. using this combined method, the target organisms in the food samples theoretically could be concentrated 250-fold and detected at cell concentrations  as low as 10(1) to 10(3) cfu/g using the rti-qpcr assay, and amounts as small as  10(0) to 10(1) cfu/g could be isolated using plate counting. the combined separation and concentration methods and rti-qpcr confirmed within 3 h the presence of 10(1) to 10(2) cfu/g of salmonella and c. jejuni directly in naturally contaminated chicken and the presence of s. aureus directly in remaining food items in a poisoning outbreak. these results illustrated the feasibility of using these assays for rapid inspection of bacterial food contamination during a real-world outbreak.

TI  == prevalence of antibodies reactive to pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria in preimmune serum of new zealand white rabbits.
AB  == polyclonal antibodies are typically produced in rabbits. the rabbit's health plays an important role in the quality of antibodies produced. therefore, recommendations have been made by organizations on which bacteria and how frequently to test rabbit colonies. since it is well known that rabbits may contain cross-reactive antibodies in their preimmune serum, it is common to test  the rabbits for reactivity prior to immunization. here preimmune sera from 19 different rabbits were tested with elisa against 27 pathogenic and nonpathogenic  bacterial cultures. elisa results showed that salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and bacillus cereus as4-12 had the highest average absorbance values  (0.60 and 0.54, respectively) and the most preimmune serum samples testing positive was 17. pseudomonas putrefaciens and b. subtilis had the lowest absorbance values (< 0.1) and did not test positive in any of the preimmune serum samples. fourteen of the 27 cultures showed positive reactions with 50% or more of the preimmune serum samples tested. fifty-three percent of the rabbit preimmune sera showed positive reactions with 10 or more bacterial cultures. in western blot analyses, selected serum samples showing the highest elisa values reacted with bands in the 97, 36, and 29 kda regions or with bands in the 63 kda  and 32 kda regions. data suggest that the presence of cross-reactive antibodies in the preimmune serum is a common problem amongst the samples tested. extensive  preimmune serum testing should be implemented when polyclonal antibodies are intended for diagnostic testing.

TI  == berry phenolics: antimicrobial properties and mechanisms of action against severe human pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and mechanisms of phenolic extracts of 12 nordic berries were studied against selected human pathogenic microbes. the most sensitive bacteria on berry phenolics were helicobacter pylori and bacillus cereus. campylobacter jejuni and candida albicans were inhibited only with phenolic extracts of cloudberry, raspberry, and strawberry, which all were rich in ellagitannins. cloudberry extract gave strong microbicidic effects on the basis of plate count with all studied strains. however, fluorescence staining of liquid cultures of virulent salmonella showed viable cells not detectable by plate count adhering to cloudberry extract, whereas staphylococcus aureus cells adhered to berry extracts were dead on the basis of their fluorescence and plate count. phenolic extracts of cloudberry and raspberry disintegrated the outer membrane of examined salmonella strains as indicated by 1-n-phenylnaphthylamine (npn) uptake  increase and analysis of liberation of [14c]galactose- lipopolysaccharide. gallic acid effectively permeabilized the tested salmonella strains, and significant increase in the npn uptake was recorded. the stability of berry phenolics and their antimicrobial activity in berries stored frozen for a year were examined using escherichia coli and nonvirulent salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium. the amount of phenolic compounds decreased in all berries, but their antimicrobial activity was not influenced accordingly. cloudberry, in particular, showed constantly strong antimicrobial activity during the storage.

AB  == antimicrobial combinations are used most frequently to provide broad-spectrum empirical coverage in the treatment of bacterial infections. however, combination of two antibiotics may not influence their activity, may lead to synergy or antagonism in the activity. neomycin may be combined with one of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, procaine penicillin, gramicidin, bacitracin, polymyxin b, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin in some human and veterinary multiantibiotic drugs distributed in poland. the checkerboard method has been one of the traditional assays for the measurement of antibiotic interactions. the aim of this study was to analyse the activity interaction of neomycin with second antibiotic in multiantibiotic drugs distributed in poland on standards and clinical bacterial strains. checkerboard results for all strains demonstrated synergism for 2.5% of combinations, only for standards strains. in one case salmonella enteritidis, in combination of neomycin with bacitracin, inhibition effect was observed. additive effects were predominant--49%. in 18% neutral effects were shown, but in 26% of combinations fic indexes were not possible to calculate, because of the resistance of clinical strains to the highest concentration of at least one antibiotic. in combination of aminoglycoside (neomycin) with beta-lactams antibiotics (ampicillin, procaine penicillin) in vitro, no synergy was observed for all examined strains. the best results were achieved for combinations of neomycin with peptide antibiotics (polymyxin, gramicidin and bacitracin)--5 for all 6 synergy effect observed.

TI  == growth inhibition of foodborne pathogens and food spoilage organisms by select raw honeys.
AB  == twenty-seven honey samples from different floral sources and geographical locations were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of seven food spoilage organisms (alcaligenes faecalis, aspergillus niger, bacillus stearothermophilus, geotrichum candidum, lactobacillus acidophilus, penicillium expansum, pseudomonas fluorescens) and five foodborne pathogens (bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica ser. typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus) using an overlay inhibition assay. they were also tested for specific activity against s. aureus 9144 and b. stearothermophilus using the equivalent percent phenol test--a well diffusion assay corresponding to a dilute phenol standard curve. honey inhibited bacterial  growth due to high sugar concentration (reduced water activity), hydrogen peroxide generation, and proteinaceous compounds present in the honey. some antibacterial activity was due to other unidentified components. the ability of honey to inhibit the growth of microorganisms varies widely, and could not be attributed to a specific floral source or demographic region produced in this study. antibacterially active samples in this study included montana buckwheat, tarweed, manuka, melaleuca, and saw palmetto. furthermore, the bacteria were not  uniformly affected by honey. varying sensitivities to the antimicrobial properties were observed with four strains of s. aureus thus emphasizing the variability in the antibacterial effect of honey samples. mold growth was not inhibited by any of the honeys tested. b. stearothermophilus, a heat-resistant spoilage bacteria, was shown to be highly sensitive to honey in both the overlay  and well diffusion assays; other sensitive bacteria included a. faecalis and l. acidophilus. non-peroxide antibacterial activity was observed in both assays; the highest instance was observed in the specific activity assay against b. stearothermophilus. further research could indicate whether honey has potential as a preservative in minimally processed foods.

TI  == a rapid bioassay for single bacterial cell quantitation using bioconjugated nanoparticles.
AB  == the rapid and sensitive determination of pathogenic bacteria is extremely important in biotechnology, medical diagnosis, and the current fight against bioterrorism. current methods either lack ultrasensitivity or take a long time for analysis. here, we report a bioconjugated nanoparticle-based bioassay for in  situ pathogen quantification down to single bacterium within 20 min. the bioconjugated nanoparticle provides an extremely high fluorescent signal for bioanalysis and can be easily incorporated with biorecognition molecules, such as antibody. the antibody-conjugated nanoparticles can readily and specifically identify a variety of bacterium, such as escherichia coli o157:h7, through antibody-antigen interaction and recognition. the single-bacterium-detection capability within 20 min has been confirmed by the plate-counting method and realized by using two independent optical techniques. the two detection methods correlated extremely well. furthermore, we were able to detect multiple bacterial samples with high throughput by using a 384-well microplate format. to show the usefulness of this assay, we have accurately detected 1-400 e. coli o157 bacterial cells in spiked ground beef samples. our results demonstrate the potential for a broad application of bioconjugated nanoparticles in practical biotechnological and medical applications in various biodetection systems. the ultimate power of integrating bionanotechnology into complex biological systems will emerge as a revolutionary tool for ultrasensitive detection of disease markers and infectious agents.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

TI  == antibacterial effects of carica papaya fruit on common wound organisms.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to investigate antibacterial activity of ripe and unripe carica papaya on selected micro-organisms. cultures of micro-organisms were routinely maintained in nutrient agar slants at 4 degrees c. extracts of immature, mature and ripe carica papaya fruit were obtained by separately grinding factions of the epicarp, endocarp and seeds and filtering them through gauze. sensitivity tests were conducted by adding 0.06 ml of extract to agar wells (6 mm diameter) prepared from 20 ml agar seeded with 10(6) cells/ml suspension of one of the eight organisms per plate. the inoculated plates were allowed to equilibrate at 4 degrees c for 1 hour, incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 hours, and zones of inhibition measured in millimetres. anti-bacterial activity was expressed in terms of the radius of zone of inhibition. seed extracts from the fruit showed inhibition in the following order: b cereus > e coli > s faecalis > s aureus > p vulgaris > s flexneri. no significant difference was found in bacterial sensitivity between immature, mature and ripe fruits. no inhibition zone was produced by epicarp and endocarp extracts. carica papaya seeds contain anti-bacterial activity that inhibits growth of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. observed activity was independent of stage of fruit maturity. carica papaya has antibacterial effects that could be useful in treating chronic skin ulcers to promote healing.

TI  == volatile constituents from the leaves of callicarpa japonica thunb. and their antibacterial activities.
AB  == volatile substances of callicarpa japonica thunb. were examined for their antibacterial activities against six foodborne microorganisms using the optical densitometer bioscreen c. extracts of c. japonica were obtained by simultaneous steam distillation and solvent extraction (sde), and those extracted for 1.5 and  2.0 h at ph 6.0 strongly inhibited the growth of bacillus cereus and salmonella typhimurium; the content of the volatile substances of leaves at these ph levels  were 543.1 and 706.7 mg/kg, respectively. all foodborne microorganisms tested were strongly inhibited by the addition of >8% (v/v) of the sde extracts to broth medium. the major volatile components of the sde extracts obtained at 1.5 h and ph 6.0 were gamma-caryophyllene, 1-octen-3-ol, 2-hexenal, germacrene b, and aromadendrene ii, with corresponding peak areas of 44.14, 15.6, 9.86, 5.24, and 4.01%, respectively, and major antibacterial components were 1-octen-3-ol and 2-hexenal. among the 32 materials identified as volatile flavor components, 2-hexenal, 2,4-hexadienal, 1-octen-3-ol, 2,4-heptadienal, and epiglobulol strongly inhibited microorganism growth. in particular, 2-hexenal (107.52 mg/l) and 1-octen-3-ol (678.64 mg/l) inhibited the growth of most microorganisms tested by >90%.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a low-molecular-weight chitosan obtained from cellulase digestion of chitosan.
AB  == a water-soluble chitosan hydrolysate with high activity against escherichia coli  was obtained during cellulase digestion of chitosan for 18 h. this 18-h hydrolysate is composed of low-molecular-weight chitosan (lmwc), with a molecular weight of 12.0 kda, and chitooligosaccharides, which are composed of sugars with  a degree of polymerization of 1 to 8. lmwc has a strong activity at 100 ppm against many pathogens and yeast species, including bacillus cereus, e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica serovar typhi, and saccharomyces cerevisiae, while the chitooligosaccharides have much weaker antimicrobial activity than does lmwc. accordingly, the antimicrobial activity against e. coli in the 18-h hydrolysate proved to come mainly from the presence of lmwc.

TI  == genehunter, a transposon tool for identification and isolation of cryptic antibiotic resistance genes.
AB  == genehunter is a transposon tool designed for the experimental activation and identification of silent antibiotic resistance genes. the method permits the identification of novel resistance genes that lack previously identified homologues. using salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain lt2 as a test organism for the in vivo version of the genehunter method, we were able to activate, clone, and identify two cryptic antibiotic resistance genes, the aminoglycoside acetyltransferase aac(6')-iaa and the probable mar-a regulon activator rma. because the method requires being able to electroporate the host with an efficiency of at least 10(10) transformants per microgram, the in vivo method is not applicable to most microorganisms. we therefore developed an in vitro transposition method, showed that it can also recover the cryptic rma gene  from s. enterica serovar typhimurium strain lt2, and showed that it is generally  applicable to a variety of microorganisms by using it to recover a cryptic metallo-beta-lactamase gene from the gram-positive organism bacillus cereus. it is anticipated that the genehunter method will be used to identify potential resistance genes during the development and testing of novel antibiotics, new variants of existing antibiotics, and drug inhibitor combinations.

TI  == interaction of a free-living soil nematode, caenorhabditis elegans, with surrogates of foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == free-living nematodes may harbor, protect, and disperse bacteria, including those ingested and passed in viable form in feces. these nematodes are potential vectors for human pathogens and may play a role in foodborne diseases associated  with fruits and vegetables eaten raw. in this study, we evaluated the associations between a free-living soil nematode, caenorhabditis elegans, and escherichia coli, an avirulent strain of salmonella typhimurium, listeria welshimeri, and bacillus cereus. on an agar medium, young adult worms quickly moved toward colonies of all four bacteria; over 90% of 3-day-old adult worms entered colonies within 16 min after inoculation. after 48 h, worms moved in and  out of colonies of l. welshimeri and b. cereus but remained associated with e. coli and salmonella typhimurium colonies for at least 96 h. young adult worms fed on cells of the four bacteria suspended in k medium. worms survived and reproduced with the use of nutrients derived from all test bacteria, as determined for eggs laid by second-generation worms after culturing for 96 h. development was slightly slower for worms fed gram-positive bacteria than for worms fed gram-negative bacteria. worms that fed for 24 h on bacterial lawns formed on tryptic soy agar dispersed bacteria over a 3-h period when they were transferred to a bacteria-free agar surface. the results of this study suggest that c. elegans and perhaps other free-living nematodes are potential vectors for both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including foodborne pathogens in soil.

TI  == eggshell matrix proteins as defense mechanism of avian eggs.

AB  == the antimicrobial effect of linolenic acid with or without monoglyceride (glycerol laurate or glycerol myristate) against six food-borne microorganisms was determined in broth medium. minimum inhibitory concentration of linolenic acid on bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus was 20 and 50 ppm, respectively. the growth of b. cereus treated with linolenic acid at 10 ppm with  10 ppm monoglyceride was more inhibitory than that of linolenic acid alone, and the viable cell population was reduced 2-4 log cycles compared to that of the control. when linolenic acid was added at that level, the adenosine triphosphate  (atp) concentration of extracellular fluid was drastically increased compared with that of the control, and the combined effect with monoglyceride was higher than that with linolenic acid alone. however, the intracellular atp concentration decreased compared with that of the control. from these results, we concluded that linolenic acid has a strong antimicrobial activity against b. cereus and s.  aureus, and that linolenic acid combined with monoglyceride showed stronger antimicrobial activity than using linolenic acid alone.

AB  == in response to increasing concern about home hygiene, the use of antibacterial products to reduce microorganisms in kitchen sponges and cleaning cloths is strongly promoted by some producers of detergent for domestic use. the effects of an antibacterial dishwashing liquid on escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis,  staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus were investigated in a modified suspension test and in used sponges with and without food residues under laboratory conditions. a limited study was conducted in households to assess the  efficacy of antibacterial dishwashing liquid as used by the consumer. in the suspension tests, s. aureus and b. cereus were shown to be susceptible to low concentrations of antibacterial dishwashing liquid (0.5%), whereas e. coli and salmonella enteritidis maintained their initial numbers for at least 24 h at 25 degrees c. at higher concentrations (2 to 4%), all test organisms decreased to below the detection limit after 24 h. over a 24-h period, the antibacterial dishwashing liquid did not significantly reduce these organisms in used sponges in which food residues were present. the antibacterial product did not reduce the competitive microorganisms either. similar results were found for sponges involved in daily household use. the results of this study demonstrate that the antibacterial dishwashing liquid was effective in reducing pathogens in the suspension test but not in the used sponges. this finding indicates that to determine the efficacy of antibacterial products, their use in a household setting must be considered.

TI  == heat resistance of bacillus cereus, salmonella typhimurium and lactobacillus delbrueckii in relation to ph and ethanol.
AB  == the aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of ethanol alone and in combination with low ph on the heat resistance of specific bacteria. the bacteria chosen are representative of heat resistant and heat sensitive pathogens (bacillus cereus and salmonella typhimurium) and of relatively heat resistant spoilage microorganisms (lactobacillus delbrueckii). the chosen bacteria were treated at different temperatures ranging between 70 and 97 degrees c for b. cereus, 48 and 54 degrees c for s. typhimurium and 44 and 60 degrees c for l. delbrueckii, in media of different ph (3, 5 and 7) and ethanol content (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10%). both factors proved to be very effective in reducing the heat resistance of the bacteria examined in this work. at ph 7, an increase in ethanol content up to 10% caused d values to decrease by up to 100-fold (s. typhimurium). a drop from ph 7 to ph 3 also caused up to a 100-fold reduction in the d values (s. typhimurium). for b. cereus the regression analysis of the log10 of the d value in relation to temperature, ph and ethanol content was used to produce a second order polynomial equation. the z values increased at decreasing ph and cells were more sensitive to ethanol at lower ph. for s. typhimurium the polynomial equation produced to describe the relationship between log10 of the d  values and temperature and ethanol content was also a second order equation indicating that the relationship between z values and ethanol was non-linear. for l. delbrueckii, z values were independent of the ethanol content of the heating medium. acid tolerance at 25 and 37 degrees c (l. delbrueckii and s. typhimurium) and acid adaptation (s. typhimurium) were also tested. l. delbrueckii was more ethanol and ph tolerant than s. typhimurium at heat treatment temperatures whilst s. typhimurium was more acid tolerant than l. delbrueckii at incubation temperatures (25 and 37 degrees c). acid adaptation increased the tolerance of s. typhimurium to low ph at 25 degrees c but failed to improve its thermal resistance at 48 degrees c. in all bacteria used, the effects of ph and ethanol were more evident at lower treatment temperatures and therefore their significance becomes greater in view of reduced thermal processing and/or changes in product formulation.

TI  == insights into the mechanism of catalysis by the p-c bond-cleaving enzyme phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase derived from gene sequence analysis and mutagenesis.
AB  == phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase (phosphonatase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphonoacetaldehyde to acetaldehyde and inorganic phosphate. in this study, the genes encoding phosphonatase in bacillus cereus and in salmonella typhimurium were cloned for high-level expression in escherichia coli. the kinetic properties of the purified, recombinant phosphonatases were determined. the schiff base mechanism known to operate in the b. cereus enzyme was verified for the s. typhimurium enzyme by phosphonoacetaldehyde-sodium borohydride-induced inactivation and by site-directed mutagenesis of the catalytic lysine 53. the protein sequence inferred from the b. cereus phosphonatase gene was determined, and this sequence was used along with that from the s. typhimurium phosphonatase  gene sequence to search the primary sequence databases for possible structural homologues. we found that phosphonatase belongs to a novel family of hydrolases which appear to use a highly conserved active site aspartate residue in covalent  catalysis. on the basis of this finding and the known stereochemical course of phosphonatase-catalyzed hydrolysis at phosphorus (retention), we propose a mechanism which involves schiff base formation with lysine 53 followed by phosphoryl transfer to aspartate (at position 11 in the s. typhimurium enzyme and position 12 in the b. cereusphosphonatase) and last hydrolysis at the imine c(1)  and acyl phosphate phosphorus.

AB  == the epidemiology of general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering for large numbers is described and compared with foodborne outbreaks in other settings. from 1 january 1992 to 31 december 1994, the phls communicable disease surveillance centre identified 101 foodborne general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering in england and wales (16% of all foodborne outbreaks). salmonella species were associated with 77 of the 101 outbreaks and s. enteriditis phage type 4 accounted for 57. small round structured viruses were implicated in five outbreaks, clostridium perfringens in four, bacillus cereus in two, and campylobacter sp and escherichia coli in one each. no pathogen was identified in 11 outbreaks. outbreaks occurred most commonly in summer. the commonest vehicles implicated were poultry/eggs in 44 outbreaks, desserts in 13, and meat/meat products in nine. salad/vegetables, sauces, and fish/shellfish were each implicated in eight  outbreaks. raw shell eggs were implicated in a fifth of outbreaks. inappropriate  storage was the commonest fault, reported in association with 50 outbreaks (ambient temperature for long periods before serving in 29), inadequate heat treatment was reported in 35, cross contamination in 28, an infected food handler in 11, and other faults in 14. outbreaks associated with catering on domestic premises were independently more likely than outbreaks in other settings to be associated with salmonellas, inappropriate storage of food, and consumption of poultry, eggs, or sauces. public health services need to direct messages about the use, preparation, and storage of food to those who cater on domestic premises.

TI  == seasonal variations in the isolation of salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, bacillus cereus and clostridium perfringens from environmental samples.
AB  == calf carcasses contaminated with s. typhimurium, b. cereus and cl. perfringens were placed in either a decomposition pit or in a deep burial pit. salmonella was isolated from the soil around the decomposition pit for 27 weeks and for 15 weeks around the burial site. salmonella re-appeared in soil samples during cold winter weather after an apparent 9-week absence from the decomposition pit and after 68  weeks in the burial site (a total of 88 weeks after the start of the experiment). there was also an annual rise in the isolation rate of b. cereus from the soil during the colder winter months, but cl. perfringens appeared to be more prevalent in samples taken during spring of the second year of the study. a similar apparent rise in the prevalence of s. enteritidis during a cold winter period occurred in an empty poultry house that had previously held a naturally infected broiler-breeder flock.

TI  == sequence of the salmonella typhimurium stylt1 restriction-modification genes: homologies with ecop1 and ecop15 type-iii r-m systems and presence of helicase domains.
AB  == the stylt1 restriction-modification (r-m) system of salmonella typhimurium has recently been suggested to belong to the type-iii r-m systems [de backer and colson, gene 97 (1991) 103-107]. the nucleotide sequences of stylt1 mod and res have been determined. two closely adjacent open reading frames were found 12 bp apart with coding capacities of 651 (mod) and 982 (res) amino acids (aa), respectively. the genes, lying in the same direction of transcription in the mod-res order, are transcribed as distinct units. the deduced aa sequences reveal homologies with known type-iii enzymes from the escherichia coli p1 prophage, e.  coli p15 plasmid and bacillus cereus chromosome. in addition, the stylt1 restriction endonuclease (enase), like other type-i and type-iii enases, contains sequence motifs characteristic of superfamily-ii helicases, which may be involved in dna unwinding at the cleavage site.

TI  == formycins a and b and some analogues: selective inhibitors of bacterial (escherichia coli) purine nucleoside phosphorylase.
AB  == formycin b (fb), a moderate inhibitor (ki approximately 100 microm) of mammalian  purine nucleoside phosphorylase (pnp), and formycin a (fa), which is totally inactive vs. the mammalian enzyme, are both effective inhibitors of the bacterial (escherichia coli) enzyme (ki approximately 5 microm). examination of a series of n-methyl analogues of fa and fb led to the finding that n(6)-methyl-fa, virtually inactive vs. the mammalian enzyme, is the most potent inhibitor of e. coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase (ki approximately 0.3 um) at neutral ph. inhibition is competitive not only with respect to ino, but also relative to 7-methyl-guo and 7-methyl-ado, as substrates. both oxoformycins a and b are relatively poor inhibitors. for the most potent inhibitor, n(6)-methyl-fa, it was shown that the  enzyme preferentially binds the neutral, and not the cationic, form. in accordance with this the neutral, but not the cationic form, of the structurally  related n(1)-methyl-ado was found to be an excellent substrate. reported data on  tautomerism of formycins were profited from, and extended, to infer which tautomeric species and ionic forms are the active inhibitors. a commercially available (sigma) bacterial pnp, of unknown origin, was shown to differ from the  e. coli enzyme by its inability to phosphorylase ado; this enzyme was also resistant to fa and fb. these findings have been extended to provide a detailed comparison of the substrate/inhibitor properties of pnp from various microorganisms.

TI  == campylobacter jejuni non-culturable coccoid cells.
AB  == the behaviour of campylobacter jejuni in the environment is poorly documented. rapid loss of viability on culture media is reported. this phenomenon is associated with the development of so-called coccoid cells. it has been suggested that these cells can be infective to animals and man. results obtained with atp-measurements of coccoid cells and direct viable count (dvc) support this hypothesis. introduction of coccoid cells into simulated gastric, ileal and colon environments did not result in the presence of culturable cells. oral administration to laboratory animals and volunteers caused no typical symptoms of campylobacteriosis. until 30 days after uptake of the cells antibodies against c. jejuni could not be detected in the blood, and the presence of this microorganism in stool samples could not be demonstrated.

TI  == inhibition of clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. four strains were isolated belonging to the species lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. the sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from  nisin. their resistance to phospholipase d indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. the inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains  of clostridium tyrobutyricum, lactobacillus helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.

TI  == dead salmonellae or their endotoxin accelerate the early course of a salmonella infection in mice.
AB  == the course of a salmonella infection following a low intravenous dose of virulent organisms was studied in mice. simultaneous administration of 10(4) s. typhimurium c5 together with c. 10(8) dead salmonellae caused a marked acceleration of early net bacterial growth in the liver and spleen, leading to a  rapidly overwhelming infection. administration of similar numbers of either staphylococcus albus or bacillus cereus had no effect, whereas 20 micrograms of s. typhimurium boivin-type lipopolysaccharide (b-lps) produced an effect similar  to dead organisms; 1 microgram b-lps had a significant infection-accelerating effect. both b-lps and westphal-type endotoxin (w-lps) could enhance a salmonella infection in lps-responsive c3h/hemg mice, whereas only b-lps was effective in lps non-responder c3h/hej mice, implying that the infection-enhancing effect of a large bolus of dead organisms may be due in part to its lps content. the results  show that the course of a salmonella infection following administration of large  numbers of salmonellae in mice is different from that of salmonella infections arising from small inocula. the relevance of these results to studies on the possible intracellular location of salmonellae in vivo is discussed.

TI  == survival of pathogenic microorganisms in an egg-nog-like product containing 7% ethanol.
AB  == a liquor consisting of whole egg, saccharose (25% w/v) and ethanol (7.0% w/v) was artificially contaminated with salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus (three different strains), bacillus cereus and listeria monocytogenes. after 3 weeks of incubation at 22 degrees c the numbers of salmonella, s. aureus and l. monocytogenes decreased more than 3 log10 units. under such conditions, however, the total number of microorganisms increased 3 log10 units. at 4 degrees c the decrease of pathogenic microorganisms was much slower and a decrease of 3 log10 units was observed only after 7 weeks of incubation. egg-nog, without ethanol, incubated at 22 degrees c allowed growth of salmonella and s. aureus, while the numbers of b. cereus spores remained unchanged. vegetative cells of b. cereus as well as l. monocytogenes decreased in numbers. however, after prolonged incubation the numbers of l. monocytogenes increased significantly.

TI  == mechanism of inactivation of alanine racemase by beta, beta, beta-trifluoroalanine.
AB  == the alanine racemases are a group of plp-dependent bacterial enzymes that catalyze the racemization of alanine, providing d-alanine for cell wall synthesis. inactivation of the alanine racemases from the gram-negative organism  salmonella typhimurium and gram-positive organism bacillus stearothermophilus with beta, beta, beta-trifluoroalanine has been studied. the inactivation occurs  with the same rate constant as that for formation of a broad 460-490-nm chromophore. loss of two fluoride ions per mole of inactivated enzyme and retention of [1-14c]trifluoroalanine label accompany inhibition, suggesting a monofluoro enzyme adduct. partial denaturation (1 m guanidine) leads to rapid return of the initial 420-nm chromophore, followed by a slower (t1/2 approximately 30 min-1 h) loss of the fluoride ion and 14co2 release. at this point, reduction by nab3h4 and tryptic digestion yield a single radiolabeled peptide. purification and sequencing of the peptide reveals that lysine-38 is covalently attached to the plp cofactor. a mechanism for enzyme inactivation by trifluoroalanine is proposed and contrasted with earlier results on monohaloalanines, in which nucleophilic attack of released aminoacrylate on the plp aldimine leads to enzyme inactivation. for trifluoroalanine inactivation, nucleophilic attack of lysine-38 on the electrophilic beta-difluoro-alpha, beta-unsaturated imine provides an alternative mode of inhibition for these enzymes.

TI  == regulation of plasminogen activator secretion in mouse peritoneal macrophages. ii. inhibition by immunomodulators of bacterial origin.
AB  == two classes of immunomodulators of bacterial origin, peptidoglycan derivatives and lipopolysaccharides, are able to block in vitro the production of plasminogen activator by elicited macrophages: the release of the enzyme into the medium is inhibited and the intracellular activity reduced. in the case of peptidoglycan derivatives, high molecular weight compounds like wsa (water-soluble adjuvant) are stronger inhibitors than small molecules like mpp (muramyl pentapeptide). mdp (muramyl dipeptide) gives partial inhibition only. wsa (at 100 micrograms/ml) completely inhibits plasminogen activator production; the inhibition is reversible and specific. lps is active at low concentrations (25-100 ng/ml). at concentrations higher than 50-100 ng/ml the action of lps becomes irreversible and less specific. peptidoglycan-derived immunomodulators can inhibit plasminogen activator production in the presence of polymixin b or in the case of macrophages obtained from c3h/hej mice; lps is inactive under such conditions.

AB  == all the species tested were sensitive to gamma radiation treatment, even at a dose as low as 0.001 mrad. the spore-former bacillus cereus (pcj 213) proved to be more resistant than the rest of the tested species, while the gram-negative organisms were more susceptible to irradiation treatment. the tolerance among those organisms is depicted by the descending order: proteus vulgaris, irregular  vi, escherichia coli i, e. coli iii, and salmonella typhi-murium. yet all the tested faecal streptococci species, with the exception of streptococcus bovis, may be regarded as holding an intermediate position between the more resistant b. cereus (pcj 213) and the more sensitive gram-negative organisms.

TI  == outer membrane of salmonella typhimurium: accessibility of phospholipid head groups to phospholipase c and cyanogen bromide activated dextran in the external  medium.
AB  == whole cells of salmonella typhimurium were treated with bacillus cereus phospholipase c or with cnbr-activated dextran. if phosphatidylethanolamine head  groups are exposed and accessible on the outer surface of the outer membrane of these cells, it was expected that these groups would be hydrolyzed by the former  agent, and become covalently coupled to the latter agent. with strains producing  lipopolysaccharides of s or rc type, results did not indicate the presence of any accessible head groups on the outer surface. in contrast, with strains that produce outer membranes containing less complete lipopolysaccharides (rd or re type) and reduced amounts of proteins, both methods clearly showed the presence of exposed phosphatidylethanolamine head groups. these data can be most easily explained by assuming that the outer membranes of s and rc strains either contains all phospholipid molecules in its inner leaflet or has proteins that completely cover up the head groups at its outer surface. in either model, the reduction in the amount of outer membrane proteins in rd or re mutants would produce membranes with exposed phospholipid head groups. cnbr-activated dextran can be easily prepared, and reacts with high efficiency under near-physiological  conditions. its additional advantage as a nonpenetrating membrane-labeling reagent is that we can be quite confident on its impermeability because of its size, in contrast, with most other reagents whose presumed impermeability is dependent only on the presence of charged groups.

TI  == effect of delayed evisceration on the microbial quality of meat.
AB  == the postomortem invasion of muscle and other tissues by bacteria from the intestinal tract was studied with the use of radioactive tracers. the injection of 14c-labeled bacteria or spores into the intestines of guinea pig carcasses within 24 h of death resulted in the rapid spread of 14c throughout carcasses. when live bacteria were injected along with the labeled cells, it was not possible to isolate viable organisms from the body tissues if the living animal had been exposed to the bacteria. it appears that animals are immune to their normal intestinal flora and that this immunity persists after death; thus passage of these bacteria into the lymphatic system does not necessarily result in the presence of live bacteria in carcass tissues. it therefore seems that a delay of  up to 24 h before evisceration would not lead to deep tissue contamination of the carcass by organisms usually present in the intestines. further evidence for this hypothesis was obtained by showing that muscle and lymph nodes from uneviscerated lamb carcasses hung for 24 h at 20 c remained sterile.
