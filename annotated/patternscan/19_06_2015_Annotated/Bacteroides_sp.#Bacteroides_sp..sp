TI  == effects of lactobacillus salivarius ren on cancer prevention and intestinal microbiota in 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine-induced rat model.
AB  == probiotics have been suggested as a prophylactic measure in colon cancer. the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of lactobacillus salivarius ren (ren) in modulating colonic microbiota structure and colon cancer incidence in a rat model after injection with 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine (dmh). the results indicated that oral administration of ren could effectively suppress dmh-induced colonic carcinogenesis. a significant decrease in cancer incidence (87.5% to 25%) was detected in rats fed with a dose of 5 x 1010 cfu/kg bodyweight per day. using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and real-time pcr combined with multivariate statistical methods, we demonstrated that injection with dmh significantly altered the rat gut microbiota, while ren counteracted these dmh-induced adverse effects and promoted reversion of the gut microbiota close to the healthy state. tvalue biplots followed by band sequencing identified 21 bacterial strains as critical variables affected by dmh and ren. injection of dmh significantly increased the amount of ruminococcus species (sp.) and clostridiales bacteria, as well as decreasing the prevotella sp. administration of ren reduced the amount of ruminococcus sp., clostridiales bacteria, and bacteroides dorei, and increased the amount of prevotella. real-time pcr results  were consistent with the results derived by t-value biplots. these findings suggested that ren is a potential agent for colon cancer prevention. in conclusion, the results in the present study suggest a potential therapeutic approach based on the modulation of intestinal microflora by probiotics may be beneficial in the prevention of colorectal carcinogenesis.

TI  == bacterial xylose isomerases from the mammal gut bacteroidetes cluster function in saccharomyces cerevisiae for effective xylose fermentation.
AB  == background: xylose isomerase (xi) catalyzes the conversion of xylose to xylulose, which is the key step for anaerobic ethanolic fermentation of xylose. very few bacterial xis can function actively in saccharomyces cerevisiae. here, we illustrate a group of xis that would function for xylose fermentation in s. cerevisiae through phylogenetic analysis, recombinant yeast strain construction,  and xylose fermentation. results: phylogenetic analysis of deposited xi sequences showed that xi evolutionary relationship was highly consistent with the bacterial taxonomic orders and quite a few functional xis in s. cerevisiae were clustered with xis from mammal gut bacteroidetes group. an xi from bacteroides valgutus in  this cluster was actively expressed in s. cerevisiae with an activity comparable  to the fungal xi from piromyces sp. two xi genes were isolated from the environmental metagenome and they were clustered with xis from environmental bacteroidetes group. these two xis could not be expressed in yeast with activity. with the xi from b. valgutus expressed in s. cerevisiae, background yeast strains were optimized by pentose metabolizing pathway enhancement and adaptive evolution in xylose medium. afterwards, more xis from the mammal gut bacteroidetes group, including those from b. vulgatus, tannerella sp. 6_1_58faa_ct1, paraprevotella xylaniphila and alistipes sp. hgb5, were individually transformed into s. cerevisiae. the known functional xi from orpinomyces sp. ukk1, a mammal gut fungus, was used as the control. all the resulting recombinant yeast strains were able to ferment xylose. the respiration-deficient strains harboring b. vulgatus and alistipes sp. hgb5 xi genes respectively obtained specific xylose consumption rate of 0.662 and 0.704 g xylose gcdw(-1) h(-1), and ethanol specific productivity of 0.277 and 0.283 g ethanol gcdw(-1) h(-1), much comparable to those obtained by the control strain carrying orpinomyces sp. ukk1 xi gene. conclusions: this study demonstrated that xis clustered in the mammal gut bacteroidetes group were able to be expressed functionally in s. cerevisiae and background strain anaerobic adaptive evolution in xylose medium is essential for  the screening of functional xis. the methods outlined in this paper are instructive for the identification of novel xis that are functional in s. cerevisiae.

TI  == [isolation, identification and naringin biotransforming properties of naringinase producing bacteria isolated from human intestinal microflora].
AB  == objective: isolation of specific bacteria from human intestinal microflora to convert naringin to naringenin efficiently. methods: fresh human feces from healthy individual was cultured in an anaerobic chamber for 24 h before being diluted and spread on agar medium. we cultured and incubated each single colony with the substrate naringin. the biotransformation of naringin by each single colony was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). we identified the isolated bacteria based on the analyses of 16s rdna sequence and biochemical traits. we also studied the bioconversion kinetics of the bacteria. results: four bacterial strains, named auh-jld3, auh-jld7, auh-jld104 and auh-jld109, capable of biotransforming naringin to naringenin, were isolated and  identified as blautia sp. auh-jld3, enterococcus sp. auh-jld7, bacteroides sp. auh-jld104 and streptococcus pasteurianus subsp. auh-jld109 respectively based on the 16s rdna sequence analysis, bacterial cell morphology, and biochemical traits. study on biotransforming kinetics showed that all the four isolated bacterial strains were able to convert naringin (0.2 mmol/l) to naringenin within 12 h. the maximal concentration of the substrate naringin that strain auh-jld3, strain auh-jld7, strain auh-jld104 and strain auh-jld109 could biotransform efficiently were 0. 2 mmol/l (the average biotransforming rate was 66. 67%), 0.8  mmol/l (the average biotransforming rate was 86.49%), 0. 2 mmol/l (the average biotransforming rate was 73.68%) and 1.6 mmol/l (the average biotransforming rate was 93.20%), respectively. conclusion: the four bacterial strains were capable of biotransforming naringin to naringenin, among which streptococcus pasteurianus subsp. auh-jld109 has the highest naringin biotransforming capacity.

TI  == determining the role of a probiotic in the restoration of intestinal microbial balance by molecular and cultural techniques.
AB  == the human intestine has a vast variety of microorganisms, and their balance is dependent on several factors. antibiotics affect microfloral balance and allow naturally opportunistic organisms to multiply. azithromycin is the most widely used macrolide antibiotic, active against a wide number of pathogens including pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. it is currently used in the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients. the use of probiotics has advantages in gastrointestinal conditions, including infectious diarrhea and imbalance due to antibiotic use. in this research, the effect of azithromycin on the intestinal microbiota of sprague dawley rats and the role of lactobacillus acidophilus in the restoration of the balance by employing molecular and cultural techniques was investigated. pcr with universal primers targeting the v3 region of the 16s rrna  gene followed by dgge was used to characterize the overall intestinal microbiota  composition. cultivable fecal bacteria count using microbiological media and semi-quantitative pcr with group-specific primers were also utilized to analyze the effects of antibiotic and probiotic on microflora. we found that the total amount of 16s rrna gene and fecal aerobic bacterial count was reduced following azithromycin administration along with elimination of non-pathogenic escherichia  coli, but it was restored by the use of the probiotic. the results from pcr with  group-specific primers showed that bacteroides sp was present in the control and  probiotic groups, but it was nearly eliminated in the antibiotic group. moreover, semi-quantitative pcr revealed that the numbers of enterobacteriaceae were nearly the same in the probiotic group and decreased in the antibiotic group, while bifidobacterium was significantly increased in the probiotic group and decreased  in the antibiotic group (p < 0.05) as compared with that in the control group. azithromycin-induced dysbiosis can result in prolonged deleterious effects on the host. the present study revealed that the use of lactic acid bacteria particularly l. acidophilus helped to restore intestinal microfloral balance.

TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in seri kembangan, malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  == this study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around seri kembangan, a city in malaysia. pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of otus with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (otus) observed across all samples. the highest appearance frequencies (100%) were otus closely related to enterobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas sp. and pseudomonas putida. several otus were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, cronobacter sakazaki, cronobacter turisensis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, hafnia alvei, kurthia gibsonii, salmonella bongori, salmonella enterica, salmonella paratyphi, salmonella tyhpi, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. the condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.

TI  == a metaproteomics approach to elucidate host and pathogen protein expression during catheter-associated urinary tract infections (cautis).
AB  == long-term catheterization inevitably leads to a catheter-associated bacteriuria caused by multispecies bacterial biofilms growing on and in the catheters. the overall goal of the presented study was (1) to unravel bacterial community structure and function of such a uropathogenic biofilm and (2) to elucidate the interplay between bacterial virulence and the human immune system within the urine. to this end, a metaproteomics approach combined with in vitro proteomics analyses was employed to investigate both, the pro- and eukaryotic protein inventory. our proteome analyses demonstrated that the biofilm of the investigated catheter is dominated by three bacterial species, that is, pseudomonas aeruginosa, morganella morganii, and bacteroides sp., and identified  iron limitation as one of the major challenges in the bladder environment. in vitro proteome analysis of p. aeruginosa and m. morganii isolated from the biofilm revealed that these opportunistic pathogens are able to overcome iron restriction via the production of siderophores and high expression of corresponding receptors. notably, a comparison of in vivo and in vitro protein profiles of p. aeruginosa and m. morganii also indicated that the bacteria employ different strategies to adapt to the urinary tract. although p. aeruginosa seems  to express secreted and surface-exposed proteases to escape the human innate immune system and metabolizes amino acids, m. morganii is able to take up sugars  and to degrade urea. most interestingly, a comparison of urine protein profiles of three long-term catheterized patients and three healthy control persons demonstrated the elevated level of proteins associated with neutrophils, macrophages, and the complement system in the patient's urine, which might point  to a specific activation of the innate immune system in response to biofilm-associated urinary tract infections. we thus hypothesize that the often asymptomatic nature of catheter-associated urinary tract infections might be based on a fine-tuned balance between the expression of bacterial virulence factors and the human immune system.

TI  == gastrointestinal symptoms in travellers.
AB  == diarrhoea is probably the single most common medical complaint in returning travellers. the most common pathogens are entero-toxigenic escherichia coli, shigella, salmonella and campylobacter. viruses, toxigenic arcobacter and bacteroides fragilis, as well as parasites such as cryptosporidium sp, are increasingly recognised but are not tested for in most diagnostic laboratories. blood in stools is a sign of invasive disease and should trigger exclusion of invasive amoebic disease. the use of empiric antibiotics may shorten illness but  is complicated by the diversity of bacterial causes and emerging resistance.

TI  == isolation and characterization of novel multifunctional recombinant family 26 glycoside hydrolase from mehsani buffalo rumen metagenome.
AB  == rumen microbiota harbor diverse set of carbohydrate active enzymes (cazymes) which play crucial role in the degradation of complex plant polysaccharide thereby providing metabolic energy to the host animals. earlier we reported cazyme analysis from buffalo rumen metagenome by high throughput shotgun sequencing. among the various cazymes, glycoside hydrolase family 26 (gh26) enzymes have number of industrial applications including paper, oil, biofuel, food, feed, pharmaceutical, coffee and detergent industries. here, we report isolation and characterization of gh26 enzyme from buffalo rumen metagenome. a novel gh26 gene comprised of 1119 base pairs was successfully amplified using the gene specific primers inferred based on the contig generated from metagenome sequence assembly and cloned in pet32a (+) expression vector as n-terminal histidine tag fusion protein. a novel gh26 protein from unknown rumen microorganism shared a maximum of 68% identity with the prevotela ruminicola 23 encoded carbohydrate esterase family 7 and 46% with bacteroides sp. 2_1_33b encoded mannan endo-1, 4-beta-mannosidase. the recombinant gh26-histidine tag fusion protein was expressed in escherichia coli and purified using ni- nta affinity chromatography. the purified enzyme displayed multifunctional activities against various carbohydrate substrates including locust bean gum, beech wood xylan, pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose suggesting mannanase, xylanase, pectin  esterase and endoglucanase activities, respectively. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == bacterial community structure associated with elective cesarean section versus vaginal delivery in chinese newborns.
AB  == objectives: increasing attention is being paid to the potential for cesarean birth to influence the taxa of the bacteria that compose the infant intestinal microbiota. the present study characterized the diversity of the intestinal microbiota in newborn infants delivered vaginally (vd) or by cesarean section (cd). methods: a cross-sectional study was performed using fecal specimens collected on days 2 and 4 of postnatal life from 25 vd infants and 16 cd infants. profiles of the fecal microbiota were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis in combination with 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequencing of the clones corresponding to the degenerating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) bands. results: on days 2 and 4 of postnatal  life, vd and cd infants did not differ in the richness and evenness of the fecal  bacterial community; however, the taxa of the fecal microbiota were significantly different between the 2 groups. in vd infants, escherichia coli, bacteroides sp,  and bifidobacterium longum were the dominant microbes. in cd infants, staphylococcus sp, clostridium sp, enterobacter sp, and streptococcus sp were more common. conclusions: these results demonstrate that delivery method has a profound influence on the structure of the intestinal microbiota in chinese newborn infants. this is in accordance with data reported in other regions.

TI  == [nug--necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis: a review].
AB  == necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (nug) is an acute and rare (0.5-11% of the population) infectious disease of the gum tissue, which is characterized by ulceration and inflammation of the inter-dental gum tissue. nug was documented by historians since the fourth century bc, most of the reports from the ancient world were in the context of illness among fighting troops, present studies of nug in the modern world are still common among soldiers. nug is associated with poor oral hygiene and weakening of the host, especially in immunocompromised patients, malnutrition and poor living conditions, as well as in the context of mental stress. nug is more common in young adults, but reports of morbidity in young children with malnutrition in the background are not uncommon. nug diagnosis is based on three essential symptoms: sore gums, bleeding gums and the  most diagnostic characteristic, ulceration and necrosis of the interdental papillae. the disease is considered to have a clear initial infectious etiology,  when the main bacteria, associated with the disease, include: bacteroides intermedius and fusobacterium sp. the infection involves anaerobic \ aerobic bacteria with a majority of gram-negative bacteria. the treatment of nug is based on combining mechanical removal of tartar with local and systemic delivery of antimicrobial agents. adequate treatment usually prevent the progression of the disease and ulcer healing is expected in a few days. nevertheless, lack of treatment can lead to deterioration in the form nup to noma.

TI  == humin as an electron donor for enhancement of multiple microbial reduction reactions with different redox potentials in a consortium.
AB  == a solid-phase humin, acting as an electron donor, was able to enhance multiple reductive biotransformations, including dechlorination of pentachlorophenol (pcp), dissimilatory reduction of amorphous fe (iii) oxide (feooh), and reduction of nitrate, in a consortium. humin that was chemically reduced by nabh4 served as an electron donor for these microbial reducing reactions, with electron donating  capacities of 0.013 mmol e(-)/g for pcp dechlorination, 0.15 mmol e(-)/g for iron reduction, and 0.30 mmol e(-)/g for nitrate reduction. two pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks within the humin were detected by cyclic voltammetry analysis. 16s rrna gene sequencing-based microbial community analysis of the consortium incubated with different terminal electron acceptors, suggested that dehalobacter sp., bacteroides sp., and sulfurospirillum sp. were involved in the pcp dechlorination, dissimilatory iron reduction, and nitrate reduction, respectively. these findings suggested that humin functioned as a versatile redox mediator, donating electrons for multiple respiration reactions with different redox potentials.

TI  == higher blood glucose level associated with body mass index and gut microbiota in  elderly people.
AB  == background: some dominant bacterial divisions of the intestines have been linked  to metabolic diseases such as overweight and diabetes. objective: a pilot study aimed to evaluate the relations between the culturable intestinal bacteria with body mass index (bmi) and some principal cellular and metabolic markers of blood  in people older than 65. design: altogether 38 generally healthy elderly people were recruited: ambulatory (n=19) and orthopedic surgery (n=19). questionnaires on general health, anthropometric measurements, routine clinical and laboratory data, and quantitative composition of cultivable gut microbiota were performed. results: blood glucose level was positively correlated with bmi (r=0.402; p=0.014). higher blood glucose level had negative correlation with relative share of intestinal anaerobic bacteria such as bacteroides (r=-0.434; p=0.0076) and gram-positive anaerobic cocci (r=-0.364; p=0.027). in contrast, the relative share of bifidobacteria (r=0.383; p=0.019) and staphylococci (r=0.433; p=0.008) was positively correlated to blood glucose level. in elderly people, a higher blood glucose concentration was predicted by the reduction of the anaerobes' proportion (adj. sex, age, and bmi r(2)=0.192, p=0.028) and that of bacteroides sp. (adj. r(2)=0.309, p=0.016). conclusion: a tight interplay between increased bmi, level of blood glucose, and the reduced proportion of cultivable bacteroides is taking place in the gut microbiota of elderly people.

TI  == analysis of interaction property of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside with human gut microbiota.
AB  == calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside as the major isoflavonoids in astragali radix has  been investigated intensively and has been reported to possess a wide range of pharmacological properties. however, the route and metabolites of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside by human intestinal bacteria are not well understood and its metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. therefore, the objective of this study was to screen the ability of the bacteria  to metabolize calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside and assess the effect of this compound on the intestinal bacteria. finally, five strains including bacteroides  sp.13, and sp.58, clostridium sp.21-2, veillonella sp.43-1, and bacillus sp.46 were isolated from human intestinal bacteria and were studied their abilities to  convert calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside. a total of six metabolites were identified in human incubated solution by ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (uplc-q-tof-ms). the results indicated that hydrolysis, demethylation, dehydroxylation and acetylation were the major metabolism of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside. on the other hand, different strains of intestinal bacteria have varying degrees of growth sensitivity to calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside. growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as enterobacter, enterococcus, clostridium and bacteroides was significantly repressed by calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside, while commensal probiotics such as lactobacillus, bifidobacterium were less severely affected. this indicates that calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population.  our observation provided further evidence for the importance of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside in human health and diseases.

AB  == in searching for symbionts derived from bioactive natural products, six sulfureous diketopiperazines designated as lasiodiplines a-f (1-6) were characterized from the culture of lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae f2, previously residing in the apparently normal flower of illigera rhodantha (hernandiaceae). identification of structures was accomplished by a combination of spectroscopic and computational approaches, in conjunction with the low-temperature (100k) single-crystal x-ray diffraction with cu kalpha radiation. lasiodipline e (5) was demonstrated to be antibacterial against the clinical strains streptococcus sp.,  bacteroides vulgates, peptostreptococcus sp. and veillonella parvula, respectively, with an minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) range of 0.12-0.25 mug/ml. in addition, compounds 4 and 6 exemplify two unusual architectures of natural cyclodipeptides, signifying the unique biochemical characteristics of the producing fungus.

TI  == evaluation of fecal microorganisms of children with cleft palate before and after palatoplasty.
AB  == this study isolated and quantified intestinal bacteria of children with cleft palate before and after palatoplasty. a prospective study was conducted from may  2007 to september 2008 on 18 children with cleft palate, aged one to four years,  of both genders, attending a tertiary cleft center in brazil for palatoplasty, to analyze the effect of surgical palate repair on the concentration of anaerobes bacteroides sp, bifidobacterium sp and microaerophiles lactobacillus sp in feces  of infants with cleft palate before and 24 hours after treatment with cefazolin for palatoplasty. there was significant reduction of lactobacillus sp (p < 0.002), bacteroides sp (p < 0.001) and bifidobacterium sp (p = 0.021) after palatoplasty, revealing that surgery and utilization of cefazolin significantly influenced the fecal microbiota comparing collections before and after surgery. however, due to study limitations, it was not possible to conclude that other isolated factors, such as surgical stress, anesthetics and other medications used in palatoplasty might have a significant influence on the microbiota. considering the important participation of the intestinal microbiota on both local and systemic metabolic and immunological activities of the host, professionals should be attentive to the possible influence of these changes in patients submitted to  cleft repair.

TI  == description of anaerobacterium chartisolvens gen. nov., sp. nov., an obligately anaerobic bacterium from clostridium rrna cluster iii isolated from soil of a japanese rice field, and reclassification of bacteroides cellulosolvens murray et al. 1984 as pseudobacteroides cellulosolvens gen. nov., comb. nov.
AB  == an obligately anaerobic bacterial strain designated t-1-35(t) was isolated as a dominant cultivable cellulose-degrading bacterium from soil of a japanese rice field as an anaerobic filter-paper degrader. cells of strain t-1-35(t) stained gram-positive and were non-spore-forming rods with rounded ends, 0.8-1.0x3.5-15.0 microm, and motile by means of two to four polar flagella. cells of strain t-1-35(t) exhibited pleomorphism: in aged cultures (over 90 days of incubation),  almost all cells were irregularly shaped. although no spore formation was observed, cells tolerated high temperatures, up to 90 degrees c for 10 min. the temperature range for growth was 15-40 degrees c, with an optimum at 35 degrees c. the ph range for growth was 5.5-9.0, with an optimum at ph 8.0-8.5 (slightly alkaliphilic). strain t-1-35(t) fermented some carbohydrates to produce ethanol and lactate as the major products. major cellular fatty acids were iso-c16 : 0 and iso-c13 : 0 3-oh. phylogenetic analysis based on the 16s rrna gene sequence revealed that strain t-1-35(t) belonged to clostridium rrna cluster iii. the closest relative of strain t-1-35(t) was bacteroides cellulosolvens wm2(t), with  16s rrna gene sequence similarity of 93.4 %. phenotypic, physiological and molecular genetic methods demonstrated that strain t-1-35(t) was distinct from its phylogenetic relatives (members of clostridium rrna cluster iii) because it predominantly produced ethanol, iso-c13 : 0 3-oh was a major cellular fatty acid  and it always exhibited pleomorphism. on the basis of the results of a polyphasic taxonomic study, strain t-1-35(t) is considered to represent a novel genus and species, anaerobacterium chartisolvens gen. nov., sp. nov. the type strain of anaerobacterium chartisolvens is t-1-35(t) ( = dsm 27016(t) = nbrc 109520(t)). in addition, from the results of our phylogenetic analysis and its phenotypic features, the species bacteroides cellulosolvens murray et al. 1984 is proposed to be reclassified in the new genus pseudobacteroides as pseudobacteroides cellulosolvens gen. nov., comb. nov., with the type strain wm2(t) ( = atcc 35603(t) = dsm 2933(t) = nrcc 2944(t)).

TI  == [terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of diversity of mucosa-associated microbiota in patients with crohn's disease].
AB  == objective: to explore the differences of colonic mucosal-associate bacterial diversity between the patients with crohn's disease (cd) and healthy controls. methods: eight cd patients and 23 healthy controls were recruited from september  2010 to december 2011 at west china hospital. one biopsy were taken from cecum of every patient with cd and healthy control by endoscopic examination. the diversity of colonic mucosa-associated microbiota was detected by terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) . hierarchical cluster analysis were performed to compare the similarity of microbial communities between cd patients and healthy controls. differences of bacterial diversity between two groups were also evaluated. the difference of predominant terminal-restrict fragments (t-rf) were analyzed and the bacterium predicted by predominant t-rfs were identified according to mica database. results: hierarchical cluster analysis showed that the mucosal microbial community of cd patients differed from healthy controls. and there were more similarities in the  samples of same group than that of different groups. compared with healthy control group, the richness of mucosal microbiota in cd patients was lower (haeiii:7 +/- 4 vs 10 +/- 8, p = 0.048; mspi+haeiii:20 +/- 10 vs 24 +/- 12, p = 0.036). shannon-wiener index of cd patients was lower than healthy control (1.7 +/- 0.7 vs 2.0 +/- 0.5, p = 0.220) with no significant difference. species evenness and simpson index of cd patients were significantly greater than healthy controls (0.84 +/- 0.14 vs 0.77 +/- 0.13, p = 0.045; 0.25 +/- 0.16 vs 0.22 +/- 0.15, p = 0.038) . the t-rf of 37, 40 and 66 bp digested with mspi enzyme predominated in cd patients. relative quantitative analysis showed 35 bp t-rf digested with mspi was significantly higher in cd patients than that in healthy controls (36.8% (23.0%, 55.4%) vs 14.3% (9.5%, 19.5%), p = 0.001), and 74, 141, 486, 490 bp t-rfs were all significantly lower than healthy controls (3.2% (1.3%, 5.1%) vs 10.2% (5.4%, 17.3%), p = 0.001; 4.5% (1.7%, 7.1%) vs 10.8% (5.9%, 21.1%), p = 0.007; 4.2% (1.6%, 5.3%) vs 7.6% (5.9%, 9.3%), p = 0.022; 3.6% (2.4%, 6.1%) vs 18.3% (9.9%, 43.2%), p = 0.008). the mucosal bacterial community composition in cd patients was predominated by firmicutes, proteobacterium and actinobacterium. compare with healthy control, bacteroides were significantly reduced in cd patients while firmicutes (e.g. enterobacter sp.) and actinomycetaceae significantly increased. conclusions: dysbiosis of mucosal microbiota occurs in cd with decreases of richness and biodiversity. increased enterobacter sp., actinobacterium and decreased bacteroides may play an important role in the pathogenesis of cd.

TI  == polysaccharide from seeds of plantago asiatica l. affects lipid metabolism and colon microbiota of mouse.
AB  == polysaccharide from the seeds of plantago asiatica l. was given via oral administration to mice (0.4 g/kg body weight, 30 days) to observe its effects on  mouse nutrient metabolism and colon microbiota. it was found the polysaccharide intake could lower the apparent absorption of lipid. total triglyceride, cholesterol, and atherogenic index in blood serum with total lipid and cholesterol levels in liver of polysaccharide group mice were all significantly lower than those of the control group (p < 0.05). furthermore, the effect of the  polysaccharide intake on mouse colon bacterial communities was investigated. mice from the polysaccharide group showed a higher colon bacterial diversity than the  control group. bacteroides sp., eubacterium sp., butyrate-producing bacteria butyrivibrio sp., and probiotics bifidobacterium bifidum , lactobacillus fermentum , and lactobacillus reuteri in mouse colon were all increased after polysaccharide intake. these indicated that the intake of polysaccharide from p.  asiatica l. could be beneficial for lipid metabolism and colon microbiota.

TI  == on the catalytic mechanism of polysaccharide lyases: evidence of his and tyr involvement in heparin lysis by heparinase i and the role of ca2+.
AB  == the structurally diverse polysaccharide lyase enzymes are distributed from plants to animals but share common catalytic mechanisms. one, heparinase i (f. heparinum), is employed in the production of the major anticoagulant drug, low molecular weight heparin, and is a mainstay of cell surface proteoglycan analysis. we demonstrate that heparinase i specificity and efficiency depend on the cationic form of the substrate. ca(2+)-heparin, in which alpha-l-iduronate-2-o-sulfate residues adopt (1)c4 conformation preferentially, is a substrate, while na(+)-heparin is an inhibitor. his and tyr residues are identified in the catalytic step and a model based on molecular dynamics and docking is proposed, in which deprotonated his203 initiates beta-elimination by abstracting the c5 proton of the alpha-l-iduonate-2-o-sulfate residue in the substrate, and protonated tyr357 provides the donor to the hexosamine leaving group.

TI  == periodontopathogens levels and clinical response to periodontal therapy in individuals with the interleukin-4 haplotype associated with susceptibility to chronic periodontitis.
AB  == periodontitis is an inflammatory disease that results from an interaction between dental biofilm agents and the host immune-inflammatory response. periodontopathogenic organisms, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, as well as the host's susceptibility, represented by the host's genetic makeup, are the key factors that influence this complex disease. recently, we identified haplotypes in the il4 gene that were associated with chronic periodontitis (cp). this study aimed to evaluate whether  subjects with different il4 haplotypes (tci/cci and ttd/cti) would be differentially colonized by periodontopathogens and whether they would respond differently to non-surgical periodontal therapy. thirty-nine patients carrying the il4 haplotype of genetic susceptibility to cp (il4+) or protection against cp (il4-) were evaluated. those groups were further subdivided into individuals with cp (cp il4+ or cp il4-) and those that were periodontally healthy (h) (h il4+ or  h il4-). cp patients were submitted to non-surgical periodontal therapy. clinical and microbiological analyses were performed considering the data at baseline and  45 and 90 days after periodontal therapy. periodontopathogens levels were evaluated by absolute quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). the baseline data revealed that the total levels of periodontopathogens were higher in the cp  il4+ than in the cp il4- groups. clinical analyses revealed that the periodontal  therapy was equally effective, independent of the subject's il4 genetic load. the tci/cci il4 haplotype, previously associated with genetic susceptibility to cp, was also associated with increased levels of periodontopathogenic bacteria, but this genetic background did not influence the response to non-surgical periodontal treatment.

TI  == the beneficial effect of exopolysaccharides from bifidobacterium bifidum wbin03 on microbial diversity in mouse intestine.
AB  == background: the structure of exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by bifidobacterium and their beneficial effects on human health have been fully studied, but only a  few studies have investigated their influence on microbial diversity in the human/animal intestine. results: the strain named bifidobacterium bifidum wbin03  with high growth rate and exopolysaccharide (eps) yield was selected to study the effect of its eps on modifying the intestinal microbiota of mice. the results indicated that eps significantly increased the growth of lactobacilli and total anaerobic bacteria, and exerted their inhibition effect on the growth of enterobacteria, enterococci and bacteroides fragilis. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis indicated that the eps significantly increased the diversity of total bacteria and lactobacilli, but significantly decreased the diversity of enterobacteria. when receiving a low dose of eps, bacteroidales sp./lactobacillus sp. occupied the dominant position, and l. johnsonii, l. animalis and l. reuteri were identified as the dominant strains when receiving a  high concentration of eps. conclusion: the combination of viable cell count, dgge and sequencing was used as an effective method to assess the microbial diversity  in mouse intestine, and the benefit effect of eps from b. bifidum wbin03 on probiotics and antagonistic effect against pathogens would guaranteed the health  of their hosts.

TI  == microbial population dynamics in the faeces of wood-eating loricariid catfishes.
AB  == catfishes of the genus panaque are known for their ability to feed on wood and hence to process cellulose fibres in their digestive systems. the paper industry  uses cellulose fibres and thus has an interest in exploiting this property biomimetically: it could be employed as a pretreatment to lessen the energy required by the mechanical production stage of manufacturing nanocellulose fibres. here, we characterize the diet-associated in situ microbial diversity and population dynamic in the faeces of catfish (panaque sp.) exposed to consecutive  diets of pellet food and then wood. fish faeces samples were collected and investigated by parallel dna deep amplicon sequencing of the bacterial 16s rrna ssu for both diet conditions. the most frequently occurring bacterium in the faeces was cetobacterium sp. the dominant cellulolytic bacterial genera found in  ascending relative abundance were as follows: aeromonas sp., flavobacterium sp.,  bacteroides sp., pseudomonas sp. and cellvibrio sp. diet-associated changes in the faeces microbiome were noted for flavobacterium sp. extensive microbial diversity was found in catfish faeces, evidenced using culture-independent molecular techniques. no significant diet-associated effects on the microbiome in terms of biodiversity were observed in the catfish faeces, but diet-associated changes in the microbial population structure were observed. significance and impact of the study: although catfishes are not classified as true xylivores, inhabiting their faeces are bacteria that may provide a novel source of cellulolytic enzyme. based on this first microbiology study, the faeces and thus  the gastrointestinal microbiome of panaque catfishes are an unexplored reservoir  of microbial extracts with enhanced polysaccharide transforming enzyme activity.  the biomimetical exploitation of this cellulolytic activity in the form of novel  enzymes or by applying a mixture of cellulolytic micro-organisms could accomplish a pretreatment to the mechanical production process of nanocellulose fibres, thus could reduce the energy consumption costs significantly.

TI  == identification of the major metabolites of hyperoside produced by the human intestinal bacteria using the ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: traditional chinese medicine (tcm), used in clinical practice for thousands of years, has been taken as a new way to tackle chronic diseases. in chinese medicine, many ingredients which are known to have biological effects just pass through the gut, they do not get into the bloodstream. study on interactions of these active ingredients with the intestinal bacteria is very helpful to unravel how tcm works. aim of the study: hyperoside is a major active constituent in many medicinal plants which are traditionally used in chinese medicines for their neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. it would be metabolized by intestinal bacteria after oral administration which leads to the variation of ethnopharmacological profile of these traditional medicines. thus, it is necessary to investigate the metabolic routes and metabolites of hyperoside produced by human intestinal bacteria. materials and methods: ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (uplc/qtof-ms)  technique combined with metabolynx() software was used for analysis of the metabolic profile of hyperoside by the isolated human intestinal bacteria from the human feces. results: parent compound and 6 metabolites (m1-m7) were detected in the isolated bacterial samples compared with blank samples. quercetin, 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylbenzoic acid (m2-m4) were only found in the sample of bacteroides sp. 45. dehydroxylation of hyperoside and the conjugates: acetylation and hydroxylation of hyperoside (m5-m7) were identified in the majority of isolated intestinal bacterial samples. conclusions: only bacteroides sp. 45 could metabolize hyperoside to form its aglycone quercetin, thereafter, quercetin was further metabolized to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. furthermore, the majority of bacteria could metabolize hyperoside to dehydroxylation of hyperoside and the conjugates: hydroxylation and acetylation of hyperoside. in this study, the metabolic routes and metabolites of hyperoside produced by the different intestinal bacteria were investigated for the first time. furthermore,  the production of metabolites of hyperoside might influence the effects of traditional medicines. thus, the study on the metabolism of hyperoside by human intestinal bacteria is of great importance to an understanding of the effects of  traditional medicines.

AB  == objective: to identify the causative pathogens and evaluate the antibiotic sensitivity, resistance patterns, and virulence in a contemporary series of patients with fournier's gangrene. materials and methods: the medical records of  41 consecutive cases of fournier's gangrene were evaluated. the patient demographics, causative pathogens, antibiotic sensitivity, and resistance patterns were assessed. the fournier's gangrene severity index and length of stay were analyzed statistically to determine any differences by causative pathogen. results: a total of 122 pathogens were cultured. the wound cultures were polymicrobial for 34 patients (83%). most common pathogens cultured were bacteroides sp (43.9%), escherichia coli (36.6%), and prevotella sp (34.1%). e coli was resistant to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in 13.3%, and 40% of isolates respectively. the wound cultures were monomicrobial for 7 patients (17.0%). a monomicrobial isolate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was cultured that was susceptible to clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam was seen in providencia sp, klebsiella sp, e coli, and methicillin-resistant s aureus. resistance to ceftriaxone and gentamicin was seen in methicillin-resistant s aureus and e coli, respectively. no resistance to clindamycin was demonstrated. no statistically significant difference was detected between the fournier's gangrene severity index or length of stay and the causative pathogens. conclusion: fournier's gangrene remains a community-acquired polymicrobial infection, with anaerobic bacteria as the most common causative pathogens. candida and methicillin-resistant s aureus are emerging causative pathogens, but  methicillin-resistant s aureus remains sensitive to clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. although resistance was demonstrated by some causative pathogens, together, the currently recommended broad-spectrum antibiotics adequately covered all pathogens. coverage with agents such as fluconazole, vancomycin, or piperacillin-tazobactam is indicated in patients at risk of fungal or hospital-acquired organisms.

TI  == the inhibitory effect of polyphenols on human gut microbiota.
AB  == the intestinal microbiota (im) is responsible for metabolism of many compounds provided in the diet, such as polyphenols, increasing their bioavailability. however, there are remarkably few studies investigating the influence of polyphenols on the composition and activity of the gut microbial community. this  study evaluated the influence of the polyphenols naringenin (n), naringin (nr), hesperetin (h), hesperidin (hr), quercetin (q), rutin (qr), and catechin (cat) on the growth of human im representatives (bacteroides galacturonicus, lactobacillus sp., enterococcus caccae, bifidobacterium catenulatum, ruminococcus gauvreauii, escherichia coli). polyphenols were added to liquid medium at a final concentration of 20, 100 or 250 mug/ml (for q concentrations were 4, 20 or 50 mug/ml) and their impact on the im was assessed by measurement of the turbidity after 24-h culture. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) for polyphenols that inhibited bacteria was estimated. cat had no impact on the tested im. q had  the strongest impact on r. gauvreauii, b. galacturonicus and lactobacillus sp. (mic 20-50 mug/ml) growth, whilst its rutinoside had no impact. nr and hr had no  impact, but their aglycones n and h inhibited growth of almost all analyzed bacteria (mic >/=250 mug/ml). we conclude that flavonoid aglycones, but not their glycosides, may inhibit growth of some intestinal bacteria. this means that polyphenols probably can modulate the im and indirectly interfere with their own  bioavailability.

TI  == in vitro fermentation of commercial alpha-gluco-oligosaccharide by faecal microbiota from lean and obese human subjects.
AB  == the fermentation selectivity of a commercial source of a-gluco-oligosaccharides (bioecolians; solabia) was investigated in vitro. fermentation by faecal bacteria from four lean and four obese healthy adults was determined in anaerobic, ph-controlled faecal batch cultures. inulin was used as a positive prebiotic control. samples were obtained at 0, 10, 24 and 36 h for bacterial enumeration by fluorescent in situ hybridisation and scfa analyses. gas production during fermentation was investigated in non-ph-controlled batch cultures. a-gluco-oligosaccharides significantly increased the bifidobacterium sp. population compared with the control. other bacterial groups enumerated were unaffected with the exception of an increase in the bacteroides-prevotella group  and a decrease in faecalibacterium prausnitzii on both a-gluco-oligosaccharides and inulin compared with baseline. an increase in acetate and propionate was seen on both substrates. the fermentation of a-gluco-oligosaccharides produced less total gas at a more gradual rate of production than inulin. generally, substrates fermented with the obese microbiota produced similar results to the lean fermentation regarding bacteriology and metabolic activity. no significant difference at baseline (0 h) was detected between the lean and obese individuals  in any of the faecal bacterial groups studied.

TI  == characterization of microbial community in the leachate associated with the decomposition of entombed pigs.
AB  == foot and mouth disease (fmd) is one of the acute infectious diseases in hoofed and even-toed mammals, including pigs, and it occurs via acute infection by aphthovirus. when fmd is suspected, animals around the location of origin are typically slaughtered and buried. other methods such as rendering, composting, and incineration have not been verified in practice in korea. after the fmd incident, the regular monitoring of the microbial community is required, as microorganisms greatly modify the characteristics of the ecosystem in which they  live. this is the result of their metabolic activities causing chemical changes to take place in the surrounding environment. in this study, we investigated changes in the microbial community during a 24 week period with dna extracts from leachate, formed by the decomposition of buried pigs at a laboratory test site, using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) with a genomic dna. our results revealed that bacteroides coprosuis, which is common in pig excreta, and  sporanaerobacter acetigenes, which is a sulfur-reduced microbe, were continuously observed. during the early stages (0~2 weeks) of tissue decomposition, clostridium cochlearium, fusobacterium ulcerans, and fusobacterium sp., which are involved in skin decomposition, were also observed. in addition, various microbes such as turicibacter sanguinis, clostridium haemolyticum, bacteroides propionicifaciens, and comamonas sp. were seen during the later stages (16~24 weeks). in particular, the number of existing microbial species gradually increased during the early stages, including the exponential phase, decreased during the middle stages, and then increased again during the later stages. therefore, these results indicate that the decomposition of pigs continues for a  long period of time and leachate is created continuously during this process. it  is known that leachate can easily flow into the neighboring environment, so a long-term management plan is needed in burial locations for fmd-infected animals.

TI  == reduction of salivary arginine catabolic activity through periodontal therapy.
AB  == objective: salivary enzymes may be used to diagnose periodontal conditions. salivary arginase activity (saa) is related to susceptibility to bacterial infection. therefore, the aim of this controlled interventional study was to determine the saa before and after non-surgical periodontal therapy. method and materials: eighty-nine subjects were selected: 31 periodontally healthy patients  (controls), 27 gingivitis patients, and 31 chronic periodontitis patients. plaque and gingival indices, probing depth, and clinical attachment level were monitored. the presence of campylobacter rectus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema  denticola, and prevotella intermedia was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction.  salivary total protein level and saa were also established by spectrophotometry.  clinical and arginase data were analyzed using the wilcoxon, mann-withney, and kruskal-wallis tests (p < .05). for microbial data, the chi-square test was used. the pearson correlation test was also used between each parameter evaluated. results: after therapy, due to a significant reduction in saa, the values observed for the gingivitis and periodontitis groups were similar to those found  in the healthy group. interestingly, after therapy, saa followed the same positive pattern showed by the overall improvement of clinical parameters (gingivitis and periodontitis groups mean values, pre- > posttherapy) and by the  reduction of target pathogens (gingivitis group t forsythia, pre- > posttherapy;  periodontitis group p. gingivalis, t. denticola, p. intermedia, and t. forsythia, pre- > posttherapy). conclusion: based on the reduction of saa after therapy, in  accordance with the expected reduction in clinical and microbiologic parameters,  it was concluded that saa has the potential to serve as a reliable method to access to the therapeutic response of chronic periodontitis subjects treated with nonsurgical periodontal therapy.

TI  == detection of s-nitrosothiol and nitrosylated proteins in arachis hypogaea functional nodule: response of the nitrogen fixing symbiont.
AB  == to detect the presence of no, ros and rns in nodules of crack entry legumes, we used arachis hypogaea functional nodule. the response of two cognate partner rhizobia was compared towards no and gsno using s. meliloti and bradyrhizobium sp nc921001. ros, no, nitrosothiol and bacteroids were detected by fluorescence microscopy. redox enzymes and thiol pools were detected biochemically. nitrosothiols were found to be present but ros and no were absent in a. hypogaea  nodule. a number of s-nitrosylated proteins were also detected. the total thiol pool and most of the redox enzymes were low in nodule cytosolic extract but these were found to be high in the partner microorganisms indicating partner rhizobia could protect the nodule environment against the nitrosothiols. both s. meliloti  and bradyrhizobium sp nc921001 were found to contain gsno reductase. interestingly, there was a marked difference in growth pattern between s. meliloti and bradyrhizobium sp in presence of sodium nitroprusside (snp) and s-nitrosoglutathione (gsno). bradyrhizobium sp was found to be much more tolerant to no donor compounds than the s. meliloti. in contrast, s. meliloti showed resistance to gsno but was sensitive to snp. together our data indicate that nodule environment of crack entry legumes is different than the nodules of infection mode entry in terms of no, ros and rns. based on our biochemical characterization, we propose that exchange of redox molecules and reactive chemical species is possible between the bacteroid and nodule compartment.

TI  == hubac and nifh source tracking markers display a relationship to land use but not rainfall.
AB  == identification of the source of fecal pollution is becoming a priority for states and territories in the u.s. in order to meet water quality standards and to develop and implement total maximum daily loads. the goal of this research was to relate microbial source tracking (mst) assay concentrations to land use and levels of impervious surfaces in order to gauge how increasing development is associated with human fecal contamination in inland watersheds. the concentrations of two proposed mst markers, targeting nifh of methanobrevibacter  smithii and hubac of bacteroides sp., were positively correlated with increasing  anthropogenic development and impervious surfaces. higher concentrations of these mst markers in more urbanized watersheds suggest that increasing development negatively affects water quality. neither mst marker concentration was correlated with antecedent rainfall levels, and detection of markers did not differ between  dry weather and rain events. water samples were also analyzed for norovirus and enterovirus, but these enteric viruses were rarely detected. these mst results differ from previous studies that have found correlations between traditional fecal indicator bacteria (fib) and antecedent rainfall. this difference suggests  that the mst markers used in this study may be more specific for recent, land-based contamination events as opposed to resuspension of particle-associated organisms in waterways. hubac was detected in 98% of samples, correlating with fecal coliform and escherichia coli concentrations. the ubiquity of the hubac marker in our samples suggests that this marker does not provide sufficiently different or additional information than fib, and it is likely this marker was amplifying non-human targets. the nifh marker was detected in 30% of samples. less than half of the nifh-positive samples contained levels of fecal coliforms or e. coli above regulatory thresholds, suggesting that nifh would be more useful when utilized simultaneously with fib than in a tiered monitoring strategy. the results of this research suggests that land use factors play an important role in characterizing and mitigating fecal contamination in watersheds.

TI  == identification of isoquercitrin metabolites produced by human intestinal bacteria using uplc-q-tof/ms.
AB  == in this paper, ultraperformance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (uplc-q-tof/ms) and the metabolynx software combined with mass  defect filtering were applied to identity the metabolites of isoquercitrin using  an intestinal mixture of bacteria and 96 isolated strains from human feces. the human incubated samples collected for 72 h in the anaerobic incubator and extracted with ethyl acetate were analyzed by uplc-q-tof/ms within 10 min. the parent compound and five metabolites were identified by eight isolated strains, including bacillus sp. 17, veillonella sp. 23 and 32 and bacteroides sp. 40, 41,  56, 75 and 88 in vitro. the results indicate that quercetin, acetylated isoquercitrin, dehydroxylated isoquercitrin, hydroxylated quercetin and hydroxymethylated quercetin are the major metabolites of isoquercitrin. furthermore, a possible metabolic pathway for the biotransformation of isoquercitrin was established in intestinal flora. this study will be helpful for understanding the metabolic route of isoquercitrin and the role of different intestinal bacteria in the metabolism of natural compounds.

TI  == aidc, a novel n-acylhomoserine lactonase from the potato root-associated cytophaga-flavobacteria-bacteroides (cfb) group bacterium chryseobacterium sp. strain strb126.
AB  == n-acylhomoserine lactones (ahls) are used as quorum-sensing (qs) signal molecules by many gram-negative bacteria. we have reported that chryseobacterium sp. strain strb126, which was isolated from the root surface of potato, has ahl-degrading activity. in this study, we cloned and characterized the aidc gene from the genomic library of strb126. aidc has ahl-degrading activity and shows homology to several metallo-beta-lactamase proteins from bacteroidetes, although not to any known ahl-degrading enzymes. purified aidc, as a maltose-binding fusion protein,  showed high degrading activity against all tested ahls, whether short- or long-chain forms, with or without substitution at carbon 3. high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) analysis revealed that aidc functions as an ahl lactonase catalyzing ahl ring opening by hydrolyzing lactones. an assay to determine the effects of covalent and ionic bonding showed that zn(2+) is important to aidc activity both in vitro and in vivo. in addition, the aidc gene  could also be pcr amplified from several other chryseobacterium strains. in conclusion, this study indicated that the aidc gene, encoding a novel ahl lactonase, may be widespread throughout the genus chryseobacterium. our results extend the diversity and known bacterial hosts of ahl-degrading enzymes.

TI  == performance of two quantitative pcr methods for microbial source tracking of human sewage and implications for microbial risk assessment in recreational waters.
AB  == before new, rapid quantitative pcr (qpcr) methods for assessment of recreational  water quality and microbial source tracking (mst) can be useful in a regulatory context, an understanding of the ability of the method to detect a dna target (marker) when the contaminant source has been diluted in environmental waters is  needed. this study determined the limits of detection and quantification of the human-associated bacteroides sp. (hf183) and human polyomavirus (hpyv) qpcr methods for sewage diluted in buffer and in five ambient, florida water types (estuarine, marine, tannic, lake, and river). hf183 was quantifiable in sewage diluted up to 10(-6) in 500-ml ambient-water samples, but hpyvs were not quantifiable in dilutions of >10(-4). specificity, which was assessed using fecal composites from dogs, birds, and cattle, was 100% for hpyvs and 81% for hf183. quantitative microbial risk assessment (qmra) estimated the possible norovirus levels in sewage and the human health risk at various sewage dilutions. when juxtaposed with the mst marker detection limits, the qmra analysis revealed that  hf183 was detectable when the modeled risk of gastrointestinal (gi) illness was at or below the benchmark of 10 illnesses per 1,000 exposures, but the hpyv method was generally not sensitive enough to detect potential health risks at the 0.01 threshold for frequency of illness. the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity in the mst methods indicates that hf183 data should be interpreted judiciously, preferably in conjunction with a more host-specific marker, and that better methods of concentrating hpyvs from environmental waters are needed if this method is to be useful in a watershed management or monitoring context.

TI  == microbial community structure and performance of an anaerobic reactor digesting cassava pulp and pig manure.
AB  == microbial community dynamics in response to changes in substrate types (i.e. pig  manure (pm), cassava pulp (cp) and mixtures of pm and cp) were investigated in an anaerobic continuously stirred tank reactor (cstr). molecular identification of bacterial and archaeal domains were performed, using a 16s rdna clone library with polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) screening and phylogenetic analysis. analysis of bacterial clone libraries revealed that the differences in the community structure corresponded to the substrate types. however, the bacteroidetes were the most abundant group in all substrates, followed by the clostridia. with pure pm, the dominant bacterial groups were bacteroidales, clostridia and paludibacter. with a co-substrate, at cp to pm (cp:pm) ratio of 50:50, the sequences analysis revealed the greatest diversity of bacterial communities at class level, and the sequences affiliated with cytophaga sp. became an exclusive predominant. with cp alone, bacteroides sp. was the dominant species and this reactor had the lowest diversity of bacteria. archaea observed in the cstr fed with all substrate types were methanosaeta sp., methanosaeta concilii and methanospirillum hungatei. among the  archaea, methanosaeta sp. was the exclusive predominant. the relative distribution of archaea also changed regarding to the substrate types.

TI  == cell-free supernatants from probiotic lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg decrease colon cancer cell invasion in vitro.
AB  == probiotics have been shown to have a preventative role in colorectal carcinogenesis but research concerning their prophylactic potential in the later  stages of colorectal cancer, specifically metastasis is limited. this study explored the potential of cell-free supernatants (cfs) from 2 probiotic lactobacillus sp., lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, to inhibit colon cancer cell invasion by influencing matrix metalloproteinase-9 (mmp-9) activity and levels of the tight junction protein zona occludens-1 (zo-1) in cultured metastatic human colorectal carcinoma cells. hct-116 cells were treated  with cfs from l. casei, l. rhamnosus, or bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (a gut commensal); or with uninoculated bacterial growth media. treatment with cfs from  both lactobacillus sp. decreased colorectal cell invasion but treatment with cfs  from b. thetaiotaomicron did not. cfs from both lactobacillus sp. decreased mmp-9 and increased zo-1 protein levels. l. rhamnosus cfs also lowered mmp-9 activity.  to begin elucidating the secreted bacterial factor conveying these responses, lactobacillus sp. cfs were fractionated into defined molecular weight ranges and  cell invasion assessed. fractionation revealed that the inhibitory activity was contained primarily in the >100 kda and 50-100 kda fractions, suggesting the inhibitory compound may be a macromolecule such as a protein, nucleic acid, or a  polysaccharide.

TI  == distribution and functions of tonb-dependent transporters in marine bacteria and  environments: implications for dissolved organic matter utilization.
AB  == background: bacteria play critical roles in marine nutrient cycles by incorporating and redistributing dissolved organic matter (dom) and inorganic nutrients in the ocean. tonb-dependent transporter (tbdt) proteins allow gram-negative bacteria to take up scarce resources from nutrient-limiting environments as well as siderophores, heme, vitamin b12, and recently identified  carbohydrates. thus, the characterization of tbdt distribution and functions is essential to better understand the contribution tbdt to dom assimilation and its  consequences on nutrient cycling in the environment. methodology/principal findings: this study presents the distribution of encoded known and putative tbdt proteins in the genomes of microorganisms and from the global ocean survey data.  using a lek clustering algorithm and substrate specificities, the tbdt sequences  were mainly classified into the following three groups: (1) dom transporters; (2) siderophores/vitamins transporters; and (3) heme/hemophores/iron(heme)-binding protein transporters. diverse tbdts were found in the genomes of oligotroph citromicrobium bathyomarinum jl354 and citromicrobium sp jlt1363 and were highly  expressed in the stationary phase of bacterial growth. the results show that the  gammaproteobacteria and the cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides (cfb) group bacteria accounted for the majority of the tbdt gene pool in marine surface waters. conclusions/significance: the results of this study confirm the ecological importance of tbdts in dom assimilation for bacteria in marine environments owing to a wide range of substrate utilization potential in the ubiquitous gammaproteobacteria and cfb group bacteria.

TI  == green-lipped mussel extract (perna canaliculus) and glucosamine sulphate in patients with knee osteoarthritis: therapeutic efficacy and effects on gastrointestinal microbiota profiles.
AB  == objective: to investigate how changes in the gastrointestinal tract (git) microbiota profile may influence nutraceutical efficacy in osteoarthritis (oa) and allow the formulation of a hypothesis that explains in part the inconsistent  and contentious findings from oa clinical studies with green-lipped mussel (glm)  and glucosamine. methods: a non-blinded randomised clinical trial was conducted with 38 subjects diagnosed with knee oa. each participant received either 3,000 mg/day of a whole glm extract or 3,000 mg/day of glucosamine sulphate (gs), p.o.  for 12 weeks. faecal microbial analyses were carried out after collecting stools  at t (0) and t (12) weeks. additional pharmacometric measures were obtained from  changes in arthritic scores in the western ontario mcmaster universities arthritis index (womac) and the lequesne algofunctional indices and the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (gsrs). an intention-to-treat analysis was  employed and participant data collected at t (0), t (6) and t (12) weeks. results: there were no statistically significant changes in bacterial growth patterns determined by the wilcoxon test. in both groups there was a trend towards a decrease in clostridium and staphylococcus species and increase in lactobacillus, streptococcus and eubacterium species. in the glm group bifidobacterium tended to increase and enterococcus and yeast species to decrease. the gs-treated group demonstrated a trend towards a decrease in bacteroides and an increase in yeasts and coliforms species, most notably escherichia coli. we further confirm significant improvement (p < 0.05) in all oa outcome measures from t (0) to t (12) weeks for both the glm and gs groups. the gsrs scores indicated that git function significantly improved over the 12 weeks  duration with glm and gs supplementation. conclusion: both glm and gs reduced oa  symptoms and non-significantly altered the gut microbiota profile from baseline.  changes in the microbiota profiles occurred in both treatment groups; the most notable being a reduction in the clostridia sp. this study suggests that nutritional supplements such as glm and gs may regulate some of the metabolic and immunological activities of the git microbiota. the decrease in clostridia, a potent modulator of colonic th17 and cd4+ regulatory t cells, was consistent with a decrease in inflammation; improved gsrs scores and oa symptoms for these oa participants. the git microbiota may be important factor in the first-pass metabolism of these nutraceuticals.

TI  == association of fecal indicator bacteria with human viruses and microbial source tracking markers at coastal beaches impacted by nonpoint source pollution.
AB  == water quality was assessed at two marine beaches in california by measuring the concentrations of culturable fecal indicator bacteria (fib) and by library-independent microbial source tracking (mst) methods targeting markers of  human-associated microbes (human polyomavirus [hpyv] pcr and quantitative pcr, methanobrevibacter smithii pcr, and bacteroides sp. strain hf183 pcr) and a human pathogen (adenovirus by nested pcr). fib levels periodically exceeded regulatory  thresholds at doheny and avalon beaches for enterococci (28.5% and 31.7% of samples, respectively) and fecal coliforms (20% and 5.8%, respectively). adenoviruses were detected at four of five sites at doheny beach and were correlated with detection of hpyvs and human bacteroides hf183; however, adenoviruses were not detected at avalon beach. the most frequently detected human source marker at both beaches was bacteroides hf183, which was detected in  27% of samples. correlations between fibs and human markers were much more frequent at doheny beach than at avalon beach; e.g., adenovirus was correlated with hpyvs and hf183. human sewage markers and adenoviruses were routinely detected in samples meeting fib regulatory standards. the toolbox approach of fib measurement coupled with analysis of several mst markers targeting human pathogens used here demonstrated that human sewage is at least partly responsible for the degradation of water quality, particularly at doheny beach, and resulted  in a more definitive assessment of recreational water quality and human health risk than reliance on fib concentrations alone could have provided.

TI  == differential interleukin-10 (il-10) and il-23 production by human blood monocytes and dendritic cells in response to commensal enteric bacteria.
AB  == human peripheral blood contains antigen-presenting cells (apc), including dendritic cells (dc) and monocytes, that may encounter microbes that have translocated from the intestine to the periphery in disease states like hiv-1 infection and inflammatory bowel disease. we investigated the response of dc and  monocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) to a panel of representative commensal enteric bacteria, including escherichia coli, enterococcus sp., and bacteroides fragilis. all three bacteria induced significant upregulation of the maturation and activation markers cd40 and cd83 on myeloid dendritic cells (mdc) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pdc). however, only mdc produced cytokines, including interleukin-10 (il-10), il-12p40/70, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), in response to bacterial stimulation. cytokine profiles in whole pbmc differed depending on the stimulating bacterial species: b. fragilis induced production of il-23, il-12p70, and il-10, whereas e. coli and enterococcus induced an il-10-predominant response. mdc and monocyte depletion experiments indicated that these cell types differentially produced il-10 and il-23 in response to e. coli and b. fragilis. bacteroides thetaiotaomicron did not induce levels of il-23 similar to those of b. fragilis,  suggesting that b. fragilis may have unique proinflammatory properties among bacteroides species. the addition of recombinant human il-10 to pbmc cultures stimulated with commensal bacteria abrogated the il-23 response, whereas blocking il-10 significantly enhanced il-23 production, suggesting that il-10 controls the levels of il-23 produced. these results indicate that blood mdc and monocytes respond differentially to innate stimulation with whole commensal bacteria and that il-10 may play a role in controlling the proinflammatory response to translocated microbes.

AB  == a microbial fuel cell (mfc) was constructed to investigate the possible generation of electricity using cattle dung as a substrate. after 30 days of operation, stable electricity was generated, and the maximum volumetric power density was 0.220 w/m(3). the total chemical oxygen demand (tcod) removal and coulombic efficiency (ce) of the mfc reached 73.9+/-1.8% and 2.79+/-0.6%, respectively, after 120 days of operation. acetate was the main metabolite in the anolyte, and other volatile fatty acids (vfas) (propionate and butyrate) were present in minor amounts. the pcr-dgge analysis indicated that the following five groups of microbes were present: proteobacteria, bacteroides, chloroflexi, actinobacteria and firmicutes. proteobacteria and firmicutes were the dominant phyla in the sample; specifically, 36.3% and 24.2% of the sequences obtained were proteobacteria and firmicutes, respectively. clostridium sp., pseudomonas luteola and ochrobactrum pseudogrignonense were the most dominant groups during the electricity generation process. the diversity of archaea dramatically decreased after 20 days of operation. the detected archaea were hydrogenotrophic methanogens, and the methanobacterium genus disappeared during the periods of stable electricity generation via acidogenesis.

TI  == identification of rutin deglycosylated metabolites produced by human intestinal bacteria using uplc-q-tof/ms.
AB  == in this paper, rutin was metabolized by human intestinal bacteria and five isolated strains including bacillus sp. 52, bacteroides sp. 45, 42, 22 and veillonella sp. 32, the metabolites were identified using ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (uplc-q-tof/ms). as a result, bacillus sp. 52 and bacteroides sp. 45 could metabolize rutin to quercetin 3-o-glucoside and leucocyanidin. bacteroides sp. 42 and veillonella sp. 32 could convert rutin to leucocyanidin. bacteroides sp. 22 could hydrolyze rutin to quercetin-3-o-glucoside. in order to further explain the metabolism pathway of rutin, the beta-d-glucosidase and alpha-l-rhamnosidase activities of five strains were determined. bacteroides sp. 22 could produce alpha-l-rhamnosidase but did not produce beta-d-glucosidase or beta-d-glucosidase activity was too low to be detected. the other four strains all demonstrated alpha-l-rhamnosidase and beta-d-glucosidase activities. furthermore, alpha-l-rhamnosidase and beta-d-glucosidase activities of veillonella sp. 32 and  bacteroides sp. 42 were higher than those of bacteroides sp. 45 and bacillus sp.  52. based on these results, we can propose the deglycosylated rout of rutin: rutin was metabolized to be quercetin-3-o-glucoside by alpha-l-rhamnosidase produced from these bacteria, thereafter, quercetin-3-o-glucoside was further metabolized by beta-d-glucosidase to form leucocyanidin. because of the higher enzyme activity in veillonella sp. 32 and bacteroides sp. 42, quercetin-3-o-glucoside was completely metabolized to leucocyanidin by these two  bacteria. due to the lack of beta-d-glucosidase activity, bacteroides sp. 22 could not further metabolize quercetin-3-o-glucoside to leucocyanidin. this study will be helpful for understanding the deglycosylated rout of rutin and the role of different intestinal bacteria on the metabolism of natural compounds.

AB  == objectives: this study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum  of the tongue. material and methods: a randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects  was performed. bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: no halitosis (identified by vsc assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone,  in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. at day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, fusobacterium sp., porphyromonas gingivalis,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and tannerella forsythia. a decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: p. gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica, s. aureus, and treponema denticola. baseline vsc scores were correlated with several bacterial species. the use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of vsc compared to rinsing alone. conclusions: vsc scores were  not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. the active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. clinical relevance: periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.

TI  == comparative (meta)genomic analysis and ecological profiling of human gut-specific bacteriophage phib124-14.
AB  == bacteriophage associated with the human gut microbiome are likely to have an important impact on community structure and function, and provide a wealth of biotechnological opportunities. despite this, knowledge of the ecology and composition of bacteriophage in the gut bacterial community remains poor, with few well characterized gut-associated phage genomes currently available. here we  describe the identification and in-depth (meta)genomic, proteomic, and ecological analysis of a human gut-specific bacteriophage (designated phib124-14). in doing  so we illuminate a fraction of the biological dark matter extant in this ecosystem and its surrounding eco-genomic landscape, identifying a novel and uncharted bacteriophage gene-space in this community. phib124-14 infects only a subset of closely related gut-associated bacteroides fragilis strains, and the circular genome encodes functions previously found to be rare in viral genomes and human gut viral metagenome sequences, including those which potentially confer advantages upon phage and/or host bacteria. comparative genomic analyses revealed phib124-14 is most closely related to phib40-8, the only other publically available bacteroides sp. phage genome, whilst comparative metagenomic analysis of both phage failed to identify any homologous sequences in 136 non-human gut metagenomic datasets searched, supporting the human gut-specific nature of this phage. moreover, a potential geographic variation in the carriage  of these and related phage was revealed by analysis of their distribution and prevalence within 151 human gut microbiomes and viromes from europe, america and  japan. finally, ecological profiling of phib124-14 and phib40-8, using both gene-centric alignment-driven phylogenetic analyses, as well as alignment-free gene-independent approaches was undertaken. this not only verified the human gut-specific nature of both phage, but also indicated that these phage populate a distinct and unexplored ecological landscape within the human gut microbiome.

TI  == bacteroides reticulotermitis sp. nov., isolated from the gut of a subterranean termite (reticulitermes speratus).
AB  == an obligately anaerobic, non-pigmented, non-spore-forming, gram-staining-negative, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain rs-03(t), was isolated from the gut of the subterranean termite reticulitermes speratus. the taxonomic position of the novel strain was determined by following a polyphasic approach. phylogenetic analyses based on 16s rrna gene sequences showed that strain rs-03(t) was a member of the genus bacteroides and was most closely related to bacteroides thetaiotaomicron jcm 5827(t) (95.0 % sequence similarity), bacteroides faecis jcm 16478(t) (94.8 %) and bacteroides xylanisolvens jcm 15633(t) (94.3 %). the results of hsp60 gene sequence analysis indicated that the novel strain was different from established members of the genus bacteroides. strain rs-03(t) was saccharolytic and produced succinic and acetic acids, with small amounts of propionic acid, as metabolic end products. the major cellular fatty acids of strain rs-03(t) were anteiso-c(15 : 0), c(18 : 1)omega9c and iso-c(17 : 0) 3-oh. the major menaquinones were mk-10 and mk-9 and the genomic dna g+c content was 44.9 mol%. based on these data, strain rs-03(t) represents a  novel species in the genus bacteroides, for which the name bacteroides reticulotermitis sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is rs-03(t) ( = jcm 10512(t) = ccug 62153(t)).

TI  == molecular-phylogenetic characterization of the microbiota in ulcerated and non-ulcerated regions in the patients with crohn's disease.
AB  == background: the dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota has been established in crohn's disease (cd), but the molecular characterization of this dysbiosis in chinese subjects with cd remains unclear. this study aims to investigate the predominant bacterial composition of the faecal and mucosal-associated microbiota in chinese cd patients using culture-independent techniques. methods/principal findings: eighteen patients with cd and 9 healthy controls were included in this  study. the faeces and the intestinal mucosal tissues from the ulcerated and nonulcerated sites were subjected to bacterial community fingerprinting using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). the predominant bacterial composition in the faeces and mucosa was determined with dna sequencing and blast. we showed that the bacterial diversity in the faeces of cd patients was reduced compared with that in healthy controls (p<0.01). the faecal bacterial dysbiosis of the patients was characterized by an elevated abundance of gamma-proteobacteria (especially escherichia coli and shigella flexneri) and a reduced proportion of bacteroidetes and firmicutes. five bacterial species defined the microbiota imbalance of the ulcerated mucosa in cd, including an increase in escherichia coli, a decrease in faecalibacterium prausnitzii, lactobacillus coleohominis, bacteroides sp and streptococcus gallolyticus in the  bacterial community as compared with the nonulcerated (p<0.01). conclusions/significance: this is the first description of intestinal microbiota  dysbiosis in chinese cd patients. these results allow a better understanding of the faecal and mucosal microbiota in cd, showing a predominance of some opportunistic pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in beneficial bacterial species. the findings may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of cd in chinese population.

TI  == the antimicrobial action of chitosan, low molar mass chitosan, and chitooligosaccharides on human colonic bacteria.
AB  == antibacterial effect of chitooligosaccharides (cos) and low molar mass chitosans  (lmwc) is considered as one of the most important characteristics of chitosan (cs) hydrolysates. here, we show the in vitro effect of different cos, lmwc, and  cs on representative anaerobic bacteria isolated from human colon as a possibility of targeting modification of colonic microflora composition by supplementation of dietary cs products by humans. specific growth rate of seven selected nonpathogenic anaerobic bacterial strains (clostridium paraputrificum, clostridium beijerinckii, roseburia intestinalis, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteriodes thetaiotaomicron, faecalibacterium prausnitzii and blautia coccoides) was determined in the presence of 0.25 and 0.5% cos (2, 3, and 6 kda), 0.025 and  0.05% of lmwc (10 and 16 kda), and 0.025 and 0.1% of cs in vitro. the growth rate decreased in all strains in the presence of cos and lmwc in higher concentrations in comparison to control incubations. a relatively higher resistance to cs hydrolyzates was detected in r. intestinalis and f. prausnitzii, and more susceptible were bacteria belonging to bacteoides sp. and clostridium sp. the antimicrobial activity, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic), and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc) were determined. the antimicrobial activity increased with the degree of polymerization (dp). mic ranged from 0.25 to 4.5% in dependence on bacterial strain and dp of cs/lmwc. mbc also decreased with dp. the most effective antimicrobial action was detected in lmwc with 16 kda and cs. weak antimicrobial activity was found in cos with small molecules (2 and 3 kda).

TI  == clostridia in premature neonates' gut: incidence, antibiotic susceptibility, and  perinatal determinants influencing colonization.
AB  == background: although premature neonates (pn) gut microbiota has been studied, data about gut clostridial colonization in pn are scarce. few studies have reported clostridia colonization in pn whereas bacteroides and bifidobacteria have been seldom isolated. such aberrant gut microbiota has been suggested to be  a risk factor for the development of intestinal infections. besides, pn are often treated by broad spectrum antibiotics, but little is known about how antibiotics  can influence clostridial colonization based on their susceptibility patterns. the aim of this study was to report the distribution of clostridium species isolated in feces from pn and to determine their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. additionally, clostridial colonization perinatal determinants were analyzed. results: of the 76 pn followed until hospital discharge in three french neonatal intensive care units (nicus), 79% were colonized by clostridia. clostridium sp. colonization, with a high diversity of species, increased throughout the hospitalization. antibiotic courses had no effect on the clostridial colonization incidence although strains were found susceptible (except c. difficile) to anti-anaerobe molecules tested. however, levels of colonization were decreased by either antenatal or neonatal (during more than 10  days) antibiotic courses (p = 0.006 and p = 0.001, respectively). besides, incidence of colonization was depending on the nicu (p = 0.048). conclusion: this study shows that clostridia are part of the pn gut microbiota. it provides for the first time information on the status of clostridia antimicrobial susceptibility in pn showing that strains were susceptible to most antibiotic molecules. thus, the high prevalence of this genus is not linked to a high degree of resistance to antimicrobial agents or to the use of antibiotics in nicus. the  main perinatal determinant influencing pn clostridia colonization appears to be the nicu environment.

TI  == bacterial communities in an ultrapure water containing storage tank of a power plant.
AB  == ultrapure waters (upws) containing low levels of organic and inorganic compounds  provide extreme environment. on contrary to that microbes occur in such waters and form biofilms on surfaces, thus may induce corrosion processes in many industrial applications. in our study, refined saltless water (upw) produced for  the boiler of a hungarian power plant was examined before and after storage (sampling the inlet [tke] and outlet [tku] waters of a storage tank) with cultivation and culture independent methods. our results showed increased cfu and direct cell counts after the storage. cultivation results showed the dominance of aerobic, chemoorganotrophic alpha-proteobacteria in both samples. in case of tku  sample, a more complex bacterial community structure could be detected. the applied molecular method (t-rflp) indicated the presence of a complex microbial community structure with changes in the taxon composition: while in the inlet water sample (tke) alpha-proteobacteria (sphingomonas sp., novosphingobium hassiacum) dominated, in the outlet water sample (tku) the bacterial community shifted towards the dominance of alpha-proteobacteria (rhodoferax sp., polynucleobacter sp., sterolibacter sp.), cfb (bacteroidetes, formerly cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides group) and firmicutes. this shift to the direction of fermentative communities suggests that storage could help the development of communities with an increased tendency toward corrosion.

TI  == correlation network analysis applied to complex biofilm communities.
AB  == the complexity of the human microbiome makes it difficult to reveal organizational principles of the community and even more challenging to generate  testable hypotheses. it has been suggested that in the gut microbiome species such as bacteroides thetaiotaomicron are keystone in maintaining the stability and functional adaptability of the microbial community. in this study, we investigate the interspecies associations in a complex microbial biofilm applying systems biology principles. using correlation network analysis we identified bacterial modules that represent important microbial associations within the oral community. we used dental plaque as a model community because of its high diversity and the well known species-species interactions that are common in the  oral biofilm. we analyzed samples from healthy individuals as well as from patients with periodontitis, a polymicrobial disease. using results obtained by checkerboard hybridization on cultivable bacteria we identified modules that correlated well with microbial complexes previously described. furthermore, we extended our analysis using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim), which includes a large number of bacterial species, among them uncultivated organisms present in the mouth. two distinct microbial communities appeared in healthy individuals while there was one major type in disease. bacterial modules in all communities did not overlap, indicating that bacteria were able to effectively re-associate with new partners depending on the environmental conditions. we then identified hubs that could act as keystone species in the bacterial modules. based on those results we then cultured a not-yet-cultivated microorganism, tannerella sp. ot286 (clone bu063). after two rounds of enrichment by a selected helper (prevotella oris ot311) we obtained colonies of tannerella sp. ot286 growing on blood agar plates. this system-level  approach would open the possibility of manipulating microbial communities in a targeted fashion as well as associating certain bacterial modules to clinical traits (e.g.: obesity, crohn's disease, periodontal disease, etc).

TI  == properties of boage2, a second n-acetyl-d-glucosamine 2-epimerase from bacteroides ovatus atcc 8483.
AB  == n-acyl-d-glucosamine 2-epimerase (age) catalyzes the reversible epimerization between n-acetyl-d-mannosamine (mannac) and n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (glcnac). bacteroides ovatus atcc 8483 shows 3 putative genes for age activity (bacova_00274, bacova_01795 and bacova_01816). the bacova_00274 gene encodes an age (boage1) with strong similarity to the age previously characterized in bacteroides fragilis. interestingly, the bacova_01816 gene (boage2) shares 57% identity with anabaena sp. ch1 age, but has an extra 27-amino acid tag sequence in the n-terminal. when cloned and expressed in escherichia coli rosetta (de3)plys, bacova_01816 was able to convert mannac into glcnac and vice versa. it was stable over a broad range of phs and its activity was enhanced by atp (20 mum). the incubation with atp stabilized its structure, raising its melting temperature by about 8 degrees c. in addition, the catalytic efficiency for mannac synthesis was higher than that for glcnac synthesis. these characteristics make boage2 a promising biocatalyst for sialic acid production using cheap glcnac as starting material. boage2 could be considered a renin-binding protein and its  interaction with renin was studied for the first time in a prokaryotic age. surprisingly, renin activated boage2, an effect which is contrary to that described for mammalian age and unrelated with the unique n-terminal tag, since a mutant without this tag was also activated by renin. when boage2 sequence was compared with other related (real and putative) age described in the databases, it was seen that age enzymes can be divided in 3 different groups. the relationship between these groups is also discussed.

AB  == aim: study of wound microbial landscape in suppurative necrotic complications in  patients with diabetic foot syndrome (dfs), and a possibility of suppression of bacterial biofilm development in these wounds by ultrasound cavitation (usc). materials and methods: 2 randomized groups of patients were included in the study: main group of 145 individuals with suppurative necrotic complications of dfs, who received ultrasound cavitation therapy, and comparison group of 86 patients who received basic therapy. in the main group sonoca-180 (siring, germany) unit, that allows to combine the process of mechanical wound treatment with antibacterial action of low frequency ultrasound, was used for wound treatment. quantitative and qualitative composition of wound microflora was studied by using bacteriological method with parallel utilization of transmission and scanning electron microscopy in the dynamic of usc treatment. results: in patients with dfs bacterial biofilms containing congestions in the polysaccharide matrix and fixed at the surface of dense structure of periostenum wound were detected. in the microbial landscape in dfs patients in 21% of cases aerobic-anaerobic microflora was detected, while associations included mostly from 2 to 5 bacteria species--members of the peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, prevotella, bacteroides genera. bacteria of staphylococcus, acinetobacter, pseudomonas, escherichia and klebsiella sp. genera were detected less frequently. application of usc in the main group resulted in a decrease of microbial contamination of wounds in the short-term. conclusion: usc method, when compared  with classical therapy approach in dfs complications, in patients with suppurative necrotic complications allows not only to remove mechanically the necrotic tissues but also to effectively suppress the bacterial biofilms that have formed in the wounds, this promotes the acceleration of recovery process and preparation of the patients for further plastic surgery intervention.

TI  == contrasts in concentrations and loads of conventional and alternative indicators  of fecal contamination in coastal stormwater.
AB  == fecal contamination in stormwater is often complex. because conventional fecal indicator bacteria (fib) cannot be used to ascertain source of fecal contamination, alternative indicators are being explored to partition these sources. as they are assessed for future use, it is critical to compare alternative indicators to conventional fib under a range of stormwater delivery conditions. in this study, conventional fib and fecal bacteroides spp. were monitored throughout the duration of five storm events from coastal stormwater outfalls in dare county, north carolina, usa to characterize relationships among  fib concentrations, alternative fecal markers, and loading of contaminants. water samples were collected multiple times during each storm and analyzed for enterococcus sp. and escherichia coli using enzymatic tests and fecal bacteroides spp. by qpcr. both conventional fib and fecal bacteroides spp. concentrations in  stormwater were generally high and extremely variable over the course of the storm events. over the very short distances between sites, we observed statistically significant spatial and temporal variability, indicating that stormwater monitoring based on single grab-samples is inappropriate. loading of fib and fecal bacteroides spp. appeared to be affected differently by various hydrologic factors. specifically, spearman correlations between fecal bacteroides spp. and drainage area and antecedent rainfall were lower than those between conventional fib and these hydrologic factors. furthermore, the patterns of fecal bacteroides spp. concentrations generally increased over the duration of the storms, whereas e. coli and enterococcus sp. concentrations generally followed the patterns of the hydrograph, peaking early and tailing off. given the greater  source-specificity and limited persistence of fecal bacteroides spp. in oxygenated environments, differences in these patterns suggest multiple delivery  modes of fecal contamination (i.e. landscape scouring versus groundwater discharge).

AB  == strains of gram-negative anaerobic rods were isolated from chinchilla (chinchilla lanigera) faeces, and three strains, st161(t), st33 and st37(t), were investigated taxonomically. based on phylogenetic analyses and specific phenotypic characteristics, the three strains were allocated to the genus bacteroides. phylogenetic analyses of their 16s rrna gene sequences revealed that strain st161(t) formed a distinct line of descent, with highest sequence similarity to strain st33 (98.7 %) and bacteroides oleiciplenus jcm 16102(t) (97.7 %). high levels of dna-dna relatedness (79-89 %) were found between strains st161(t) and st33, but low levels were found between strain st161(t) and b. oleiciplenus jcm 16102(t) (33-37 %) and between strain st33 and b. oleiciplenus jcm 16102(t) (33-37 %). these data clearly indicated that strains st161(t) and st33 represent a single novel species. 16s rrna gene sequence analyses showed that strain st37(t) also formed a distinct line of descent, with highest sequence similarity to bacteroides acidifaciens jcm 10556(t) (96.5 %) and bacteroides caccae jcm 9498(t) (95.6 %). analysis of hsp60 gene sequences also supported these relationships. based on phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, two novel species, bacteroides stercorirosoris sp. nov. and bacteroides faecichinchillae sp. nov., are thus proposed. the type strains of b. stercorirosoris and b. faecichinchillae are st161(t) ( = jcm 17103(t) = ccug 60872(t)) and st37(t) ( = jcm 17102(t) = ccug 60873(t)), respectively. the dna g+c contents of strains st161(t) and st37(t) were 45.7 and 41.0 mol%, respectively.

TI  == burden of emerging anaerobes in the maldi-tof and 16s rrna gene sequencing era.
AB  == the isolation of anaerobes from patients has declined in recent years, whereas their detection by molecular techniques has increased. in the present work, we analyzed the application of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) and 16s rrna gene sequencing to routine identification of anaerobes in clinical microbiology laboratory. we identified 544 isolates of 79 species by routine culture from deep samples in our hospital. maldi-tof ms allowed identification of 332 isolates (61%). the remaining 212 (39%) were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing, allowing identification of 202 at the species level. the most common anaerobes were propionibacterium spp. (12%), finegoldia magna (4%), fusobacterium spp. (6%) and  bacteroides spp. (6%). however, among the 79 identified species, seven were new species or genera, including two prevotella conceptionensis, a species previously detected by our team by amplification and sequencing, five anaerococcus sp. and one prevotella sp. beyond the identification of these new species, we also identified several uncommon or previously not described associations between species and specific pathologic conditions. maldi-tof ms-based identification, which will become more effective with future spectra database improvement, will be likely responsible of a burden of emerging anaerobes in clinical microbiology.

AB  == aims: to develop species-specific monitoring techniques for rapid detection of bacteroides and parabacteroides inhabiting the mouse intestine by fluorescence in situ hybridization. methods and results: the specificity of oligonucleotide probes was evaluated by fluorescence whole-cell hybridization. oligonucleotide probes specific for each species hybridized only with the target bacteria. using  these probes, caecal bacteroides-parabacteroides microbiota of conventional mice  and specific pathogen-free (spf) mice from three different breeders were analysed. it was shown that bacteroides acidifaciens group-1, group-2 and group-3 were dominant in conventional mice and spf mice from two out of three breeders. bacteroides vulgatus and parabacteroides distasonis were detected in one of these two spf breeding colonies in addition to bact. acidifaciens. spf mice of the remaining breeder harboured characteristic bacteroides-parabacteroides microbiota, consisting of bacteroides sp. asf519 and bacteroides caccae. conclusions: bacteroides acidifaciens is the dominant and most typical species in the mouse bacteroides-parabacteroides microbiota. the group-3 was identified as a novel group and revealed to occupy a major niche together with bact. acidifaciens group-1 and group-2. significance and impact of the study: the species-specific probe set developed in this study was the efficient tool for rapid detection of target bacterial groups inhabiting the mouse intestine. the results of this study provide important new information on the mouse bacteroides-parabacteroides community.

TI  == molecular identification of bacteria associated with canine periodontal disease.
AB  == periodontal disease is one of the most common diseases of adult dogs, with up to  80% of animals affected. the aetiology of the disease is poorly studied, although bacteria are known to play a major role. the purpose of this study was to identify the bacteria associated with canine gingivitis and periodontitis and to  compare this with the normal oral flora. swabs were obtained from the gingival margin of three dogs with gingivitis and three orally healthy controls, and subgingival plaque was collected from three dogs with periodontitis. samples were subjected to routine bacterial culture. the prevalent species identified in the normal, gingivitis and periodontitis groups were uncultured bacterium (12.5% of isolates), bacteroides heparinolyticus/pasteurella dagmatis (10.0%) and actinomyces canis (19.4%), respectively. bacteria were also identified using culture-independent methods (16s rrna gene sequencing) and the predominant species identified were pseudomonas sp. (30.9% of clones analysed), porphyromonas cangingivalis (16.1%) and desulfomicrobium orale (12.0%) in the normal, gingivitis and periodontitis groups, respectively. uncultured species accounted for 13.2%, 2.0% and 10.5%, and potentially novel species for 38.2%, 38.3% and 35.3%, of clones in the normal, gingivitis and periodontitis groups, respectively. this is the first study to use utilise culture-independent methods  for the identification of bacteria associated with this disease. it is concluded  that the canine oral flora in health and disease is highly diverse and also contains a high proportion of uncultured and, in particular, potentially novel species.

TI  == microbial culture and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assessment of bacteria in root canals of primary teeth pre- and post-endodontic therapy with a calcium hydroxide/chlorhexidine paste.
AB  == aim: to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary teeth with apical periodontitis and the in vivo antimicrobial effects of a calcium hydroxide/chlorhexidine paste used as root canal dressing. design: baseline samples were collected from 30 root canals of primary teeth with apical periodontitis. then, the root canals were filled with a calcium hydroxide paste containing 1% chlorhexidine for 14 days and the second bacteriologic samples were taken prior to root canal filling. samples were submitted to microbiologic culture procedure to detect root canal bacteria and processed for checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: baseline microbial culture revealed high prevalence and cfu number of anaerobic, black-pigmented bacteroides, streptococcus, and aerobic microorganisms. following root canal dressing, the overall number of cfu was dramatically diminished compared to initial contamination (p <0.05), although prevalence did not change (p > 0.05). of 35 probes used for checkerboard dna-dna hybridization, 31 (88.57%) were present at baseline, and following root canal dressing, the number of positive probes reduced to 13 (37.14%). similarly, the number of bacterial cells diminished folowing application of calcium hydroxide/chlorhexidine root canal dressing (p =  0.006). conclusion: apical periodontitis is caused by a polymicrobial infection,  and a calcium hydroxide/chlorhexidine paste is effective in reducing the number of bacteria inside root canals when applied as a root canal dressing.

AB  == aim: to study microbial repertoire of urine in healthy women and patients with chronic recurrent cystitis (crc) including facultative anaerobic (fa) and non-clostridial anaerobic (nca) bacteria. materials and methods. triple bacteriological study of urine was performed in three groups of women: group i--22 healthy virgin women aged 18- 25 years, group ii--24 women aged 18 - 25 years with regular sexual contacts, group iii--72 women aged 20 - 60 years with crc, before antibacterial therapy. bacteriological method was used to study qualitative and quantitative composition of urine microflora. results: in all subjects from groups i and ii aerobic-anaerobic associations with predomination of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), corynebacteria, peptococci, and peptostreptococci were isolated from urine. quantity of isolated nca bacteria was significantly higher than that of fa. in etiologic structure of crc, nca bacteria, enterobacteria, and cns predominated. spectrum of nca bacteria isolated from patients with crc was wider and level of bacteriuria--higher (p < 0.05) compared to groups i and ii. bacteria were identified in aerobic-anaerobic associations. in 85.7% of cases following nca were identified in biopsy samples:  propionibacterium sp. (41.8%), peptococcus sp. (35.7%), eubacterium sp. (28.6%),  peptostreptococcus sp. (14.3%), and bacteroides sp. (14.3%). aerobic-anaerobic associations were observed in 7.1% of samples. conclusion: urine of healthy women is not sterile. aerobic-anaerobic mixed infections were detected in patients with crc that should take into account during diagnostics and treatment of this disease.

TI  == spatiotemporal development of the bacterial community in a tubular longitudinal microbial fuel cell.
AB  == the spatiotemporal development of a bacterial community in an exoelectrogenic biofilm was investigated in sucrose-fed longitudinal tubular microbial fuel cell  reactors, consisting of two serially connected modules. the proportional changes  in the microbial community composition were assessed by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and dna sequencing in order to relate them to the performance and stability of the bioelectrochemical system. the reproducibility of duplicated reactors, evaluated by cluster analysis and jaccard's coefficient, shows 80-90% similarity in species composition. biofilm development through fed-batch start-up and subsequent stable continuous operation results in a population shift from gamma-proteobacteria- and bacteroidetes- to firmicutes-dominated communities, with other diverse species present at much lower relative proportions. dgge patterns were analysed by range-weighted richness (rr) and pareto-lorenz evenness distribution curves to investigate the evolution of the bacterial community. the first modules shifted from dominance by species closely related to bacteroides graminisolvens, raoultella ornithinolytica and klebsiella sp. bm21 at the start of continuous-mode operation to a community dominated by paludibacter propionicigenes-, lactococcus sp.-, pantoea agglomerans- and klebsiella oxytoca-related species with stable power generation (6.0 w/m(3)) at day 97. operational strategies that consider the dynamics of the population will provide  useful parameters for evaluating system performance in the practical application  of microbial fuel cells.

TI  == microbial characterization of the biofilms developed for treating ampicillin-bearing wastewater.
AB  == in this study, biofilms were developed in three airlift reactors to treat wastewaters with ampicillin (amp) of 0, 4 and 8 mg l(-1), respectively. during 60 days of operation, amp was not found to inhibit the biofilm growth. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and 16s rrna gene sequencing were used to characterize the bacterial community of these biofilms. it was found that the community diversity was lowered, whereas the community stability was enhanced in  the biofilm supplemented with amp as compared to the biofilm free of amp. community members were particularly examined in the biofilms developed with 8 mg  l(-1) amp at different stages. phylogenetic classification revealed that all the  identified bacteria fell into four divisions: beta-proteobacteria, alpha-proteobacteria, gamma-proteobacteria and bacteroides. the dominant genus was acidovorax sp. with an abundance of about 35%. further analyses on the identification results showed that the quantitative change of amp-degrading bacteria in the biofilms developed with amp was positively related to the amp biodegradation performance.

TI  == shifts in coastal antarctic marine microbial communities during and after melt water-related surface stratification.
AB  == antarctic coastal waters undergo major physical alterations during summer. increased temperatures induce sea-ice melting and glacial melt water input, leading to strong stratification of the upper water column. we investigated the composition of micro-eukaryotic and bacterial communities in ryder bay, antarctic peninsula, during and after summertime melt water stratification, applying community fingerprinting (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) and sequencing analysis of partial 18s and 16s rrna genes. community fingerprinting of the eukaryotic community revealed two major patterns, coinciding with a period of melt water stratification, followed by a period characterized by regular wind-induced breakdown of surface stratification. during the first stratified period, we observed depth-related differences in eukaryotic fingerprints while differences in bacterial fingerprints were weak. wind-induced breakdown of the melt water layer caused a shift in the eukaryotic community from an actinocyclus  sp.- to a thalassiosira sp.-dominated community. in addition, a distinct transition in the bacterial community was found, but with a few days' delay, suggesting a response to the changes in the eukaryotic community rather than to the mixing event itself. sequence analysis revealed a shift from an alpha- and gammaproteobacteria to a cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides-dominated community under mixed conditions. our results show that melt water stratification and the transition to nonstabilized antarctic surface waters may have an impact not only  on micro-eukaryotic but also bacterial community composition.

TI  == identification and characterization of a novel fumarase gene by metagenome expression cloning from marine microorganisms.
AB  == background: fumarase catalyzes the reversible hydration of fumarate to l-malate and is a key enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle and in amino acid metabolism. fumarase is also used for the industrial production of l-malate from  the substrate fumarate. thermostable and high-activity fumarases from organisms that inhabit extreme environments may have great potential in industry, biotechnology, and basic research. the marine environment is highly complex and considered one of the main reservoirs of microbial diversity on the planet. however, most of the microorganisms are inaccessible in nature and are not easily cultivated in the laboratory. metagenomic approaches provide a powerful tool to isolate and identify enzymes with novel biocatalytic activities for various biotechnological applications. results: a plasmid metagenomic library was constructed from uncultivated marine microorganisms within marine water samples.  through sequence-based screening of the dna library, a gene encoding a novel fumarase (named fumf) was isolated. amino acid sequence analysis revealed that the fumf protein shared the greatest homology with class ii fumarate hydratases from bacteroides sp. 2_1_33b and parabacteroides distasonis atcc 8503 (26% identical and 43% similar). the putative fumarase gene was subcloned into petblue-2 vector and expressed in e. coli bl21(de3)plyss. the recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity. functional characterization by high performance liquid chromatography confirmed that the recombinant fumf protein catalyzed the hydration of fumarate to form l-malate. the maximum activity for fumf protein occurred at ph 8.5 and 55 degrees c in 5 mm mg(2+). the enzyme showed higher affinity and catalytic efficiency under optimal reaction conditions: k(m) = 0.48  mm, v(max) = 827 mum/min/mg, and k(cat)/k(m) = 1900 mm/s. conclusions: we isolated a novel fumarase gene, fumf, from a sequence-based screen of a plasmid metagenomic library from uncultivated marine microorganisms. the properties of fumf protein may be ideal for the industrial production of l-malate under higher  temperature conditions. the identification of fumf underscores the potential of marine metagenome screening for novel biomolecules.

TI  == ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel patients exhibit distinct abnormalities of the gut microbiota.
AB  == background: previous studies suggest a link between gut microbiota and the development of ulcerative colitis (uc) and irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). our aim was to investigate any quantitative differences in faecal bacterial compositions in uc and ibs patients compared to healthy controls, and to identify individual bacterial species that contribute to these differences. methods: faecal microbiota of 13 uc patients, 11 ibs patients and 22 healthy volunteers were analysed by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) using universal and bacteroides specific primers. the data obtained were normalized using in-house developed statistical method and interrogated by multivariate approaches. the differentiated bands were excised and identified by sequencing the v3 region of the 16s rrna genes. results: band profiles revealed that number  of predominant faecal bacteria were significantly different between uc, ibs and control group (p < 10-4). by assessing the mean band numbers in uc (37 +/- 5) and ibs (39 +/- 6), compared to the controls (45 +/- 3), a significant decrease in bacterial species is suggested (p = 0.01). there were no significant differences  between ibs and uc. biodiversity of the bacterial species was significantly lower in uc (mu = 2.94, sigma = 0.29) and ibs patients (mu = 2.90, sigma = 0.38) than controls (mu = 3.25, sigma = 0.16; p = 0.01). moreover, similarity indices revealed greater biological variability of predominant bacteria in uc and ibs compared to the controls (median dice coefficients 76.1% (iqr 70.9 - 83.1), 73.8% (iqr 67.0 - 77.5) and 82.9% (iqr 79.1 - 86.7) respectively). dna sequencing of discriminating bands suggest that the presence of bacteroides vulgatus, b. ovatus, b. uniformis, and parabacteroides sp. in healthy volunteers distinguishes them from ibs and uc patients. dgge profiles of bacteroides species revealed a decrease of bacteroides community in uc relative to ibs and controls. conclusion: molecular profiling of faecal bacteria revealed abnormalities of intestinal microbiota in uc and ibs patients, while different patterns of bacteroides species loss in particular, were associated with uc and ibs.

TI  == bacteriophage treatment significantly reduces viable clostridium difficile and prevents toxin production in an in vitro model system.
AB  == clostridium difficile is primarily a nosocomial pathogen, causing thousands of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in the uk each year. in this study, we used a batch fermentation model of a c. difficile colonised system to evaluate the potential of a prophylactic and a remedial bacteriophage treatment regime to  control the pathogen. it is shown that the prophylaxis regime was effective at preventing the growth of c. difficile (p = <0.001) and precluded the production of detectable levels of toxins a and b. the remedial treatment regime caused a less profound and somewhat transient decrease in the number of viable c. difficile cells (p = <0.0001), but still resulted in a lower level of toxin production relative to the control. the numbers of commensal bacteria including total aerobes and anaerobes, bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides sp., lactobacillus  sp., total clostridium sp., and enterobacteriaceae were not significantly decreased by this therapy, whereas significant detrimental effects were observed  with metronidazole treatment. our study indicates that phage therapy has potential to be used for the control of c. difficile; it highlights the main benefits of this approach, and some future challenges.

AB  == the influence of a defined trace metal solution and additionally ni(2+) on anaerobic digestion of biomass was investigated. a novel synthetic model substrate was designed consisting of cellulose, starch and urea as carbon and nitrogen source in a ratio mimicking the basic composition of maize silage. two independent batch fermentations were carried out over 21 d with the synthetic model substrate in the presence of the trace metal solution. particularly an increase in nickel concentrations (17 and 34 microm) enhanced methane formation by up to 20%. this increased activity was also corroborated by fluorescence microscopy measurements based on cofactor f(420). the eubacterial and methanogenic population was characterized with the single strand conformational polymorphism analysis and the amplified 16s rdna restriction analysis of 16s rrna genes amplified by different primer systems. nearly the half of the analyzed bacteria were identified as firmicutes while 70% in this phylum belonged to the class of clostridiales and 30% to the class of bacilli. bacteroides and uncultured bacteria represented each a quarter of the analyzed community. methanogenic archaea were investigated with ardra, too. the hydrogenotrophic methanoculleus sp. was the dominant genus which is commonly described for maize digestion thus confirming the value of the model substrate.

TI  == cultivation-dependent and -independent characterization of microbial community producing polyhydroxyalkanoates from raw-glycerol.
AB  == high substrate costs decrease the profitability of polyhydroxyalkanoates (phas) production, and thus low-cost carbon substrates coming from agricultural and industrial residuals are tested for the production of these biopolymers. among them crude glycerol, formed as a byproduct during biodiesel production, seems to  be the most promising source of carbon. the object of this study was to characterize the mixed population responsible for the conversion of crude glycerol into phas by the cultivation-dependent and -independent methods. enrichment of the microbial community was monitored by applying the ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (risa) and the identification of community members was based on 16s rrna gene sequencing of cultivable species. molecular analysis revealed that mixed populations consist of microorganisms affiliated with four bacterial lineages: alpha, gamma- proteobacteria, actinobacteria and bacteroides. among them, three pseudomonas strains and rhodobacter sp. possessed genes coding  for polyhydroxyalkanoates synthase. comparative analysis revealed that most of the microorganisms detected by direct molecular analysis were obtained by the traditional culturing method.

TI  == bacteroides chinchillae sp. nov. and bacteroides rodentium sp. nov., isolated from chinchilla (chinchilla lanigera) faeces.
AB  == gram-negative anaerobic rods were isolated from chinchilla (chinchilla lanigera)  faeces and three strains, st170(t), st180 and st28(t), were investigated taxonomically. on the basis of phylogenetic analyses and specific phenotypic characteristics, the three strains belonged to the genus bacteroides. phylogenetic analysis of their 16s rrna gene sequences revealed that strains st170(t) and st180 formed a single cluster and a distinct line of descent. strain st170(t) exhibited 99.7 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity with strain st180 and 95.1, 94.6 and 94.4 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity with bacteroides massiliensis jcm 13223(t), bacteroides dorei jcm 13471(t) and bacteroides vulgatus jcm 5826(t), respectively. strain st28(t) also formed a distinct line of descent and exhibited the highest 16s rrna gene sequence similarity with bacteroides uniformis jcm 5828(t) (98.1 %). low dna-dna relatedness (1 %) between strain st28(t) and b. uniformis jcm 5828(t) clearly indicated that they belonged  to different species. analysis of hsp60 sequences also supported these relationships. the dna g+c contents of strains st170(t) and st28(t) were 45.2 and 41.0 mol%, respectively. on the basis of phenotypic characteristics and phylogenetic data, two novel species, bacteroides chinchillae sp. nov. (type strain st170(t) = jcm 16497(t) = ccug 59335(t)) and bacteroides rodentium sp. nov. (type strain st28(t) = jcm 16496(t) = ccug 59334(t)), are proposed.

TI  == the increase of lactobacillus species in the gut flora of newborn broiler chicks  and ducks is associated with weight gain.
AB  == background: a bacterial role in the obesity pandemic has been suspected based on  the ingestion of probiotics that can modify the gut flora. the objective of our study was to determine if increased lactobacillus sp. in the gut flora of newborn broiler chicks and ducks could result in weight gain increase. methodology: female broiler chicks (gallus gallus domesticus) and ducks (anas platyrhynchos domestica) were separated into one control and two experimental groups, and inoculated once or twice with 4x10(10)lactobacillus spp. per animal in pbs, or with pbs alone. fecal samples were collected before and at 24 hours, 2, 4, 8, 16  and 30 days after the inoculation. dna was extracted from the stools, and qpcr assays were performed on a mx3000 system for the detection and quantification of  lactobacillus sp., bacteroidetes and firmicutes, using a quantification plasmid.  animals were measured and sacrificed 60 days after the beginning of the experiment, and livers were collected and measured. principal findings: chicks inoculated once and twice with lactobacillus weighed 10.2% (p = 0.0162) and 13.5% (p = 0.0064) more than the control group animals, respectively. similarly, ducks  inoculated once and twice weighed 7.7% (p = 0.05) and 14% (p = 0.035) more than those in the control group, respectively. liver mass was also significantly higher in inoculated animals compared to the control group. inoculation with lactobacillus sp. increased the dna copies of lactobacillus spp. and firmicutes in the stools. bacteroidetes remained stable, and only the second lactobacillus sp. inoculation significantly decreased its population in chicks. the ratio of dna copies of firmicutes to those of bacteroidetes increased to as much as 6,4 in chicks and 8,3 in ducks. conclusions: differences in the intestinal microbiota may precede weight increase, as we found that an increase of lactobacillus sp. in newborn ducks and chicks preceded the development of weight gain.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteroides host strain hb-73 used to detect sewage specific phages in hawaii.
AB  == previous studies have shown that escherichia coli and enterococci are unreliable  indicators of fecal contamination in hawaii because of their ability to multiply  in environmental soils. in this study, the method of detecting bacteroides phages as specific markers of sewage contamination in hawaii's recreational waters was evaluated because these sewage specific phages cannot multiply under environmental conditions. bacteroides hosts (gb-124, ga-17), were recovered from  sewage samples in europe and were reported to be effective in detecting phages from sewage samples obtained in certain geographical areas. however, gb-124 and ga-17 hosts were ineffective in detecting phages from sewage samples obtained in  hawaii. bacteroides host hb-73 was isolated from a sewage sample in hawaii, confirmed as a bacteroides sp. and shown to recover phages from multiple sources  of sewage produced in hawaii at high concentrations (5.2-7.3 x 10(5) pfu/100 ml). these bacteroides phages were considered as potential markers of sewage because they also survived for three days in fresh stream water and two days in marine water. water samples from hawaii's coastal swimming beaches and harbors, which were known to be contaminated with discharges from streams, were shown to contain moderate (20-187 cfu/100 ml) to elevated (173-816 cfu/100 ml) concentrations of enterococci. these same samples contained undetectable levels (<10 pfu/100 ml) of f+ coliphage and bacteroides phages and provided evidence to suggest that these enterococci may not necessarily be associated with the presence of raw sewage. these results support previous conclusions that discharges from streams are the major sources of enterococci in coastal waters of hawaii and the most likely source of these enterococci is from environmental soil rather than from sewage.

TI  == the rag locus of porphyromonas gingivalis might arise from bacteroides via horizontal gene transfer.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is regarded as one of the risk factors of periodontitis. p. gingivalis exhibits a wide variety of genotypes. many insertion sequences (iss), located in their chromosomes, made p. gingivalis differentiate into virulent and avirulent strains. in this research, we investigated the prevalence  of p. gingivalis in the gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) among periodontitis patients from zhenjiang, china, detected the p. gingivalis rag locus distributions by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and analyzed the origin of the p. gingivalis rag locus based on evolution. there were three rag locus variants co-existing in zhenjiang. the results showed that the rag locus may be associated with severe periodontitis. this work also firstly ascertained that the rag locus might arise, in theory, from bacteroides sp. via horizontal gene transfer.

AB  == a fibrolytic consortium, dominated by the rumen cellulolytic bacterium fibrobacter succinogenes, was artificially constructed on hay stems to detect and identify rumen bacteria that can potentially interact with f. succinogenes. consortium-bacterial members were determined by dgge and sequencing analysis targeted bacterial 16s rdna. an artificial consortium was formed in a 2-step incubation of hay stems; the first step with group 1, 2 or 3 f. succinogenes strains, the second step with rumen fluid. after consortium formation, morphologically different bacteria were observed in association with f. succinogenes. dgge exhibited more than 30 bands, the pattern of which depended on the f. succinogenes group. sequencing suggested that butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, clostridium sp., f. succinogenes group 2, prevotella  ruminicola and unclassified bacteroides were prominent in the group 1 consortium  and that treponema bryantii, b. fibrisolvens, acinetobacter sp, and wolinella succinogenes were prominent in the group 2 consortium. however, in the group 3 consortium, f. succinogenes-like bacteria were microscopically undetectable, whereas cellulolytic ruminococcus albus and f. succinogenes group 1 were prominent, suggesting that the group 3 cannot be a core member of this consortium. this study is the first attempt to identify bacterial members of a fibrolytic consortium dominated by a specific bacterium.

TI  == mode of delivery affects the bacterial community in the newborn gut.
AB  == the first colonisation of the intestine is one of the most profound immunological exposures faced by the newborn and it is influenced by external and internal factors. the early composition of human microbiota could have long-lasting metabolic effects and the initial composition of human intestinal bacteria is also known to affect postnatal immune system development, as we are already aware that reduced microbial stimulation during infancy would result in slower postnatal maturation of the immune system and development of an optimal balance between th1 and th2-like immunity. mode of delivery has a major role on the composition of intestinal microbiota in early infancy, as it has been shown that  infants born by caesarean section (cs) have lower numbers of bifidobacteria and bacteroides compared with vaginally born infants. we designed a study to investigate the influence of mode of delivery (cs vs. vaginal delivery) on intestinal microbial composition on day 3 of life using pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and pcr-temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (tgge). both dgge and tgge analyses have been used, together with the specific amplifications for 10 bifidobacterium sp., 3 ruminococcus sp., and bacteroides that all have a highly relevant physiological role in the intestinal ecosystem of the newborn. a total of 46 term infants were enrolled in the study, consecutively recruiting all the cs-delivered babies (n=23; 8 males and 15 females) and the immediately following spontaneously delivered babies (n=23; 11 males and 12 females). dgge analysis carried out with bifidobacterium-specific primers revealed the presence of this genus in 13 of 23 (56.5%) samples derived from vaginally delivered newborns but in none of the samples obtained from newborns delivered by cs. pcr analysis with bifidobacterium-species-specific primers showed that naturally delivered infants had a large number of bifidobacterial species, whereas in cs-delivered babies only two samples (8.7%) gave positive results, one for b. longum and another for b. gallicum. in all babies enrolled, micro-organisms belonging to ruminococcus species were absent and bacteroides was found in 8.7% of spontaneously delivered babies only. based on our findings, it seems that newborn's intestinal bacteria during the first 3days of life are strongly influenced by mode of delivery. the intestinal flora of cs and vaginally delivered infants appears to be very different; the former being altered and characterised by a substantial absence of bifidobacteria sp., the latter characterised by subject-specific microbial profiles, although predominant groups such as b. longum and b. catenulatum could be identified. in summary, mode of delivery does affect the early stage of intestinal bacterial colonisation, which  is altered in cs-delivered infants compared with vaginally delivered infants, with only a minor influence of the type of feeding. in addition, the importance of methodological aspects for determining intestinal microbiota in clinical trials requires emphasis if intestinal microbiota composition is to be considered a measure of postnatal adaptation.

TI  == identification of candidate pathogens of papillomatous digital dermatitis in dairy cattle from quantitative 16s rrna clonal analysis.
AB  == although it is suspected that papillomatous digital dermatitis (pdd), an infectious foot disease of cattle, is caused by multiple bacteria, it remains unclear precisely which ones are involved in the etiology. to study the bacterial community, we used 16s rrna gene sequencing of randomly selected clones based on  pcr with minimum amplification cycles to search for organisms present in pdd lesions but not in healthy foot skin. the nucleotide sequences of 1525 clones from 5 pdd lesions (836 clones) and 4 samples of healthy foot skin (689 clones) were determined and grouped into 316 operational taxonomic units (otus) with a cut-off value of >99% sequence identity. two otus, p-01 (143 clones; 100% nucleotide sequence identity with treponema phagedenis) and p-02 (112 clones; 86% identity with bacteroidetes), were detected most frequently in all pdd samples examined. in contrast, otu n-01 (87 clones), showing 99% nucleotide sequence identity with moraxella phenylpyruvica, was the most prevalent in the normal samples examined. spirochaetes were detected in only 1 sample. phylogenetic analysis showed that t. denticola-like and t. phagedenis-like spirochetes were the predominant groups in the pdd lesions. detection of multiple treponemes and an unknown bacterium close to bacteroides sp. at high rates by a culture-independent approach could be evidence of the association of these organisms with pdd.

TI  == enhancement of biogas production by addition of hemicellulolytic bacteria immobilised on activated zeolite.
AB  == biogas from agricultural biomass and residues is a valuable source of renewable energy. however, recalcitrant plant cell structures represent a barrier in the fermentative biodegradation process in single- and two-stage reactors. therefore, approaches concerning a more efficient de-polymerisation of cellulose and hemicellulose to monomeric sugars are required amongst others in order to optimise the fermentation efficiency and to increase methane yields. here we show a new strategy for the enhancement of biogas production from hemicellulose-rich substrates. hemicellulolytic populations from a common biogas fermenter consortium were successively enriched in batch-cultures using a synthetic medium  containing xylan powder as single carbon source under anaerobic mesophilic conditions. enriched hemicellulolytic bacteria were immobilised on trace metal activated zeolite to ensure a stable storage and easy application. xylanase activity increased continuously during subsequent enrichment cycles by up to 162%. in batch-culture experiments we were able to observe an increase of methane by 53% compared to controls without additionally introduced microorganisms immobilised on zeolite. specific enrichment of hemicellulolytic bacteria during the process was confirmed by using single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis based on amplification of the eubacterial 16s rdna fragments. using sequence analysis conspicuous bands from sscp patterns could be identified as belonging to the groups bacteroides sp., azospira oryzae (dechlorosoma sp.) as well as to a wide spectrum of diverse species within the order of clostridiales (firmicutes).

TI  == a family of transcriptional antitermination factors necessary for synthesis of the capsular polysaccharides of bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == a single strain of bacteroides fragilis synthesizes eight distinct capsular polysaccharides, designated psa to psh. these polysaccharides are synthesized by-products encoded by eight separate polysaccharide biosynthesis loci. the genetic architecture of each of these eight loci is similar, including the fact that the first gene of each locus is a paralog of the first gene of each of the other ps loci. these proteins are designated the upxy family, where x is replaced by a to h, depending upon the polysaccharide locus from which it is produced. mutational analysis of three separate upxy genes demonstrated that they are necessary and specific for transcription of their respective polysaccharide biosynthesis operon and that they function in trans. transcriptional reporter constructs, reverse transcriptase pcr, and deletion analysis demonstrated that the upxys do not affect initiation of transcription, but rather prevent premature transcriptional termination within the 5' untranslated region between the promoter and the upxy gene. the upxys have conserved motifs that are present in nusg and nusg-like proteins. mutation of two conserved residues within the conserved kow motif abrogated upay activity, further confirming that these proteins belong to the nusg-like (nusg(sp)) family. alignment of highly similar upxys led to the identification of a small region of these proteins predicted to  confer specificity for their respective loci. construction of an upay-upey hybrid that produced a protein in which a 17-amino-acid segment of upay was changed to that of upey altered upay's specificity, as it was now able to function in transcriptional antitermination of the pse biosynthesis operon.

TI  == full-mouth ultrasonic debridement associated with amoxicillin and metronidazole in the treatment of severe chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the adjunctive clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic effects of the systemic administration of amoxicillin and metronidazole in the full-mouth ultrasonic debridement of patients with severe chronic periodontitis. methods: twenty-five patients presenting at least eight teeth with probing depth (pd) > or =5 mm and bleeding on probing (bop) were selected and randomly assigned to full-mouth ultrasonic debridement + placebo (control group) or full-mouth ultrasonic debridement + amoxicillin and metronidazole (test group). the clinical outcomes evaluated were  visible plaque index, bop, position of the gingival margin, relative attachment level (ral), and pd. real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used for quantitative analysis of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis). the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) technique permitted the detection of prostaglandin e(2,) interleukin-1beta, and interferon-gamma levels in gingival crevicular fluid. all  parameters were evaluated at baseline and at 3 and 6 months post-treatment. results: at 6 months, the test treatment resulted in lower bop and an additional  reduction (0.83 mm) in pd (p <0.05). data also showed ral gain > or =2 mm at 43.52% of sites in control patients compared to 58.03% of sites in test patients  (p <0.05). however, both groups had similar mean ral gain (1.68 and 1.88 mm for the control and test groups, respectively). real-time pcr and elisa failed to identify significant differences between the groups. conclusions: both treatments resulted in significant clinical improvements; however, there was a slight, but significantly greater, improvement in bop and the percentage of sites with pd > or =5 mm exhibiting ral gain > or =2 mm in the test group. nevertheless, no improvement in the microbiologic or immunologic outcome was observed with the adjunctive use of systemic amoxicillin and metronidazole.

TI  == characterization of bacteria, clostridia and bacteroides in faeces of vegetarians using qpcr and pcr-dgge fingerprinting.
AB  == background/aims: this study aimed to investigate the quantitative and qualitative changes of bacteria, bacteroides, bifidobacterium and clostridium cluster iv in faecal microbiota associated with a vegetarian diet. methods: bacterial abundances were measured in faecal samples of 15 vegetarians and 14 omnivores using quantitative pcr. diversity was assessed with pcr-dgge fingerprinting, principal component analysis (pca) and shannon diversity index. results: vegetarians had a 12% higher abundance of bacterial dna than omnivores, a tendency for less clostridium cluster iv (31.86 +/- 17.00%; 36.64 +/- 14.22%) and higher abundance of bacteroides (23.93 +/- 10.35%; 21.26 +/- 8.05%), which were not significant due to high interindividual variations. pca suggested a grouping  of bacteria and members of clostridium cluster iv. two bands appeared significantly more frequently in omnivores than in vegetarians (p < 0.005 and p < 0.022). one was identified as faecalibacterium sp. and the other was 97.9% similar to the uncultured gut bacteriumdq793301. conclusions: a vegetarian diet affects the intestinal microbiota, especially by decreasing the amount and changing the diversity of clostridium cluster iv. it remains to be determined how these shifts might affect the host metabolism and disease risks.

TI  == rapid qpcr-based assay for fecal bacteroides spp. as a tool for assessing fecal contamination in recreational waters.
AB  == concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria (fib; e.g. escherichia coli, and enterococcus sp.) can only be used in limited ways for determining the source of  fecal contamination in recreational waters because they cannot distinguish human  from non-human fecal contamination. several bacteroides spp. have been suggested  as potential alternative indicators. we have developed a rapid, culture-independent method for quantifying fecal bacteroides spp. using quantitative pcr (qpcr) targeting the 16s rrna gene. the assay specifically targets and quantifies the most common human bacteroides spp. the details of the  method are presented, including analyses of a wide range of fecal samples from different organisms. specificity and performance of the qpcr assay were also tested via a laboratory experiment where human sewage and gull guano were inoculated into a range of environmental water samples. concentrations of fecal bacteroides spp., total enterococcus sp., enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus casseliflavus were measured using qpcr, and total enterococcus sp. and e. coli were quantified by membrane filtration (mf). samples spiked with gull guano were highly concentrated with total enterococcus sp., e. coli, e. faecalis, and e. casseliflavus, demonstrating that these indicators are  prominent in animal feces. on the other hand, fecal bacteroides spp. concentrations were high in samples containing sewage and were relatively low in  samples spiked with gull guano. sensitivity and specificity results suggest that  the rapid fecal bacteroides spp. qpcr assay may be a useful tool to effectively predict the presence and concentration of human-specific fecal pollution.

TI  == phocaeicola abscessus gen. nov., sp. nov., an anaerobic bacterium isolated from a human brain abscess sample.
AB  == a strictly anaerobic bacterial strain, 7401987t, was isolated from a human brain  abscess sample. cells were gram-negative, non-spore-forming, coccoid to rod-shaped and motile by flagella in a lophotrichous arrangement. the isolate was asaccharolytic and the major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-c15:0 (28.2%), c16:0 (18.0%), iso-c15:0 (12.3%) and iso-c17:0 3-oh (11.7%). 16s rrna gene sequence comparisons showed that the isolate was distantly related to members of  the genera bacteroides (<83.6% similarity), parabacteroides (<79.9% similarity),  tannerella (<79.8% similarity), dysgonomonas (<79.6% similarity), porphyromonas (<79.3% similarity) and prevotella (<78.9% similarity). the low 16s rrna gene sequence similarity values and physiological and biochemical characteristics differentiated strain 7401987t from all known species and indicate that our isolate represents a novel species in a new genus within the phylum bacteroidetes. the name phocaeicola abscessus gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain of phocaeicola abscessus is 7401987t (=ccug 55929t=csur p22t=dsm  21584t).

TI  == influence of long-term consumption of a lactococcus lactis strain on the intestinal immunity and intestinal flora of the senescence-accelerated mouse.
AB  == the senescence-accelerated mouse develops normally until 5-6 months of age and then displays rapid and irreversible advancement of senescence manifesting as clinical signs and gross lesions. to clarify the effect of lactic acid bacteria on the physiological changes with increasing age, heat-killed lactococcus lactis  g50 was administered to 1-month-old senescence-accelerated-prone mouse (samp)6 mice for 11 months, a senescence-accelerated mouse strain that develops senile osteoporosis. mice fed g50 gained more weight than the control mice (not fed g50) during the feeding experiment. faecal iga levels in the mice fed g50 at 3 months  were higher than those of the control mice but decreased to control levels with increasing age. the numbers of viable cells of bacteroides sp., lactobacillus sp., staphylococcus sp., enterococcus/streptococcus sp. and enterobacteriaceae sp. in faeces were similar for mice fed the g50 and control diets at any age, but strain g50 suppressed the intestinal growth of h2s-producing bacteria. bone density of the thigh bone did not differ between aged g50 and control mice. strain g50 would be a beneficial bacterium for the enhancement of intestinal immunity during youth and to suppress the growth of harmful intestinal bacteria.  the applicability of strain g50 for the food and animal industries has been proposed in the present study.

TI  == spatial and temporal changes in the microbial community in an anaerobic swine waste treatment lagoon.
AB  == microorganisms are central to both the beneficial (organic degradation, nutrient  removal, biogas production) and detrimental (odor production, pathogen contamination) effects of swine waste storage systems. in this study, both quantitative (real-time polymerase chain reaction) and qualitative (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, cloning, sequence analysis) molecular analyses were used to track spatial and temporal changes in the microbial community of swine slurry from a 0.4 ha anaerobic lagoon. the lagoon, located in a region of western kentucky which has a humid, subtropical environment, was sampled on a monthly basis (n=10) over a period of one year at four different depths (top, 51 cm from  the top, 152 cm from the top, and bottom >198 cm). the concentration and diversity of bacteroides sp. was seasonal (up to 90% decrease between march and june). hespellia sp. and other clostridial species, on the other hand, were endemic in the slurry (concentrations up to 1.0x10(7) cells ml(-1) slurry) regardless of time of the year or lagoon depth. results suggest that there were seasonal effects on the microbial community in the swine lagoon, while the effect of depth was not as pronounced. seasonal changes in the microbial community in stored wastes may be (directly or indirectly) correlated with changes in malodor  emissions from lagoons.

TI  == extremophile culture collection from andean lakes: extreme pristine environments  that host a wide diversity of microorganisms with tolerance to uv radiation.
AB  == a total of 88 bacterial strains were isolated from six andean lakes situated at altitudes ranging from 3,400 to 4,600 m above sea level: l. aparejos (4,200 m), l. negra (4,400 m), l. verde (4,460 m), l. azul (4,400 m), l. vilama (4,600 m), and salina grande (3,400 m). salinity ranged from 0.4 to 117 ppm. general diversity was determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis. from the excised dgge bands, 182 bacterial sequences of good quality were obtained. gammaproteobacteria and cytophaga/flavobacterium/bacteroides (cfb) were the most abundant phylogenetic groups with 42% and 18% of identified bands,  respectively. the isolated strains were identified by sequence analysis. isolated bacteria were subjected to five different uv-b exposure times: 0.5, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. afterwards, growth of each isolate was monitored and resistance was classified according to the growth pattern. a wide interspecific variation among  the 88 isolates was observed. medium and highly resistant strains accounted for 43.2% and 28.4% of the isolates, respectively, and only 28.4% was sensitive. resistance to solar radiation was equally distributed among the isolates from the different lakes regardless of the salinity of the lakes and pigmentation of isolates. of the highly resistant isolates, 44.5% belonged to gammaproteobacteria, 33.3% to betaproteobacteria, 40% to alphaproteobacteria, 50% to cfb, and among gram-positive organisms, 33.3% were hgc and 44.5% were firmicutes. most resistant strains belonged to genera like exiguobaceterium sp.,  acinetobacter sp., bacillus sp., micrococcus sp., pseudomonas sp., sphyngomonas sp., staphylococcus sp., and stenotrophomonas sp. the current study provides further evidence that gammaproteobacteria are the most abundant and the most uv-b-resistant phylogenetic group in andean lakes and that uv resistance in bacteria isolated from these environments do not depend on pigmentation and tolerance to salinity.

TI  == microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women.
AB  == background: the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals is a recently created microbial niche which thus far has been characterized only to a very limited extent. yet the knowledge of this microflora can be considered as essential to the follow-up of transsexual women. the primary objective of this study was to map the neo-vaginal microflora in a group of 50 transsexual women for whom a neovagina was constructed by means of the inverted penile skin flap technique. secondary objectives were to describe possible correlations of this microflora with multiple patients' characteristics, such as  sexual orientation, the incidence of vaginal irritation and malodorous vaginal discharge. results: based on gram stain the majority of smears revealed a mixed microflora that had some similarity with bacterial vaginosis (bv) microflora and  that contained various amounts of cocci, polymorphous gram-negative and gram-positive rods, often with fusiform and comma-shaped rods, and sometimes even with spirochetes. candida cells were not seen in any of the smears. on average 8.6 species were cultured per woman. the species most often found were: staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus anginosus group spp., enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium sp., mobiluncus curtisii and bacteroides ureolyticus. lactobacilli were found in only one of 30 women. there was no correlation between dilatation habits, having coitus, rinsing habits and malodorous vaginal discharge on the one hand and the presence of a particular species on the other. there was  however a highly significant correlation between the presence of e. faecalis on the one hand and sexual orientation and coitus on the other (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027 respectively). respectively 82%, 58% and 30% of the samples showed an amplicon after amplification with m. curtisii, atopobium vaginae and gardnerella  vaginalis primer sets. conclusion: our study is the first to describe the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women. it reveals a  mixed microflora of aerobe and anaerobe species usually found either on the skin, in the intestinal microflora or in a bv microflora.

TI  == [bacterial diversity of disused thermal vents in tibetan yangbajing region].
AB  == objective: to study the bacterial diversity in sediment and water from two disused thermal vents in yangbajing, tibet, china. methods: we constructed 16s rrna gene libraries of the total dna from three samples. sediment sample a and water sample a were from thermal vent a. sediment sample b was from thermal vent  b. positive clones from the libraries were analyzed randomly by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. positive clones' sequences of every operational taxonomic units from libraries were determined, and sequence data were submitted to genbank and contrasted to those known sequences. phylogenetic trees were built up by using mega4.0 program. results: most of bacteria communities of the two thermal vents were typical thermophilc inhabitants, the predominant proteobacteria communities were found in thermal vent a and thermal vent b (ratios in sediment a, water sample a and sediment b were 41.08%, 38.00% and 42.57%) one of the sub-predominant bacteria communities, deinococcus-thermus, was found in thermal vent a and thermal vent b (ratios in sediment a, water sample a and sediment b were 10.71%, 20.00% and 21.30%). moreover, one of the sub-predominant bacteria communities, acidobacteria that was rarely found in hot  springs or thermal vents, was present both in sediments of thermal vent a and b (16.07%, 19.15%). the third sub-predominant community in sediment of thermal vent a was eubacterium sp. (14.28%), belonging to phylum firmicutes whereas no acidobacteria was found in water sample a. instead, hydrogenobacter, belonging to phylum aquificae, was another sub-predominant community (16.00%) in water sample  a. in addition, chloroflexi, cyanobacteria and cfb group ( cytophaga-flexibacter-bacteroides) were detected in both thermal vents. conclusion: compared with and contrasted to the references, we found that bacteria communities in yangbajing thermal field were similar to that in some hot springs and thermal vents around the world but slightly abnormal. some bacteria communities in thermal vent a and thermal vent b were not very popular, such as vibrio sp., bacteriovorax sp., holophagalacidobacterium, verrucomicrobium.

TI  == species identification of clinical isolates of bacteroides by matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis and related species are important human pathogens involved in mixed infections of different origins. the b. fragilis group isolates are phenotypically very similar, grow more slowly than aerobic bacteria and, accordingly, are frequently misidentifed with classical or automated phenotypical identification methods. recent taxonomic changes and new species accepted as members of the bacteroides genus are not included in the different databases of commercially available identification kits. the use of matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) was therefore evaluated for the species identification of 277 clinical isolates of the bacteroides genus. species identification was carried out with maldi bruker daltonik biotyper software (bruker daltonik gmbh, bremen, germany) by comparing the mass spectrum of each strain with the mass spectra of the 3260 reference strains currently available. the results of conventional phenotypical identification of the isolates were used as a reference. 16s rrna gene sequencing was performed for a selection of the strains that gave discrepant results and for all those inconclusively identified by maldi-tof ms; 270 isolates (97.5%) were unequivocally identified [log(score) >/=2.0] by comparison with the reference strains present in the maldi biotyper database. of the 23 isolates for which the  maldi-tof ms species identification differed from the conventional phenotypical identification, 11 were sequenced. the sequencing data confirmed the maldi-tof ms result in ten cases and, for the remaining isolate, the sequencing data did not lead to the determination of the species, but only to that of the genus (bacteroides sp.). the discriminating power and identification accuracy of maldi-tof ms proved to be superior to that of biochemical testing for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides uniformis.

TI  == antibacterial activity of human defensins on anaerobic intestinal bacterial species: a major role of hbd-3.
AB  == defensins are natural mucosal antimicrobial peptides and their broad spectrum activity against aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria has been well investigated. the aim of this study was to systematically examine the antibacterial activity of the small intestinal paneth cell derived alpha-defensin hd5 and the major colonic beta-defensins hbd-1-3 against strict anaerobic intestinal bacteria. the antibacterial activity was assessed with a flow cytometric assay employing a membrane potential sensitive dye as marker for loss  of cell viability. the majority of the tested strains belonging to the dominant anaerobe genera of the gut, bacteroides and parabacteroides, were only minimally  affected by the constitutively expressed defensins hd5 and hbd-1. the inducible defensin hbd-2 had a limited antibacterial effect, whereas the inducible hbd-3 exhibited potent activity against most strains. the effect of hbd-3 on bacteroides sp. appeared to be dependent on the presence of oxygen. bacteroides fragilis strains isolated from blood during bacteremia or from extraintestinal infections were more resistant to hbd-3 than strains from the physiological gut flora. thus, defensin resistance is not only species- but also strain-specific and may be clinically relevant in the host-bacteria interaction influencing mucosal translocation and systemic infection.

TI  == multidrug resistance gene deficient (mdr1a-/-) mice have an altered caecal microbiota that precedes the onset of intestinal inflammation.
AB  == aim: to compare caecal microbiota from mdr1a(-/-) and wild type (fvb) mice to identify differences in the bacterial community that could influence the intestinal inflammation. methods and results: caecal microbiota of mdr1a(-/-) and fvb mice were evaluated at 12 and 25 weeks of age using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and quantitative real-time pcr. dgge fingerprints of fvb and mdr1a(-/-) mice (with no intestinal inflammation) at 12 weeks revealed differences in the presence of dna fragments identified as bacteroides fragilis,  b. thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus and an uncultured alphaproteobacterium. escherichia coli and acinetobacter sp. were only identified in dgge profiles of mdr1a(-/-) mice at 25 weeks (with severe intestinal inflammation), which also had a lower number of total bacteria in the caecum compared with fvb mice at same age. conclusions: differences found in the caecal microbiota of fvb and mdr1a(-/-) mice (12 weeks) suggest that the lack of abcb1 transporters in intestinal cells due to the disruption of the mdr1a gene might lead to changes in the caecal microbiota. the altered microbiota along with the genetic defect could contribute to the development of intestinal inflammation in mdr1a(-/-) mice. significance and impact of the study: differences in caecal microbiota of mdr1a(-/-) and fvb mice (12 weeks) suggest genotype specific colonization. the results provide evidence that abcb1 transporters may regulate host interactions with commensal bacteria. future work is needed to identify the mechanisms involved in this possible cross-talk between the host intestinal cells and microbiota.

TI  == sphingobacterium sp. strain pm2-p1-29 harbours a functional tet(x) gene encoding  for the degradation of tetracycline.
AB  == aims: the tet(x) gene has previously been found in obligate anaerobic bacteroides spp., which is curious because tet(x) encodes for a nadp-dependent monooxygenase  that requires oxygen to degrade tetracycline. in this study, we characterized a tetracycline resistant, aerobic, gram-negative sphingobacterium sp. strain pm2-p1-29 that harbours a tet(x) gene. methods and results: sphingobacterium sp.  pm2-p1-29 demonstrated the ability to transform tetracycline compared with killed controls. the presence of the tet(x) gene was verified by pcr and nucleotide sequence analysis. additional nucleotide sequence analysis of regions flanking the tet(x) gene revealed a mobilizable transposon-like element (tn6031) that shared organizational features and genes with the previously described bacteroides conjugative transposon ctndot. a circular transposition intermediate  of the tet(x) region, characteristic of mobilizable transposons, was detected. however, we could not demonstrate the conjugal transfer of the tet(x) gene using  three different recipient strains and numerous experimental conditions. conclusions: this study suggests that sphingobacterium sp. pm2-p1-29 or a related bacterium may be an ancestral source of the tet(x) gene. significance and impact  of the study: this study demonstrates the importance of environmental bacteria and lateral gene transfer in the dissemination and proliferation of antibiotic resistance among bacteria.

AB  == aquatic humic substance (ahs) in landfill leachate is resistant to biodegradation, especially in anaerobic habitats. however, we reported here for the first time that ahs was completely biodegraded with the anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process. as a result of aromatic-ring cleavage and mineralization, carboxylic and aliphatic organics were significantly produced, the contents of chromophores such as quinoid and ketone were remarkably decreased to decolorize the leachate, and produced carbon dioxide along with increasing carbonate was clearly presented. of the degraded ahs of 137 mg l(-1), 51 mg l(-1) was owed to the oxidation with sulfate of 76 mg l(-1) as electron acceptor, and the rest to other metabolic mechanism. isolation and identification of heterotrophic bacteria revealed a diversified consortium comprising four facultative anaerobic species, bacillus sp., paenibacillus sp., bacteroides sp. and staphylococcus sp., without sulfate-reducing bacteria detected. their contribution to ahs biodegradation and sulfate reduction under the special conditions with high oxidization-reduction potential and insufficient electron acceptors has not been known yet. further work is underway to investigate their properties and respective duties in the consortium.

TI  == uncultivated bacteria as etiologic agents of intra-amniotic inflammation leading  to preterm birth.
AB  == intra-amniotic infection and inflammation are major causes of preterm birth (ptb). however, intra-amniotic inflammation is often detected in the absence of infection. this may partly be due to the culturing methods employed in hospital laboratories, which are unable to detect the uncultivated species. in this study, intra-amniotic microbial infections associated with ptb were examined by both culture and 16s rrna-based culture-independent methods and were corroborated by the presence of intra-amniotic inflammation. amniotic fluid (af) specimens from 46 pregnancies complicated by ptb and 16 asymptomatic women were analyzed. no bacterial dna was amplified in af collected from the asymptomatic women. among the 46 samples associated with ptb, bacterial dna was amplified from all (16/16)  of the culture-positive samples and 17% (5/30) of the culture-negative samples. in the culture-positive group, additional species were detected in more than half (9/16) of the cases by pcr and clone analysis. altogether, approximately two- thirds of the species detected by the culture-independent methods were not isolated by culture. they included both uncultivated and difficult-to-cultivate species, such as fusobacterium nucleatum, leptotrichia (sneathia) spp., a bergeyella sp., a peptostreptococcus sp., bacteroides spp., and a species of the  order clostridiales. to examine intra-amniotic inflammation, an af proteomic fingerprint (mass-restricted score) was determined by surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. inflammation was detected in all five samples which were culture negative but pcr positive. women who were  pcr positive more often had elevated interleukin-6 levels in their af, histological chorioamnionitis, and funisitis and delivered neonates with early-onset neonatal sepsis. previously unrecognized, uncultivated, or difficult-to-cultivate species may play a key role in the initiation of ptb.

TI  == commensal intestinal bacterial strains trigger ankylosing enthesopathy of the ankle in inbred b10.br (h-2(k)) male mice.
AB  == joint disease ankylosing enthesopathy (ankent) naturally occurs in inbred mice with c57bl/10 genetic background. ankent has many parallels to human ankylosing spondylitis (as) and represents an animal model for as. environmental conditions  (i.e., microbial load of the organism) are among the risk factors for ankent, similar to as. the role of microflora in the development of ankent was investigated. ankent was tested in four experimental groups of germ-free mice associated with different numbers of various intestinal microbes and three control groups: germ-free, specific pathogen-free, and conventional (cv) mice. mice were colonized either with anaerobic bacteria isolated from the intestine of a cv mouse or with bacterial strains obtained from the collection of microorganisms. microbes were characterized and checked by microbiological cultivation methods and with the use of polymerase chain reaction amplification and rdna sequence analysis. joint disease developed in gf mice colonized with a mixture containing bacteroides spp. and enterococcus sp., and/or veillonella sp.  and staphylococcus sp. no ankent appeared in males colonized with probiotic bacterium lactobacillus sp. in control groups ankent occurred in spf and cv animals; the gf animals remained healthy. the results confirmed that the germ-free conditions protect from joint inflammation, and thus microbes are necessary for ankent development. in colonized mice the ankent was triggered by luminal anaerobic bacteria, which are common components of intestinal microflora.

TI  == detection of periodontal pathogens in oral mucous membranes of edentulous individuals.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to investigate the colonization of campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), prevotella intermedia, and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) in the tongue and cheek of newborns and elderly individuals with no teeth. methods:  seventy-four edentulous subjects were included in this cross-sectional study. microbiologic samples were taken from the dorsum of the tongue and cheek mucosa of all individuals and analyzed using a bacterial dna-specific polymerase chain reaction. results: c. rectus was the most prevalent species in both groups (20.9% in the cheek of newborns, and 77.4% in the tongue of elderly subjects). p. gingivalis and p. intermedia were not detected in any of the 43 newborns; however, p. gingivalis was recovered from the tongue and cheek (3.2%) of elderly  individuals, whereas p. intermedia was detected in the tongue (9.6%) and cheek (3.2%) of elderly individuals. t. forsythia was detected in newborns as well as elderly individuals, although the highest prevalence was observed in the tongue of newborns (6.9%) and elderly (9.6%) individuals. a. actinomycetemcomitans was not found in the tongue of newborns, but we observed a. actinomycetemcomitans in  the cheek (2.3%) of newborns and in the tongue (12.9%) and cheek (6.4%) of elderly patients. conclusions: although we did not detect p. gingivalis and p. intermedia in newborns, periodontal pathogens could be detected from the oral mucous membranes of edentulous individuals. our results suggest that major attention should be paid to edentulous individuals as an important measure in the prevention of the initial colonization of natural teeth and dental implants by periodontal pathogens.

TI  == correlates of periodontal decline and biologic markers in older adults.
AB  == background: there is limited information on infectious and host responses distinguishing older people with or without active periodontitis. this study measured bacterial and serum cytokine and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hscrp) levels in older persons. methods: elders (mean age: 67 years), whose periodontal status had declined most or least (20% worst or 20% best) over 5 years, were enrolled. two years later, they were classified as periodontally declining (active periodontitis [ap]), if they had at least five teeth with probing depth (pd) > or =5 mm, or stable (stable periodontally [sp]), if they did not. groups were compared with respect to demographics, pd, clinical loss of attachment, subgingival bacteria, serum hscrp, interleukin (il)-1beta and -6, and chronic diseases. results: ten ap and 24 sp subjects were identified; 13% of women and 44% of men from the original sample were in the ap group (p <0.05). most asians were sp; most whites and all african americans were classified as having ap (p <0.01). more ap elders had osteoporosis (p <0.01), but the ap and sp groups did not differ with respect to il-1beta and -6 or hscrp. bacterial counts  were higher in the ap group for parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros) (7.7 x 10(5) cells versus 3.8 x 10(5) cells; p <0.05), prevotella intermedia (25.7 x 10(5) cells versus 9.8 x 10(5) cells; p <0.01), tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (16.2 x 10(5) cells versus 8.0 x 10(5) cells; p <0.05), and streptococcus mutans (6.2 x 10(5) cells versus 2.0 x 10(5) cells; p <0.01). three risk factors were most predictive of periodontal decline: pd, osteoporosis, and being white or african american. conclusion: periodontal decline was associated with osteoporosis, ethnicity, pd,  gender, serum hscrp, and levels of four bacterial species.

TI  == influence of support material on the immobilization of biomass for the degradation of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate in anaerobic reactors.
AB  == two horizontal-flow anaerobic immobilized biomass reactors (haib) were used to study the degradation of the las surfactant: one filled with charcoal (haib1) and the other with a mixed bed of expanded clay and polyurethane foam (haib2). the reactors were fed with synthetic substrate supplemented with 14 mg l(-1)of las, kept at 30+/-2 degrees c and operated with a hydraulic retention time (hrt) of 12h. the surfactant was quantified by hplc. spatial variation analyses were done  to quantify organic matter and las consumption along the reactor length. the presence of the surfactant in the load did not affect the removal of organic matter (cod), which was close to 90% in both reactors for an influent cod of 550  mg l(-1). the results of a mass balance indicated that 28% of all las added to haib1 was removed by degradation. haib2 presented 27% degradation. molecular biology techniques revealed microorganisms belonging the uncultured holophaga sp., uncultured delta proteobacterium, uncultured verrucomicrobium sp., bacteroides sp. and uncultured gamma proteobacterium sp. the reactor with biomass immobilized on charcoal presented lower adsorption and a higher kinetic degradation coefficient. so, it was the most suitable support for las anaerobic treatment.

TI  == [microbial diversity analysis in rotating drum biofilter for nitric oxide denitrifying removal].
AB  == pcr-dgge was applied to analyze the microbial communities in rotating drum biofilter (rdb) for nitric oxide denitrifying removal under anaerobic conditions. the 16s rrna genes (v3 region) were amplified with two universal primers (338f-gc and 518r). these amplified dna fragments were separated by parallel dgge. the dgge profiles of biofilm samples from different sections of rdb are similar and about sixteen types of microorganisms are identified in the biofilm samples. these results show that microbial diversity of rdb firstly increases but then decreases with the addition of cu ii (edta) and the increase of no removal efficiency. however, the change of microbial community is not significant during  the process. eight major bands of 16s rrna genes fragments from dgge profiles of  biofilm samples were further eluted from gel, re-amplified, cloned and sequenced. the sequences of these fragments were compared with the database in genebank (ncbi). the gene analysis of 16s rrna showed that the major populations are cytopahga-flexibacteria-bacteroides (cfb) group bacteroides, beta -proteobacterium, gamma-proteobacterium and clostridium sp.. in addition, denitrification is related with band g-5, g-6 and g-8. g-5 is affiliated with gamma-proteobacterium. both g-6 and g-8 are affiliated with beta-proteobacterium.

TI  == use of bromodeoxyuridine immunocapture to identify psychrotolerant phenanthrene-degrading bacteria in phenanthrene-enriched polluted baltic sea sediments.
AB  == the aim of this study was to enrich and identify psychrotolerant phenanthrene-degrading bacteria from polluted baltic sea sediments. polyaromatic  hydrocarbon (pah)-contaminated sediments were spiked with phenanthrene and incubated for 2 months in the presence of bromodeoxyuridine that is incorporated  into the dna of replicating cells. the bromodeoxyuridine-incorporated dna was extracted by immunocapture and analyzed by terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism and 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing to identify bacterial populations that were growing. in addition, degradation genes were quantified in  the bromodeoxyuridine-incorporated dna by real-time pcr. phenanthrene concentrations decreased after 2 months of incubation in the phenanthrene-enriched sediments and this reduction correlated to increases in copy numbers of xyle and phnac dioxygenase genes. representatives of exiguobacterium, schewanella, methylomonas, pseudomonas, bacteroides and an uncultured deltaproteobacterium and a gammaproteobacterium dominated the growing  community in the phenanthrene-spiked sediments. isolates that were closely related to three of these bacteria (two pseudomonads and an exiguobacterium sp.)  could reduce phenanthrene concentrations in pure cultures and they all harbored phnac dioxygenase genes. these results confirm that this combination of culture-based and molecular approaches was useful for identification of actively  growing bacterial species with a high potential for phenanthrene degradation.

TI  == proteolytic activity in stored aerobic granular sludge and structural integrity.
AB  == aerobic granules lose stability during storage. the goal of this work was to highlight the main cause of stability loss for stored granules as intracellular protein hydrolysis. the quantity of extracellular proteins was noted to be significantly lower during granule storage, and protease enzyme activities were correspondingly higher in the cores of stored granules. the proteolytic bacteria, which secrete highly active protease enzymes, were for the first time isolated and characterized by analyzing 16s rdna sequences. the proteolytic bacteria belonged to the genera pseudomonas, raoultella, acinetobacter, pandoraea, klebsiella, bacillus and uncultured bacterium, and were grouped into proteobacteria, enterobacteria and firmicutes. the pb1 (pseudomonas aeruginosa) strain, which exhibited very high proteolytic activity during the skim milk agar  test, was located at the core regime with active protease enzymes, and was close  to the obligate anaerobic strain bacteroides sp. hence, the extracellular proteins in stored granules were proposed to be hydrolyzed by enzymes secreted by proteolytic bacteria with the hydrolyzed products ultimately being used by nearby anaerobic strains. this process gradually digests the protein core, and eventually consumes the entire granule.

TI  == prognostic factors and impact of antibiotherapy in 117 cases of anaerobic bacteraemia.
AB  == bacteraemia due to anaerobic bacteria occurs infrequently, making the systematic  use of an anaerobic blood sample bottle in patients with sepsis controversial. we retrospectively reviewed the clinical and microbiological data from all cases of  anaerobic bacteraemia in a teaching hospital over 2 years and determined the prognostic factors and antibiotic management. with the goal of evaluating the morbidity and mortality of bacteraemia due to anaerobic bacteria, a case-control  study was also performed. one hundred eighty-four blood cultures from 125 patients grew at least one anaerobic bacterium, representing 0.5% of all and 7.0% of the positive blood cultures. one hundred seventeen patients were studied. in 24 cases, anaerobic blood cultures were associated with concomitant aerobic bacteria isolation. the most frequently isolated anaerobic species were bacteroides sp. (n = 62), clostridium sp. (n = 25), and fusobacterium sp. (n = 12). the most frequent site of origin was the digestive tract (n = 61). in 51 cases, patients did not receive adequate empirical antianaerobic therapy. the mortality rate was 27%. age [odds ratio (or) 1.059; 95% confidence interval (ci)  1.021-1.100], cancer history (or 3.21, 95% ci 1.126-9.156), and ineffective definitive antibiotherapy (or 19.292, 95% ci 5.330-69.832) were independently associated with increased hospital mortality. the 72 patients that could be matched with patients without anaerobic bacteria according to their primary diagnosis had a longer hospitalisation and a trend toward increased mortality (p  = 0.08). anaerobic bacteraemia contributed significantly to the morbidity of the  patients, and adequate empirical antibiotherapy may play an important role in the clinical outcomes.

TI  == activity and structure of stored aerobic granules.
AB  == this study investigates how storage temperatures and periods under extended idle  conditions affected the stability and activity of granules that have a high phenol-degrading capability. the granule activity increased as storage temperature decreased, and declined as storage time increased. granules stored with pure water at room temperature (20.8+/-5.6 degrees c) lost stability after three months storage. particularly, granules stored with 500 mg l(-1) phenol solution demonstrated high phenol degradation capability following storage. further, storage at subfreezing temperatures (-20 degrees c) is an ideal way of preserving stability and activity of phenol-fed granules. anaerobic degradation of proteins in granule core by obligate anaerobic strain such as bacteroides sp.  corresponded to the stability loss of stored granules.

AB  == an adult male eastern grey kangaroo from a wildlife reserve near melbourne was submitted for necropsy examination and was discovered to have abnormal dentition. there was no evidence that any premolars or molars had ever been present on the right mandible, whilst the incisors were normal. the age of the kangaroo was estimated to be 1 year 9 months using the right maxillary molars and 2 years 4 months old using the contralateral side, presumably due to the asymmetry of the dental arcades. 'lumpy jaw', a common periodontal disease of kangaroos, from which bacteroides sp was cultured, was present on the base of the vertical ramus  of the left mandible. complete unilateral absence of premolar and molar teeth in  the mandible of a kangaroo has not been described. this condition affected molar  progression in both sets of maxillary molars.

AB  == two strictly anaerobic bacterial strains (sv434(t) and s562) were isolated from rice-straw residue in a methanogenic reactor treating waste from cattle farms in  japan. they had identical 16s rrna gene sequences and showed almost the same phenotypic properties. the cells of both strains were gram-negative, non-motile,  non-spore-forming rods; extraordinarily long rods often occurred. remarkable stimulation of growth occurred with the addition of haemin and cobalamin (vitamin b(12)) to the medium. the supplementary cobalamin and haemin could be replaced if autoclaved and clarified sludge fluid obtained from the reactor was added. both strains utilized a range of growth substrates, including arabinose, fructose, galactose, glucose, mannose, cellobiose, maltose, glycogen, starch, dextrin, amygdalin, lactate and pyruvate. both strains produced acetate and propionate with a small amount of succinate from these substrates in the presence of haemin  and cobalamin. both strains were slightly alkaliphilic, having a ph optimum at about 7.9. the temperature range for growth was 5-35 degrees c, the optimum being 30 degrees c. the nacl concentration range for growth was 0-4 % (w/v). catalase activity was not detected in cells cultivated without haemin, whereas cells cultivated with haemin usually had the enzyme activity. oxidase and nitrate-reducing activities were not detected. aesculin was hydrolysed, but gelatin was not hydrolysed. both strains were sensitive to bile acids. the major  cellular fatty acids of both strains were anteiso-c(15 : 0) and iso-c(15 : 0). menaquinones mk-8(h(0)) and mk-9(h(0)) were the major respiratory quinones and the genomic dna g+c contents were 46.2-47.5 mol%. a phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequences placed both strains in the phylum bacteroidetes. bacteroides coprosuis (isolated from swine-manure storage pits) was the species most closely related to both strains (95.9 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity to the type strain). on the basis of the phylogenetic, physiological and chemotaxonomic analyses, strains sv434(t) and s562 represent a novel species of the genus bacteroides, for which the name bacteroides propionicifaciens sp. nov.  is proposed. the type strain is sv434(t) (=jcm 14649(t) =dsm 19291(t)).

AB  == numerous novel anaerobic bacteria were isolated from the crevicular spaces of dogs with periodontitis. the phenotypic characteristics of these bacterial isolates indicated that they were similar to members of the genus porphyromonas.  however, comparison of the 16s rrna gene sequences of the isolates indicated that they were related to members of the bacteroides splanchnicus subgroup. a representative of the novel isolates, strain b106(t), induced alveolar bone loss  in a mouse model of experimental periodontal disease. based on biochemical, morphological, molecular phylogenetic, and pathogenic evidence, it is proposed that the taxonomic subgroup containing these novel isolates and b. splanchnicus should be classified in a new genus, odoribacter gen. nov., within the family 'porphyromonadaceae'. in addition, it is proposed that b. splanchnicus should be  reclassified as odoribacter splanchnicus comb. nov., and that the newly identified isolates should be classified as representing odoribacter denticanis sp. nov., the type strain of which is b106(t) (=atcc pta-3625(t)=cncm i-3225(t)).

AB  == two novel strains of the cytophaga-flexibacter-bacteroides (cfb) group, designated gsoil 219" and gsoil 2381, were isolated from soil of a ginseng field  of pocheon province in korea. both strains were gram-negative, aerobic, nonmotile, nonspore-forming, and rod-shaped. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequences indicated that both isolates belong to the genus chitinophaga but were clearly separated from established species of this genus. the sequence similarities between strain gsoil 219t and type strains of the established species and between strain gsoil 238t and type strains of the established species ranged from 91.4 to 94.7% and 91.6 to 94.2%, respectively. phenotypic and chemotaxonomic data (major menaquinone, mk-7; major fatty acids, iso-c15:0 and c(16:1) omega5c; major hydroxy fatty acid, iso-c(17:0) 3-oh; major polyamine, homospermidine) supported the affiliation of both strains gsoil 219t and gsoil 238t to the genus chitinophaga. furthermore, the results of physiological and biochemical tests allowed genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of both strains from the other validated chitinophaga species. therefore, the two isolates represent two novel species, for which the name chitinophaga soli sp. nov. (type strain, gsoil 219t=kctc 12650t=dsm 18093t) and chitinophaga terrae sp. nov. (type strain, gsoil 238t=kctc 12651t=dsm 18078t) are proposed.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus r11 consumed in a food supplement survived human digestive transit without modifying microbiota equilibrium as assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the survival of lactobacillus rhamnosus r11 and lactobacillus acidophilus r52 in the human digestive tract and their effects  on the microbiota homeostasis. we designed an open human trial including 14 healthy volunteers. a 3-week exclusion period of fermented products was followed  by a 12-day consumption period of 4 capsules daily containing 2 x 10(9)l. rhamnosus r11 and 1 x 10(8)l. acidophilus r52, and a 12-day wash-out period. the  2 strains and dominant bacterial groups of the microbiota were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. at the end of the capsule consumption period, high levels of l. rhamnosus r11 were detected in faecal samples from all  volunteers, reaching a mean value of 7.1 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) equivalents/g of stool. l. acidophilus r52 was detected in the stools of only 1 volunteer, reaching a maximum level of 6.1 log(10) cfu equivalents/g of stool. dilution plating enumerations performed in parallel provided less consistent and  generally lower levels. no significant effect of capsule consumption was observed on microbiota homeostasis for the dominant faecal populations. mean values of 8.8, 9.2, 9.9 and 10.6 log(10) cfu equivalents/g of stool were obtained for the clostridium coccoides, bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides sp. and clostridium leptum groups, respectively.

AB  == phospholipid fatty acid (plfa) analysis and 16s ribosomal dna polymerase chain reaction amplification-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) were used to determine microbial communities and predominant microbial populations in  water samples collected from a pilot-scale constructed wetland system. this pilot-scale constructed wetland system consists of three types: subsurface-flow (ssf), surface-flow (sf) and a floating aquatic plant (fap) system. analysis of plfa profiles indicated primarily eukaryotic organisms, including fungi, protozoa, and diatoms were observed in all three wetland systems. biomarkers for  gram-negative bacteria were also detected in all samples analyzed while low proportions of biomarkers for gram-positive bacteria were observed. biomass content (total pfla/sample) was highest in water samples collected from both sf and fap system while highest metabolic activity was observed in fap system. this  is consistent with the observed highest metal removal rate in fap system. sequence analysis of the predominant pcr-dgge dna fragments showed 0.92 to 0.99 similarity indices to beta-proteobacteria, flavobacterium sp. gobb3-206, flexibacter-cytophaga-bacteroides group, and gram-positive bacteria. results suggest diverse microbial communities including microorganisms that may significantly contribute to biogeochemical elemental cycles.

TI  == characterization of bcta, a mating apparatus protein required for transfer of the bacteroides fragilis conjugal element btf-37.
AB  == we have previously described the identification of btf-37, an autonomously transferable chromosomal element isolated from bacteroides fragilis clinical isolate lv23. in this study, we determined that btf-37 harbors a 16kb conjugal transfer-encoding region that contains an almost identical copy of a previously identified bacteroides sp. conjugation-specific gene bcta. bcta has been shown to be required for conjugation in other bacteroides sp. strains, but no information  is available regarding its function. we now report strain distribution and gene expression profiles of bcta. the bcta gene was present in conjugative transposon-harboring b. fragilis strains, but not on a non-transferable b. fragilis plasmid. we also showed that recombinant bcta predominantly localized to the bacterial membrane, and that its n-terminal 32 amino acids were cleaved in an escherichia coli protein expression system, indicating the presence of a signal sequence. expression of bcta consistently increased ~3-fold upon pre-exposure of  conjugating b. fragilis lv23 to subinhibitory concentrations of tetracycline. maximum expression occurred 60min post-tetracycline induction, which also coincided with the time at which highest conjugation frequencies were seen for strain lv23. based on localization, signal sequence and tetracycline inducibility, our results indicate that bcta is indeed an important member of the bacteroides conjugal apparatus, since its gene is regulated by conditions that specifically control conjugation.

TI  == a novel sampling method for the investigation of gut mirobiota.
AB  == aim: in order to characterize the qualitative and quantitative microorganisms in  different sites of the lower digestive tract (ldt) in healthy volunteers, a specific technique was developed for collecting mucous of the distal ileum, colon and rectum. methods: a polyethylene tube was designed to go through the colonoscope channel with a no.8 french tube. in order to avoid internal contamination, the distal extremity was protected with a membrane of microfilm after being sterilized in ethilene oxid. to facilitate the aspiration of a precise volume, its interior was coated with silicone. one hundred microlliter (0.1 ml) sample of mucous was collected and transferred into an eppenddorff tube  containing nine hundred microlliter (0.9 ml) of vmga-3 (viable medium of goteborg). this procedure was repeated at each site of the ldt with a new sterilized catheter. results: all sites revealed the "non pathogenic" anaerobic bacteria veillonella sp (average 10(5) colony forming units/ml-cfu/ml), allowing  to conclude an environment of low oxidation-reduction potential (redox) in the ldt. it was also characterized the presence of klebisiella sp with significant statistical predominance (ssp) in the ileum. enterobacter sp was found with ssp in the sigmoid colon, bacteroides sp non-pigmented (npg) and e.coli with ssp in the sigmoid colon and rectum, enterococcus sp and lactobacillus sp with ssp in the rectum, all in a mean concentration of 10(5) cfu/ml. conclusion: this procedure is feasible and efficient and can point out a similar distribution of the aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with the presence of biological markers of normal microbiota in the ldt.

AB  == the microbial community in the human colon contains bacteria that reduce cholesterol to coprostanol, but the species responsible for this conversion are still unknown. we describe here the first isolation and characterization of a cholesterol-reducing bacterium of human intestinal origin. strain d8 was isolated from a 10(-8) dilution of a fresh stool sample provided by a senior male volunteer with a high capacity to reduce luminal cholesterol to coprostanol. cholesterol-to-coprostanol conversion by strain d8 started on the third day, while cells were in stationary phase, and was almost complete after 7 days. intermediate products (4-cholesten-3-one and coprostanone) were occasionally observed, suggesting an indirect pathway for cholesterol-to-coprostanol conversion. resting-cell assays showed that strain d8 could reduce 1.5 mumol of cholesterol/mg bacterial protein/h. strain d8 was a gram-negative, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped organism identified as a member of the genus bacteroides closely related to bacteroides vulgatus, based on its morphological and biochemical characteristics. the 16s rrna gene sequence of strain d8 was most similar (>99.5%) to those of two isolates of the recently described species bacteroides dorei. phylogenetic tree construction confirmed that bacteroides sp.  strain d8 clustered within an independent clade together with these b. dorei strains. nevertheless, no cholesterol-reducing activity could be detected in cultures of the b. dorei type strain. based on bacteroides group-specific pcr-temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis, there was no correlation between the presence of a band comigrating with the band of bacteroides sp. strain d8 and cholesterol conversion in 11 human fecal samples, indicating that this strain is unlikely to be mainly responsible for cholesterol conversion in the human population.

AB  == the diversity and nitrogenase activity of epilithic marine microbes in a holocene beach rock (heron island, great barrier reef, australia) with a proposed biological calcification "microbialite" origin were examined. partial 16s rrna gene sequences from the dominant mat (a coherent and layered pink-pigmented community spread over the beach rock) and biofilms (nonstratified, differently pigmented microbial communities of small shallow depressions) were retrieved using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), and a clone library was retrieved from the dominant mat. the 16s rrna gene sequences and morphological analyses revealed heterogeneity in the cyanobacterial distribution patterns. the  nonheterocystous filamentous genus blennothrix sp., phylogenetically related to lyngbya, dominated the mat together with unidentified nonheterocystous filaments  of members of the pseudanabaenaceae and the unicellular genus chroococcidiopsis.  the dominance and three-dimensional intertwined distribution of these organisms were confirmed by nonintrusive scanning microscopy. in contrast, the less pronounced biofilms were dominated by the heterocystous cyanobacterial genus calothrix, two unicellular entophysalis morphotypes, lyngbya spp., and members of the pseudanabaenaceae family. cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides and alphaproteobacteria phylotypes were also retrieved from the beach rock. the microbial diversity of the dominant mat was accompanied by high nocturnal nitrogenase activities (as determined by in situ acetylene reduction assays). a new dgge nifh gene optimization approach for cyanobacterial nitrogen fixers showed that the sequences retrieved from the dominant mat were related to nonheterocystous uncultured cyanobacterial phylotypes, only distantly related to  sequences of nitrogen-fixing cultured cyanobacteria. these data stress the occurrence and importance of nonheterocystous epilithic cyanobacteria, and it is  hypothesized that such epilithic cyanobacteria are the principal nitrogen fixers  of the heron island beach rock.

AB  == purpose: the aim of this study was to standardize the methods of sample collection of mucus from the digestive tract and to determine the microbiota in healthy volunteers from brazil, collecting samples from the mouth, esophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon, and rectum. methods: microbiota of selected healthy volunteers from the oral cavity (n=10), the esophagus (n=10), the upper digestive tract (n=20), and the lower digestive tract (n=24) were evaluated through distinct collection methods. collection methods took into account the different sites, using basic scraping and swabbing techniques, stimulated saliva from the oral cavity, irrigation-aspiration with sterile catheters especially designed for the esophagus, a probe especially designed for  upper digestive tract, and a special catheter for the lower digestive tract. results: (i) mixed microbiota were identified in the oral cavity, predominantly gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic cocci; (ii) transitional flora mainly in the  esophagus; (iii) veillonella sp, lactobacillus sp, and clostridium sp in the stomach and duodenum; (iv) in the jejunum and upper ileum, we observed bacteroides sp, proteus sp, and staphylococcus sp, in addition to veillonella sp; (v) in the colon, the presence of "nonpathogenic" anaerobic bacteria veillonella  sp (average 10(5) ufc) indicates the existence of a low oxidation-reduction potential environment, which suggests the possibility of adoption of these bacteria as biological markers of total digestive tract health. conclusions: the  collection methods were efficient in obtaining adequate samples from each segment of the total digestive tract to reveal the normal microbiota. these procedures are safe and easily reproducible for microbiological studies.

TI  == antagonic effect of the inhibition of inducible nitric oxide on the mortality of  mice acutely infected with escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == sepsis, the leading cause of death in intensive care units, is associated with overproduction of nitric oxide (no) due to inducible no synthase (inos), responsible for some of the pathologic changes. aminoguanidine (ag) is a selective inos inhibitor with reported inconsistent actions in sepsis. to investigate the influence of inos, we studied models of acute bacterial sepsis using acute challenges with aerobic (escherichia coli) and anaerobic (bacteroides fragilis) bacteria in the presence of ag. six-week-old, 23 g, male and female balb/c and c57bl/6j mice, in equal proportions, were inoculated (ip) with bacteria in groups of 4 animals for each dose and each experiment in the absence  or presence of ag (50 mg/kg, ip, starting 24 h before challenge and daily until day 6) and serum nitrate was measured by chemiluminescence. both types of bacteria were lethal to mice, with an ld50 of 6 nephelometric units (u) for e. coli and 8 u for b. fragilis. nitrate production peaked on the second day after e. coli inoculation with 8 and 6 u (p < 0.05), but was absent after non-lethal lower doses. after challenge with b. fragilis this early peak occurred at all tested doses after 24 h, including non-lethal ones (p < 0.05). ag-treated mice challenged with e. coli presented higher survival (p < 0.05) and increased ld50.  ag-treated mice challenged with b. fragilis had lower ld50 and higher mortality.  control ag-treated animals presented no toxic effects. the opposite effect of inos blockade by ag in these models could be explained by restriction of oxygen for immune cells or an efficient action of no in anaerobic localized infections.  the antagonic role of no production observed in our bacterial models could explain the reported discrepancy of no action in sepsis.

TI  == bft gene subtyping in enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis isolated from children with acute diarrhea.
AB  == enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis (etbf) strains are associated with diarrhea  disease in farm animals and young children. in this study, the bft gene subtyping from etbf strains recovered from one immunodeficient and two immunocompetent children with diarrhea were determined. thirteen etbf strains were isolated and by using a multiplex-pcr their bft subtypes were determined. all 13 etbf strains  harbored the bft-1 subtype and by ap-pcr they were clustered in the same group i. this study shows that etbf strains can be present in acute diarrhea and that bft-1 subtype is often present in these organisms. however, further studies are needed to evaluate the role of this bft-1 subtype in the pathogenesis of diarrhea.

TI  == bacteroides barnesiae sp. nov., bacteroides salanitronis sp. nov. and bacteroides gallinarum sp. nov., isolated from chicken caecum.
AB  == eight bacterial strains isolated from the caecum of chicken, bl2(t), bl66, eg3, eg6, m27, bl78(t), c35(t) and c43, were characterized by determining their phenotypic characteristics, cellular fatty acid profiles, menaquinone profiles and phylogenetic positions based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that these isolates belonged to the genus bacteroides. one group of five strains (bl2(t), bl66, eg3, eg6 and m27) was related most closely to bacteroides coprocola jcm 12979(t), with approximately 93 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity, and to bacteroides plebeius jcm 12973(t), with about 92 % similarity, and shared >or=99.6 % similarity with each other. strain bl78(t) exhibited 90.5 % similarity to b. plebeius jcm 12973(t) and 89.8 % similarity to b. coprocola jcm 12979(t) and differed from the above group of five strains at >or=10 % sequence divergence. strains c35(t) and c43 were related most closely to bacteroides eggerthii jcm 12986(t), with 95.1 % sequence similarity, to bacteroides stercoris jcm 9496(t), with 94.6 % similarity, and to bacteroides  uniformis jcm 5828(t), with 94.4 % similarity, and shared 100 % similarity with each other. from results of phenotypic examination, cellular fatty acid composition analysis, menaquinone composition analysis and dna g+c contents, the  group of five strains as well as strain bl78(t) were shown to differ from the type strains of b. coprocola and b. plebeius. strain bl78(t) differed from the others based on its menaquinone composition, which included mk-11 and mk-12. strains c35(t) and c43 could also be differentiated from the type strains of b. eggerthii, b. stercoris and b. uniformis. the group of five strains, strain bl78(t), b. coprocola jcm 12979(t) and b. plebeius jcm 12973(t) showed low levels of dna-dna relatedness (<35 %) with each other. high levels of dna-dna relatedness were obtained within the group of five strains (>75 %). strains c35(t) and c43 exhibited a high level of dna-dna relatedness (>88 %) with each other, but low levels with b. eggerthii jcm 12986(t) (<40 %), b. stercoris jcm 9496(t) (<37 %) and b. uniformis jcm 5828(t) (<16 %). on the basis of these data, three novel bacteroides species are proposed: bacteroides barnesiae sp. nov. (type strain bl2(t)=jcm 13652(t)=dsm 18169(t)), bacteroides salanitronis sp. nov. (type strain bl78(t)=jcm 13657(t)=dsm 18170(t)) and bacteroides gallinarum sp. nov. (type strain c35(t)=jcm 13658(t)=dsm 18171(t)).

TI  == cardinium symbionts cause cytoplasmic incompatibility in spider mites.
AB  == intracellular symbiotic bacteria belonging to the cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides lineage have recently been described and are widely distributed in arthropod species. the newly discovered bacteria, named cardinium sp, cause the expression of various reproductive alterations in their arthropod hosts, including cytoplasmic incompatibility (ci), induction of parthenogenesis and feminization of genetic males. we detected 16s ribosomal dna  sequences similar to those of cardinium from seven populations of five spider mite species, suggesting a broad distribution of infection of cardinium in spider mites. to clarify the effect of cardinium on the reproductive traits of the infected spider mites, infected mites were crossed with uninfected mites for each population. in one of the populations, eotetranychus suginamensis, ci was induced when infected males were crossed with uninfected females. the other six populations of four species showed no reproductive abnormalities in the f(1) generation, but the possibility of ci effects in the f(2) generation remains to be tested. one species of spider mite, tetranychus pueraricola, harbored both cardinium and wolbachia, but these symbionts seemed to have no effect on the reproduction of the host, even when the host was infected independently with each symbiont.

TI  == plasmid-related resistance to cefoxitin in species of the bacteroides fragilis group isolated from intestinal tracts of calves.
AB  == species of the bacteroides fragilis group are considered the most common anaerobe in human and animal infections and also harbor plasmids conferring resistance to  several antibiotics. in this study, resistance to cefoxitin, plasmid profile and  beta-lactamase production in species of the b. fragilis group isolated from intestinal tracts of calves were evaluated. one hundred sixty-one b. fragilis group bacteria isolated from calves with and without diarrhea were analyzed. cefoxitin susceptibility was performed using an agar dilution method, beta-lactamase production by using a nitrocefin method, and plasmid extraction by using a commercial kit. minimal inhibitory concentration values for cefoxitin ranged from 32 to > 512 microg/ml, and 47 bacteria (29.2%) were resistant to cefoxitin (breakpoint 16 microl). only seven isolates harbored plasmids varying from 6.0 to 5.0 kb, and a 5.5-kb plasmid in b. vulgatus bd26e and b. fragilis bc5j might be related to cefoxitin resistance. beta-lactamase was detected in 33  (70.2%) isolates. the cepa gene was observed in total dna and in the 5.5-kb plasmid. the plasmid presence in organisms isolated from cattle may be important  in ecologic terms, and it needs further study.

TI  == effect of chitosan on the growth of human colonic bacteria.
AB  == growth of 6 bacterial strains representing dominant members of the human colonic  microflora was measured in the presence of 0.025, 0.05 and 0.5 % chitosan (from shrimp shells, with a 97 % final degree of deacetylation). the effect of chitosan was variable and dependent on bacterial species. the most susceptible to chitosan were bacteria belonging to genera bacteroides and clostridium (91-97% growth inhibition). on the other hand, roseburia sp., eubacterium sp. and faecalibacterium sp. were more resistant (63-83 % inhibition of growth). chitosan can thus be considered as one of the means for influencing the bacterial population in the human colon.

TI  == effect of tea phenolics and their aromatic fecal bacterial metabolites on intestinal microbiota.
AB  == tea is rich in polyphenols and other phenolics that have been widely reported to  have beneficial health effects. however, dietary polyphenols are not completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are metabolized by the gut microflora so that they and their metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. in this study, we investigated the influence of the phenolic components of a tea extract and their aromatic metabolites upon bacterial growth. fecal homogenates containing bacteria significantly catalyzed tea phenolics, including epicatechin, catechin, 3-o-methyl gallic acid, gallic acid and caffeic acid to generate aromatic metabolites dependent on bacterial species. different strains of intestinal bacteria had varying degrees of growth sensitivity to tea phenolics and metabolites. growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile and bacteroides spp. was significantly repressed by tea phenolics and their derivatives, while commensal anaerobes like clostridium spp., bifidobacterium spp. and probiotics such as lactobacillus sp. were less severely affected. this indicates that tea phenolics exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population, probably by acting as metabolic prebiotics. our observations provide further evidence for the importance of colonic bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of phenolics in human health and disease. the bioactivity of different phenolics may play an important role in the maintenance of gastrointestinal health.

AB  == analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequences of species currently assigned to the genus flexibacter has shown extensive intrageneric phylogenetic heterogeneity. it has been shown in previous studies that the species [flexibacter] sancti, [flexibacter] filiformis and [flexibacter] japonensis were most closely related to chitinophaga pinensis. in addition, [cytophaga] arvensicola and species of the genus terrimonas also clustered into this phylogenetic group. although the similarities of 16s rrna gene sequences were low (88.5-96.4 %), there is no evidence for clear phenotypic differences between these organisms that justify assignment to different genera. a proposal is made to transfer these species to the genus chitinophaga as chitinophaga sancti comb. nov., chitinophaga filiformis comb. nov., chitinophaga japonenis comb. nov. and chitinophaga arvensicola comb.  nov. on the basis of phylogenetic and phenotypic data. furthermore, a novel species is described within this genus, chitinophaga skermanii sp. nov., with strain cc-sg1b(t) (=ccug 52510(t)=cip 109140(t)) as the type strain.

AB  == the community structure of the bacteria associated with nodularia spumigena (mertens) cyanobacterial aggregates in the baltic sea was studied with temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (tgge), using a 16s rrna gene fragment as a target. various developmental stages of the aggregates and free-floating cyanobacterial filaments were sampled to reveal possible changes in associated microbial community structure during development and senescence of the aggregates. the microbial community structures of all samples differed, and the communities of young and decaying aggregates were separated by cluster analysis of the tgge fingerprint data. sequencing of the tgge fragments indicated the presence of bacteria from the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-proteobacterial groups, as well as members of cytophaga-flexibacter-bacteroides lineages and gram-positive actinobacteria spp. the majority of the nodularia-associated sequences were not closely related to previously reported 16s rdna sequences from the baltic sea or  any other environment. the structure of the bacterial assemblage reflects the environmental changes associated with the succession and decay of the cyanobacterial aggregates. in addition, the sequence data suggest that the n. spumigena (mertens) blooms in the baltic sea may host thus far uncharacterized bacterial species.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of clinically relevant anaerobes in estonia from 1999 to 2001.
AB  == at present little or no data is available regarding the resistance profiles of anaerobic bacteria in relation to the general usage of antibiotics. the objective of this study was to assess whether any potential relationship exists between the dynamics of antibiotic resistance of anaerobic bacteria and the consumption of antibiotics during the last 3 years within the estonian population. in total, 416 anaerobic isolates were investigated from various clinical samples. the anaerobes were isolated on wilkins-chalgren agar, incubated in an anaerobic glove box and identified by standard methods. beta-lactamase negative strains were tested against metronidazole, clindamycin, benzylpenicillin and the positive strains were further tested against metronidazole, clindamycin, and ampicillin/sulbactam  by e-tests. the results of the susceptibility tests were interpreted according to the current criteria of nccls. data from the estonian state agency of medicines was used to assess the antibiotic consumption rate in the population (defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants annually). the following species of anaerobes were isolated: b. fragilis group, bacteroides sp., fusobacterium sp., porphyromonas sp., prevotella sp., peptostreptococcus sp., in addition to various unidentified gram-positive rods. metronidazole resistance was not found among gram-negative bacteria despite a relatively high consumption of this antimicrobial agent in estonia. only ampicillin/sulbactam demonstrated excellent  in vitro activity against all anaerobes. unexpectedly despite a relatively low rate of consumption of clindamycin a high rate of resistance to this agent occurred; a similar situation was noted for penicillin. in the present study we did not observe a relationship between the changes in antibiotic consumption (ddd/1000) rate and the resistance pattern of anaerobic bacteria to metronidazole, clindamycin, penicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam during a 3-year follow-up period. high resistance to penicillin among some species and also to clindamycin is similar to the global trend and argues for limited use of these antibiotics in empirical treatment. we would suggest that monitoring of local susceptibility pattern is necessary for the selection of initial empirical therapy.

AB  == enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis (etbf) strains produce a metalloprotease toxin (bft) related to diarrheal disease in animals, young children, and adults.  three different isoforms of the enterotoxin, designated bft-1, bft-2, and bft-3,  have been identified and sequenced. in the present study, the pathogenicity of the etbf strains carrying bft-1 or bft-2 was evaluated. each toxin gene subtype of etbf (bft-1 or bft-2) was intragastrically monoassociated to germ-free mice during 10 days and histopathological data from intestines and liver compared with those from mice monoassociated to a non-enterotoxigenic b. fragilis. histopathological alterations were observed in all groups of animals related to etbf. these alterations were characterized mainly by ulceration, edema, and inflammatory infiltration in intestine. however, these lesions were slightly more severe in mice monoassociated with bft-2 subtype. no alteration or lesion was observed in animals associated with the non-enterotoxigenic b. fragilis. in conclusion, strains harboring bft-1 or bft-2 gene subtypes were able to induce histopathological alterations in intestine of a gnotobiotic mice model and it could explain the effect produced for the enterotoxin.

TI  == antibiotic treatment partially protects against type 1 diabetes in the bio-breeding diabetes-prone rat. is the gut flora involved in the development of  type 1 diabetes?
AB  == aims/hypothesis: accumulating data suggest that the gut immune system plays a role in the development of type 1 diabetes. the intestinal flora is essential for the development of the (gut) immune system and the establishment of tolerance. it has been reported that oral administration of food and bacterial antigens early in life suppresses later development of diabetes in the bio-breeding diabetes-prone (bb-dp) rat. this study was designed to investigate the possible relationship between the development of diabetes and the composition of intestinal flora. materials and methods: the intestinal flora of bb-dp rats, a rat model for type 1 diabetes, was characterised long before the clinical onset of diabetes by fluorescent in situ hybridisation. in a separate experiment, bb-dp rats were treated with antibiotics and the effect on diabetes incidence and level of insulitis was analysed. results: we observed a difference in bacterial composition between rats that eventually did and those that did not develop diabetes. this difference was detectable long before clinical onset of the disease. rats that did not develop diabetes at a later age displayed a lower amount of bacteroides sp. modulation of the intestinal flora through antibiotic treatment decreased the incidence and delayed the onset of diabetes. a combination of antibiotic treatment and a protective hydrolysed casein diet completely prevented diabetes in the bb-dp rat. conclusions/interpretation: our data suggest that the intestinal flora is involved in the development of type 1 diabetes. factors influencing composition of the intestinal flora could be a target for therapeutic intervention.

TI  == ultrasound markers of fetal infection, part 2: bacterial, parasitic, and fungal infections.
AB  == up to 1% of all pregnancies have clinically overt intra-amniotic bacterial infections, and an even larger percentage of pregnant women may be affected by silent infections. although most pregnant women with overt intra-amniotic bacterial infection have experienced prolonged rupture of membranes (prom), symptomatic and most silent nonviral intra-amniotic infections may occur with intact membranes. the etiology of intra-amniotic infection after prom is almost always polymicrobial and consists of genital tract pathogens, such as group b streptococci, chlamydia trachomatis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, mycoplasmas, aerobic  gram-negative bacilli, such as the coliforms, and facultative and anaerobic endogenous organisms, such as peptococci, peptostreptococci, and bacteroides species. these organisms gain access to the uterine cavity by the ascending route. organisms such as treponema pallidum, listeria monocytogenes, toxoplasma gondii, trypanosomes, and plasmodia are capable of gaining access to the amniotic cavity by transplacental hematogenous spread, and cause devastating fetal infections. symptomatic intra-amniotic infection is usually a diagnosis of exclusion. diagnostic criteria based on both clinical and laboratory findings lack sensitivity and are nonspecific. it is difficult to obtain uncontaminated intra-amniotic samples, especially when there is prom. the problem is even greater with silent infections. in most cases, fetal infection is suspected after an unexplained and unexpected adverse outcome. maternal morbidity is increased with intra-amniotic infection; although maternal mortality is extremely rare in developed countries, this is not the case in societies where pregnant women have  limited or no access to medical care. although infected women who are treated early and aggressively with wide-spectrum antibiotics do well, more than 10% of these women develop bacteremia and up to half of them will require cesarean delivery because of poor uterine contractions and arrest of labor. the overwhelming majority of term neonates exposed to intrauterine infection after prom do well, but up to 30% of these neonates require treatment of neonatal pneumonia or bacteremia. outcomes for preterm neonates or for neonates who experienced silent fetal infections are more severe. morbidity and mortality rates in these cases are high, and survivors may have long-term devastating sequelae. the ability to identify ultrasound markers of fetal infection will help clinicians identify etiologic agents with greater accuracy and correlate these infections with specific antepartum and postpartum syndromes. the recognition of  markers of intrauterine infection will also reduce unexpected adverse outcomes that result from undiagnosed fetal infections.

TI  == occurrence and activity of human intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of dietary lignans.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota is necessary for the production of enterolignans  from the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (sdg). however, little is known about the bacteria that contribute to sdg conversion. therefore, we aimed at describing the occurrence and activity of sdg metabolising bacteria. the data showed differences in conversion efficiency between sdg deglycosylating species, but sdg was completely deglycosylated within 20 h by five of six strains. the strain clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db showed the highest initial rate  of sdg deglycosylation. furthermore, we found that bacteroides distasonis and b.  fragilis made up 0.5% and 3.3% of total faecal bacteria, respectively. however, clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db was detected within the dominant microbiota of only  two out of 20 faecal samples. bacteria involved in the demethylation step of sdg  conversion also demethylated a variety of compounds other than sdg. in particular, peptostreptococcus productus demethylated the lignans pinoresinol, lariciresinol and matairesinol. finally, eggerthella lenta catalysed the reduction of pinoresinol and lariciresinol to secoisolariciresinol.

AB  == the phylogenetic diversity of culturable psychrophilic bacteria associated with sea ice from high latitude sea (77 degrees 30'n - 81 degrees 12'n), canadian basin and greenland sea arctic, was investigated. a total of 37 psychrophilic strains were isolated using three different methods of ( i ) spread plate method: 100 microl of each dilution ice-melt sample was spreaded onto the surface of marine 2216 agar (difco laboratories, detroit, mi) and incubated for 2 to 6 weeks at 4 degrees c; ( ii ) bath culture and spread plate method: 1 ml of sample was added to 9ml of nsw (unamended natural seawater, 0.2 microm prefiltered and autoclaved) and incubated for 1 months at - 1 degrees c, then spread plate method was used to isolate bacterial strains from the pre-cultured samples; ( iii ) cold shock, bath culture and spread plate method: samples were exposed to - 20 degrees c for 24h, then bacterial strains isolated by bath culture and spread plate method under aerobic conditions. nearly half of psychrophilic strains are isolated by using method iii . 16s rdna nearly full-length sequence analysis reveal that psychrophilic strains fall in two phylogenetic divisions, gamma-proteobacteria (in the genera colwellia, marinobacter, shewanella, thalassomonas, glaciecola, marinomonas and pseudoalteromonas) and cytophaga-flexibacter-bacteroides (in the genera flavobacterium and psychroflexus). nine of bacterial isolates (bsi20007, bsi20497, bsi20517, bsi20537, bsi20170, bsi20001, bsi20002, bsi20675 and bsi20101) quite likely represent novel species (16s rdna sequence similarity below 97%). one of strains  (bsi20002) from canadian basin shows 100% sequence similarity to the antarctic weddell sea ice isolate marinobacter sp. ant8277, suggesting bacteria may have a  bipolar distribution at the species level. af283859 sequences were submitted to the blast search program of the national center for biotechnology information website (ncbi, http://www. ncbi. nlm.nih. gov). twenty sequences showing 100% similarity each other are retrieved from the database, eleven from antarctic seawater bacteria, three from antarctic sea-ice bacteria, one from spitzbergen sea-ice bacteria, two from chukchi sea sea-ice bacteria, two from canadian basin  sea-ice bacteria (in this study) and one from uncultured bacterium clone pda-otu11 associated with the coral pocillopora damicornis from the great barrier reef. these may indicate that the physiological and geographic barriers appear to be permeable and some bacterial species can survive in different environment. the majority of the bacterial strains are able to secrete diversity cold-adaptive hydrolytic enzymes into the medium at 4 degrees c. the isolates that are able to  degrade tween-80, glutin, and starch account for, respectively, 62.6%, 51.4% and  40.5%.

TI  == development of a scorpion probe-based real-time pcr for the sensitive quantification of bacteroides sp. ribosomal dna from human and cattle origin and  evaluation in spring water matrices.
AB  == spring water from alpine catchments are important water resources but they can be vulnerable against faecal contamination. potential faecal contamination sources are wildlife populations, pasturing activities, or alpine tourism. unfortunately, no faecal source tracking method is available to date which is sensitive enough for appropriate spring water monitoring and source allocation. our purpose was to develop a duplex scorpion real-time pcr approach for the specific and sensitive quantification of bacteroides sp. 16s rdna fragments from human and cattle origin. by the developed approach, detection of plasmids, carrying the respective biomarker sequence, was possible over a range of more than seven orders of magnitudes down to six copy numbers per pcr assay. furthermore, the duplex scorpion real-time pcr allowed the specific quantification down to 50 targets in  plasmid spiked spring water matrices. results indicate that microbial source tracking appears feasible in spring water habitats by probe-based real-time pcr technologies. however, preliminary testing of the established approach on faecal  samples collected from a representative alpine habitat did not allow unambiguous  source allocation in all cases. in the future, the available sequence database has thus to be widened to allow reliable source tracking in alpine spring watersheds and even expand this approach to other potential faecal sources.

AB  == two strains, 199t and 176, of gram-negative, anaerobic, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming bacteria were isolated during studies of microbiota in human faeces using polyamine-deficient medium. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna  gene sequences revealed that the isolated strains belonged to the genus bacteroides. the g+c content (42.4-43.0 mol%) and major fatty acid composition (anteiso-c15:0, 31.8-36.2 %) supported the affiliation of the two strains to the  genus bacteroides. 16s rrna gene sequence similarities with their closest neighbours, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and bacteroides ovatus, ranged from 94.6 to 96.5 %. dna-dna hybridization and phenotypic analysis showed that the two strains belonged to the same species (dna-dna relatedness of 89 %) and were distinct from their close relatives, b. thetaiotaomicron and b. ovatus (<23 % dna-dna relatedness). on the basis of these data, a novel species of the genus bacteroides, bacteroides finegoldii sp. nov., is proposed, comprising the designated type strain 199t (=jcm 13345t=dsm 17565t) and strain 176 (=jcm 13346).

TI  == effects of long-term ingestion of difructose anhydride iii (dfa iii) on intestinal bacteria and bile acid metabolism in humans.
AB  == changes in the intestinal microbiota of 10 human subjects with long-term ingestion of 3 g/d difructose anhydride iii (dfa iii; 4 persons, 2 months; 3 persons, 6 months; and 3 persons, 12 months) were examined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). according to the answers to questionnaires, the subjects were divided into two groups (constipated and normal). the dgge profile  was different for every individual and each subject had unique profiles of intestinal microbiota. in the dgge profiles of constipated subjects, the intensities of bands related to bacteroides spp. increased. moreover, the dfa iii-assimilating bacteria, ruminococcus sp. were isolated from subjects who ingested dfa iii for 12 months. these strains showed 95% similarity of their 16s  rdna sequences with that of ruminococcus obeum atcc 29174(t) (x85101) and produced large amounts of acetic acid. dfa iii ingestion for 2 months tended to increase total organic acids in feces, and tended to decrease fecal ph and the secondary bile acid (sba) ratio in total bile acids. the sba ratio in total bile  acids corresponded to fecal ph. the production of sba was decreased by low ph in  vitro. these results indicated that dfa iii ingestion in humans tended to lower intestinal ph, inhibited bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylation activities and also tended to decrease the sba ratios in total bile acids. moreover, as another cause for the decrease in the sba ratio in total bile acids, it was suggested that the  number of bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating bacteria were decreased by dfa iii ingestion.

TI  == characterization of psychrotolerant heterotrophic bacteria from finnish lapland.
AB  == a total of 331 aerobic heterotrophic bacterial strains were isolated from various ecosystems of finnish lapland (68-69 degrees n) including forest soil, arctic alpine-tundra soil, stream water, lake and mire sediments, lichen and snow algae. whole cell fatty acid and 16s rrna gene sequence analysis and microscopy indicated that the isolates were dominated by gram-negative bacteria, while only  20 gram-positive strains were isolated. based on 16s rrna gene sequences the isolates were members of alpha-, beta-, gamma-proteobacteria, gram-positives with low g+c content, actinobacteria and the cytophaga/flexibacter/bacteroides group.  more than one-third of the isolates could be tentatively identified as pseudomonas spp. which were particularly abundant in the alpine-tundra soils where they represented 60% of all isolates. other frequently isolated gram-negative taxa were burkholderia sp., collimonas sp., pedobacter sp., janthinobacter sp., duganella sp., dyella sp. and sphingomonas sp. growth temperature ranges and hydrolytic enzyme activities of selected ca.100 strains were screened. the strains were psychrotolerant growing generally at temperatures ranging from 0 to 30 degrees c, as 82% of the isolates grew at 0 degrees c while  only 7% grew at 35 degrees c. protease and lipase activities at 5 degrees c were  detected in more than half of the strains while approximately 20% of the strains  possessed amylase and/or cellulase activities.

AB  == the effects of subinhibitory concentrations of clindamycin on the morphological,  biochemical and genetic characteristics of species of the bacteroides fragilis group isolated from children with diarrhea were determined. the minimal inhibitory and subinhibitory concentrations for clindamycin were determined. minimal inhibitory concentration values ranging from 0.25 to 512 microg ml(-1) were observed. cultures grown with clindamycin were used to determine the macroscopic morphological characteristics, cellular viability, ultrastructural characteristics and dna integrity. clindamycin did not alter colonial morphology, but after 6 h elongated cells were observed. also, extracellular vesicles and electron-lucent areas inside the cytoplasm were observed. bacteria treated with clindamycin also showed fragmentation of dna as determined by electrophoresis. the alterations produced by clindamycin might be indicative of a possible modification of the structures involved in bacterial pathogenesis.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacteria in asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to use terminal restriction fragment length  polymorphism analysis and the 16s rrna gene clone library to investigate the diversity of the microbiota associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections and to compare the bacterial community structure in these two clinical conditions. samples were taken from asymptomatic endodontic infections associated with chronic periradicular lesions and from symptomatic infections clinically diagnosed as acute abscesses. 16s rrna genes from dna isolated from clinical samples were used to construct clone libraries or were subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. sequence analysis of 186 clones revealed 42 taxa; 23 (55%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which seven were unique to endodontic infections. clone sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that the most commonly detected taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum (including terminal restriction fragment types 1 and 2), peptostreptococcus micros/peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone aj062/bs044/fg014, prevotella species, dialister species, mogibacterium species, lachnospiraceae oral clone 55a-34, filifactor alocis, megasphaera sp. oral clone cs025/bs073, and veillonella sp. oral clone bp1-85/veillonella dispar/v. parvula. bacteroides-like sp. oral clone x083/bacteroidales oral clone mce7_20 and dialister sp. oral clone bs016/mce7_134 were detected only in asymptomatic teeth. on the other hand, f. nucleatum terminal restriction fragment type 2, prevotella intermedia, dialister pneumosintes, and some phylotypes were exclusively detected in symptomatic samples. bacterial profiles of symptomatic endodontic infections generated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were clearly different from those of asymptomatic infections. overall, the average number of terminal restriction fragments in symptomatic samples was significantly larger than in asymptomatic samples. molecular analysis of the microbiota associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic endodontic infections indicates that the endodontic bacterial diversity is greater than previously described by culture methods and that the structure of the microbiota differ significantly between asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.

TI  == phylogeny of human intestinal bacteria that activate the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota is essential for the conversion of the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (sdg) via secoisolariciresinol (seco) to  the enterolignans enterodiol (ed) and enterolactone (el). however, knowledge of the species that catalyse the underlying reactions is scant. therefore, we focused our attention on the identification of intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of sdg. strains of bacteroides distasonis, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides ovatus and clostridium cocleatum, as well as the newly isolated strain clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db, deglycosylated sdg. demethylation of seco was catalysed by strains of butyribacterium methylotrophicum, eubacterium callanderi, eubacterium limosum and peptostreptococcus productus. dehydroxylation of seco was catalysed by strains of clostridium scindens and eggerthella lenta. finally, the newly isolated strain ed-mt61/pyg-s6 catalysed the dehydrogenation of ed to el. the results indicate that the activation of sdg involves phylogenetically diverse bacteria, most of which are members of the dominant human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == multitiered approach using quantitative pcr to track sources of fecal pollution affecting santa monica bay, california.
AB  == the ubiquity of fecal indicator bacteria such as escherichia coli and enterococcus spp. in urban environments makes tracking of fecal contamination extremely challenging. a multitiered approach was used to assess sources of fecal pollution in ballona creek, an urban watershed that drains to the santa monica bay (smb) near los angeles, calif. a mass-based design at six main-stem sites and four major tributaries over a 6-h period was used (i) to assess the flux of enterococcus spp. and e. coli by using culture-based methods (tier 1); (ii) to assess levels of enterococcus spp. by using quantitative pcr and to detect and/or quantify additional markers of human fecal contamination, including a human-specific bacteroides sp. marker and enterovirus, using quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr (tier 2); and (iii) to assess the specific types of enterovirus genomes found via sequence analysis (tier 3). sources of fecal indicator bacteria were ubiquitous, and concentrations were high, throughout ballona creek, with no  single tributary dominating fecal inputs. the flux of enterococcus spp. and e. coli averaged 10(9) to 10(10) cells h(-1) and was as high at the head of the watershed as at the mouth prior to discharge into the smb. in addition, a signal  for the human-specific bacteroides marker was consistently detected: 86% of the samples taken over the extent during the study period tested positive. enteroviruses were quantifiable in 14 of 36 samples (39%), with the highest concentrations at the site furthest upstream (cochran). these results indicated the power of using multiple approaches to assess and quantify fecal contamination in freshwater conduits to high-use, high-priority recreational swimming areas.

AB  == a strictly anaerobic, propionate-producing bacterial strain (wb4t) isolated from  rice plant residue in anoxic rice-field soil in japan was characterized phenotypically and phylogenetically. cells were gram-negative, non-motile, non-spore-forming, short rods. the strain utilized various sugars and produced propionate and acetate as major fermentation products with a small amount of succinate. the optimum growth temperature was 30 degrees c. oxidase, catalase and nitrate-reducing activities were negative. the major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-c(15 : 0), c(15 : 0) and anteiso-c(17 : 0) 3-oh. menaquinone mk-8(h4) was the major respiratory quinone. the genomic dna g+c content was 39.3 mol%. phylogenetic analysis based on the 16s rrna gene sequence placed the strain in the phylum 'bacteroidetes'. the closest relative to strain wb4t was an environmental clone from water contaminated with equine manure (sequence similarity of 99.7 %) and the strain formed a distinct cluster with other environmental clones mainly from freshwater sediments. the closest recognized species were members of the genus dysgonomonas, with 16s rrna gene sequence similarities of 90.9-89.8 %. bacteroides merdae was the next closest recognized species (similarity of 88.7 % to the type strain). given that the ecological, physiological and chemotaxonomic characteristics of strain wb4t were different from those of any related species, a new genus and species paludibacter propionicigenes gen. nov., sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate it. the type strain is wb4t (= jcm 13257t = dsm 17365t).

TI  == bacterial diversity in water samples from uranium wastes as demonstrated by 16s rdna and ribosomal intergenic spacer amplification retrievals.
AB  == bacterial diversity was assessed in water samples collected from several uranium  mining wastes in ger many and in the united states by using 16s rdna and ribosomal intergenic spacer amplification retrievals. the results obtained using  the 16s rdna retrieval showed that the samples collected from the uranium mill tailings of schlema/alberoda, germany, were predominated by nitrospina-like bacteria, whereas those from the mill tailings of shiprock, new mexico, usa, were predominated by gamma-pseudomonas and frauteria spp. additional smaller populations of the cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides group and alpha- and delta-proteobacteria were identified in the shiprock samples as well. proteobacteria and cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides were also found in the third uranium mill tailings studied, gittersee/coschutz, germany, but the groups  of the predominant clones were rather small. most of the clones of the gittersee/coschutz samples represented individual sequences, which indicates a high level of bacterial diversity. the samples from the fourth uranium waste studied, steinsee deponie b1, germany, were predominantly occupied by acinetobacter spp. the ribosomal intergenic spacer amplification retrieval provided results complementary to those obtained by the 16s rdna analyses. for instance, in the shiprock samples, an additional predominant bacterial group was  identified and affiliated with nitrosomonas sp., whereas in the gittersee/coschutz samples, anammox populations were identified that were not retrieved by the applied 16s rdna approach.

AB  == a microbial consortium (am) obtained by sequential enrichment in liquid culture with a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) mixture of three- and four-ringed pahs as a sole source of carbon and energy was examined using a triple-approach method based on various cultivation strategies, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), and the screening of 16s and 18s rrna gene clone libraries. eleven different sequences by culture-dependent techniques and seven by both dgge and clone libraries were obtained. the comparison of three variable  regions (v3-v5) of the 16s rrna gene between the sequences obtained yielded 19 different microbial components. proteobacteria were the dominant group, representing 83% of the total, while the cytophaga-flexibacter-bacteroides group  (cfb) was 11% and the ascomycota fungi 6%. beta-proteobacteria were predominant in the dgge and clone library methods, whereas they were a minority in culturable strains. the highest diversity and number of noncoincident sequences were achieved by the cultivation method that showed members of the alpha-, beta-, and  gamma-proteobacteria; cfb bacterial group; and ascomycota fungi. only six of the  11 strains isolated showed pah-degrading capability. the bacterial strain (ams7)  and the fungal strain (amf1), which were similar to sphingomonas sp. and fusarium sp., respectively, achieved the greatest pah depletion. the results indicate that polyphasic assessment is necessary for a proper understanding of the composition  of a microbial consortium.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of tce-dechlorinating consortia enriched on a variety of electron donors.
AB  == two rapidly fermented electron donors, lactate and methanol, and two slowly fermented electron donors, propionate and butyrate, were selected for enrichment  studies to evaluate the characteristics of anaerobic microbial consortia that reductively dechlorinate tce to ethene. each electron donor enrichment subculture demonstrated the ability to dechlorinate tce to ethene through several serial transfers. microbial community analyses based upon 16s rdna, including terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) and clone library/sequencing, were performed to assess major changes in microbial community structure associated with electron donors capable of stimulating reductive dechlorination.  results demonstrated that five phylogenic subgroups or genera of bacteria were present in all consortia, including dehalococcoides sp., low g+c gram-positives (mostly clostridium and eubacterium sp.), bacteroides sp., citrobacter sp., and delta proteobacteria (mostly desulfovibrio sp.). phylogenetic association indicates that only minor shifts in the microbial community structure occurred between the four alternate electron donor enrichments and the parent consortium.  inconsistent detection of dehalococcoides spp. in clone libraries and t-rflp of enrichment subcultures was resolved using quantitative polymerase chain reaction  (q-pcr). q-pcr with primers specific to dehalococcoides 16s rdna resulted in positive detection of this species in all enrichments. our results suggest that tce-dechlorinating consortia can be stably maintained on a variety of electron donors and that quantities of dehalococcoides cells detected with dehalococcoides specific 16s rdna primer/probe sets do not necessarily correlate well with solvent degradation rates.

AB  == two proteolytic, strictly anaerobic bacterial strains (tb107(t) and tb6-6) were isolated from the granule sludge of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor treating brewery wastewater. the strains were gram-negative, non-spore-forming and motile. cells were rod-shaped (0.6-0.9x1.9-2.2 microm). growth of the strains was observed at 20-45 degrees c and ph 6.0-9.7. the strains were proteolytic. yeast extract, peptone, pyruvate, glycine and l-arginine could be used as carbon  and energy sources. weak growth was also observed with tryptone, l-serine, l-threonine and l-alanine as carbon and energy sources. both strains did not use  any of the tested carbohydrates, alcohols and fatty acids except pyruvate. acetic acid and nh3 were produced from yeast extract, peptone and l-arginine, and propionic acid was also produced from yeast extract. pyruvate was converted to acetic acid and co2. gelatin was not hydrolysed. indole and h2s were not produced. the two strains did not grow in medium containing 20 % bile. addition of strain tb107t to a syntrophic propionate-degrading co-culture accelerated the  propionate-degradation rate. the predominant cellular fatty acid was the branched-chain fatty acid anteiso-c(15 : 0) (46.21 %). the genomic dna g+c contents of strains tb107t and tb6-6 were 46.6 and 48.9 mol%, respectively. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequences revealed that the two strains represent a new phyletic sublineage within the cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides (cfb) group, with <91 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity to the closest species with validly published names. on the basis of polyphasic evidence from this study, a new genus and species, proteiniphilum acetatigenes gen. nov., sp. nov., is proposed, with strain tb107t  (=jcm 12891t=as 1.5024t) as the type strain.

AB  == c-glucosides, in which sugars are attached to the aglycone by carbon-carbon bonds, are generally resistant to acid and enzyme hydrolysis. the c-glucosyl bond of mangiferin, a xanthone c-glucoside, was cleaved by anaerobic incubation with a human intestinal bacterium, bacteroides sp. mang, to give norathyriol. a cell-free extract obtained by sonication of b. sp. mang demonstrated cleaving activity for mangiferin to norathyriol by adding nadh, diaphorase, and dithiothreitol. both high molecular weight (>10 k) and low molecular weight (<10  k) fractions obtained from the cell-free extract were required for the activity.  mncl2 was necessary for the activity, but other metal ions were not. by purification of the high molecular weight fraction using deae-cellulose and phenyl sepharose column chromatography, two fractions, designated as proteins a and b, were separated and required for the activity. neither protein a nor protein b alone showed any activity. this is the first report describing a c-glucosyl-cleaving enzyme from human intestinal bacterium that seems to involve  a novel enzyme mechanism.

AB  == the diversity of the culturable microbial communities was examined in two sponge  species-pseudoceratina clavata and rhabdastrella globostellata. isolates were characterized by 16s rrna gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. the bacterial community structures represented in both sponges were found to be similar at the phylum level by the same four phyla in this study and also at a finer scale at the species level in both firmicutes and alphaproteobacteria. the  majority of the alphaproteobacteria isolates were most closely related to isolates from other sponge species including alpha proteobacterium nw001 sp. and  alpha proteobacterium mbic3368. members of the low %g + c gram-positive (phylum firmicutes), high %g + c gram-positive (phylum actinobacteria), and cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides (phylum bacteroidetes) phyla of domain bacteria were also represented in both sponges. in terms of culturable organisms, taxonomic diversity of the microbial community in the two sponge species displays similar structure at phylum level. within phyla, isolates often belonged to the same genus-level monophyletic group. community structure and taxonomic composition in the two sponge species p. clavata and rha. globostellata share significant features with those of other sponge species including those from widely separated geographical and climatic regions of the sea.

TI  == bacteroides plebeius sp. nov. and bacteroides coprocola sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  == nine strains of gram-negative, anaerobic rod were isolated from human faeces. based on phylogenetic analysis and specific phenotypic characteristics, these strains were included within the bacteroides cluster and were divided into two clusters. strains from the two clusters showed 16s rrna gene sequence similarities of 90.4 and 92.7% to the nearest recognized species, bacteroides vulgatus. the strains also formed two clusters exhibiting a 16s rrna gene sequence divergence of approximately 6%. dna-dna hybridization studies confirmed  that the two novel strain clusters were distinct from each other. based on the phenotypic and phylogenetic findings, two novel species, bacteroides plebeius sp. nov. and bacteroides coprocola sp. nov., are proposed, each representing one of the two strain clusters. the dna g+c content of the type strains were 43.9 mol% for b. plebeius (m12(t)=jcm 12973(t)=dsm 17135(t)) and 42.4 mol% for b. coprocola (m16(t)=jcm 12979(t)=dsm 17136(t)).

AB  == the in-vitro activities of penicillin, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, imipenem, ertapenem, metronidazole and clindamycin were evaluated against 138 gram-negative anaerobic isolates (82 bacteroides fragilis group, 17 non-fragilis  bacteroides spp., 31 prevotella spp., four fusobacterium spp., two veillonella spp., one porphyromonas sp. and one tissierella praeacuta) collected from six general hospitals in athens, greece. overall rates of non-susceptibility (both resistant and intermediately-resistant) to penicillin and ticarcillin-clavulanic  acid were 81.8% and 2.3%, respectively. the rates of non-susceptibility to cefoxitin and clindamycin were 30.3% and 31.1%, respectively, and that for metronidazole was 4.3% (four prevotella spp. isolates, one porphyromonas sp. isolate and one b. fragilis isolate). only the single b. fragilis isolate was nim-positive by pcr. only one b. fragilis isolate was resistant to both carbapenems tested, while six more bacteroides spp. isolates were imipenem-susceptible and ertapenem-non-susceptible. the mic range, mic(50) and mic(90) values were comparable for imipenem and ertapenem, although ertapenem mic(90)s were one or two two-fold dilutions higher.

TI  == isolation of a human intestinal bacterium that transforms mangiferin to norathyriol and inducibility of the enzyme that cleaves a c-glucosyl bond.
AB  == the c-glucosyl bond of c-glucosides generally tolerates acid and enzymatic hydrolysis. many c-glucosides are cleaved by human intestinal bacteria. we isolated the specific bacterium involved in the metabolism of mangiferin (2-beta-d-glucopyranosyl-1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxyxanthone), c-glucosyl xanthone, from a mixture of human fecal bacteria. the anaerobic bacteroides species named mang,  transformed mangiferin to the aglycone, norathyriol, suggesting cleavage of a c-glucosyl bond. however, b. sp. mang cleaved c-glucosyl in a dose- and time-dependent manner only when cultivated in the presence of mangiferin. cleavage was abolished by inhibitors of rna and protein syntheses, such as rifampicin and chloramphenicol, respectively, indicating that the enzyme that cleaves c-glucosyl is induced by mangiferin. in contrast, mangiferin did not affect bacterial alpha- and beta-glucosidase activities under any conditions. the c-glucosyl-cleavage in cell-free extracts was not altered by potent glucosidase inhibitors such as 1-deoxynojirimycin and gluconolactone. therefore, the c-glucosyl-cleaving enzyme substantially differs from known glucosidases that cleave o-glucosides. this is the first description of a specific intestinal bacterium that is involved in the metabolism of mangiferin and which produces a novel and inducible c-glucosyl-cleaving enzyme.

TI  == [surgical treatment of chronical pulmonary abscesses--contemporary treatment].
AB  == between jan 1991 and dec 2000 a total of 67 patients were operated on for chronic primary pulmonary abscesses. they were 57 men and 10 women with mean age of 46.2  (range, 12 to 72) years. the indications for surgery was mainly "delayed closure" following medical therapy and percutaneous tube drainage (3), as well as a massive hemoptysis in 4 cases. ct scanning and brochoscopy were performed in all  patients. the majority of them had multiple isolates (51/67) of both aerobic and  anaerobic (predominantly bacteroides sp., fusobacterium sp., and peptococci) organisms. the following operations were carried out: lobectomy (52) including 8  decortications, bilobectomy (5), pneumonectomy (4) including two pleuro pneumonectomy, polysegmentectomy (4) and segmental resection (2). the 30-day hospital mortality rate was 1.49% (1 patient died following rethoracotomy for bronchial stump fistula with empyema and polyorganic insufficiency). major postoperative complications were 6 (8.9%) and included 3 pleural empyema (additional drainage), two rethoracotomy for intrapleural bleeding and one residual pleural cavity, treated by thoracoplasty. minor postoperative complications (atelectasis, wound infection and prolonged air-leakage) were observed in 9 patients (13.4%). the long-term results (following-up ranged from 6 to 112 weeks) are considered very good. in conclusion, surgery is indicated for patients with significant hemoptysis, suspected malignancy and those with "late healing" abscesses with acceptable postoperative results, although the rate of major postoperative complications remains relatively high.

TI  == trypanosoma cruzi: influence of predominant bacteria from indigenous digestive microbiota on experimental infection in mice.
AB  == to verify the influence of some predominant components from indigenous microbiota on systemic immunological responses during experimental chagas disease, germ-free nih swiss mice were mono-associated with escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides vulgatus or peptostreptococcus sp. and then infected with the y strain of trypanosoma cruzi. all the mono-associations predominantly induced a th1 type of specific immune response to the infection by t. cruzi. a direct correlation was observed between a higher survival rate and increased ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha production (p<0.05) in e. faecalis-, b. vulgatus-, and peptostreptococcus-associated mice. moreover, higher levels of anti-t. cruzi igg1 and anti-t. cruzi igg2a were also found in mono-associated animals after infection. on the other hand, with the exception of e. faecalis-associated mice,  mono-association induced a lower il-10 production after infection (p<0.05) when compared with germ-free animals. interestingly, spleen cell cultures from non-infected germ-free and mono-associated mice spontaneously produced higher levels (p<0.05) of il-10 than cultures from infected mono-associated mice, except again for e. faecalis-associated animals. in conclusion, the presence of the components of the indigenous microbiota skews the immune response towards production of inflammatory cytokines during experimental infection with t. cruzi  in gnotobiotic mice. however, the degree of increase in production of cytokines depends on each bacterial component.

TI  == molecular assessment of inoculated and indigenous bacteria in biofilms from a pilot-scale perchlorate-reducing bioreactor.
AB  == bioremediation of perchlorate-contaminated groundwater can occur via bacterial reduction of perchlorate to chloride. although perchlorate reduction has been demonstrated in bacterial pure cultures, little is known about the efficacy of using perchlorate-reducing bacteria as inoculants for bioremediation in the field. a pilot-scale, fixed-bed bioreactor containing plastic support medium was  used to treat perchlorate-contaminated groundwater at a site in southern california. the bioreactor was inoculated with a field-grown suspension of the perchlorate-respiring bacterium dechlorosoma sp. strain kj and fed groundwater containing indigenous bacteria and a carbon source amendment. because the reactor was flushed weekly to remove accumulated biomass, only bacteria capable of growing in biofilms in the reactor were expected to survive. after 26 days of operation, perchlorate was not detected in bioreactor effluent. perchlorate remained undetected by ion chromatography (detection limit 4 mug l(-1)) during 6  months of operation, after which the reactor was drained. plastic medium was subsampled from top, middle, and bottom locations of the reactor for shipment on  blue ice and storage at -80 degrees c prior to analysis. microbial community dna  was extracted from successive washes of thawed biofilm material for pcr-based community profiling by 16s-23s ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (risa). no dna sequences characteristic of strain kj were recovered from any risa bands. the most intense bands yielded dna sequences with high similarities to dechloromonas  spp., a closely related but different genus of perchlorate-respiring bacteria. additional sequences from risa profiles indicated presence of representatives of  the low g+c gram-positive bacteria and the cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides group. confocal scanning laser microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization  (fish) were also used to examine biofilms using genus-specific 16s ribosomal rna  probes. fish was more sensitive than risa profiling in detecting possible survivors from the initial inoculum. fish revealed that bacteria hybridizing to dechlorosoma probes constituted <1% of all cells in the biofilms examined, except in the deepest portions where they represented 3-5%. numbers of bacteria hybridizing to dechloromonas probes decreased as biofilm depth increased, and they were most abundant at the biofilm surface (23% of all cells). these spatial  distribution differences suggested persistence of low numbers of the inoculated strain dechlorosoma sp. kj in parts of the biofilm nearest to the plastic medium, concomitant with active colonization or growth by indigenous dechloromonas spp. in the biofilm exterior. this study demonstrated the feasibility of post hoc analysis of frozen biofilms following completion of field remediation studies.

TI  == monitoring of microbial community structure and succession in the biohydrogen production reactor by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge).
AB  == to study the structure of microbial communities in the biological hydrogen production reactor and determine the ecological function of hydrogen producing bacteria, anaerobic sludge was obtained from the continuous stirred tank reactor  (cstr) in different periods of time, and the diversity and dynamics of microbial  communities were investigated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge).  the results of dgge demonstrated that an obvious shift of microbial population happened from the beginning of star-up to the 28th day, and the ethanol type fermentation was established. after 28 days the structure of microbial community  became stable, and the climax community was formed. comparative analysis of 16s rdna sequences from reamplifying and sequencing the prominent bands indicated that the dominant population belonged to low g+c gram-positive bacteria (clostridium sp. and ethanologenbacterium sp.), beta-proteobacteria (acidovorax sp.), gamma-proteobacteria (kluyvera sp.), bacteroides (uncultured bacterium sja-168), and spirochaetes (uncultured eubacterium e1-k13), respectively. the hydrogen production rate increased obviously with the increase of ethanologenbacterium sp., clostridium sp. and uncultured spirochaetes after 21 days, meanwhile the succession of ethanol type fermentation was formed. throughout the succession the microbial diversity increased however it decreased  after 21 days. some types of clostridium sp. acidovorax sp., kluyvera sp., and bacteroides were dominant populations during all periods of time. these special populations were essential for the construction of climax community. hydrogen production efficiency was dependent on both hydrogen producing bacteria and other populations. it implied that the co-metabolism of microbial community played a great role of biohydrogen production in the reactors.

TI  == analysis of the large bowel microbiota of colitic mice using pcr/dgge.
AB  == aim: to test combined polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16s rrna gene sequences and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr/dgge) as an analytical method to investigate the composition of the large bowel microbiota of mice during the development of colitis. methods and results: the colonic microbiota of formerly germfree interleukin 10 (il-10)-deficient mice that had been exposed to  the faecal microbiota of specific pathogen-free animals was screened using pcr/dgge. the composition of the large bowel microbiota of il-10-deficient mice changed as colitis progressed. dna fragments originating from four bacterial populations ('bacteroides sp.', bifidobacterium animalis, clostridium cocleatum,  enterococci) were more apparent in pcr/dgge profiles of colitic mice relative to  non-colitic animals, whereas two populations were less apparent (eubacterium ventriosum, acidophilus group lactobacilli). specific dna:rna dot blot analysis showed that bifidobacterial ribosomal rna (rrna) abundance increased as colitis developed. conclusions: pcr/dgge was shown to be an effective method to demonstrate changes in the composition of the large bowel microbiota of mice in relation to progression of inflammatory disease. the intensity of staining of dna fragments in dgge profiles reflected increased abundance of bifidobacterial rrna  in the microbiota of colitic animals. as bifidobacterial fragments in pcr/dgge profiles generated from microbiota dna showed increased intensity of fragment staining, an increase in bifidobacterial numbers in colitic mice was indicated. significance and impact of the study: pcr/dgge analysis demonstrated an altered composition of the large bowel microbiota of colitic mice. this work will allow specific groups of bacteria to be targeted in future research concerning the pathogenesis of colitis.

TI  == new antibiotic agents: problems and prospects.
AB  == background: surgical site infections are the third most common healthcare-associated infection, often leading to prolonged hospital stay and excessive expenditures. management of these infections has become more challenging due to rising rates of multi-drug-resistant organisms and few new antibiotic options. methods: this paper reviews the literature, summarizes the epidemiology of surgical site infections and the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and provides an insight into new treatment options for this condition.  results: patients with surgical site infections are at greater risk of acquiring  healthcare-associated antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) sp., and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-(esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. multi-drug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteroides fragilis are also a growing problem. several useful drugs have recently become available for the management of serious, gram-positive infections (e.g., daptomycin, linezolid, telithromycin). tigecycline, the first-in-class glycylcycline, has broad-spectrum in vitro activity, including against mrsa, vre, resistant enteric gram-negative bacilli (e.g., acinetobacter sp.), "atypical" pathogens, and anaerobes. phase 3 clinical trials suggest that tigecycline will be an excellent option for antibiotic monotherapy for complicated skin and soft tissue infections (csssi) and intra-abdominal infections. oritavancin and dalbavacin, two novel glycopeptide antibiotics that are also in late-stage clinical development, appear that they, too, will be useful for csssi due to resistant, gram-positive bacteria. conclusions: multi-drug-resistant pathogens are threatening the success of available antibiotic therapy. many new options are useful for infections due to multi-drug-resistant, gram-positive bacteria. tigecycline is a promising new agent that provides coverage against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative, aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic strains, including resistant isolates, and may make broad-spectrum, single-agent therapy possible.

AB  == sodium lactate additions to a trichloroethene (tce) residual source area in deep, fractured basalt at a u.s. department of energy site have resulted in the enrichment of the indigenous microbial community, the complete dechlorination of  nearly all aqueous-phase tce to ethene, and the continued depletion of the residual source since 1999. the bacterial and archaeal consortia in groundwater obtained from the residual source were assessed by using pcr-amplified 16s rrna genes. a clone library of bacterial amplicons was predominated by those from members of the class clostridia (57 of 93 clones), of which a phylotype most similar to that of the homoacetogen acetobacterium sp. strain haap-1 was most abundant (32 of 93 clones). the remaining bacteria consisted of phylotypes affiliated with sphingobacteria, bacteroides, spirochaetes, mollicutes, and proteobacteria and candidate divisions op11 and op3. the two proteobacterial phylotypes were most similar to those of the known dechlorinators trichlorobacter thiogenes and sulfurospirillum multivorans. although not represented by the bacterial clones generated with broad-specificity bacterial primers, a dehalococcoides-like phylotype was identified with genus-specific primers. only four distinct phylotypes were detected in the groundwater archaeal library, including predominantly a clone affiliated with the strictly acetoclastic methanogen methanosaeta concilii (24 of 43 clones). a mixed culture that completely dechlorinates tce to ethene was enriched from this groundwater, and both communities were characterized by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp). according to t-rflp, the laboratory enrichment community was less diverse overall than the groundwater community, with 22 unique phylotypes as opposed to 43 and a higher percentage of clostridia, including the  acetobacterium population. bioreactor archaeal structure was very similar to that of the groundwater community, suggesting that methane is generated primarily via  the acetoclastic pathway, using acetate generated by lactate fermentation and acetogenesis in both systems.

TI  == pyogenic liver abscesses in a child spreading to pulmonary and subcutaneous tissues: case report.
AB  == pyogenic liver abscess is a rare and life-threatening disease in children. our case is noteworthy because of the rapid advancement of liver abscesses without any other systemic disorder. a 16-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital with fatigue, pallor, weight loss and high fever. in physical examination a fluctuating mass was observed under the scapular area and hepatosplenomegaly was  found. in computed tomography, three septated cystic lesions which looked like abscesses were demonstrated in the liver. the abscess was drained through percutaneous route. right pleural empyema with clinical features of adult respiratory distress syndrome appeared after the first day of treatment. bacteroides sp. was isolated from pus. on the twentieth day of the therapy, control abdominal computed tomography revealed two new abscesses in the liver. they were drained and the antibiotic therapy was continued with ticarcillin-clavulanate, fluconazole and levofloxacin. by the end of the first week of the therapy, the fever of the patient had abated. this therapy was continued for four weeks; 15 days after the end of the therapy there was prominent healing of the liver lesions with only one necrotic remnant 2 cm in diameter on abdominal computed tomography.

AB  == anaerobic saccharolytic bacteria thriving at high ph values were studied in a cellulose-degrading enrichment culture originating from the alkaline lake, verkhneye beloye (central asia). in situ hybridization of the enrichment culture  with 16s rrna-targeted probes revealed that abundant, long, thin, rod-shaped cells were related to cytophaga. bacteria of this type were isolated with cellobiose and five isolates were characterized. isolates were thin, flexible, gliding rods. they formed a spherical cyst-like structure at one cell end during  the late growth phase. the ph range for growth was 7.5-10.2, with an optimum around ph 8.5. cultures produced a pinkish pigment tentatively identified as a carotenoid. isolates did not degrade cellulose, indicating that they utilized soluble products formed by so far uncultured hydrolytic cellulose degraders. besides cellobiose, the isolates utilized other carbohydrates, including xylose,  maltose, xylan, starch, and pectin. the main organic fermentation products were propionate, acetate, and succinate. oxygen, which was not used as electron acceptor, impaired growth. a representative isolate, strain z-7010, with marinilabilia salmonicolor as the closest relative, is described as a new genus and species, alkaliflexus imshenetskii. this is the first cultivated alkaliphilic anaerobic member of the cytophaga/ flavobacterium/ bacteroides phylum.

TI  == survey of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the bacteria of the bacteroides fragilis group isolated from the intestinal tract of children.
AB  == the bacteria of the bacteroides fragilis group are considered important clinical  pathogens and they are the most common anaerobes isolated from human endogenous infections. in this study, the susceptibility patterns to antibiotics and metals  of 114 species of the b. fragilis group isolated from children with and without diarrhea were determined. susceptibility was assayed by using an agar dilution method with wilkins-chalgren agar. all b. fragilis strains were resistant to lead and nickel, but susceptible to metronidazole and imipenem. beta-lactamase production was detected by using biological and nitrocefin methods, respectively, in 50% and 90.6% of the isolates of children with diarrhea and in 60% and 90% of  the isolates of children without diarrhea. our results show an increase of antibiotics and metals resistance in this microbial group, and a periodic evaluation of the antimicrobial susceptibility is needed. in brazil, the contamination for antibiotics or metal ions is often observed, and it is suggested an increase the antimicrobial resistance surveillance of this microbial group, mainly those isolated from children's diarrhea.

TI  == bacterial diversity in malan ice core from the tibetan plateau.
AB  == three ice core samples were collected from the malan ice core drilled from the tibetan plateau, and three 16s rdna clone libraries by direct amplification from  the ice-melted water were established. ninety-four clones containing bacterial 16s rdna inserts were selected. according to restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis, 11 clones were unique in the library from which they were  obtained and used for partial sequence and phylogenetic analysis, and compared with 8 reported sequences from the same ice core at depth 70 m. differences among the samples were apparent in clone libraries. the phylotypes were dominated by the proteobacteria group, acinetobacter sp. and cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides (cfb) group. they accounted for 92.5% (proteobacteria), 100% (acinetobacter sp.), 34.4% (cfb) and 100% (beta-proteobacteria) in the clone libraries from the samples at ice depths 35, 64, 70, and 82 m, respectively. the acinetobacter sp. was only found in the deposition at ice depth 82 m and closely clustered with gamma-proteobateria. two  members (malan a-21 and 101) of alpha-proteobacteria from the sample of 35 m and  two (malan b-26 and 48) of beta-proteobacteria of 64 m were loosely clustered (<  95% similarity) with known bacteria, represented new genera in ice bacteria.

TI  == symbionts of the gut flagellate staurojoenina sp. from neotermes cubanus represent a novel, termite-associated lineage of bacteroidales: description of 'candidatus vestibaculum illigatum'.
AB  == the symbioses between cellulose-degrading flagellates and bacteria are one of the most fascinating phenomena in the complex micro-ecosystem found in the hindgut of lower termites. however, little is known about the identity of the symbionts. one example is the epibiotic bacteria colonizing the surface of hypermastigote protists of the genus staurojoenina. by using scanning electron microscopy, it was shown that the whole surface of staurojoenina sp. from the termite neotermes  cubanus is densely covered with long rod-shaped bacteria of uniform size and morphology. pcr amplification of 16s rrna genes from isolated protozoa and subsequent cloning yielded a uniform collection of clones with virtually identical sequences. phylogenetic analysis placed them as a new lineage among the bacteroidales, only distantly related to other uncultivated bacteria in the hindgut of other termites, including an epibiont of the flagellate mixotricha paradoxa. the closest cultivated relative was tannerella forsythensis (<85 % sequence identity). fluorescence in situ hybridization with a newly designed clone-specific oligonucleotide probe confirmed that these sequences belong to the rod-shaped epibionts of staurojoenina sp. transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of a gram-negative cell wall and revealed special attachment sites for the symbionts on the cell envelope of the flagellate host. based on the isolated phylogenetic position and the specific association with the surface of staurojoenina sp., we propose to classify this new taxon of bacteroidales under the provisional name 'candidatus vestibaculum illigatum'.

AB  == a gram-negative bacterium designated la1(t) was isolated from water collected in  hypersaline lake laysan on laysan island in the northwestern hawaiian islands. cells occurred singly as fine rods to short filaments. growth in 50 % strength marine broth occurred optimally when the medium contained 7.5-10 % (w/v) nacl. the major fatty acids in la1(t) grown at 15 and 30 degrees c were 12-methyl tetradecanoic acid and 13-methyl tetradecanoic acid, respectively. the nucleotide sequence of the 16s rrna gene showed that la1(t) belonged in the cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides (cfb) group in the domain bacteria. the closest described neighbour in terms of 16s rrna gene sequence identity was psychroflexus torquis acam 623(t) (94.4 % over 1423 bases), an obligate psychrophile from antarctic sea-ice. the g+c content of 35.0 mol% was consistent  with this affiliation. phenotypic and genotypic analyses, including dna hybridization, indicated that la1(t) could be assigned to the genus psychroflexus but, based on significant differences, including growth at 43 degrees c, it constitutes a novel species, psychroflexus tropicus sp. nov., for which la1(t) (=atcc baa-734(t)=dsm 15496(t)) is the type strain.

TI  == spatial distribution and stability of the eight microbial species of the altered  schaedler flora in the mouse gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == the overall complexity of the microbial communities in the gastrointestinal (gi)  tracts of mammals has hindered observations of dynamics and interactions of individual bacterial populations. however, such information is crucial for understanding the diverse disease-causing and protective roles that gut microbiota play in their hosts. here, we determine the spatial distribution, interanimal variation, and persistence of bacteria in the most complex defined-flora (gnotobiotic) model system to date, viz., mice colonized with the eight strains of the altered schaedler flora (asf). quantitative pcr protocols based on the 16s rrna sequence of each asf strain were developed and optimized to specifically detect as few as 10 copies of each target. total numbers of the asf  strains were determined in the different regions of the gi tracts of three c.b-17 scid mice. individual strain abundance was dependent on oxygen sensitivity, with  microaerotolerant lactobacillus murinus asf361 present at 10(5) to 10(7) cells/g  of tissue in the upper gi tract and obligate anaerobic asf strains being predominant in the cecal and colonic flora at 10(8) to 10(10) cells/g of tissue.  the variation between the three mice was small for most asf strains, except for clostridium sp. strain asf502 and bacteroides sp. strain asf519 in the cecum. a comparison of the relative distribution of the asf strains in feces and the colon indicated large differences, suggesting that fecal bacterial levels may provide a poor approximation of colonic bacterial levels. all asf strains were detected by  pcr in the feces of c57bl/6 restricted flora mice, which had been maintained in an isolator without sterile food, water, or bedding for several generations, providing evidence for the stability of these strains in the face of potential competition by bacteria introduced into the gut.

AB  == an anaerobic landfill leachate bioreactor was operated with crystalline cellulose and sterile landfill leachate until a steady state was reached. cellulose hydrolysis, acidogenesis, and methanogenesis were measured. microorganisms attached to the cellulose surfaces were hypothesized to be the cellulose hydrolyzers. 16s rrna gene clone libraries were prepared from this attached fraction and also from the mixed fraction (biomass associated with cellulose particles and in the planktonic phase). both clone libraries were dominated by firmicutes phylum sequences (100% of the attached library and 90% of the mixed library), and the majority fell into one of five lineages of the clostridia. clone group 1 (most closely related to clostridium stercorarium), clone group 2 (most closely related to clostridium thermocellum), and clone group 5 (most closely related to bacteroides cellulosolvens) comprised sequences in clostridium group iii. clone group 3 sequences were in clostridium group xiva (most closely related to clostridium sp. strain xb90). clone group 4 sequences were affiliated  with a deeply branching clostridial lineage peripherally associated with clostridium group vi. this monophyletic group comprises a new clostridium cluster, designated cluster via. specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) probes for the five groups were designed and synthesized, and it was demonstrated in fish experiments that bacteria targeted by the probes for clone groups 1, 2, 4, and 5 were very abundant on the surfaces of the cellulose particles and likely the key cellulolytic microorganisms in the landfill bioreactor. the fish probe for clone group 3 targeted cells in the planktonic phase, and these organisms were hypothesized to be glucose fermenters.

AB  == little is known about bacteria associated with lepidoptera, the large group of mostly phytophagous insects comprising the moths and butterflies. we inventoried  the larval midgut bacteria of a polyphagous foliivore, the gypsy moth (lymantria  dispar l.), whose gut is highly alkaline, by using traditional culturing and culture-independent methods. we also examined the effects of diet on microbial composition. analysis of individual third-instar larvae revealed a high degree of similarity of microbial composition among insects fed on the same diet. dna sequence analysis indicated that most of the pcr-amplified 16s rrna genes belong  to the gamma-proteobacteria and low g+c gram-positive divisions and that the cultured members represented more than half of the phylotypes identified. less frequently detected taxa included members of the alpha-proteobacterium, actinobacterium, and cytophaga/flexibacter/bacteroides divisions. the 16s rrna gene sequences from 7 of the 15 cultured organisms and 8 of the 9 sequences identified by pcr amplification diverged from previously reported bacterial sequences. the microbial composition of midguts differed substantially among larvae feeding on a sterilized artificial diet, aspen, larch, white oak, or willow. 16s rrna analysis of cultured isolates indicated that an enterococcus species and culture-independent analysis indicated that an entbacter sp. were both present in all larvae, regardless of the feeding substrate; the sequences of these two phylotypes varied less than 1% among individual insects. these results  provide the first comprehensive description of the microbial diversity of a lepidopteran midgut and demonstrate that the plant species in the diet influences the composition of the gut bacterial community.

TI  == assessment of equine fecal contamination: the search for alternative bacterial source-tracking targets.
AB  == 16s rdna clone libraries were evaluated for detection of fecal source-identifying bacteria from a collapsed equine manure pile. libraries were constructed using universal eubacterial primers and bacteroides-prevotella group-specific primers.  eubacterial sequences indicated that upstream and downstream water samples were predominantly beta- and gamma-proteobacteria (35 and 19%, respectively), while the manure library consisted predominantly of firmicutes (31%) and previously unidentified sequences (60%). manure-specific eubacterial sequences were not detectable beyond 5 m downstream of the pile, suggesting either poor survival or  high dilution rates. in contrast, bacteroides and prevotella sp. sequences were detected both in manure and downstream using group-specific primers. novel sequences from bacteroides and prevotella analysis produced an equine-specific phylogenetic cluster as compared to previous data sets obtained for human and bovine samples. while these results suggest that some anaerobic fecal bacteria might be potential identifiers for use in source-tracking applications, a comprehensive examination of environmental sequences within these species should  be performed before methods targeting these bacterial groups are applied to watersheds for development of microbial source-tracking protocols.

AB  == the present study was aimed at disclosing the influence of bacteroides fragilis (one of the most important bacterial agents causing colitis in children) experimental infection on the expression of substance p (sp) and somatostatin (som) in neurons and nerve fibres within the porcine ascending colon. distinct differences in the distribution pattern of neural elements immunoreactive to the  substances studied were observed between the experimental (inflam) and control (contr) pigs. in general, the number of sp-ir neurons and nerve terminals increased, while the expression of som decreased after bacteroides fragilis-induced colitis (bfic). however, distinct differences in the intensity of these alterations were observed between particular compartments of the bowel segment studied. thus, the present results suggest that sp- and som-immunoreactive (som-ir) elements of the enteric nervous system play a part in the control of colonic activity during bfic.

TI  == distribution of periodontal pathogens in korean aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: microbial associations in aggressive periodontitis versus different ethnic origins are substantially unknown. we undertook this study to determine the prevalence of seven putative periodontopathogens in korean patients and to evaluate microbial differences in localized and generalized aggressive periodontitis patients. methods: thirty-nine aggressive periodontitis patients between 20 and 35 years old (24 males and 15 females; mean age 29.6 years) were selected according to clinical criteria. the patients were subclassified into 17  localized and 22 generalized aggressive periodontitis patients. in each of the 39 individuals, subgingival plaque samples were collected from four diseased teeth (> or = 6 mm probing depth, 156 sites) and one healthy site (< or = 3 mm probing  depth, 39 sites). polymerase chain reaction (pcr) of the 16s ribosomal rna gene fragments (about 530 bp) of plaque bacteria and their subsequent detection by dot-blot hybridization using specific oligonucleotide probes were performed to determine the presence of seven periodontopathogens. results: the prevalences were 75% for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 94.2% for tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), 99.4% for fusobacterium sp., 85.9% for micromonas micros (formerly peptostreptococcus micros), 96.8% for porphyromonas gingivalis, 78.8% for prevotella intermedia, and 96.8% for treponema sp. the prevalences of these bacteria were significantly higher in diseased sites than in healthy sites. logistic regression analysis showed that p. intermedia was more significantly associated with generalized aggressive periodontitis than the localized form, with an odds ratio of 3.28 (95% confidence interval 1.26-8.56, p = 0.015). conclusions: our results demonstrate that the seven periodontal pathogens analyzed are strongly associated with korean aggressive periodontitis. in particular, p. intermedia are more significantly associated with generalized aggressive periodontitis, a more severe and progressive form, than with localized aggressive periodontitis.

TI  == localized aggressive periodontitis in primary dentition: a case report.
AB  == background: a 5-year-old japanese boy presented with persistent gingival inflammation and severe mobility of the right lower primary incisors. due to severe alveolar bone loss and a deep periodontal pocket (5 mm), the incisors were extracted at the second visit. methods: clinical, radiographic, histological, and microbiological examinations were carried out. then, the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique was employed to detect specific periodontal pathogens. the chemotactic activity of polymorphonuclear neutrophils was also measured. results: tannerella, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, and eikenella sp. were recovered from the subgingival microflora around the right lower incisors, while  a. actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected using the pcr method. further chemotaxis assay revealed  that neutrophil function was depressed compared with that of healthy controls. conclusions: although inflammation remained around the right primary second molars, the bone loss was controlled by periodic professional mechanical teeth cleaning (pmtc), subgingival irrigation, and local antibiotic application. the probing depths of all teeth, including permanent incisors and molars, were within 2.5 mm.

TI  == isolation and characterization of oligotrophic acido-tolerant methanogenic consortia from a sphagnum peat bog.
AB  == two dense and highly enriched (up to 10(9) cells ml(-1), <10% of bacterial satellites) acido-tolerant (ph 4.0-6.5) methanogenic consortia, '26' and 'k', were isolated from the peat beneath a sphagnum-eriophorum-carex community in west siberia. both consortia produced methane from co2:h2 on chemically defined, diluted n-free media containing ti(iii)citrate as reducing agent. the phylogenetic analysis of 16s ribosomal dna revealed three archaeal and nine bacterial sequence types. consortium '26' contained single archaea methanobacterium sp., represented by rods of 1.5-10x0.5-1.0 microm. in consortium 'k', there were two archaeal phylotypes, the respective methanogens were further  differentiated morphologically with the fluorescence in situ hybridization technique: one less abundant (<2%) population of the long-curved rods (50-100x0.3-0.4 microm) fell into the order of methanomicrobiales, while the dominant organism ( approximately 98%), represented by straight rods with abrupt  rectangular ends (3-9x0.5 microm), was affiliated with earlier uncultured 'rice cluster i'. the main bacterial satellite used citrate as a single carbon and energy source; it was similar in both consortia, and after isolation in pure culture, it was identified as a new member of the alpha-subclass of proteobacteria. the other bacterial satellites were distributed among four taxonomic groups: the delta-subclass of proteobacteria, the flavobacterium-bacteroides-cytophaga line of descent, the acidobacterium-fibrobacter line of descent and the green non-sulfur bacteria line of descent. at least 11 out of 12 components of acido-tolerant consortia are new  to science at the species, genus and order levels; their existence until now was  evident only from environmental gene retrievals. the sphagnum wetlands, attracting attention only recently because of their global environmental role, are shown to be an especially valuable source of novel prokaryotic organisms.

TI  == molecular, biochemical and ecological characterisation of a bio-catalytic calcification reactor.
AB  == bio-catalytic calcification (bcc) reactors utilise microbial urea hydrolysis by autochthonous bacteria for the precipitation-removal of calcium, as calcite, from industrial wastewater. due to the limited knowledge available concerning natural  ureolytic microbial calcium carbonate (caco(3)) precipitation, the microbial ecology of bcc reactors has remained a black box to date. this paper characterises bcc reactor evolution from initialisation to optimisation over a 6-week period. three key parameters were studied: (1) microbial evolution, (2) the (bio)chemical caco(3) precipitation pathway, and (3) crystal nucleation site  development. six weeks were required to establish optimal reactor performance, which coincided with an increase in urease activity from an initial 7 mg urea l(-1) reactor h(-1) to about 100 mg urea l(-1) reactor h(-1). urease activity in  the optimal period was directly proportional to ca(2+) removal, but urease gene diversity was seemingly limited to a single gene. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16s rrna genes revealed the dynamic evolution of the microbial community structure of the calcareous sludge, which was eventually dominated by a few species including porphyromonas sp., arcobacter sp. and bacteroides sp. epi-fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy showed that the calcareous sludge was colonised with living bacteria, as well as the calcified remains of organisms. it appears that the precipitation event is localised in a micro-environment, due to colonisation of crystal nucleation sites (calcareous sludge) by the precipitating organisms.

TI  == characteristics of brain abscess with isolation of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == in view of its localization, brain abscess (ba) usually requires medical and surgical care. a broad spectrum of bacteria is involved. recent reports stress the increasing frequency of anaerobes, but their impact has not been well evaluated. a retrospective review was conducted of all episodes of documented ba  admitted in a tertiary-care hospital over a 10 y period. ba due to anaerobic bacteria (group a) were compared with other cases (group b) to determine the frequency and eventual characteristics of ba with isolated anaerobic bacteria. between 1991 and 2000, ba were diagnosed in 42 patients (28m, 14f, mean age 54.6  y). no differences in clinical features and laboratory findings were found between patients with ba caused by anaerobic (n = 22) and only aerobic (n = 20) bacteria. using appropriate microbiological techniques, 41 anaerobic bacteria strains were isolated in 22 of 42 patients (52.4%) with ba. anaerobic bacteria were associated with aerobic strains in 5 patients (12%), whereas in 17 patients  (40.5%) only anaerobic strains were isolated in cerebral puncture cultures. the most frequently isolated species were fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 14), prevotella sp. (n = 8), actinomyces sp. (n = 6) and bacteroides sp. (n = 4). compared with group b, group a had more cases of a single abscess (p = 0.03) and  ear, nose and throat (ent) as a source of infection (p = 0.04), and seemed to have a better outcome (p = 0.07). these results emphasize the important role that anaerobic bacteria play in ba. the presence of such pathogens must be evoked when faced with a single abscess, an ent infection, or both. therapy should take into  account this high frequency.

TI  == reclassification of bacteroides putredinis (weinberg et al., 1937) in a new genus alistipes gen. nov., as alistipes putredinis comb. nov., and description of alistipes finegoldii sp. nov., from human sources.
AB  == during studies on the bacteriology of appendicitis in children, we often isolated from inflamed and non-inflamed tissue samples, an unusual bile-resistant pigment-producing strictly anaerobic gram-negative rod. phenotypically this organism resembles members of bacteroides fragilis group of species, as it is resistant to bile and exhibits a special-potency-disk pattern (resistance to vancomycin, kanamycin and colistin) typical for the b. fragilis group. however, the production of brown pigment on media containing haemolysed blood and a cellular fatty acid composition dominated by iso-c15:0, suggests that the organism most closely resembles species of the genus porphyromonas. however, the  unidentified organism differs from porphyromonads by being bile-resistant and by  not producing butyrate as a metabolic end-product. comparative 16s ribosomal rna  gene sequencing studies show the unidentified organism represents a distinct sub-line, associated with but distinct from, the miss-classified species bacteroides putredinis. the clustering of the unidentified bacterium with bacteroides putredinis was statistically significant, but they displayed > 4% sequence divergence with each other. chromosomal dna-dna pairing studies further  confirmed the separateness of the unidentified bacterium and bacteroides putredinis. based on phenotypic and phylogenetic considerations, it is proposed that bacteroides putredinis and the unidentified bacterium from human sources be  classified in a new genus alistipes, as alistipes putredinis comb. nov. and alistipes finegoldii sp. nov., respectively. the type strain of alistipes finegoldii is ccug 46020(t) (= ahn243(t)).

TI  == identification of a new ribosomal protection type of tetracycline resistance gene, tet(36), from swine manure pits.
AB  == previously, only one ribosome protection type of a tetracycline resistance gene,  tetq, had been identified in bacteroides spp. during an investigation of anaerobic bacteria present in swine feces and manure storage pits, a tetracycline-resistant bacteroides strain was isolated. subsequent analysis showed that this new bacteroides strain, bacteroides sp. strain 139, did not contain tetq but contained a previously unidentified tetracycline resistance gene. sequence analysis showed that the tetracycline resistance gene from bacteroides sp. strain 139 encoded a protein (designated tet 36) that defines a new class of ribosome protection types of tetracycline resistance. tet 36 has 60% amino acid identity over 640 aa to tetq and between 31 and 49% amino acid identity to the nine other ribosome protection types of tetracycline resistance genes. the tet(36) region was not observed to transfer from bacteroides sp. strain 139 to another bacteroides sp. under laboratory conditions. yet tet(36) was found in other genera of bacteria isolated from the same swine manure pits and from swine feces. phylogenetic analysis of the tet(36)-containing isolates indicated that tet(36) was present not only in the cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroides group to which bacteroides sp. strain 139 belongs but also in gram-positive genera and gram-negative proteobacteria, indicating that horizontal transfer of tet(36) is occurring between these divergent phylogenetic groups in the farm environment.

TI  == role of non-h2o2 producing lactobacilli and anaerobes in normal and complicated pregnancy.
AB  == lactobacilli (doederlein's bacilli) are the most important predominant protective agents of the vaginal microbial ecosystem and alteration in vaginal ph directly speculates the concentration of lactobacilli. currently, recognition of anaerobic lactobacilli (non-h2o2 producing lactobacilli) had further raised its significance. therefore, the present study was aimed to explore the role of non-h2o2 lactobacilli and its association with other anaerobes in 100 cases of complicated pregnancy, 75 cases of normal pregnancy and 35 cases in non-pregnant  women. vaginal and cervical swabs were obtained and were inoculated in special and suitable media. anaerobic lactobacilli (non-h2o2 producing) were more common  genital microbes in women of complicated pregnancy (56.0%) than in normal pregnancy (34.7%) and in control group (14.2%). rate of recovery of non-h2o2 producing lactobacilli increased when pathogenic bacteria especially anaerobes dominate the genital microflora. anaerobic lactobacilli were seen in higher numbers when they were associated with bacteroides sp and other anaerobes. they were significantly reduced when aerobes predominated in flora; the correlation have been discussed.

(5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.

TI  == effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  == duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. a panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16s rrna sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii, ruminococcus flavefaciens-ruminococcus bromii, eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides, and eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of  bacteria related to r. flavefaciens-r. bromii and e. cylindroides. the ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. the roseburia-related strain a2-183(f) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex  carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by  cross-feeding. in contrast, roseburia intestinalis l1-82(r) and eubacterium sp. strain a2-194(r) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that a2-194(r) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. these results suggest that many low-g+c-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics  from their effects in vitro.

AB  == cefditoren pivoxil, an oral third-generation cephalosporin, was approved by the food and drug administration in september 2001. it has been used in japan for several years. the greatest therapeutic potential of cefditoren appears to be its activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms causing respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections, such as haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis. cefditoren is also effective against methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus.  nevertheless, cefditoren has no activity against atypical pathogens, including chlamydia pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and legionella sp. moreover, cefditoren does not inhibit pseudomonas aeruginosa or bacteroides fragilis. in virtually all studies, cefditoren has compared favorably against other orally administered antibiotics used against the most commonly isolated respiratory tract pathogens. its side effect profile includes diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and dyspepsia. cefditoren is indicated for treatment of mild-to-moderate acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pharyngitis-tonsillitis, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by susceptible strains of organisms in adults and adolescents (> or = 12 yrs of age). based on its reported antimicrobial activity, cefditoren has potential for empiric management of most commonly encountered respiratory tract infections. additional studies will further define its role in clinical practice.

TI  == gelidibacter mesophilus sp. nov., a novel marine bacterium in the family flavobacteriaceae.
AB  == two gram-negative, aerobic, heterotrophic, marine bacteria, isolated from mediterranean sea water off the coast near valencia (spain), were the object of this study. these non-motile, yellow-pigmented, rod-shaped strains have been studied by means of dna-dna hybridization, 16s rrna sequencing and cultural and physiological features. phylogenetic analysis showed that both strains belong to  the phylum cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides, and their closest neighbour is the psychrophilic bacterium gelidibacter algens. the two strains differ from g. algens in their mesophilic behaviour, hydrolytic pattern and use of different carbon sources. there is 31% dna-dna hybridization between the proposed type strain and g. algens, and both isolates show 97.5% 16s rdna similarity to g. algens. they represent a novel species of the genus gelidibacter, for which the name gelidibacter mesophilus sp. nov. is proposed, with strain 2sm29t (= cect 5103t = dsm 14095t) as the type strain.

TI  == clinical review: bacteremia caused by anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  == this review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of bacteremia caused by anaerobic bacteria in children. bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus sp., clostridium sp., and fusobacterium sp. were the most common clinically significant anaerobic isolates. the strains of anaerobic organisms found depended, to a large extent, on the portal of entry and the underlying disease. predisposing conditions include: malignant neoplasms, immunodeficiencies, chronic renal insufficiency, decubitus ulcers, perforation of viscus and appendicitis, and neonatal age. organisms identical to those causing anaerobic bacteremia can often be recovered from other infected sites that may have served as a source of persistent bacteremia. when anaerobes resistant to penicillin are suspected or isolated, antimicrobial drugs such as clindamycin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, cefoxitin, a carbapenem, or the combination of a  beta-lactamase inhibitor and a penicillin should be administered. the early recognition of anaerobic bacteremia and administration of appropriate antimicrobial and surgical therapy play a significant role in preventing mortality and morbidity in pediatric patients.

TI  == metabolism of ginsenoside r(c) by human intestinal bacteria and its related antiallergic activity.
AB  == when ginsenoside r(c) was anaerobically incubated with human fecal microflora, all specimens metabolized ginsenoside r(c) to compound k and protopanaxadiol. the main metabolite was compound k. among the bacteria isolated from human fecal microflora, most bacteria, such as bacteroides sp., eubacterium sp., and bifidobacterium sp. potently transformed ginsenoside r(c) to compound k. bifidobacterium k-103 and eubacterium a-44 transformed it to compound k via ginsenoside r(d) and bacteroides hj-15 and bifidobacterium k-506 metabolized to compound k via ginsenoside mb, which was isolated as a new metabolite (m.w. 940[+na]). among ginsenoside r(c) and its metabolites, compound k exhibited the most potent antiallergic activity on the ige-induced rbl cell line as well as potent cytotoxic activity against tumor cell lines.

TI  == sulfate-reducing bacteria colonize pouches formed for ulcerative colitis but not  for familial adenomatous polyposis.
AB  == purpose: ileal pouch-anal anastomosis remains the "gold standard" in surgical treatment of ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis. pouchitis occurs mainly in patients with a background of ulcerative colitis, although the reasons for this are unknown. the aim of this study was to characterize differences in pouch bacterial populations between ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous pouches. methods: after ethical approval was obtained, fresh stool samples were collected from patients with ulcerative colitis pouches (n = 10), familial adenomatous polyposis (n = 7) pouches, and ulcerative colitis ileostomies (n = 8). quantitative measurements of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria  were performed. results: sulfate-reducing bacteria were isolated from 80 percent  (n = 8) of ulcerative colitis pouches. sulfate-reducing bacteria were absent from familial adenomatous polyposis pouches and also from ulcerative colitis ileostomy effluent. pouch lactobacilli, bifidobacterium, bacteroides sp, and clostridium perfringens counts were increased relative to ileostomy counts in patients with ulcerative colitis. total pouch enterococci and coliform counts were also increased relative to ileostomy levels. there were no significant quantitative or qualitative differences between pouch types when these bacteria were evaluated. conclusions: sulfate-reducing bacteria are exclusive to patients with a background of ulcerative colitis. not all ulcerative colitis pouches harbor sulfate-reducing bacteria because two ulcerative colitis pouches in this study were free of the latter. they are not present in familial adenomatous polyposis pouches or in ileostomy effluent collected from patients with ulcerative colitis. total bacterial counts increase in ulcerative colitis pouches after stoma closure. levels of lactobacilli, bifidobacterium, bacteroides sp, clostridium perfringens, enterococci, and coliforms were similar in both pouch groups. because sulfate-reducing bacteria are specific to ulcerative colitis pouches, they may play a role in the pathogenesis of pouchitis.

TI  == prevalence of gram negative anaerobic bacilli in routine clinical specimens.
AB  == a total of 206 gram negative anaerobic bacilli were isolated from 2591 routine clinical specimens. majority of them (78.2%) were part of a mixed flora. a high incidence of gram negative anaerobic bacilli was found in post-operative wound infections and diabetic foot infections (30.1%), followed by necrotizing fasciitis and crush injuries (18%), pus of empyema and lung abscesses (14.5%) and aspirates from other deep abscesses (10.7%). bacteroides fragilis was the most frequently recognized species (42.2%), followed by fusobacterium sp. (17.4%), prevotella sp. (15.1%) and porphyromonas sp. (11.2%). neomycin blood agar plate yielded the maximum number (72.8%) of strains in pure culture. gram negative anaerobic bacilli in infective processes are significantly on the rise and so suspected cultures should be processed for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of microbial diversity in the rhizoplane of oilseed rape (brassica napus cv. westar) employing cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent approaches.
AB  == the structure of the microbial rhizoplane community of the important crop plant oilseed rape was studied by using a culture-dependent as well as a culture-independent approach based on 16s rdna amplification. after isolation of  the microbial community from the rhizoplane of oilseed rape (brassica napus cv. westar), the collected suspension was divided into two parts. one part was used for cultivation of bacteria onto three different growth media to establish a culture collection. from the other part of the rhizoplane suspension, genomic dna was isolated and purified. thereafter, 16s rdna was amplified by pcr and cloned to obtain a library of 16s rdna genes representative for the bacterial communities of this habitat. phylogenetic 16s rdna sequence analysis of 103 clones of this library revealed considerable differences from the corresponding nucleotide sequences of 111 cultured bacteria. whereas the 16s rdna clone library was dominated by a-proteobacteria and bacteria of the cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides (cfb) phylum (51% and 30%, respectively), less than 17% of the cultured bacteria belonged to these two groups. more than 64% of the cultivated isolates were allocated to the b- and g-subclasses of the proteobacteria, which were present in the clone library at about 14%. most of the clones of the a-proteobacteria of the library showed highest similarity to bradyrhizobium sp. no such bacteria were found in the culture collection. similarly, the second dominant group of the clone library comprising members of the cfb phylum was represented in the culture collection by a single isolate. the phylogenetic analysis of isolates of the culture collection clearly emphasized the need to use different growth media for recovery of rhizoplane bacteria. whereas most of the a-proteobacteria were recovered on complex medium, most of the b-proteobacteria were isolated onto minimal media. our results demonstrate that the combined approach pursued in this paper is necessary to explore the biodiversity of bacterial rhizoplane communities.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of brazilian subjects with untreated chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: different periodontopathogenic microbiota have been associated with periodontal diseases in several populations. the present investigation determined the subgingival microbiota of untreated chronic periodontitis brazilians using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. methods: twenty-five periodontitis patients (mean age, 41 +/- 2; mean probing depth [pd], 3.3 +/- 0.2; mean attachment level [al], 3.6 +/- 0.2) with no history of previous periodontal  therapy and a control group of 14 healthy subjects (mean age, 34 +/- 0.6; mean pd, 1.8 +/- 0.2; mean al, 1.7 +/- 0.1) were selected. measurements of pd, al, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation, and suppuration were recorded at 6 sites/tooth. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 4 sites in each tooth/subject in both groups. the presence and levels of 41 subgingival species were determined in 4,032 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard method. results: periodontal pathogens, as well as some unusual species (e. faecalis, e. coli and bartonella sp.), were detected significantly more often and/or in higher levels in the periodontitis group (p < 0.05). most species were more frequently detected in interproximal sites. b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, e. nodatum, and f. nucleatum ss vincentii showed a significant positive correlation with mean pd and al (p < 0.05). conclusions: the subgingival microbiota of brazilians with untreated chronic periodontitis were complex, including high proportions of periodontopathogens commonly found in other populations, as well as some unusual species.

TI  == clinical, genetic and microbiological findings in a brazilian family with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background/aim: aggressive periodontitis comprises a group of rapidly progressive forms of periodontitis. besides bacteria, a high level of subject susceptibility  must be involved in the expression of disease. in the present study, we report the clinical, microbiological and genetic profile of a 14-individual family with  aggressive periodontitis. method: pcr was utilized to detect pathogenic bacteria  of affected sites. dna was obtained from epithelial cells through a mouthwash with 3% glucose and scrapping of the oral mucosa. rflp-pcr was used to analyze cytokine genetic polymorphisms. results: localized aggressive periodontitis was diagnosed for an 18-year-old systemically healthy non-smoking proband, with siblings displaying aggressive periodontitis. bacteroides forsythus and treponema denticola were the most frequent pathogens. the proband presented actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans and detectable levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and treponema denticola. allele 2 of il-1alpha (-889) polymorphism was found in all individuals as well as allele 1 of the il-1beta (+3953) gene. alleles 1 and 2 (50 % each) of il-1beta (-511), allele 1 of tnf-alpha (-308) and allele 2 (in homo or heterozygosity) of il-rn (intron 2) gene were present. conclusion: the results show that the present microbiological  and genetic parameters were not relevant for the prediction of periodontitis susceptibility in this family.

TI  == obligate bacterial endosymbionts of acanthamoeba spp. related to the beta-proteobacteria: proposal of 'candidatus procabacter acanthamoebae' gen. nov., sp. nov.
AB  == all obligate bacterial endosymbionts of free-living amoebae currently described are affiliated with the alpha-proteobacteria, the chlamydiales or the phylum cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides. here, six rod-shaped gram-negative obligate bacterial endosymbionts of clinical and environmental isolates of acanthamoeba spp. from the usa and malaysia are reported. comparative 16s rdna sequence analysis demonstrated that these endosymbionts form a novel, monophyletic lineage within the beta-proteobacteria, showing less than 90% sequence similarity to all  other recognized members of this subclass. 23s rdna sequence analysis of two symbionts confirmed this affiliation and revealed the presence of uncommon putative intervening sequences of 146 bp within helix-25 that shared no sequence  homology to any other bacterial rdna. in addition, the 23s rrna of these endosymbionts displayed one polymorphism at the target site of oligonucleotide probe bet42a that is conserved in all other sequenced beta-proteobacteria. intra-cytoplasmatic localization of the endosymbionts within the amoebal host cells was confirmed by electron microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization with a specific 16s rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probe. based on these findings, the provisional name 'candidatus procabacter acanthamoebae' is proposed for classification of a representative of the six endosymbionts of acanthamoeba spp.  studied in this report. comparative 18s rdna sequence analysis of the acanthamoeba host cells revealed their membership with either acanthamoeba 18s rdna sequence type t5 (acanthamoeba lenticulata) or sequence type t4, which comprises the majority of all acanthamoeba isolates.

TI  == microheterogeneity in 16s ribosomal dna-defined bacterial populations from a stratified planktonic environment is related to temporal changes and to ecological adaptations.
AB  == temporal changes of the bacterioplankton from a meromictic lake (lake vilar, banyoles, spain) were analyzed with four culture-independent techniques: epifluorescence microscopy, pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) fingerprinting, fluorescence in situ whole-cell hybridization and flow cytometry  sorting. microscopically, blooms of one cyanobacterium (synechococcus sp.-like),  one green sulfur bacterium (chlorobium phaeobacteroides-like), and one purple sulfur bacterium (thiocystis minor-like) were observed at different depths and times. dgge retrieved these populations and, additionally, populations related to the cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides phylum as predominant community members. the analyses of partial 16s ribosomal dna sequences from the dgge fingerprints (550 bp analyzed) revealed higher genetic diversity than expected from microscopic observation for most of these groups. thus, the sequences of two synechococcus spp. (both had a similarity of 97% to synechococcus sp. strain pcc6307 in 16s rrna), two thiocystis spp. (similarities to thiocystis minor of 93 and 94%, respectively), and three cytophaga spp. (similarities to cytophaga fermentans of 88 and 89% and to cytophaga sp. of 93%, respectively) were obtained. the two populations of synechococcus exhibited different pigment compositions and temporal distributions and their 16s rrna sequences were 97.3% similar. the two thiocystis populations differed neither in pigment composition nor in morphology, but their 16s rrna sequences were only 92.3% similar and they  also showed different distributions over time. finally, two of the cytophaga spp. showed 96.2% similarity between the 16s rrna sequences, but one of them was found to be mostly attached to particles and only in winter. thus, the identity of the  main populations changed over time, but the function of the microbial guilds was  maintained. our data showed that temporal shifts in the identity of the predominant population is a new explanation for the environmental 16s rrna microdiversity retrieved from microbial assemblages and support the hypothesis that clusters of closely related 16s rrna environmental sequences may actually represent numerous closely related, yet ecologically distinct, populations.

TI  == isolation and characterization of clv25, a bacteroides fragilis chromosomal transfer factor resembling multiple bacteroides sp. mobilizable transposons.
AB  == horizontal dna transfer contributes significantly to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes in bacteroides fragilis. to further our understanding of dna transfer in b. fragilis, we isolated and characterized a new transfer factor, clv25. clv25 was isolated from b. fragilis lv25 by its capture on the nonmobilizable escherichia coli-bacteroides shuttle vector pgat400deltabglii. similar to other bacteroides sp. transfer factors, clv25 was mobilized in e. coli by the conjugative plasmid r751. using tn1000 mutagenesis and deletion analysis of clv25, two mobilization genes, bmga and bmgb, were identified, whose predicted proteins have similarity to dna relaxases and mobilization proteins, respectively. in particular, bmga and bmgb were homologous to moca and mocb, respectively, the two mobilization proteins of the b. fragilis mobilizable transposon tn4399. a cis-acting origin of transfer (orit) was localized to a 353-bp region that included nearly all of the intergenic region between bmgb and  orf22 and overlapped with the 3' end of orf22. this orit contained a putative nic site sequence but showed no significant similarity to the orit regions of other transfer factors, including tn4399. despite the lack of sequence similarity between the orits of clv25 and tn4399, a mutation in the clv25 putative dna relaxase, bmga, was partially complemented by tn4399. in addition to the functional cross-reaction with tn4399, a second distinguishing feature of clv25 is that predicted proteins have similarity to proteins encoded not only by tn4399 but by several bacteroides sp. transfer factors, including nbu1, nbu2, ctndot, tn4555, and tn5520.

AB  == the strictly anaerobic gram-negative bacterium strain fru22t grows at 50 degrees  c in media containing up to 75 g nacl l(-1). hexoses and pentoses are fermented to equal molar amounts of acetate, propionate and succinate, and no co2 is formed. an orange-red pigment similar to flexirrubin is produced during stationary phase upon exposure to light for several days. cells also produce a surface-active extracellular compound which lowers the surface tension of the medium. this tenside is heat-tolerant up to 70 degrees c and is destroyed by treatment with proteinase k or trypsin, but not by lipase. comparative 16s rdna sequence analysis confirmed a phylogenetic affiliation of strain fru22t to the phylum bacteroides (cytophaga/flavobacterium/bacteroides), moderately related to  the genus marinilabilia. therefore, on the basis of phylogenetic, phenotypic and  physiological evidence, a new genus, anaerophaga, is proposed to harbour strain fru22t (dsm 12881t, ocm 798t) which is described as the type strain of a new species, anaerophaga thermohalophila gen. nov., sp. nov.

TI  == phylogeny of culturable estuarine bacteria catabolizing riverine organic matter in the northern baltic sea.
AB  == the objective of our study was to isolate and determine the phylogenetic affiliation of culturable estuarine bacteria capable of catabolizing riverine dissolved organic matter (rdom) under laboratory conditions. additions of rdom consistently promoted the growth of estuarine bacteria in carbon-limited dilution cultures, with seasonal variation in growth rates and yields. at least 42 different taxa were culturable on solid agar media and, according to quantitative dna-dna hybridizations, constituted 32 to 89% of the total bacterial number in the enriched treatments. five species in the cytophaga-flexibacter-bacteroides group and one in the gamma-proteobacteria phylogenetic group (marinomonas sp.) were numerically dominant during the stationary phase of the rdom-enriched dilution cultures but not in the control cultures. four of the isolates in cytophaga-flexibacter-bacteroides group were putatively affiliated with the genus flavobacterium: all dominating isolates were determined to be new species based on comparison to the current databases. the same group of species dominated independently of the season investigated, suggesting a low diversity of bacteria  catabolizing rdom in the estuary. it also suggested a broad tolerance of the dominating species to seasonal variation in hydrography, chemistry, and competition with other species. taken together, our results suggest that a limited group of bacteria, mainly in the flavobacterium genus, played an important role in introducing new energy and carbon to the marine system in the northern baltic sea.

AB  == the microbiota of the intestinal tract of chickens plays an important role in inhibiting the establishment of intestinal pathogens. earlier culturing and microscopic examinations indicated that only a fraction of the bacteria in the cecum of chickens could be grown in the laboratory. therefore, a survey of cecal  bacteria was done by retrieval of 16s rrna gene sequences from dna isolated from  the cecal content and the cecal mucosa. the ribosomal gene sequences were amplified with universal primers and cloned or subjected to temporal temperature  gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge). partial 16s rrna gene sequences were determined from the clones and from the major bands in ttge gels. a total of 1,656 partial 16s rrna gene sequences were obtained and compared to sequences in  the genbank. the comparison indicated that 243 different sequences were present in the samples. overall, sequences representing 50 phylogenetic groups or subgroups of bacteria were found, but approximately 89% of the sequences represented just four phylogenetic groups (clostridium leptum, sporomusa sp., clostridium coccoides, and enterics). sequences of members of the bacteroides group, the bifidobacterium infantis subgroup, and of pseudomonas sp. each accounted for less than 2% of the total. sequences related to those from the escherichia sp. subgroup and from lactobacillus, pseudomonas, and bifidobacterium spp. were generally between 98 and 100% identical to sequences already deposited  in the genbank. sequences most closely related to those of the other bacteria were generally 97% or less identical to those in the databases and therefore might be from currently unknown species. ttge and random cloning indicated that certain phylogenetic subgroups were common to all birds analyzed, but sequence data from random cloning also provided evidence for qualitative and quantitative  differences among the cecal microbiota of individual birds reared under very similar conditions.

TI  == muricauda ruestringensis gen. nov., sp. nov., a facultatively anaerobic, appendaged bacterium from german north sea intertidal sediment.
AB  == a gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic bacterium with appendages was isolated from continuous cultures with a seawater-sediment suspension containing hexadecane as the sole carbon source. although this organism was isolated from a  hexadecane-degrading bacterial community, it was not able to degrade hexadecane.  however, this bacterium was able to use different sugars and amino acids for growth, indicating that it probably profits from the lysis or from products like  surfactants of other cells in the community. 16s rdna analysis demonstrated that  the isolated strain is phylogenetically related to the family flavobacteriaceae of the phylum 'cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides'. evidence based on phenotypic characteristics and 16s rdna analysis supports the conclusion that this bacterium is distinct from its nearest relative, zobellia uliginosa (90.72%  similarity in 16s rrna gene sequence), and from the other genera of the flavobacteriaceae. it is therefore proposed that the isolated marine bacterium represents a novel taxon, designated muricauda ruestringensis gen. nov., sp. nov. the type strain is strain b1t (= dsm 13258t = lmg 19739t).

TI  == phylogenetic analysis and taxonomic study of marine cytophaga-like bacteria: proposal for tenacibaculum gen. nov. with tenacibaculum maritimum comb. nov. and  tenacibaculum ovolyticum comb. nov., and description of tenacibaculum mesophilum  sp. nov. and tenacibaculum amylolyticum sp. nov.
AB  == bacterial strains were isolated from sponge and green algae which were collected  on the coast of japan and palau. the phylogenetic relationships of these isolates among marine species of the cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides complex were analysed by using their gyrb nucleotide sequences and translated peptide sequences (gyrb) in addition to 16s rdna sequences. these isolates were closely related to the previously characterized marine flexibacter species, [flexibacter] maritimus and [flexibacter] ovolyticus. these flexibacter species are distantly related to flexibacter flexilis, the type species of the genus flexibacter, and phylogenetically belong to the family flavobacteriaceae (according to analysis using both 16s rdna and gyrb sequences). their phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic characteristics prompted the proposal that these two species should be transferred to the new genus tenacibaculum, as tenacibaculum maritimum and tenacibaculum ovolyticum, respectively. two additional new species of the genus tenacibaculum, tenacibaculum mesophilum gen. nov., sp. nov. (= mbic 1140t = ifo 16307t) and tenacibaculum amylolyticum gen. nov., sp. nov. (= mbic 4355t = ifo 16310t), which were isolated from sponges and macroalgae, are also reported. for  taxonomic considerations at the species level, the resolution of gyrb sequences was superior to that of 16s rdna sequences, and the grouping based on the gyrb phylogram was consistent with dna-dna hybridization results.

TI  == members of the cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides phylum as intracellular bacteria of acanthamoebae: proposal of 'candidatus amoebophilus asiaticus'.
AB  == three gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria that were found intracellularly in two environmental and one clinical acanthamoeba sp. isolates were analysed. two endocytobionts showing a parasitic behaviour were propagated successfully outside their amoebal host cells and were identified subsequently by comparative 16s rrna sequence analysis as being most closely affiliated with flavobacterium succinicans (99% 16s rrna sequence similarity) or flavobacterium johnsoniae (98%  16s rrna sequence similarity). one endocytobiont could neither be cultivated outside its original acanthamoeba host (acanthamoeba sp. tumsj-321) nor transferred into other amoebae. electron microscopy revealed that the amoebal trophozoites and cysts were almost completely filled with cells of this endosymbiont which are surrounded by a host-derived membrane. according to 16s rrna sequence analysis, this endosymbiont could also be assigned to the cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides (cfb) phylum, but was not closely affiliated to any recognized species within this phylogenetic group (less than 82% 16s rrna  sequence similarity). identity and intracellular localization of this endosymbiont were confirmed by application of a specific fluorescently labelled 16s rrna-targeted probe. based on these findings, we propose classification of this obligate acanthamoeba endosymbiont as 'candidatus amoebophilus asiaticus'. comparative 18s rrna sequence analysis of the host of 'candidatus amoebophilus asiaticus' revealed its membership with acanthamoeba 18s rdna sequence type t4 that comprises the majority of all acanthamoeba isolates.

TI  == comparative genomics and evolution of genes encoding bacterial (p)ppgpp synthetases/hydrolases (the rel, rela and spot proteins).
AB  == in the gram-negative model organism escherichia coli, the effector molecule of the stringent response, (p)ppgpp, is synthesized by two different enzymes, rela and spot, whereas in the gram-positive model organism bacillus subtilis only one  enzyme named rel is responsible for this activity. rel and spot also possess (p)ppgpp hydrolase activity. blast searches were used to identify orthologous genes in databases. the construction and bootstrapping of phylogenetic trees allowed classification of these orthologs. four groups could be distinguished: with the exception of neisseria and bordetella (beta subdivision), the rela and spot groups are exclusively found in the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria. two rel groups representing the actinobacterial and the bacillus/clostridium group were also identified. the spot proteins are related to the gram positive rel proteins. rela proteins carry substitutions in the hd domain (aravind and koonin, 1998, tibs 23: 469-472) responsible for ppgpp degradation. a theory for the evolution of the specialized, paralogous rela and spot genes is presented: after  gene duplication of an ancestral rellike gene, the spot and rela genes evolved from the duplicated genes. the distribution pattern of the paralogous rela and spot proteins supports a new model of linear bacterial evolution (gupta, 2000, fems microbiol. rev. 24: 367-402). this model postulates that the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria represents the most recently evolved bacterial lineage. however, two paralogous, closely related genes of porphyromonas gingivalis (cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides phylum) encoding proteins with functions probably identical to the rela and spot proteins do not fit in this model. completely sequenced genomes of several obligately parasitic organisms (treponema pallidum, chlamydia species, rickettsia prowazekii) and the obligate aphid symbiont buchnera sp. aps as well as archaea do not contain rel-like genes  but they are present in the arabidopsis genome. in crosslinking experiments using different analogs of ppgpp as crosslinking reagents and rna polymerase preparations of escherichia coli, binding of ppgpp to distinct regions at the c-terminus of the beta subunit (the rpob gene product) and/or at the n-terminus of the beta subunit (the rpoc gene product) was observed previously. rpob and rpoc sequences of the species which do not possess a rel like gene do not exhibit specific insertions or deletions in the ppgpp binding regions.

TI  == flavobacterium frigidarium sp. nov., an aerobic, psychrophilic, xylanolytic and laminarinolytic bacterium from antarctica.
AB  == a psychrophilic, aerobic bacterium designated a2it was isolated from marine sediment recovered from shallow waters surrounding adelaide island, antarctica (67 degrees 34' s, 68 degrees 07' w). the organism exhibited xylanolytic and laminarinolytic activity and was halotolerant. basic characterization showed that it was gram-negative, non-motile, yellow-pigmented (beta,beta-carotene-3,3'-diol) and positive for oxidase and catalase synthesis. analysis of the 16s rdna sequence suggests that the organism belongs to the flexibacter-cytophaga-bacteroides phylum. on the basis of its 16s rdna sequence,  the bacterium is 96.8% similar to flavobacterium columnare atcc 43622--its closest relation. the genomic dna g+c content was 35 mol%. growth on xylan occurs optimally at 15 degrees c, though growth also occurs at 0 degrees c, and the doubling times are 9.6 and 34.8 h, respectively. the maximum growth temperature on xylan is at 24 degrees c. the bacterium is a neutrophile, growing across the ph range 5.6-8.4 and having an optimum at ph 7.5. analysis of the 16s rdna sequence, together with phenotypic characterization, suggests that the organism is a member of the genus flavobacterium. dna-dna hybridization experiments have shown that it is a novel species; it is proposed, therefore, that the organism be designated as the type strain of flavobacterium frigidarium sp. nov. (= atcc 700810t = ncimb 13737t).

TI  == treatment of peri-implantitis by local delivery of tetracycline. clinical, microbiological and radiological results.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical, microbiological and radiological effects of peri-implantitis therapy by local delivery of tetracycline. in 25 partially edentulous patients, 30 implants with radiographic  evidence of circumferential bone loss, and peri-implant probing depths > or =5 mm were treated with polymeric tetracycline hcl-containing fibers. clinical and microbial parameters were recorded at baseline, and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months (m) after treatment. standardized radiographs were obtained at baseline, m3, and one  year after treatment. two patients were discontinued from the study after 180 days because of persisting active peri-implantitis with pus formation. the remaining subjects showed a significant decrease of mean peri-implant probing depth from 6.0 to 4.1 mm (m1, p<0.001), which was maintained over 12 months. in comparison to baseline, the bleeding tendency was significantly reduced after one month, and thereafter (p<0.001). no significant recession of the mucosal margin was noted. the radiologically determined distance from the shoulder of the implant to the bottom of the bony defect decreased slightly, but not significantly, from 5.2 to 4.9 mm. at m1, m3 and m6, mean total anaerobic cultivable bacterial counts were significantly lower than at baseline (p<0.001).  a significant decrease in frequency of detection was noted for prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, fusobacterium sp., bacteroides forsythus, and campylobacter rectus (p<0.01). actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and eikenella corrodens had very low baseline frequencies that could not be significantly suppressed further. in conclusion, therapy of peri-implantitis by local delivery of tetracycline had a positive effect on clinical and microbiological parameters.

TI  == purification and characterization of acharan sulfate lyases, two novel heparinases, from bacteroides stercoris hj-15.
AB  == two novel acharan sulfate lyases (asl1 and asl2: no ec number) have been purified from bacteroides stercoris hj-15 which was isolated from human intestinal bacteria with glycosaminoglycan (gag) degrading enzymes. these enzymes were purified to apparent homogeneity by a combination of qae-cellulose, deae-cellulose, carboxymethyl-sephadex c-50, hydroxyapatite and hitrap sp sephadex c-25 column chromatography with the final specific activity of 50.5 and  76.7 micromol.min-1.mg-1, respectively. both acharan sulfate lyases are single subunits of 83 kda by sds/page and gel filtration. asl1 showed optimal activity at ph 7.2 and 45 degrees c. asl1 activity was inhibited by cu2+, ni2+ and co2+, but asl2 activity was inhibited by cu2+, ni2+and pb2. both enzymes were slightly  inhibited by some agents that modify histidine and cysteine residues, but activated by reducing agents such as dl-dithiothreitol and 2-mercaptoethanol. both purified bacteroidal acharan sulfate lyases acted to the greatest extent on  acharan sulfate, and to a lesser extents on heparan sulfate and heparin. they did not act on de-o-sulfated acharan sulfate. these findings suggest that the biochemical properties of these purified acharan sulfate lyases are different from those of the previously purified heparin lyases, but these enzymes belong to heparinase ii.

TI  == substance p immunoreactive sensory axons as a subset of the total axonal population in the maxillary sinus of the rabbit: a characterization of normal and infected mucosa.
AB  == substance p (sp), one of the neuropeptides released from sensory nerves, is thought to mediate neurogenic inflammation. although sp immunoreactive axons have been described in the sinus mucosa, no attempt has been made to characterize sp fibers as a subset of all axons present in the sinus mucosa. in addition, no study to date has characterized the changes in infected sinus mucosa. the maxillary sinus mucosa of new zealand white rabbits was harvested from control animals and in animals with induced maxillary sinusitis. immunohistochemical staining of the sinus mucosa for both protein gene product 9.5 (pgp), a nonspecific marker for all nerves, and for sp was performed on 11 animals: 3 controls and 8 infected. in sinus mucosa from the control rabbits, <50% of all axons labeled by pgp were immunoreactive for sp. in infected mucosa, the absolute number of axons found by pgp staining decreased and nearly all of these remaining fibers were also immunoreactive for sp. we conclude that the phenotypical labeling of nerve fibers seen in normal mucosa is altered by bacterial-induced infection.

TI  == molecular epidemiology and association of putative pathogens in root canal infection.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of putative pathogens in root canals with apical periodontitis and to determine the associations among the putative pathogens. eighteen symptomatic and 20 asymptomatic teeth from 36 subjects were studied. this research was performed with polymerase chain reaction and hybridization using rrna-based oligonucleotide probes. the most frequently found species was fusobacterium sp. (68.4%), followed by peptostreptococcus micros (44.7%) and porphyromonas gingivalis (26.3%). sixteen teeth (42.1%) contained one or more species of the selected black-pigmented bacteria. bacteroides forsythus and treponema sp. were detected in 8 teeth and 6 teeth, respectively. among the analyzed bacteria, significant relationships were shown in the combination of b. forsythus/p. gingivalis and treponema sp./p. gingivalis. there was no significant association between any bacteria and any symptoms.

AB  == results of a polyphasic taxonomic study on an unknown gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, coccobacillus-shaped organism isolated from an infected  human gall bladder are presented. phenotypic and molecular taxonomic studies revealed the organism to be close to, but distinct from, organisms designated cdc (centers for disease control and prevention) group df-3. the unknown bacterium was readily distinguished from reference strains of bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas and related taxa by 16s rrna gene sequencing, biochemical tests, analysis of cellular long-chain fatty acids and electrophoretic analysis of whole-cell proteins. based on the results of the present study, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium be classified in a new genus, dysgonomonas, as dysgonomonas gadei sp. nov. (type strain ccug 42882t = cip 106420t). in addition, a new species, dysgonomonas capnocytophagoides sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate strains previously belonging to cdc group df-3. the type species of the genus dysgonomonas is dysgonomonas gadei.

TI  == detection of major putative periodontopathogens in korean advanced adult periodontitis patients using a nucleic acid-based approach.
AB  == background: although extensive microbial analyses have been performed from subgingival plaque samples of periodontitis patients, systematic analysis of subgingival microbiota has not been carried out in a korean population so far. the purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of major putative periodontopathogens in korean patients by culture-independent methods. methods: a total of 244 subgingival plaque samples (5 sites in each participant) were taken  from 29 advanced adult periodontitis (ap) patients and 20 periodontally healthy subjects. ap samples were obtained from the 4 deepest periodontal pockets (> or =6 mm probing depth [pd]) and 1 healthy site (< or =3 mm pd) in each patient. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) of 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) of subgingival plaque bacteria was performed with eubacterial primers. aliquots of pcr products were then applied on nylon membranes and hybridized with specific oligonucleotide probes labeled with digoxigenin. results: all diseased sites harbored fusobacterium sp., while porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema sp., and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 96% of 116 diseased sites. peptostreptococcus micros, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia were present in 82%, 74%, and 71% of diseased sites, respectively. in  sites of periodontally healthy subjects, fusobacterium sp. was present in the highest proportion (58%). treponema sp., p. gingivalis, and b. forsythus were detected in 22%, 18%, and 18% of healthy sites, respectively. p. micros, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were found in 8%, 2%, and 1% of healthy  sites, respectively. the prevalence of the periodontopathogens, with the exceptions of fusobacterium sp. and b. forsythus, was significantly higher in the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects (p <0.05). conclusions: using highly sensitive methods relying on 16s ribosomal rna-based oligonucleotide probes, we confirmed the strong association of 7 putative periodontopathogens with ap patients in a korean population. with the exceptions of fusobacterium sp. and b. forsythus, all the periodontopathogens were significantly more associated with the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects.

AB  == the bacteriological and clinical findings of 18 cases of brain abscess are presented. identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic strains was performed both by conventional methods and the newer rapid ana ii panel and e-test methods, respectively. characterization of the anaerobic isolates was done by restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp). anaerobic or aerobic organisms alone were recovered in three (16.6%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic  in another three (16.6%) patients. there were nine anaerobic isolates. the predominant anaerobes were prevotella melaninogenicus (four isolates), bacteroides preacutus (three isolates), fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus sp. (one isolate each). a total of six aerobic isolates, all of which were gram-positive cocci were recovered. all the anaerobic isolates were susceptible to metronidazole, but two isolates of p. melaninogenicus were resistant to penicillin. there was complete agreement between the identification  based on biochemical profiles and rflp patterns. these findings indicate the microbial complexity of brain abscess and the need to target antimicrobial therapy against both the aerobic and anaerobic components of infection.

TI  == chemostat enrichments of human feces with resistant starch are selective for adherent butyrate-producing clostridia at high dilution rates.
AB  == resistant starch (rs) enrichments were made using chemostats inoculated with human feces from two individuals at two dilution rates (d = 0.03 h(-1) and d = 0.30 h(-1)) to select for slow- and fast-growing amylolytic communities. the fermentations were studied by analysis of short-chain fatty acids, amylase and alpha-glucosidase activities, and viable counts of the predominant culturable populations and the use of 16s rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes. considerable butyrate was produced at d = 0. 30 h(-1), which corresponded with reduced branched-chain fatty acid formation. at both dilution rates, high levels of extracellular amylase activity were produced, while alpha-glucosidase was predominantly cell associated. bacteroides and bifidobacteria predominated at the low dilution rate, whereas saccharolytic clostridia became more important at d =  0.30 h(-1). microscopic examination showed that within 48 h of inoculation, one particular bacterial morphotype predominated in rs enrichments at d = 0.30 h(-1). this organism attached apically to rs granules and formed rosette-like structures which, with glycocalyx formation, agglomerated to form biofilm networks in the planktonic phase. attempts to isolate this bacterium in pure culture were repeatedly unsuccessful, although a single colony was eventually obtained. on the basis of its 16s rdna sequence, this rs-degrading, butyrate-producing organism was identified as being a previously unidentified group i clostridium sp. a 16s rrna-targeted probe was designed using this sequence and used to assess the abundance of the population in the enrichments. at 240 h, its contributions to total rrna in the chemostats were 5 and 23% at d = 0.03 and 0.30 h(-1), respectively. this study indicates that bacterial populations with significant metabolic potential can be overlooked using culture-based methodologies. this may provide a paradigm for explaining the discrepancy between the low numbers of butyrate-producing bacteria that are isolated from fecal samples and the actual production of butyrate.

TI  == a mouse model of chronic bacterial lesions (a cotton trap) for studying oral bacteria-lymphocyte interactions.
AB  == we established a mouse model of chronic bacterial infection (cotton trap) to get  a deeper insight into interactions between immune cells and bacterial strains, that are most commonly isolated from periapical processes. we have used flow cytometry to identify the presence of intracellular cytokines of activated t cells collected from cotton traps, previously infected with different strains of  bacteria and implanted subcutaneously into the back of the mice. we provide an evidence that anaerobic bacteria (bacteroides sp.) and nocardiae are more effective in inducing cytotoxic immunity and th1 response compared to oral streptococci. differences in immune response against anaerobic bacteria when compared to streptococci are probably dependent on some non-specific immune cell  stimulation (e.g. by bacterial cell wall components), nevertheless the role of specific antigen-dependent immune mechanism can not be excluded.

TI  == immune response in chronic periapical parodonititis.

TI  == bacteriology and antimicrobial choice in hepatolithiasis.
AB  == background and aims: hepatolithiasis is prevalent in southeast asia and presents  a difficult management problem. acute repeated episodes of cholangitis are frequently manifested in patients with hepatolithiasis. without proper treatment, such infection can lead to liver abscess, secondary biliary cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and death from sepsis or hepatic failure. in addition to clearance  of the stones and relief of bile stasis either by surgery or by interventional radiologic manipulation, effective antimicrobial therapy also plays a crucial role in the treatment of patients with hepatolithiasis. the aim of this study is  to clarify the bacteriology in hepatolithiasis and to provide the information for an appropriate antimicrobial choice. methods: from july 1993 to june 1996, 150 patients with hepatolithiasis underwent surgical intervention. bile specimens were routinely obtained by syringe aspiration from common bile duct. the syringe  was immediately capped, and the bile was subsequently cultured for both aerobes and anaerobes. results: bacteria were present in the bile of all patients. the bacteria most frequently found were gram-negative bacteria such as klebsiella sp, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas sp, and the gram-positive enterococcus sp. bacteroides sp were the most frequently found anaerobes. conclusions: this study  demonstrated the close relationship between acute cholangitis in hepatolithiasis  and enteric bacteria and also displayed the detailed antibiotic sensitivity results. armed with this fruitful information, we believe the antibiotic treatment for acute cholangitis in hepatolithiasis should first aim at enteric bacteria and be adjusted later according to the results of bacteriologic cultures and clinical situation to achieve an effective microbial control.

AB  == a novel type of heparinase (heparin lyase, no ec number) has been purified from bacteroides stercoris hj-15, isolated from human intestine, which produces three  kinds of heparinases. the enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity by a combination of qae-cellulose, deae-cellulose, cm-sephadex c-50, hydroxyapatite, and hitrap sp chromatographies with a final specific activity of 19.5 mmol/min/mg. it showed optimal activity at ph 7.2 and 45 degrees c and the presence of 300 mm kcl greatly enhanced its activity. the purified enzyme activity was inhibited by cu(2+), pb(2+), and some agents that modify histidine and cysteine residues, and activated by reducing agents such as dithiothreitol and 2-mercaptoethanol. this purified bacteroides heparinase is an eliminase that  shows its greatest activity on bovine intestinal heparan sulfate, and to a lesser extent on porcine intestinal heparan sulfate and heparin. this enzyme does not act on acharan sulfate but de-o-sulfated acharan sulfate and n-sulfoacharan sulfate were found to be poor substrates. the substrate specificity of this enzyme is similar to that of flavobacterial heparinase ii. however, an internal amino acid sequence of the purified bacteroides heparinase shows significant (73%) homology to flavobacterial heparinase iii and only 43% homology to flavobacterial heparinase ii. these findings suggest that the bacteroidal heparinase is a novel enzyme degrading gags.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == sequence analysis of bacterial dna in the colon and stomach of the tyrolean iceman.
AB  == the male human body found in an alpine glacier on september 19, 1991 ("tyrolean iceman") has, for the first time in history, given scientists a chance to perform detailed anatomical, histological, and molecular investigations on the organs of  a person from the neolithic age (5350-5100 b.p.). in the present study, tissue samples aseptically taken from the stomach and the colon of the mummy were utilized for dna extraction, and the dna was pcr-amplified, using primer pairs designed to bind to fragments of the 16s ribosomal rna gene (16s rdna) of a broad range of bacteria. the pcr products were cloned in plasmid vectors, and the recombinant clones (amplicons) were sequenced. the sequence data were finally used for scanning data libraries containing the corresponding sequences of present-day bacteria, to infer the putative ecophysiology of the ancient ones. the same procedure was repeated on some fragments of grass from the clothing found near the corpse. these fragments were taken as a control of the microbiological situation of the glacier. the results show that the flora of the  iceman's stomach is entirely composed of burkholderia pickettii, an organism commonly found in aquatic habitats. the colon, on the other hand, contains several members of the fecal flora of humans, such as clostridium perfringens, c. ghonii, c. sordellii, eubacterium tenue, and bacteroides sp. the iceman's colon,  however, was found to contain, rather unexpectedly, also some members of the genus vibrio. the results are discussed in light of what is known about the preservation of microbial dna at the iceman's site and of previous parasitological studies performed on the iceman himself and on human coprolites.

TI  == antibiotic therapy attenuates colitis in interleukin 10 gene-deficient mice.
AB  == background & aims: interleukin (il)-10 gene-deficient mice, raised under germfree conditions, do not develop colitis, implying a role for bacteria. this study mapped the appearance of luminal colonic bacteria and, using antibiotic treatment, determined their association with colitis in il-10 gene-deficient mice. methods: mice were treated with ciprofloxacin or with neomycin and metronidazole. the intestine was harvested for histological scoring and bacterial assessment. results: at 2 weeks of age, before the development of colitis, il-10  gene-deficient mice demonstrated an earlier appearance of streptococcus and clostridium sp., and had a greater proportion (p < 0.01) of bacteria adherent to  the colonic mucosa. this pattern of increased adherent bacteria persisted for the 12 weeks of study. treatment of mice before the onset of colonic inflammation, with either antibiotic regime, reduced mucosal adherent bacteria and prevented colitis (p < 0.01). in contrast, treatment of established colitis with neomycin and metronidazole did not reduce adherent bacterial levels, yet was more efficacious (p < 0.05) in treating established colitis than ciprofloxacin, which  did reduce adherent colonic bacteria. conclusions: in the il-10 gene-deficient mouse model, the appearance and number of mucosal adherent colonic bacteria are altered before the onset of colitis. antibiotics both prevent and treat the colitis through correction of this primary bacterial alteration.

TI  == dyadobacter fermentans gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel gram-negative bacterium isolated from surface-sterilized zea mays stems.
AB  == a gram-negative bacterium, designated ns114t, was isolated from duplicate treatments of surface-sterilized zea mays stems. the plants were grown in synthetic soil under greenhouse conditions and watered with fertilizer containing no nitrogen. strain ns114t could not be isolated from plants watered with the standard level or 20% (w/v) of the standard level of nitrogen. cells occurred as  pairs in young cultures that attached to form angled arrangements in r2a broth and occasionally formed rounded, horseshoe arrangements in ym broth. cell variation resulted in flocculent chains of coccoid cells in old cultures. strain  ns114t fermented glucose and sucrose. the g + c content was 48 mol%. phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rrna gene showed that the strain was a member of the domain bacteria and branched from a point equidistant from an aquatic organism, runella  slithyformis and a marine isolate, 'microscilla furvescens'. phenotypic and genotypic analyses indicated that strain ns114t could not be assigned to any recognized genus; therefore a new genus and species, dyadobacter fermentans gen.  nov., sp. nov., is proposed, for which ns114t is the type strain.

TI  == the role of probiotic cultures in the control of gastrointestinal health.
AB  == the use of probiotics to enhance intestinal health has been proposed for many years. probiotics are traditionally defined as viable microorganisms that have a  beneficial effect in the prevention and treatment of specific pathologic conditions when they are ingested. there is a relatively large volume of literature that supports the use of probiotics to prevent or treat intestinal disorders. however, the scientific basis of probiotic use has been firmly established only recently, and sound clinical studies have begun to be published. currently, the best-studied probiotics are the lactic acid bacteria, particularly lactobacillus sp. and bifidobacterium sp. however, other organisms used as probiotics in humans include escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., enterococcus sp., bacteroides sp., bacillus sp., propionibacterium sp. and various fungi. some probiotic preparations contain mixtures of more than one bacterial strain. probiotics have been examined for their effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of a diverse spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea (including clostridium difficile-associated intestinal disease), infectious bacterial and viral diarrhea (including diarrhea  caused by rotavirus, shigella, salmonella, enterotoxigenic e. coli, vibrio cholerae and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency disorder, enteral feeding diarrhea, helicobacter pylori gastroenteritis, sucrase maltase deficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and lactose intolerance. probiotics have been found to inhibit intestinal bacterial enzymes involved in the synthesis of colonic carcinogens. there are many mechanisms by which probiotics enhance intestinal health, including stimulation of immunity, competition for limited nutrients, inhibition of epithelial and mucosal adherence, inhibition of epithelial invasion and production of antimicrobial substances. probiotics represent an exciting prophylactic and therapeutic advance, although additional investigations must be  undertaken before their role in intestinal health can be delineated clearly.

TI  == isolation and properties of a cellulosome-type multienzyme complex of the thermophilic bacteroides sp. strain p-1.
AB  == the extracellular form of cellulosome-type multienzyme complex of thermophilic bacteroides sp. strain p-1 which was isolated from the anaerobic digester, is described. multienzyme complex was isolated from the culture supernatant by an adsorption-desorption affinity chromatography on microcrystalline cellulose. the  isolated multienzyme complex was found to form a complex that exhibited a high molecular weight (estimated at more than 1400 kda) and was quite stable, requiring strong denaturing condition for dissociation. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate resolved multienzyme complex into at least 12 subunits with the molecular weight range of 49 to 209 kda, respectively. the isolated multienzyme complex showed cellulose-binding ability, cellulase and xylanase activities and effected the hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose and lignocellulosic materials in the form of corncob, corn  hull, rice straw, and sugarcane bagasse.

TI  == the effect of scaling and root planing on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases: 12-month results.
AB  == background/aims: previously, we reported that srp resulted in a decrease in mean  pocket depth and attachment level and reduced prevalence and levels of bacteroidesforsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola at 3 and  6 months post-srp in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis. 32 of the 57 subjects  were monitored at 9 and 12 months. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the microbial and clinical effects of srp in 32 (mean age 48+/-11) subjects over a 12-month period. method: clinical assessments of plaque, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth and attachment level were made prior to srp and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-therapy. subgingival plaque samples were taken at each visit and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique for the presence and levels of 40 subgingival species. each subject also received maintenance scaling at each of the subsequent monitoring visits. differences in clinical parameters and prevalence and levels of bacterial species were analyzed pre- and post-therapy using the wilcoxon signed ranks test. the quade test for related samples was used for analysis of multiple visits. results: mean pocket depth (mm+/-sem) decreased  from 3.2+/-0.3 at baseline to 2.9+/-0.3 at 12 months (p<0.01). mean attachment level showed significant reduction at 6 months, but did not diminish further. bleeding on probing and plaque were significantly reduced at 12 months (p<0.001,  p<0.05, respectively). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola decreased in  prevalence and levels up to the 6-month visit and remained at these lower levels  at 9 and 12 months. significant increases in levels and prevalence were noted at  12 months for actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum ss polymorphum, streptococcus mitis, capnocytophaga sp, and veillonella parvula. conclusions: the data suggest that the maintenance phase of therapy may be essential in consolidating clinical and microbiological improvements achieved as a result of initial therapy.

TI  == [trovafloxacin in gynecology].
AB  == presence of microorganisms in the female lower genital tract (lgt) in concentrations that modify the established normal equilibrium produce different symptoms that make necessary to consult the gynecologist. it is currently accepted that infections of the lgt are due to microorganisms that are normally integrating the internal flora, except for the erroneously called "sexually transmitted diseases" that are caused by external microorganisms. this means that all those microorganisms usually present without causing any disease manifestations may, under certain circumstances and determined concentrations, originate or be associated to infections. lactobacillus sp. and corynebacterium sp. are normally the most frequent microorganisms in the vagina together with streptococcus (aerobe), streptococcus agalactiae and others like enterococcus, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides sp., bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, pseudomonas, klebsiella, fusobacterium, escherichia coli. different antibiotic schemes are proposed for different infections (bacterial vaginosis, gonococcia, chlamydial infections, pelvic inflammatory disease). they  are discussed in different sections. trovafloxacin has shown to be effective in the treatment of infections due to chlamydia with excellent clinical results and  a good tolerance. it was effective as single dose therapy in the treatment of acute gonococcia with therapeutic success in 99% of the treated patients. new fluoroquinolones are also effective in the treatment of infections due to aerobial pathogens. the use of trovafloxacin in the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease would present great advantages: on one hand, it would cover  the wide spectrum of microorganisms responsible for the infection and, on the other, would permit an early switch to oral therapy once the acute phase is over.

TI  == description of cellulophaga baltica gen. nov., sp. nov. and cellulophaga fucicola gen. nov., sp. nov. and reclassification of [cytophaga] lytica to cellulophaga lytica gen. nov., comb. nov.
AB  == phenotypic data indicate that gliding, yellow/orange-pigmented, agar-digesting bacterial strains were members of the cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides (cfb)  group. the strains were isolated from the surface of the marine benthic macroalga fucus serratus l. and the surrounding seawater at three localities in danish waters. the bacteria were gram-negative, flexirubin-negative, aerobic, catalase-positive and oxidase-negative and were psychrophilic and halophilic. all strains utilized d-fructose, l-fucose and alpha-ketobutyric acid and degraded alginic acid, carrageenan, starch and autoclaved yeast cells. amplification with  primers specific for repetitive extragenic palindromic elements by pcr divided the strains of this study into two groups. both groups showed unique pcr amplification patterns compared to reference strains of the cfb group. phylogenetic analysis of 16s rdna sequences showed association of these organisms and [cytophaga] lytica at the genus level. hybridization of total chromosomal dna revealed that the new strains and [cytophaga] lytica atcc 23178t were clearly distinct from each other and other previously described species of the cfb group. a new genus is described, cellulophaga gen. nov. comprising two new species, cellulophaga baltica gen. nov., sp. nov. (nn015840t = lmg 18535t) and cellulophaga fucicola gen. nov., sp. nov. (nn015860t = lmg 18536t), as well as the emendation of [cytophaga] lytica to cellulophaga lytica gen. nov., comb. nov.

AB  == since other viruses can influence expression of human papillomavirus (hpv) 16 e6-e7 genes in vitro, this study addressed whether specific vaginal bacteria do so as well. the vaginal microflora of 18 women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin) or normal histology and hpv 16 infection, was evaluated by quantitative culture. expression of hpv 16 e6-e7 oncogenes was assessed in exfoliated cervical cells by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. hpv 16 expression was also quantitated in caski carcinoma cell line cocultured with bacteroides fragilis or lactobacillus acidophilus. isolation of lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.05) and expression of the e6*ii transcript (p = 0.03) were associated with low-grade cin or normal histology. however, changes in e6-e7 expression were not  associated independently with isolation of a specific microorganism. similarly, expression of hpv 16 e6-e7 oncogenes in vitro was unaltered in the presence of bacteria. these results suggest that vaginal microorganisms are unlikely to alter the natural history of hpv-associated cin by influencing hpv oncogene expression.

TI  == bacterial filament formation, a defense mechanism against flagellate grazing, is  growth rate controlled in bacteria of different phyla.
AB  == a facultatively filamentous bacterium was isolated from eutrophic lake water and  was identified as flectobacillus sp. strain mwh38 (a member of the cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides phylum) by comparative 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. filament formation by flectobacillus sp. strain mwh38 and filament formation by flectobacillus major, the closest known relative of strain  mwh38, were studied in chemostat cultures under grazing pressure by the bacterivorous flagellate ochromonas sp. strain ds and without predation at several growth rates. the results clearly demonstrated that filament formation by the two flectobacilli is growth rate controlled and thus independent of the presence of a predator. however, flagellate grazing positively influenced bacterial growth rates by decreasing bacterial biomass and thus indirectly stimulated filament formation. the results of investigations of cell elongation and filament formation by comamonas acidovorans px54 (a member of the beta subclass of the class proteobacteria) supported the recent proposal that in this  species the mechanism of filament formation is growth rate controlled. the finding that the grazing defense mechanism consisting of filament formation is growth rate controlled in the flectobacilli investigated and c. acidovorans px54  (i.e., in bacteria belonging to divergent evolutionary phyla) may indicate that this mechanism is a phylogenetically widely distributed defense strategy against  grazing.

TI  == hymenobacter roseosalivarius gen. nov., sp. nov. from continental antartica soils and sandstone: bacteria of the cytophaga/flavobacterium/bacteroides line of phylogenetic descent.
AB  == aseptically collected sandstone and soil samples from the antarctic dry valleys were inoculated into oligotrophic media and incubated under low light intensities. a total of 41 gram-negative isolates were obtained with reddish colonies spreading on agar. a sandstone isolate and four soil strains were characterized further. they were nearly identical in morphological, physiological, biochemical and chemotaxonomic properties. they produced large amounts of extracellular polymer and utilized for growth: glucose, saccharose, mannitol, sorbitol, l-aspartate, malate and acetate, but not d-ribose, adonitol,  dl-alanine, glutamate, glycolate, lactate or succinate. all strains hydrolyzed gelatin, starch, casein, xylan, tweens 80 or 60 and dead or living yeast cells, but not cellulose or pectin. nitrate was not reduced, ethanol was not oxidized and acid was not produced from maltose, mannitol or dulcitol. ammonia was not produced from peptone. they were strictly aerobic. major fatty acids were n 16:1  d 9, n 16:1 d 11, n 17:1 d 11, and i 15:0. the strains contained the quinone mk-7 and phosphatidylethanolamine as the main phospholipid. the base ratio ranged from 55 to 61 mol% g+c. a 16s rrna sequence analysis of strains aa-688 and aa-718 showed these to be identical and to represent a special phylogenetic group within the cytophaga/flavobacterium/bacteroides major line of descent. three soil strains labeled "taxeobacter" txc1, txg1, and txo1 (reichenbach, 1992) belonged to the same group but had lower sequence similarities (<95%). some of their characteristics were different from those of the antarctic strains: the utilization of c-compounds, hydrolysis of polymers, temperature tolerances, major fatty acids and base ratios. txc1 and txg1 may later have to be considered as members of this group, possibly on the species level, while txo1 could represent  a different related genus. it is concluded that the five antarctic strains represent a new genus and species for which the name of hymenobacter roseosalivarius is proposed. the type strain is aa-718t (dsm 11622t).

TI  == a rat model of ileal pouch-rectal anastomosis.
AB  == after colectomy and ileal pouch-rectal anastomosis, pouchitis may occur. pouchitis is a poorly defined condition with unknown etiology. the aim of this study was to develop an animal model of pouchitis. ileal pouch-rectal anastomosis was created in lewis and sprague-dawley rats. rats were studied 4 and 8 weeks after surgery, and pouchitis was assessed by stool output, histology, and tissue  myeloperoxidase (mpo) levels. some rats were treated with allopurinol or metronidazole beginning the day of surgery. rats with pouches demonstrated inflammation with a monocytic infiltration, luminal exudate, mucosal ulcerations, and serosal inflammation. rats with pouches had increased anaerobic bacterial flora compared with normal ileum. after creation of pouches, lewis rats (histology score = 8.4 +/- 1.6; mpo = 17.3 +/- 3.6, mean +/- sd) developed more severe inflammation than sprague-dawley rats did (histology score = 4.3 +/- 1.8;  mpo = 5.5 +/- 3.6) within 4 weeks, p < 0.001 and 8 weeks after surgery, p < 0.05. stool output was also greater in lewis (55 +/- 7 g/kg/day) compared with sprague-dawley rats with pouches (43 +/- 5 g/kg/day), p < 0.05. metronidazole treatment reduced histology score (6.0 +/- 0.5) p < 0.05 and mpo (5.9 +/- 1.6) p  < 0.001 in rats with pouches compared with rats with pouches that had no treatment. allopurinol treatment in rats with pouches reduced histology score (4.0 +/- 1.7) and mpo (3.9 +/- 1.6), p < 0.001, compared with rats with pouches that had no treatment. ileal pouch-rectal anastomosis in rats induced inflammation within 4 weeks, demonstrated differential host genetic susceptibility, and was associated with increased number of pouch bacteria. anaerobes, especially bacteroides sp. and free radical, may mediate inflammation. ileal pouch-rectal anastomosis surgery in rats may be a useful animal model for the study pouchitis.

AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum igg antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based  on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. on average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. differences  in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). the data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting  for multiple comparisons). serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel neisseria sp., enterococcus faecalis, prevotella loescheii and prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. high levels of serum antibody to a microbacterium lacticum-like organism, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus constellatus, actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.

TI  == cloning of an ef-p homologue from bacteroides fragilis that increases b. fragilis glutamine synthetase activity in escherichia coli.
AB  == investigations of possible regulators of bacteroides fragilis glutamine synthetase (gs) activity were done in escherichia coli using a compatible dual-plasmid system. the b. fragilis glna gene, together with upstream and downstream flanking regions, was cloned onto the low copy number plasmid pacyc184 and expressed in the e. coli glna ntrb ntrc deletion strain, ymc11. gs activity was monitored following co-transformation with a b. fragilis genomic library carried on the compatible plasmid pecor251. a gene was cloned that caused a twofold increase in b. fragilis gs activity but did not affect the activity of the e. coli gs enzyme or the b. fragilis sucrase (scrl). deletion of the b. fragilis glna downstream region decreased basal levels of gs activity, but did not affect the ability of the cloned gene to increase the b. fragilis gs activity. reporter gene analysis, using the b. fragilis glna promoter region fused to the promoterless clostridium acetobutylicum endoglucanase gene, showed no increase in reporter gene activity. this demonstrated that the increase in gs  activity was not regulated at the transcriptional level, and that the cloned gene product was not affecting the copy number of the plasmid in trans. sequence data  indicated that the cloned gene had good amino acid identity to a range of elongation factor p (ef-p) proteins, the highest being to that of a synechocystis sp (48%), and the least to mycobacterium genitalium (27%). amino acid identity to the e. coli ef-p was intermediate (37%). a possible role for ef-p in enhancing translation of the b. fragilis glna mrna is proposed.

AB  == a group of sea-ice-derived psychrophilic bacterial strains possessing the unusual ability to synthesize the polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 omega 3) and arachidonic acid (20:4 omega 6) belong to the family flavobacteriaceae (flexibacter-bacteroides-flavobacterium phylum), according to 16s rrna sequence analysis. surprisingly, the isolates were also found to cluster closely to the moderately halophilic and psychrotrophic species [flavobacterium]  gondwanense (sequence similarity 97.8-98.1%). the whole-cell fatty acid profiles  of this group and [flavobacterium] gondwanense were very similar and distinct from other related flavobacteria. the sea ice strains and [flavobacterium] gondwanense differed substantially in terms of ecophysiology, possibly representing divergent adaptations to sympagic and planktonic marine habitats, respectively. evidence based on phylogeny and fatty acid profiles supports the conclusion that the taxa are close relatives distinct from other bacterial groups. it is thus proposed that the sea ice strains represent a novel taxon designated psychroflexus torquis gen. nov., sp. nov. (type strain acam 623t) while [flavobacterium] gondwanense becomes psychroflexus gondwanense gen. nov., comb. nov.

AB  == the activities of hmr 3004 and hmr 3647 and comparator agents, especially macrolides, were determined by the agar dilution method against 262 aerobic and 120 anaerobic strains isolated from skin and soft tissue infections associated with human and animal bite wounds. hmr 3004 and hmr 3647 were active against almost all aerobic and fastidious facultative isolates (mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [mic90], < or = 0.5 and 1 microg/ml, respectively) and against all anaerobes [bacteroides tectum, porphyromonas macacae (salivosa), prevotella heparinolytica, porphyromonas sp., prevotella sp., and peptostreptococci] at < or = 0.25 and < or = 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, except  fusobacterium nucleatum (hmr 3004, mic90 = 16 microg/ml; hmr 3647, mic90 = 8 microg/ml) and other fusobacterium species (mic90, 1 and 2 microg/ml, respectively). in general, hmr 3004 and hmr 3647 were more active than any of the macrolides tested. azithromycin was more active than clarithromycin against all pasteurella species, including pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida, eikenella  corrodens, and fusobacterium species, while clarithromycin was more active than azithromycin against corynebacterium species, weeksella zoohelcum, b. tectum, and p. heparinolytica.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of otorrhea associated with tympanostomy tubes in children.
AB  == the microbiology of in 55 ear aspirates obtained from 34 children with chronic otorrhea was studied. aspiration of the middle ear exudate was done immediately following removal of tympanostomy tube (tt). the middle ear aspirates and swab specimens of the external auditory canals were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. sixty-five isolates were recovered only from the middle ears, 73 only from the external ear canals, and 73 were present at both sites. analysis of the  138 middle ear isolates demonstrated the recovery of aerobic bacteria only in 28  patients (50%), anaerobes only in seven (13%), and both aerobes and anaerobes in  20 (36%). there were 77 aerobic and 61 anaerobic isolates. commonly recovered aerobes were pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 isolates), staphylococcus aureus (11), proteus sp. (7), moraxella catarrhalis (6), klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and non-typable haemophilus influenzae (5). commonly isolated anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp. (25 isolates), prevotella sp. (10), bacteroides sp. (8) and fusobacterium sp. (6). pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. aureus were more often isolated in children older then 6 years. these findings demonstrate the polymicrobial bacteriology of tt-related otorrhea in children. specimens collected from the external auditory canals can be misleading. reliable information can be obtained from the ear exudes when collected through the tt or  through the open perforation after their removal.

AB  == several psychrophilic, gas vacuolate strains of the cytophage-flavobacterium-bacteroides (cfb) phylogenetic group were isolated from  sea ice and water from the arctic and the antarctic. the closest taxonomically defined species by 16s rrna sequence analysis is 'flectobacillus glomeratus'. however, 'flc. glomeratus' is phylogenetically distant from the flectobacillus type species, flc. major. on the basis of phenotypic, genotypic and 16s rrna sequence analyses we propose a new genus, polaribacter, with three new species, polaribacter irgensii strain 23-p (atcc 700398), polaribacter franzmannii strain  301 (atcc 700399) and polaribacter filamentus strain 215 (atcc 700397). p. filamentus is the type species of the genus. none of these species exhibits a cosmopolitan or bipolar distribution. this is the first taxonomic description of  gas vacuolate bacteria in the cfb group. additionally, we propose that 'flc. glomeratus' be reclassified to the genus polaribacter as p. glomeratus, comb. nov.

AB  == the rectal anaerobic and aerobic bacterial flora of four species of flying foxes  were determined and compared. four bacterial species were found in > or = 1 individual from each bat species at a significant (> or = 10%) level of the bacterial population: alpha-hemolytic streptococcus sp. (41 of 56 bats), enterococcus sp. (25/56), escherichia coli (21/ 56), and group d streptococcus sp., not enterococcus sp. (9/56). five other microbial species were also found in all four flying fox species, but at less significant percentages (found in at least one bat species, > or = 5% and < or = 10% of the recovered microbial population). these were nonhemolytic streptococcus sp. (30/56), yeast (26/56), corynebacterium sp. (25/56), staphylococcus sp. (25/56), and staphylococcus aureus (22/56). the majority of the species found were gram-positive, and only two obligate anaerobes, a lactobacillus and a bacteroides sp., were recovered from one bat.

TI  == aerobic, anaerobic and fungal burn wound infections.
AB  == one hundred and twenty-seven patients were studied prospectively for aerobic, anaerobic and fungal burn wound infections. all cases yielded organisms on culture. a total of 377 isolates were recovered (239 aerobes, 116 anaerobes and 22 fungi). aerobic bacteria alone were present in 49 patients (38.6%). anaerobic  bacteria alone were present in four patients (3.2%). candida sp. alone was present in one patient (0.8%). mixed aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria and/or fungi were present in 73 patients (57.5%). fungi were isolated from 21 patients (23.9%) of 88 patients having fungal cultures. the predominant isolates recovered in descending order of frequency were: pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides sp., klebsiella sp. and peptostreptococcus sp. there were 70  patients (55.1%) infected with anaerobic bacteria. the rate of recovery of anaerobes was higher in patients with open wound dressing (72.7%) than in patients with occlusive wound dressings (41.7%), (p < 0.01). seventeen patients presented with septic shock, 15 of them (88.2%) yielding positive anaerobic cultures. bacteroides sp. were isolated from 14 patients with septic shock, and were recovered from the four patients who had anaerobic infection alone. these results indicate a significant role of bacteroides sp. in burn wound sepsis.

TI  == distribution and mobility of the tetracycline resistance determinant tetq.
AB  == we tested 34 american type culture collection (atcc) and 168 clinical bacterial isolates, from the human urogenital and oral tracts and streptococci isolated from cows with mastitis, for the presence of the tetq gene using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay and dna-dna hybridization. the identities of pcr products were confirmed by southern blot hybridization of whole-cell dna. eleven  of the atcc strains were positive for tetq, including five bacteroides spp., five prevotella spp. and a single isolate of mitsuokella multiacidus. twenty-eight (29%) of the 95 clinical gram-negative isolates carried the tetq gene, while eight (11%) of the 73 clinical gram-positive isolates carried the tetq gene. this is the first description of tetq in gram-positive species. all isolates except one peptostreptococcus sp. carried tetq integrated into the chromosome. the tetq  gene could be transferred from prevotella bivia, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides  fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus and bacteroides distasonis into an enterococcus faecalis recipient at frequencies of 10(-7)-10(-9) per recipient. in contrast, tetq failed to transfer from two isolates of prevotella intermedia, two isolates  of porphyromonas gingivalis, one isolate of mobiluncus curtisii and one isolate of peptostreptococcus sp. the latter two are gram-positive species. the pcr assay was used to screen 198 proteinase k-treated biopsies of prostate, periprostate and bladder from 84 men with prostatitis. thirty-four (40%) of the patients had one or more positive samples, suggesting that the pcr assay could be of value in  screening patient material directly for the presence of bacteria.

TI  == bacteriologic and therapeutic considerations in intra-abdominal surgical infections.
AB  == the most important factor in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections are early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention while antibiotics play a secondary role. the goals of surgical procedures should be to stop peritoneal contamination, to debride necrotic tissue, to remove debris and foreign bodies and to drain any pus collection. antibiotics should be initiated before surgery and they must encompass both colonic aerobes and anaerobes including bacteroides  fragilis group but not necessary enterococcus sp. antibacterial agents with pure  activity against anaerobes include chloramphenicol, clindamycin and the nitroimidazoles while ampicillin/sulbactam, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ticarcillin/clavulanate, cefoxitin, cefotetan, ceftizoxime imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem and some advanced quinolones like sparfloxacin, represent a single drug to cover both aerobic and anaerobic microflora. although almost all clinical trials usually result in a 90% efficacy rate, the final outcome is dependant on the stage of the infection (early versus late), sepsis score, underlying diseases and the applied surgical procedures. on the other hand the choice of antibiotic(s) must be influenced by its toxicity, profiles local nosocomial susceptibility patterns, resistance inducing ability and price.

TI  == the intestinal microflora during the first weeks of life.
AB  == bacterial colonization of the neonatal gastrointestinal tract begins during birth when the neonate comes into contact with the maternal cervical and vaginal flora. in infants delivered by caesarean section, bacteria colonizing the neonate gastrointestinal tract are provided by the environment. the first bacteria encountered in the majority of healthy infants, are facultative anaerobes, which  remain predominant during the first 2 weeks of life. among them, staphylococcus,  enterobacteriaceae and streptococcus were the genera most commonly isolated from  the newborn faecal flora at birth. facultative anaerobic bacteria are followed closely by bifidobacterium sp. clostridium perfringens is present within 2 days with an increase incidence in newborns delivered by a caesarean section. clostridium perfringens seems to be the precursor for installation of other anaerobic putrefactive bacteria, as bacteroides and other clostridium sp. the impact of caesarean section and the period and quality of hospitalization are mainly implicated in changes of the normal newborn flora. feeding seems to modulate the colonization pattern. in humans, breast milk plays a role in passive immunization of the neonatal intestine, and contains factors that promote the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum in the intestinal flora. formula feeding seems  to promote implantation and persistence of clostridium perfringens, and clearly enhances intestinal colonization of c. difficile in newborns.

TI  == phenotypic diversity among ruminal isolates of prevotella ruminicola: proposal of prevotella brevis sp. nov., prevotella bryantii sp. nov., and prevotella albensis sp. nov. and redefinition of prevotella ruminicola.
AB  == selected phenotypic characteristics of isolates of prevotella ruminicola (formerly bacteroides ruminicola) were studied in order to establish whether the  characteristics of genotypic strain groups established previously on the basis of 16s ribosomal dna sequences differed systematically. among strains formerly considered p. ruminicola subsp. brevis, strains related to strain ga33t (t = type strain) typically failed to produce carboxymethyl cellulase (cmcase) activity detectable by plate assays and failed to ferment xylose, while strains related to strain b14t produced abundant cmcase and fermented xylose. we propose that strains related to ga33t, which have dna g + c contents between 45 and 51 mol%, should be assigned to a new species, prevotella brevis, and that strains related  to b14t, which have dna g + c contents between 39 and 43 mol%, should be assigned to another new species, prevotella bryantii. most of the isolates formerly classified as p. ruminicola subsp. ruminicola strains produced cmcase and had dna g + c contents between 45 and 51 mol%, and we propose that these organisms should be placed in the redefined species p. ruminicola. a small group of isolates that  have lower g + c contents are assigned to another new species, prevotella albensis. most p. brevis and p. bryantii strains produced abundatn extracellular  dnase activity. proteinase activities (as determined by [14c]casein hydrolysis) varied widely between strains, and p. brevis strains exhibited the highest mean activity. all strains produced dipeptidyl peptidase activity, but the relative activities against different peptide substrates exhibited by p. bryantii, p. albensis, and p. brevis differed systematically. the phenotypic differences among the newly defined species suggest that they may occupy distinct niches within the rumen ecosystem.

TI  == development of techniques to genetically manipulate members of the genera cytophaga, flavobacterium, flexibacter, and sporocytophaga.
AB  == the bacteroides-cytophaga-flavobacterium branch of the eubacterial phylogenetic tree contains a diverse group of bacterial species. techniques for the genetic manipulation of bacteroides spp. are well developed (a. a. salyers, n. b. shoemaker, and e. p. guthrie, crit. rev. microbiol. 14:49-71, 1987). recently we  developed techniques to genetically manipulate the gliding bacterium cytophaga johnsonae (m. j. mcbride and m. j. kempf, j. bacteriol. 178:583-590, 1996). we now demonstrate that some of these techniques allow genetic manipulation of a number of environmentally or medically significant bacteria in this group. the bacteroides transposon tn4351 was introduced into cytophaga hutchinsonii, cytophaga succinicans, flavobacterium meningosepticum, flexibacter canadensis, flexibacter sp. strain fs1, and sporocytophaga myxococcoides by conjugation. tn4351 integrated itself into the host chromosomes and conferred erythromycin resistance. we isolated several auxotrophic mutants of flavobacterium meningosepticum following tn4351 mutagenesis. the c. johnsonae-escherichia coli shuttle vector pcp11 functioned in c. succinicans but not in the other bacteria.  plyl03 did not replicate in any of these bacteria and should function as a convenient suicide vector. the identification of a system of gene transfer, a selectable marker, a suicide vector, and a transposon that functions in these diverse bacteria allows genetic manipulations to be performed.

(19 isolates). patients were examined daily during therapy, 4-14  days and 4-6 weeks post-therapy. of the 60 patients, 43 were evaluable. the majority of patients had polymicrobial infections (36 patients). all the aerobic  isolates were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam while 19 were resistant to piperacillin alone. four of 43 clinically evaluable patients were considered a clinical failure and 3 of 40 bacteriologically evaluable patients were considered to have an unfavorable microbiological response. there were 2 clinically adverse  events considered related to the study drug and several possibly related, mild and transitory, abnormalities in eosinophil counts and liver function tests. based on the safety and efficacy results from this study, the advantages of using a single agent for the treatment of mixed infections of the peritoneal cavity and its potential activity against resistant organisms, we believe that further comparative clinical trials in children with intra-abdominal infections are warranted.

AB  == the post-partum intrauterine bacterial flora, prostaglandin release, uterine involution and resumption of ovarian activity were studied in 9 swedish dairy cows during the first 8-week period. uterine involution was monitored by transrectal examinations of the reproductive tract 3 times weekly. bacteriological examination was performed from twice weekly uterine biopsies. the main pgf2 alpha metabolite (15-ketodihydro-pgf2 alpha) was monitored from twice daily blood plasma samples, while morning samples were used for progesterone determinations. the cows were assigned to 2 groups: group i (n = 7) with an uncomplicated puerperal period and group ii (n = 2) with signs of intrauterine infections. a total of 143 biopsies were collected, of which 129 (90.2%) were found to be bacteriologically negative. thirteen (9.1%) of the remaining 14 biopsies were bacteriologically positive, while one (0.7%) was probably a contamination on a single occasion. the 13 bacteriologically positive biopsies belonged to the group ii cows from which 31 isolates contained 6 different genera of facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria. actinomyces pyogenes along with bacteroides sp. and fusobacterium necrophorum were found to predominate in a mixed flora. the bacteria were rapidly eliminated and disappeared completely from the uteri towards the end of the third week post-partum. the average number of days required for completion of uterine involution was 21.8 +/- 3.0 for all animals. the plasma levels of the pgf2 alpha metabolite were significantly elevated for the first 12-18, and 18 and 27 days in group i and group ii, respectively. there was no significant relationship between the duration of pgf2  alpha release and the time required for completion of uterine involution (p > 0.05). progesterone analysis showed resumption of ovarian activity and subsequent ovulation in 4 of the 9 cows 44-55 days post-partum. thus, intrauterine infections are not commonly seen in cows with normal calving and comparison between the duration of pgf2 alpha release and the time required for completion of uterine involution showed insignificant correlation. however, the longer duration of pgf2 alpha release recorded in the 2 cows with intrauterine infections are related to the increased frequency of infections.

AB  == whole genomic and randomly-cloned dna probes for two fastidious periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus were labeled with digoxigenin and detected by a colorimetric method. the specificity and sensitivity of the whole genomic and cloned probes were compared. the cloned probes were highly specific compared to the whole genomic probes. a significant degree of cross-reactivity with bacteroides species, capnocytophaga sp. and prevotella sp. was observed with the whole genomic probes. the cloned probes were less sensitive than the whole genomic probes and required at least 10(6) target cells or a minimum of 10 ng of target dna to be detected during hybridization. although a ten-fold increase in sensitivity was obtained with the whole genomic probes, cross-hybridization to closely related species limits their reliability in identifying target bacteria in subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == sutterella wadsworthensis gen. nov., sp. nov., bile-resistant microaerophilic campylobacter gracilis-like clinical isolates.
AB  == campylobacter gracilis (formerly bacteroides gracilis) is an asaccharolytic, nitrate-positive, urease-negative organism that requires formate and fumarate or  hydrogen as a growth additive and may pit agar media. clinical isolates that were obtained primarily from appendiceal and peritoneal fluid specimens and initially  were identified in our laboratory as b. gracilis were later found to include "unusual" strains that could be distinguished by biochemical and genetic criteria. these unusual c. gracilis strains were bile resistant, could not reduce tetrazolium chloride under aerobic conditions if formate and fumarate were added  to the medium, and could grow in the presence of 2 or 6% oxygen if no blood was added to the medium. c. gracilis, other campylobacters, and the unusual strains produced distinctive dehydrogenase patterns when gels were incubated anaerobically. a cellular fatty acid analysis revealed that the cluster formed by the unusual organisms was distinct from the (separate) clusters formed by c. gracilis, bacteroides ureolyticus, and other campylobacter species. 16s rrna sequence data indicated that these organisms are not related phylogenetically to  either c. gracilis or other campylobacter species; the most closely related taxa  as determined by rrna sequence analysis were unrelated aerobes (members of the genera bordetella, alcaligenes, rhodocyclus, and comamonas). dna homology data confirmed that these taxa are separate groups. our data indicate that the unusual organisms are members of a new genus and new species, for which we propose the name sutterella wadsworthensis. the type strain of s. wadsworthensis is strain wal 9799 (= atcc 51579).

TI  == quantitative bacteriology of tonsils removed from children with tonsillitis hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis with and without hypertrophy.
AB  == the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species and their numbers were studied in tonsillar specimens from children who had undergone elective tonsillectomy: 6 patients with recurrent tonsillitis (rt), 9 with recurrent tonsillitis with hypertrophy (rth), and 8 with obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy (oth). mixed flora were present in all tonsils, yielding an average of 6.7 isolates (5.6 aerobic or facultative and 1.1 anaerobic bacteria). the highest recovery rate of  organisms per tonsil was in patients with oth (7.7 per tonsil), compared to 6.3 per tonsil in rt and 5.9 per tonsil in rth. the predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were haemophilus influenzae (22 isolates), neisseria sp (16), staphylococcus aureus (14), and eikenella corrodens (14), and the predominant anaerobic bacteria were fusobacterium sp (8), bacteroides sp (7), and prevotella melaninogenica (5). the number of bacteria per gram of tonsillar tissue varied between 10(4) and 10(8). a higher concentration of s aureus and h influenzae was found in hypertrophic tonsils (rth and oth) as compared to rt. these findings suggest the presence of an increased bacterial load and supports an etiologic role for h influenzae and s aureus in hypertrophic tonsils with and  without inflammation (rth and oth). further studies to elucidate the effect of selective antimicrobial therapy directed at these organisms may offer an alternative management of hypertrophic tonsils.

AB  == this review of 299 cases of breast abscesses seen over a 10-year period (1981-1990) at the university of calabar teaching hospital in nigeria seeks to establish the current status of breast abscesses in the tropics. lactational breast abscess constitutes 95% of breast abscesses while non-lactational breast abscess constitutes only 5% in this review. the commonest pathogen cultured from  lactational breast abscess is staphylococcus aureus and the disease responds to incision and drainage and systemic antibiotics, while non-lactational breast abscess is caused mostly by anaerobic organisms, usually with underlying mammary  duct ectasia. the low incidence of non-lactational breast abscess corresponds to  the low incidence of cigarette smoking and mammary duct ectasia in nigerian women. while the high incidence of lactational breast abscess corresponds to the  high rate of breast feeding and low level of personal hygiene in the low income group nigerian women in which the disease is commonest. economic recession has also reduced patronage of artificial feeds thus intensifying breast feeding and consequent lactational breast abscess.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis: drugs versus alternative treatment.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is one of the most common infectious disorders affecting women. it is caused by several microorganisms, including gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides, beta-streptococci and mobiluncus/falcivibrio sp. bacterial vaginosis is thought to occur as a result of a change in vaginal ph mediated by the metabolic activity of anaerobic bacteria. this rise in vaginal ph interferes with the activity of vaginal lactobacilli which maintain vaginal acidity. several types of antibiotics have been used to treat this condition. although metronidazole was found to be the most effective, none was completely successful  in either cure or prevention. several attempts have recently been made to treat bacterial vaginosis using physiological or 'natural' substances, such as lactate  gel and commercial yoghurt, which is acidic and also contains lactobacillus strains. this kind of treatment looks promising and may have a place in certain clinical conditions, including pregnancy, in cases of recurrent inflammation, or  as a prophylactic treatment before invasive gynecological procedures or abdominal surgery in patients known to be affected. this issue should be additionally studied and evaluated in light of the relatively little experience with this modality of treatment for bacterial vaginosis.

(strictly anaerobic bacterial strains) and enterococcus faecalis, (2) a whole human faecal flora, was studied.  in both cases, no gene transfer was observed to strictly anaerobic bacterial strains. dna transfer was only observed to the e. faecalis strain: in vivo cmr e. faecalis transconjugants were isolated from sequentially multi-associated mice and when the recipient strains associated with the mice, they were a defined mixture of bacteroides sp., bifidobacterium sp., peptostreptococcus sp. and e. faecalis strains. when mice were associated with the whole human faecal flora, the plasmid pil205 was transferred into some facultative anaerobic streptococci.  it was also shown that dna transfer occurred even when the lactococcal donor strain was transient in the dt of the gnotobiotic host animals.

AB  == a new glutamine synthetase gene, glnn, which encodes a polypeptide of 724 amino acid residues (m(r), 79,416), has been identified in the unicellular cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. strain pcc 6803; this is the second gene that encodes a glutamine synthetase (gs) in this cyanobacterium. the functionality of  this gene was evidenced by its ability to complement an escherichia coli glna mutant and to support synechocystis growth in a strain whose glna gene was inactivated by insertional mutagenesis. in this mutant (strain sjcr3), as well as in the wild-type strain, the second gs activity was subject to regulation by the  nitrogen source, being strongly enhanced in nitrogen-free medium. transcriptional fusion of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene with the 5'-upstream region of glnn suggested that synthesis of the second synechocystis gs is regulated at the transcriptional level. furthermore, the level of glnn mrna, a transcript of about 2,300 bases, was found to be strongly increased in nitrogen-free medium. the glnn product is similar to the gs subunits of bacteroides fragilis and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, two obligate anaerobic bacteria whose gss are markedly different from other prokaryotic and eukaryotic gss. however, significant similarity is evident in the five regions which are homologous in all of the gss so far described. the new gs gene was also found in  other cyanobacteria but not in n2-fixing filamentous species.

TI  == piperacillin and tazobactam versus clindamycin and gentamicin in the treatment of hospitalized women with pelvic infection. the piperacillin/tazobactam study group.
AB  == objective: to compare the efficacy and safety of a combination of piperacillin and tazobactam with that of clindamycin and gentamicin in the treatment of hospitalized women with infections of the upper genital tract. methods: this was  a randomized open-label trial in hospitalized women with infections of the upper  genital tract. patients were recruited at 12 hospitals in the united states and two hospitals in canada and were randomly assigned to one of two regimens in a 2:1 ratio. one group received piperacillin, 3 g every 6 hours, and tazobactam, 375 mg every 6 hours; the other group received clindamycin, 900 mg every 8 hours, and gentamicin, 2.5-5.0 mg/kg/day in three divided doses. therapy with the assigned regimen was to be administered for a minimum of 3 days. cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained from the site of infection before initiation of therapy. cultures for chlamydia trachomatis were also obtained from patients with endometritis or pelvic inflammatory disease. subjects were evaluated for clinical and bacteriologic response at 24-72 hours and 2-4 weeks after completing therapy. results: two hundred ninety-nine patients were enrolled; 196 were in the piperacillin-tazobactam group and 103 were in the clindamycin-gentamicin group. the most common diagnoses were endometritis (146) and pelvic inflammatory disease (115). the most common microorganisms recovered included: peptostreptococcus sp (99), prevotella sp (87), black pigmented bacteroides (29), b fragilis (11), enterococci (64), group b streptococcus (26),  escherichia coli (31), neisseria gonorrhoeae (49), and c trachomatis (19). a favorable clinical response occurred in 84.7% (166 of 196) of piperacillin-tazobactam patients and 87.3% (90 of 103) of clindamycin-gentamicin  patients. among those evaluable for bacteriologic response, 78% (67 of 86) and 82% (23 of 28), respectively, had a favorable response. diarrhea occurred significantly more frequently in the piperacillin-tazobactam group (9.7 versus 2.9%; p = .04), but the majority of episodes were mild to moderate. none of the adverse experiences in either treatment group were considered life-threatening and drug-related. conclusion: the combination of piperacillin and tazobactam is an effective and well-tolerated antibiotic regimen for the treatment of infections of the upper genital tract in women.

TI  == ornithobacterium rhinotracheale gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from the avian respiratory tract.
AB  == the phylogenetic position and various genotypic, chemotaxonomic, and classical phenotypic characteristics of 21 gram-negative avian isolates were studied. these strains constitute a genotypically homogeneous taxon in rrna superfamily v, as shown by dna-rrna hybridization data. determination of the 16s rrna sequence of this taxon revealed its detailed position within the "flavobacter" subgroup of the "flavobacter-bacteroides" phylum as described by gherna and woese (r. gherna  and c. r. woese, syst. appl. microbiol. 15:513-521, 1992). this new taxon is only distantly related to other members of the "flavobacter-bacteroides" phylum and is therefore given separate generic status. the dna-dna binding values for members of this taxon, for which we propose the name ornithobacterium rhinotracheale, confirmed that all of the strains are highly interrelated (dna-dna binding values greater than 90% were measured). the g+c contents of members of this taxon are between 37 and 39 mol%. an analysis of the cellular proteins and fatty acids and  classical phenotypic characteristics allowed us to distinguish o. rhinotracheale  from phenotypically similar taxa, such as riemerella anatipestifer and capnocytophaga species. the respiratory quinone content (menaquinone 7) and carbohydrate pattern of o. rhinotracheale conform with the respiratory quinone contents and carbohydrate patterns of other members of rrna superfamily v.

TI  == the role of encapsulated anaerobic bacteria in synergistic infections.
AB  == the effect of encapsulation on the virulence, survival, and protection of anaerobic bacteria from phagocytosis is reviewed. support for the importance of encapsulated gram-negative anaerobic rods (bacteroides sp., prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp.), anaerobic and facultative gram-positive cocci (afgpc) was provided by their higher recovery rate in oropharyngeal infections, abscesses and blood, compared to their number in the normal flora. the pathogenicity of bacteroides, fusobacterium, clostridium, and afgpc was studied by inoculating them into mice and observing their ability to induce subcutaneous abscesses. encapsulated bacteroides, fusobacteria, and afgpc generally induced abscesses, whereas non-encapsulated organisms did not. however, many of the strains that had only a minimal number of encapsulated organisms (< 1%) survived in the abscesses, and they became heavily encapsulated when inoculated with other viable or non-viable encapsulated bacteria. thereafter, these strains were able to induce abscesses when injected alone. encapsulated gram-negative anaerobic rods and afgpc-induced bacteraemia and translocation, and increased the mortality of the infected animals more often than did the non-encapsulated form of the same strains. as determined by using selective antimicrobial therapy and quantitative  cultures of abscesses induced in mice, possession of a capsule generally made gram-negative anaerobic rods more important than their aerobic counterparts. synergistic potentials were seen between encapsulated gram-negative anaerobic rods and all tested aerobic bacteria and most afgpc, and also between most afgpc  and pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus. these studies demonstrated the importance of encapsulated anaerobes in mixed infections.

TI  == effect of different combinations of antibiotics on experimental septic peritonitis in rabbits.
AB  == this study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of experimental septic peritonitis. two hundred rabbits, divided into ten groups of 20 rabbits each, were used. septic peritonitis was provoked in two stages: treatment of animals by mechanical lavage or antibiotics was performed during the first stage; blood cultures, isolation and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the peritoneal cavity were performed during the second stage. the parameters assessed were survival and, in the second phase, the formation of peritoneal abscesses. the most significant finding was noted in the first phase, where diffuse peritonitis took  place, with a very high mortality rate due to bacteremia and sepsis. in both blood and pus from the peritoneal cavity cultures in all groups, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis (among the aerobes) and bacteroides fragilis, clostridium sp. and peptostreptococcus sp. (among anaerobes) were the predominant pathogens identified. high mortality rates appeared to be due to the aerobic microbes, particularly escherichia coli, whereas abscess formation was related to the anaerobes, particularly bacteroides  fragilis. all antibiotics tested were effective, whether alone or in combination. metronidazole, however, was the most effective in the reduction of intraabdominal abscesses. the lowest mortality rate was observed in animals injected with piperacillin and a combination of cefoxitin and an aminoglycoside with metronidazole. finally, good peritoneal lavage seemed to be as effective as any combination of antibiotic treatment.

TI  == [bite wound infections: study of 22 hospitalized patients].
AB  == background: to study the characteristics of bite wounds with unfavorable evolution, developing infectious complications that requires hospital admission.  methods: the data from 22 patients admitted to the ciudad sanitaria vall d'hebron hospital for the above mentioned reason over the last 5 years were reviewed. results: the patients (8 males, 8 females and 6 children) were bitten by 10 dogs, 6 cats, and 6 men with predominance of the wound site being in the upper limb (10) followed by the lower limbs (6), head or face (5) and exceptionally on the breast (1). the most frequent clinical manifestation was abscess and/or cellulitis (13) and adenopathies or lymphangitis (4); 5 patients presented osteoarticular involvement including 3 bone fractures due to human aggression. with regard to the etiology of infection, the common bucal flora bacteria were isolated in all the cases; pasteurella multocida in 15/16 animal bites, eikenella corrodens associated to streptococcus in 5/6 human bites, fusobacterium spp. (5), bacteroides spp. (3) and peptococcus sp. (1). the most frequently administered antibiotics were gentamycin (15), penicillin (13), cloxacillin (5) and clindamycin (4). the evolution was favorable, although slow in many cases, with sequelae in 3 patients. conclusions: it is very difficult to foresee in which cases infectious complications will develop in bite wounds. according to the authors' experience, in the case of deep wounds the bacteria implied come from the mouth of the aggressor. careful cleansing, rapid administration of an adequate antibiotic and clinical control being the most recommendable procedure.

AB  == to study increase of the salmonella population in the cecum of chickens infected  with eimeria tenella, quantitative changes in mannose residues on the cecal mucosa were investigated. inhibition of s typhimurium adherence to the cecum by a 2% carbohydrate (d-mannose, d-galactose, l-fucose, alpha-methyl-d-glucoside) in phosphate-buffered saline solution was examined. only d-mannose had inhibitory effects. whereas, d-galactose had somewhat enhancing effects on adherence of s typhimurium to the cecal mucosa of uninfected germ-free chickens. in infected and uninfected chickens, d-mannose inhibited adherence of s typhimurium. d-mannose significantly (p < 0.05) increased adherence of bacteroides sp. in infected and uninfected chickens, d-mannose did not have any effect on adherence of clostridium perfringens and bifidobacterium thermophilum. under microscopic observation, only concanavalin a and lens culinaris agglutinin, of 8 lectins examined, were recognized as lectin-positive staining lines or spots in the cecal mucosa, indicating presence of mannose residues on the cecal mucosa. in e tenella-infected chickens, lectin-positive staining was seen strongly on the coarse surface of damaged cells and at the bottom of the crypts. these results indicate that coccidial infection may induce increase of mannose residues on the  intestinal surface and allow adhesion of more salmonellae to the intestine.

TI  == microbiology of cerebral abscess: a four-year study in malaysia.
AB  == a prospective study was carried out to determine the aetiology of cerebral abscess in relation to the primary source of infections. seventy-five patients with cerebral abscess were included in the study in the period january 1985 to december 1988. more than half of the patients studied had single lesions and the  overall most common sites were in the frontal and parietal regions. chronic suppurative otitis media, cyanotic congenital heart diseases and meningitis were  among the important predisposing conditions in these patients. approximately 25%  of the patients with cerebral abscesses had no documented antecedent infections.  pure cultures were found to be predominant (66.7%) and sterile cultures were obtained from 10 (13.3%) patients. streptococci were isolated from 23 (30.7%) patients, the commonest species being streptococcus milleri. proteus sp, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putrifaciens and bacteroides sp were almost exclusively found in cerebral abscesses secondary to chronic suppurative otitis media; these organisms were found in mixed cultures. streptococcus milleri, bacteroides sp and eikenella corrodens were found in pure cultures in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease. in patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts in-situ, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and diphtheroids were common. anaerobes were found in 15 (20.0%) patients, the majority in mixed cultures. culture, as well as gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of volatile fatty acids of cerebral pus, was carried out to enhance the  detection of the anaerobes. based on these findings, an antibiotic regimen consisting of penicillin, chloramphenicol and metronidazole is recommended as an  initial therapy while awaiting culture and sensitivity results.

TI  == analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB  == a 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. the blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. the decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. the dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was bifidobacterium sp., bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium lonqum, lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, peptococcus magnus bifidobacterium longum. in contrast, bifidobacterium bifidum,  bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides distasonis, b. ovatus, bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. among microorganisms isolated from the patient, morganella morganii, candida sp., eubacterium aerofacience and eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; streptococcus mitior, staphylococcus intermedius, micrococcus kristinae, selenomonas ruminantum, bacteroides ureolyticus and lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. these results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.

(85%, 7-27), fusobacterium nucleatum (90%, 5-8), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (73%, 1.3-12), black-pigmented anaerobic rods (bpar) (80%,  0.6-6.5) and oral streptococci (80%, 0.2-1.0). microbial groups detected less often were wolinella sp. (66%, 0-2.6), capnocytophaga sp. (30%), eikenella corrodens (4.7%, 0), campylobacter sp. (28%, 0-0.1) and spirochetes (4.7%, 0-0.07). seven days after gingival sites were scaled, the plaque score and indices for gingival inflammation declined significantly. the gingival flora after scaling were characterized by lower proportions of the actinomyces sp., p.  micros and bpar; and increased proportions of the oral streptococci, relative to  pre-scaling levels.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == four strains of a novel helicobacter species were isolated from the stomachs of cheetahs (acinonyx jubilatus) with gastritis. these isolates were phenotypically  similar to helicobacter pylori. the isolates were gram-negative, spiral bacteria  which grew under microaerophilic conditions at 37 degrees c, but not at 25 or 42  degrees c, and produced urease, catalase, oxidase, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. the isolates did not ferment glucose, mannitol, inositol, sorbitol, rhamnose, sucrose, melibiose, amygdalin, or arabinose; hydrolyze hippurate or indoxyl acetate; or reduce nitrate. they did not produce h2s from triple sugar iron agar, and they did not grow in the presence of 1.0% glycine or 1.5% nacl. they were resistant to nalidixic acid and sensitive to cephalothin and metronidazole. cells were typically 0.3 by 2.0 microns and possessed tufts of two to five sheathed, monopolar flagella. the g+c content of strain 90-119 was 30 mol%. cluster analysis of densitometry scans of polyacrylamide protein gels revealed more than 70% similarity of the cheetah isolates to h. pylori, less than 60% similarity to helicobacter felis, and less than 50% similarity to helicobacter mustelae. complete 16s rrna sequences were determined for two of the cheetah isolates. phylogenetic analysis was performed by comparing the cheetah sequences to those of 19 reference strains, including h. pylori, h. felis (two strains), h. mustelae, helicobacter muridarum, "flexispira  rappini," wolinella succinogenes, campylobacter coli, campylobacter concisus, campylobacter curvus, campylobacter fetus, campylobacter hyointestinalis, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter lari, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter sputorum subsp. bubulus, a campylobacter sp.

TI  == [gardnerella vaginalis in infections of reproductive organs].
AB  == the study was aimed at multidirectional studies on bacteria isolated from smears  from vagina and cervix uteri in 226 patients with inflammatory states of their reproductive organs. most frequently isolated aerobic bacteria were gram-negative--27%, mainly e. coli, and enterococcus faecalis--in 18% of cases. anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 81% of cases: gardnerella vaginalis was isolated in 28% and lactobacillus in 53% of cases. other anaerobic bacteria were: peptococcus asaccharolyticus (15.5%), streptococcus sp. (15.9%), and bacteroides  melaninogenicus (14.1%). gardnerella vaginalis was most frequently found in chronic cases of vaginosis (41.7%). all strains of g. vaginalis were susceptible  to cefotaxime, while 15-40% of them were resistant to gentamycin, tetracycline and metronidazole.

TI  == [the role anaerobes in dermatitis digitalis et interdigitalis in cattle].
AB  == altogether 52 tissue samples and swabs from the corium of the claw of diseased cattle were investigated. microbiological examinations revealed the presence of 11 strictly anaerobic bacterial strains that belonged to the species peptococcus  asacharolyticus, pc. sacharolyticus, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides asacharolyticus and b. melaninogenicus. the remaining isolates were classified as bacteroides, fusobacterium, streptococcus and clostridium. in the above-mentioned strains observations of their biochemical, morphological and enzymatic properties (tab. i) were carried out. their resistance to antibiotics was evaluated from the qualitative viewpoint (tab. ii). capillary isotachophoresis was used to determine the amounts of volatile fatty acids that developed during glucose fermentation (tab. iii). in the single clinical samples the above-mentioned strains occurred as association of microorganism. the anaerobic genera bacteroides and fusobacterium were found in 52% of the samples (bacteroides sp. and fusobacterium sp. were recorded in 25% and 12% of the samples, respectively, whereas in 15% of  the samples both species occurred). according to our results the etiology of dermatitis digitalis et interdigitalis is closely connected with the incidence of anaerobes. of the latter, those belonging to the genera bacteroides and fusobacterium are of major importance.

AB  == phenotypic data and phospholipid ester-linked fatty acid profiles indicate that pigmented bacterial strains isolated from a hypersaline antarctic lake are members of the "flavobacterium-bacteroides" phylum and may represent new taxa. nearly complete 16s rrna sequences were obtained for representative strains by directly sequencing the polymerase chain reaction-amplified 16s rrna gene. sequence signatures confirmed that these organisms were members of the flavobacterium-bacteroides phylum. a phylogenetic analysis, in which the sequences of the antarctic strains were compared with a large number of sequences available for members of the flavobacterium-bacteroides phylum, showed that the antarctic strains were phylogenetically distinct. the new species cluster with a  group of organisms that contains the type species of the genus flavobacterium, flavobacterium aquatile. two new species are described, for which the names flavobacterium gondwanense and flavobacterium salegens are proposed; strains acam 44 (= dsm 5423) and acam 48 (= dsm 5424) are the type strains of f. gondwanense and f. salegens, respectively.

TI  == antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). only one strain each of enterococcus faecium and pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and clostridium perfringens. both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, streptococcus pyogenes and bacteroides sp. all other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin  which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.

TI  == [roxithromycin in dental infections].
AB  == roxithromicin is a semisynthetic macrolide antibiotic, with similar antibacterial activity to erythromycin. it is characterized by an excellent pharmacokinetic profile and a good tissue penetration. particularly at the dose of 300 mg per day the dental tissue diffusion is extremely good, and this is important to oppose the oral cavity infections. oral cavity infections can be either odontogenic or non odontogenic. odontogenic infections are typically primary and are caused by commensal bacteria (oral streptococci, bacteroides sp., veillonella sp. and fusobacterium sp.). the antibacterial spectrum of roxithromycin is very large and includes many of the most frequent strains responsible for oral cavity infections. a very interesting characteristic of roxithromycin is its penetration in macrophages (uptake) that allow a more rapid inhibition of bacterial activity. to evaluate the clinical efficacy and tolerance of roxithromycin in the treatment of odontogenic infections, an open study was performed. this study evaluated both the microbiological and clinical aspects. thirty patients (21 females and 9 males) who had not been previously treated with antibiotic or antibacterial drugs, affected by infective dysodontiasis, gingivitis and periodontal diseases,  received 300 mg per day (once a day) of roxithromycin for an average period of 6  days. the symptomatology considered was: intumescence, redness, pain, lymphangitis and presence of trismus. clinical symptomatology was assessed at the start and at the end of the treatment. the symptomatological improvement due to roxithromycin was rapid and very effective. after 6 days of therapy, the improvement was statistically significant (p < 0.01) compared to basal conditions. no adverse reactions or side-effects were complained during the study. no changement were detected in laboratory parameters.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the management of acute, serous and chronic otitis media: the role of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == otitis media (om) is a common childhood disease and one which can cause significant morbidity. a knowledge of the pathogens responsible for om enables the most appropriate treatment regimen to be selected and thus minimizes further  complications which may require hospital admission and surgery. the microbiology  of acute, serous and chronic om is reviewed, with particular regard to the role of anaerobic bacteria. anaerobes, mainly gram-positive cocci, have been recovered from 25% of the ear aspirates of patients with acute otitis media. in a study of  serous om, anaerobic bacteria were recovered in 12% of the culture-positive aspirates. the predominant anaerobes were gram-positive cocci and pigmented prevotella. several studies have reported the recovery of anaerobes from about 50% of patients with chronic om and those with cholesteatoma. the predominant anaerobes were gram-positive cocci, pigmented prevotella, porphyromonas sp., bacteroides spp. and fusobacterium spp. many of these organisms produce beta-lactamase which might have contributed to the failure of the patients to respond to penicillins. the appropriate antimicrobial therapy for acute, serous and chronic otitis media is discussed.

TI  == postoperative wound infections following myocutaneous flap surgery in spinal injury patients.
AB  == severe pressure ulcers in patients with spinal cord injury are frequently treated by using musculocutaneous (m-c) flap surgery. there have been few studies of the  use of perioperative antibiotics to prevent postoperative infection in this setting. we reviewed 74 m-c flap surgeries in 53 patients (41 male and 12 female) from october 1989 for one year. the sites involved were ischial (31), sacral (24), trochanteric (18), deltoid (2), olecranon (1) and posterior thigh (1). an antibiotic was usually administered perioperatively for 5 days. patients were followed for a median of 30 (8-96) weeks. postoperative infections occurred at a  median of 12 (4-25) days in 6 of 74 (8%) surgeries. the organisms cultured from the 6 infected wounds were: bacteroides sp. (4), proteus mirabilis (2), e. coli (2), mrsa (2), and others (6--each isolated once). these results indicate that antibiotics did not prevent postoperative infection in approximately 8% of patients undergoing m-c surgery. the frequency of isolation of bacteroides sp. from these infections suggests that anaerobic bacteria may persist in healing pressure ulcers and perioperative antibiotics might include coverage for anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == degradation of endogenous bacterial cell wall polymers by the muralytic enzyme mutanolysin prevents hepatobiliary injury in genetically susceptible rats with experimental intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
AB  == jejunal self-filling blind loops with subsequent small bowel bacterial overgrowth (sbbo) induce hepatobiliary injury in genetically susceptible lewis rats. lesions consist of portal tract inflammation, bile duct proliferation, and destruction. to determine the pathogenesis of sbbo-induced hepatobiliary injury, we treated lewis rats with sbbo by using several agents with different mechanisms of activity. buffer treatment, ursodeoxycholic acid, prednisone, methotrexate, and cyclosporin a failed to prevent sbbo-induced injury as demonstrated by increased  plasma aspartate aminotransferase (ast) and elevated histology scores. however, hepatic injury was prevented by mutanolysin, a muralytic enzyme whose only known  activity is to split the beta 1-4 n-acetylmuramyl-n-acetylglucosamine linkage of  peptidoglycan-polysaccharide (pg-ps), a bacterial cell wall polymer with potent inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties. mutanolysin therapy started on the  day blind loops were surgically created and continued for 8 wk significantly diminished ast (101 +/- 37 u/liter) and liver histology scores (2.2 +/- 2.7) compared to buffer-treated rats (228 +/- 146 u/liter, p < 0.05, 8.2 +/- 1.9, p <  0.001 respectively). mutanolysin treatment started during the early phase of hepatic injury, 16-21 d after surgery, decreased ast in 7 of 11 rats from 142 +/- 80 to 103 +/- 24 u/liter contrasted to increased ast in 9 of 11 buffer-treated rats from 108 +/- 52 to 247 +/- 142 u/liter, p < 0.05. mutanolysin did not change total bacterial numbers within the loop, eliminate bacteroides sp., have in vitro antibiotic effects, or diminish mucosal pg-ps transport. however, mutanolysin treatment prevented elevation of plasma anti-pg antibodies and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf alpha) levels which occurred in buffer treated rats with sbbo and decreased tnf alpha production in isolated kupffer cells stimulated in vitro  with pg-ps. based on the preventive and therapeutic activity of this highly specific muralytic enzyme, we conclude that systemic uptake of pg-ps derived from endogenous enteric bacteria contributes to hepatobiliary injury induced by sbbo in susceptible rat strains.

(16), and escherichia coli (6). the predominant anaerobes included bacteroides sp. (12, including 9 bacteroides fragilis group) and peptostreptococcus sp. (11). single bacterial isolates were recovered in 32 (55%) patients, 18 of which were s. aureus. twenty-five beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 22 (51%) of the 43 tested patients. these included 16 s. aureus and 6 b. fragilis group. these data  highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in the polymicrobial nature of secondarily infected diaper dermatitis.

AB  == a total of 31 strains of prevotella intermedia were subjected to dna-dna hybridization and were characterized by performing physiological tests and by performing a multilocus enzyme analysis, using malate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase. all of the strains assigned to p. intermedia fermented glucose and sucrose, hydrolyzed starch but not esculin, and produced indole, acetic, isobutyric, isovaleric, and succinic acids as metabolic end products. the results of dna reassociation experiments performed with the reference probe permitted separation of the strains into two well-defined homology groups. in addition, strains with dnas that hybridized with dna from strain atcc 25611t (t = type strain) had high levels of peptidase activity and cleaved lipid substrates (4-methylumbelliferyl laurate and 4-methylumbellifelyl elaidate). multilocus enzyme electrophoresis revealed two electromorphic profiles, one characteristic of strain atcc 25611t and the other characteristic of strain atcc 33563t. we propose that a new species, prevotella nigrescens, should be created for the genetically distinct group of strains that hybridized with strain atcc 33563t. strain atcc 33563 is designated the type strain of p. nigrescens.

TI  == longitudinal monitoring of humoral antibody in subjects with destructive periodontal diseases.
AB  == fifty-one subjects (16-61 years old) with evidence of prior destructive periodontal disease were monitored clinically and immunologically at bi-monthly intervals for up to 5 yr. periodontal disease activity, determined as new attachment loss, was detected in 33 of these subjects. only 4 of 51 subjects failed to show an elevated serum antibody level to any of the 18 subgingival species tested. the antibody level threshold established for periodontally healthy subjects was exceeded most often in diseased subjects with serum antibody to actinobacillus sp., p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, c. concisus, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia in that order. in general, most serum antibody levels to subgingival species remained relatively consistent for periods as long as 5 yr. however, major increases and decreases in antibody could be detected to at most one or two species in individual subjects. in addition, prolonged, steady increases and decreases in antibody to specific species could be detected in certain subjects. these findings suggest that major changes occurring in serum antibody may reflect fluctuations in the nature of the infection. differences were observed in the antibody level to specific species when subjects were divided into subsets on the basis of clinical criteria. these included high levels of antibody to a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 in ljp and rpp subjects and to  a. actinomycetemcomitans 29523 in ljp and gjp subjects.

AB  == aims: to compare ccfa (cycloserine, cefoxitin fructose agar) with a new selective medium cdmn (containing cysteine hydrochloride, norfloxacin, and moxalactam) for  the isolation of clostridium difficile after direct faecal culture. methods: the  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of norfloxacin was determined for 64 strains of c difficile, 17 strains of other clostridium sp, and 66 various isolates of faecal origin, together with mic determinations of moxalactam against the 81 strains of clostridium sp and 15 isolates of bacteroides sp. using c difficile agar base with 0.5 g/l of cysteine hydrochloride, norfloxacin and moxalactam were incorporated into the medium and compared with ccfa for the isolation of c difficile after direct faecal culture. results: norfloxacin (12 mg/l) inhibited the growth of enterobacteriaceae and faecal streptococci; moxalactam (32 mg/l) inhibited the growth of most strains of bacteroides sp tested, together with clostridium sp other than c difficile. using the antibiotics in combination (cdmn), the growth and colonial morphology of 64 strains of c difficile were unaffected. when cdmn medium was compared with ccfa for the isolation of c difficile from 832 faeces from inpatients with diarrhoea,  the cdmn agar isolated 20% more strains and reduced the number of contaminating colonies by 30%. conclusions: cdmn both improves the isolation rate of c difficile from faecal specimens and reduces the growth of other organisms compared with ccfa.

AB  == a new species, porphyromonas circumdentaria, is proposed for pigmented, asaccharolytic strains that were isolated from the gingival margins or mouth-associated diseases of cats. this bacterium is an obligately anaerobic, gram-negative, brown- or black-pigmented, asaccharolytic, nonmotile, nonsporing,  rod-shaped organism which does not grow in bile and has a guanine-plus-cytosine content of 40 to 42 mol%. it produces major amounts of acetic, butyric, and isovaleric acids and minor amounts of propionic, isobutyric, and phenylacetic acids as end products of metabolism in cooked meat medium. glutamate and malate dehydrogenases are present, while 6-phosphogluconate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenases are absent. the major cellular fatty acid is 13-methyltetradecanoic acid (iso-c15:0 acid). p. circumdentaria strains are catalase positive and produce ammonia, and colonies fluoresce under short-wavelength uv light. these strains do not hemagglutinate erythrocytes, exhibit trypsinlike activity, or produce chymotrypsin or alpha-fucosidase. they are heavily piliated and produce a capsule. the type strain is strain vpb 3329 (= nctc 12469). bacteroides salivosus (d. n. love, j. l. johnson, r. f. jones, and a. calverley, int. j. syst. bacteriol. 37:307-309, 1987) is an obligately anaerobic, gram-negative, pigmented, asaccharolytic, nonmotile, rod-shaped organism which does not grow in bile and has a guanine-plus-cytosine content of 42 to 44 mol%. this organism produces major amounts of acetic, butyric, and phenylacetic acids and minor amounts of isobutyric and isovaleric acids as end products of metabolism in cooked meat medium.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == clarithromycin. a review of its antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic potential.
AB  == clarithromycin is an acid-stable orally administered macrolide antimicrobial drug, structurally related to erythromycin. it has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, similar to that of erythromycin and inhibits a range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, atypical pathogens and some anaerobes. significantly, clarithromycin demonstrates greater in vitro activity than erythromycin against certain pathogens including bacteroides melaninogenicus, chlamydia pneumoniae, chlamydia trachomatis, mycobacterium chelonae subspecies--chelonae and--abscessus, mycobacterium leprae, mycobacterium marinum, mycobacterium avium complex, legionella spp. and, when combined with its 14-hydroxy metabolite, against haemophilus influenzae. however, bacterial strains resistant to erythromycin are also generally resistant to clarithromycin. the antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin appears to be enhanced by the formation  in vivo of the microbiologically active 14-hydroxy metabolite. in combination, additive or synergistic activity against a variety of pathogens including haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, legionella species (principally legionella pneumophila) and various staphylococci and streptococci has been demonstrated. clarithromycin has a superior pharmacokinetic profile to that of erythromycin, allowing the benefits of twice daily administration with the potential for increased compliance among outpatients where a more frequent regimen for erythromycin might otherwise be indicated. the clinical efficacy of clarithromycin has been confirmed in the treatment of infections of the lower and upper respiratory tracts (including those associated with atypical pathogens), skin/soft tissues, and in paediatrics. clarithromycin was as effective as erythromycin and other appropriate drugs including beta-lactams (penicillins and  cephalosporins) in some of the above infections. a most promising indication for  clarithromycin appears to be in the treatment of immunocompromised patients infected with m. avium complex, m. chelonae sp. and toxoplasma sp. small initial  trials in this setting reveal clarithromycin alone or in combination with other antimicrobials to be effective in the eradication or amelioration of these infections. noncomparative studies have provided preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of clarithromycin in the treatment of infections of the urogenital  tract, oromaxillofacial and ophthalmic areas. however, the promising in vitro and preliminary in vivo activity of clarithromycin against mycobacterium leprae and helicobacter pylori warrant further clinical trials to assess its efficacy in patients with these infections. despite the improved pharmacokinetic profile and  in vitro antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin over erythromycin, comparative  studies of patients with community-acquired infections reveal the 2 drugs to be of equivalent efficacy. however, clarithromycin demonstrates greater tolerability, principally by inducing fewer gastrointestinal disturbances.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

(12, including 5 bacteroides fragilis group), fusobacterium sp. (14 isolates); and prevotella sp.  and actinomyces sp. (6 isolates each). a total of 17 aerobic or facultative isolates (0.4 per specimen), including 11 gram-positive cocci and 6 haemophilus sp., were recovered. antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients. nine patients (i.e., 6 with sinusitis and subdural empyema, 3 with sinusitis and brain abscess) did not respond to antimicrobial therapy and aspiration of the abscess,  and required surgical drainage of inflamed sinuses. these findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of intracranial abscess in children.

AB  == the development of the infant faecal flora was studied over the first three months of life in infants receiving breast milk, a modern adapted formula and adaptations of this formula. breast-fed infants developed a flora rich in bifidobacterium sp. facultative anaerobes were ubiquitous, but in relatively small numbers within the diet group. other obligate anaerobes, such as clostridium sp. and bacteriodes sp. were rarely isolated. standard formula produced a flora rich in bifidobacteria, but the growth of facultative organisms  was not suppressed by this diet. clostridium sp. and bacteroides sp. were more common in this feeding group. after the addition of lactoferrin at 10 mg/100 ml to the formula diet, a flora similar to that of the standard formula-fed babies was achieved. lactoferrin at 100 mg/100 ml was able to establish a "bifidus flora" in half of the babies given this formula, but only at age three months. clostridium sp. and bacteroides sp. were common faecal isolates from babies receiving both the lactoferrin diets.

TI  == diagnosis and management of anaerobic infections of the head and neck.
AB  == anaerobic bacteria are important pathogens in head and neck infections such as chronic otitis media, chronic sinusitis, chronic mastoiditis, head and neck abscesses, cervical adenitis, parotitis, and postoperative infection. bacteroides sp (bacteroides melaninogenicus group, bacteroides oralis, and bacteroides fragilis group), peptostreptococcus sp, and fusobacterium sp predominate. the observed recent increase in the number of beta-lactamase-producing strains of bacteroides sp isolated in head and neck infections has been associated with increased failure rates of the penicillins in the management of these infections. the pathogenicity of these organisms is expressed through their ability not only  to survive penicillin therapy but also to shield penicillin-susceptible pathogens from the drug. because of these direct and indirect virulent characteristics of anaerobic bacteria, appropriate antimicrobial therapy must be directed against all pathogens in mixed infections.

TI  == the acute phase of experimental infection with trypanosoma cruzi is more severe in mice monoassociated with strict anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == 1. the influence of some components of the normal human intestinal flora on the acute phase of experimental infection with strain cl of trypanosoma cruzi was studied in 30-day-old germ-free or gnotobiotic cfw (lob) mice monoassociated with bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus sp or clostridium sp by intragastric inoculation of 10(6) bacteria 10 days before the intraperitoneal infection with 5 x 10(3) trypomastigotes/g body weight. 2. significantly earlier parasitemia peak  and mortality were observed in bacteroides fragilis- and clostridium-associated mice (16.75 +/- 0.96 and 15.00 +/- 1.15 days, respectively) when compared with germfree animals (18.83 +/- 1.17 days). more precocious mortality (10.40 +/- 2.06 days) and, curiously, much lower blood parasitemia were observed in peptostreptococcus-associated mice than in other gnotobiotic mice. 3. the extent  of cardiac tissue parasitism decreased in the following order: germfree, b. fragilis-associated, clostridium-associated, and peptostreptococcus-associated animals. the levels of inflammatory reaction decreased in the following order: germfree, peptostreptococcus-associated, clostridium-associated, and b. fragilis-associated mice. 4. these results show that the acute phase of experimental infection with t. cruzi was more severe in mice associated with strict anaerobic bacteria when compared with germfree animals. this suggests that a normal intestinal flora may be another factor, in addition to nutritional and genetic factors, responsible for the different susceptibility of organisms of the same species infected with t. cruzi.

TI  == infection and labor. vii. microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity in spontaneous rupture of membranes at term.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to determine the frequency, microbiologic characteristics, and clinical significance of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity in women with premature rupture of membranes at term. study design: amniocentesis was performed in 32 women with term premature rupture of membranes and amniotic fluid cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and mycoplasmas. results: the prevalence of positive amniotic fluid cultures was 34.3% (11/32). the most common isolates were ureaplasma urealyticum, peptostreptococcus sp., lactobacillus sp., bacteroides fragilis, and fusobacterium sp. clinical chorioamnionitis occurred only in one patient with a positive amniotic fluid culture. her neonate had ophthalmitis. three patients (9.4%) had endometritis. among women who were delivered vaginally, those with a positive amniotic fluid culture had a significantly higher rate of endometritis than those with a negative culture (33% [3/9] vs 0% [0/20], respectively, p = 0.023). conclusions: these data indicate that microbial invasion of the amniotic  cavity occurs in approximately one third of patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes. microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity is a risk factor  for endometritis in women with term premature rupture of membranes.

AB  == the results of identification and sensitivity assay of 156 strains of pathogens causing odontogenic infections are presented. in the sensitivity assay antibacterial drugs were used. 42.3 percent of the strains were obligate anaerobes belonging to bacteroides, fusobacterium, peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, veillonella and actinomyces. significant differences in the microbial sensitivity to the drugs used for general and local therapy were detected. there was observed high sensitivity of the obligate anaerobes to gramicidin (0.02 micrograms/ml), nitazol (10 micrograms/ml), levomycetin and tetracycline (60 micrograms/ml). antiseptics such as dioxidine and chlorhexidine  used locally showed satisfactory results. the above mentioned drugs and especially levomycetin were also rather active against facultative organisms in associations of pathogens causing odontogenic infections: bacillus coagulans, b.  licheniformis, pseudomonas sp., acinetobacter calcoaceticus, staphylococcus sp. and streptococcus sp.

TI  == studies on the possible role of cattle nuisance flies, especially hydrotaea irritans, in the transmission of summer mastitis in denmark.
AB  == the summer mastitis pathogens actinomyces pyogenes, peptococcus indolicus, bacteroides melaninogenicus ss. levii, fusobacterium necrophorum and streptococcus dysgalactiae were isolated from the polyphagous symbovine dipterans hydrotaea irritans (fallen) and morellia sp. caught around dairy heifers on pasture, but not from the haematophagous species haematobia irritans (l.), haematobosca stimulans (meigen), culicoides sp. and simulium sp. secretions from  clinical cases of summer mastitis proved to be sources of summer mastitis bacteria for more than 3 weeks despite antibiotic treatment and teat amputation.  taking into account the seasonal activity pattern of hydrotaea irritans and its topographical distribution on grazing cattle, it appears evident that this fly may play a central role in the establishment and maintenance of the bacterial contamination with summer mastitis pathogens on the teats of healthy cattle. in the present study the survival of a.pyogenes and p.indolicus for 7 days in experimentally infected hydrotaea irritans, as demonstrated by the recovery of these microorganisms from agar plates exposed to live infected flies, is described. however, experimental transmission of summer mastitis from sick to healthy heifers by hydrotaea irritans proved unsuccessful.

TI  == the role of intestinal microflora on the prevention of salmonella colonization in gnotobiotic chickens.
AB  == the possible role of the intestinal microflora in inhibiting the colonization of  salmonella in the ceca of gnotobiotic chickens was investigated. in the cecal contents of newly hatched (2-day-old) and adult normal (7-mo-old) chickens, a larger number of escherichia coli and a smaller number of lactobacillus sp. were  noticed in 2-day-old chickens than in adult chickens. gnotobiotic chickens treated with cecal contents from either newly hatched or adult birds were orally  exposed to salmonella typhimurium, and on the following day s. typhimurium in the ceca were counted. the adult microflora prevented s. typhimurium colonization more strongly than did the microflora of newly hatched chicks. gnotobiotic chickens treated with e. coli, lactobacillus sp., or the mixture of both organisms were orally inoculated with s. typhimurium. the mixture of both organisms suppressed s. typhimurium colonization most effectively, followed by e. coli alone and lactobacillus sp. alone, escherichia coli may play a role of competitive exclusion only in newly hatched chickens, whereas lactobacillus sp. may have a partial role in adult chickens.

AB  == forty cases of cerebral abscesses were studied prospectively to establish the microbial agents implicated in these cases. chronic otitis media (14 patients, 35%), congenital heart disease (five patients, 12.5%),a and meningitis (five patients, 12.5%) were among the important predisposing factors. streptococcus (14 patients, 35%) was the most common causative pre-isolated, the predominant species being streptococcus milleri (11 patients, 27.5%). other organisms isolated included proteus mirabilis in six patients (15%) and staphylococcus aureus in five patients (12.5%). anaerobes (12 patients, 30%), predominantly bacteroides sp. (eight patients, 20%), played an important role in these cases, the majority of which were isolated in mixed cultures. gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of pus detected the presence of anaerobes in another 11 cases of cerebral abscess, in which cultures of anaerobes were negative. therefore, gas-liquid chromotography is useful as an adjunct to conventional bacteriological methods in providing a rapid and sensitive means of detecting anaerobes in pus obtained especially from patients who had received antibiotic therapy prior to hospitalization.

TI  == dental bacterial plaques. nature and role in periodontal disease.
AB  == antony van leeuwenhoek first described oral bacteria. however, not until almost 200 years later was the famous koch postulate introduced. since then, research has extensively been performed regarding the development and microbiology of dental plaques. in spite of the complexity of the developing flora of supragingival plaque, culture studies have shown a remarkably orderly succession  of organisms. lately, the concept of microbial specificity in the etiology of periodontal diseases has been widely suggested, i.e., that different forms of periodontal disease are associated with qualitatively distinct dental plaques. cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of the predominant cultivable microflora reveal that only a small number of the over 300 species found in human subgingival plaques are associated with periodontal disease. among the commonly mentioned are: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, capnocytophaga sp., eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, and wolinella recta, as well as certain gram-positive bacteria such as eubacterium species. anti-infective therapy for many systemic infections equals the use of antimicrobial drugs. however, for localized infections like periodontal diseases, treatment may consist of a combination of mechanical wound  debridement and the application of an antimicrobial agent. the general effectiveness of mechanical anti-infective therapy and successful oral hygiene in the management of periodontal disease is well established in the literature and has met the test of success in clinical practice for most cases of periodontitis  in adults. the definition of periodontal pathogens as either opportunistic pathogens, or as exogenous pathogens carries with it significant implications.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == enrichments on l-tartrate from a freshwater lake sediment yielded a pure culture  of anaerobic bacterium designated strain 16lt1. the rod-shaped organism was motile, did not form spores, and had a gram-negative wall structure. no cytochromes were detected. the mol % g + c of the dna was 58. the new strain was  microaerotolerant, and grew optimally at 30 degrees c and neutral ph in freshwater medium. a wide range of carbohydrates was fermented, with formate, acetate, ethanol, lactate and succinate being the end-products detected. l-tartrate and citrate were fermented to formate, acetate and co2. l-tartrate was fermented by the dehydratase pathway, and glucose by the embden-meyerhof-parnas pathway. fumarate was reduced, but nitrate, sulfate, sulfur and thiosulfate were  not used as terminal electron acceptors. glucose metabolism was constitutive, whereas l-tartrate-degrading activity was inducible. when glucose and l-tartrate  were both present as substrates, growth was diauxic with glucose being metabolized first. the growth rate and growth yield were higher on glucose than on l-tartrate. strain 16lt1 has been deposited with the deutsche sammlung von mikroorganismen as 'bacteroides' sp. dsm6268.

AB  == twenty-seven patients with a recent history of periodontal abscesses and/or loss  of gingival attachment level (gal) despite active periodontal therapy were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. clinical measurements and subgingival scaling were performed every 2 months. when a site exhibited greater than or equal to 2 mm loss of gal or a periodontal abscess, patients were administered either doxycycline at a dosage of 200 mg to start and  100 mg per day for 3 weeks, or a placebo. clinical measurements of gal and microbial analysis of subgingival plaque at study and control sites were made at  the time of active disease and at intervals of 1 week and 7 months after completion of the drug regime. plaque samples were screened for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), bacteroides intermedius (bi), eikenella corrodens (ec) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) by indirect immunofluorescence antibody technique and for spirochetes (sp) using ryu's stain. based on presence or absence analysis of the  sum scores of the 6 pathogens, both the placebo (n = 10) and the doxycycline groups (n = 17) exhibited similar scores at the time of detection of active disease (mean placebo = 2.38 +/- 0.32; mean doxycycline = 2.95 +/- 0.27; p = 0.18). one week after treatment, the probability of detection was unchanged in the placebo group (mean placebo = 3.14 +/- 0.47), but was significantly reduced in the doxycycline group (mean doxycycline = 1.77 +/- 0.26; p = 0.0002). study (active) sites exhibited scores 2 to 3 times higher than control (inactive) sites before doxycycline treatment.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  == two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (peptostreptococcus (1); eubacterium (9); clostridium (6); veillonella (6); megasphera (1); bacteroides (28); fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (p. anaerobius (1); e. fossor (9); c. villosum (1); b. fragilis (1); b. tectum (2); b. heparinolyticus (2)). three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (lrt) or paraoral (po) bacterial infections. of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. among the obligately anaerobic species, gram-positive cocci including p. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, e. fossor 11% and other gram-positive rods (excluding  clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. the gram-negative rods comprised b. fragilis 5%, b. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented bacteroides 3% and other bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of fusobacterium (7%), and gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by pasteurella spp. 19%, escherichia coli 17%, actinomyces spp. 9%, streptococcus spp. 9%. incidental facultative isolates were enterococcus spp. 2%, enterobacter cloaceae 2%, actinobacillus spp. 2% and gram-negative corroding rods 5%. on the basis of the similarities (as determined by dna hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. e. fossor and b. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and lrt and po diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.

TI  == hepatic injury associated with small bowel bacterial overgrowth in rats is prevented by metronidazole and tetracycline.
AB  == susceptible rat strains develop hepatobiliary injury following the surgical creation of self-filling blind loops that cause small bowel bacterial overgrowth. luminal bacteria or their cell wall polymers were implicated in the pathogenesis  of the lesions because sham-operated rats and rats with self-emptying blind loops, having only slightly increased bacterial counts, did not develop hepatic injury. in this study, antibiotics with different spectra of activities were continuously administered starting 1 day or 22 days after surgery to determine which intestinal flora may be responsible for the development of hepatic injury in rats with small bowel bacterial overgrowth. four weeks following surgery, lewis rats with self-filling blind loops receiving no antibiotics had elevated liver histology scores (8.2 +/- 1.3 vs. 0.7 +/- 0.4) and plasma aspartate aminotransferase levels (269 +/- 171 vs. 84 +/- 24) compared with sham-operated rats, p less than 0.001. oral gentamicin as well as oral and intraperitoneal polymyxin b, which binds endotoxin, did not prevent hepatic injury in rats with self-filling blind loops. however, oral metronidazole and tetracycline therapy continuously administered beginning 1 day after surgery diminished hepatic injury (histology score 3.0 +/- 1.8, 2.9 +/- 1.1; aspartate aminotransferase 87 +/- 25,  98 +/- 34; respectively p less than 0.001 compared with self-filling blind loops  receiving no antibiotics). metronidazole also protected wistar rats that require  12 weeks to develop hepatic injury following experimentally induced small bowel bacterial overgrowth compared with rats with self-filling blind loops that received no antibiotic treatment (histology score 10.4 +/- 1.3 vs. 0.7 +/- 1.1, and aspartate aminotransferase 273 +/- 239 vs. 76 +/- 20, p less than 0.001). when rats started metronidazole therapy 22 days after self-filling blind loop surgery, elevated aspartate aminotransferase values decreased to normal during the next 77 days and final histology scores were normal. all rats with self-filling blind loops had negative peritoneal, liver, spleen, and blood cultures but approximately 75% of mesenteric lymph node cultures were positive irrespective of antibiotic treatment. because bacteroides species have been implicated in causing vitamin b12 and disaccharidase deficiencies in rats with self-filling blind loops, we documented the presence or absence of these organisms from blind loops using selective culture techniques. metronidazole and  tetracycline eliminated bacteroides sp. from blind loops, but polymyxin b and gentamicin did not.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == the effect of antimicrobial therapy on mixed infections with bacteroides species. is eradication of the anaerobes important?
AB  == antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations in order to explore their effect on mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. subcutaneous abscesses were induced in mice by single and mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the infected animals were treated for 5 days with spiramycin, gentamicin or metronidazole alone, or metronidazole combined with spiramycin or gentamicin. animals were killed 5 days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses determined. infection induced by a single species of bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. in infections caused by two species of organisms, however, therapy directed at either the bacteroides sp. (with metronidazole) or the aerobes or facultative anaerobes (with spiramycin or  gentamicin) was effective not only in significantly reducing the numbers of the target organism but also, in 13 of 24 instances, in reducing to a small extent the numbers of the other bacteria. despite this phenomenon, in no instance did therapy with a single agent eliminate the infection and eradicate the untargeted  organism. the combination of spiramycin and metronidazole increased the reduction in numbers of b. melaninogenicus in single-organism infections and of bacteroides sp. in mixed infections with s. aureus and s. pyogenes. these findings support the need to aim treatment at all components of mixed infections.

(type species) and arcobacter cryaerophilus comb. nov. wolinella succinogenes so  far is the only species of the genus wolinella. the genus helicobacter is also emended; campylobacter cinaedi and campylobacter fennelliae are included in this  genus as helicobacter cinaedi comb. nov. and helicobacter fennelliae comb. nov.,  respectively. the genus "flexispira," with "flexispira rappini" as the only species, is closely related to the genus helicobacter. the free-living, sulfur-reducing campylobacters do not belong to any of these genera; they probably constitute a distinct genus within rrna superfamily vi.

TI  == changes in subgingival microbiota during puberty. a 4-year longitudinal study.
AB  == it was the purpose of the present investigation to monitor the composition of the subgingival microbiota at selected sites in individuals passing through puberty and to correlate observed changes with the development of pubertal maturation. between the ages of 11 and 14 years, pubertal and skeletal maturation was monitored annually in 22 boys and 20 girls. during this time, subgingival microbial samples were taken every 4th to 5th month (10 times in 4 years) mesially of the upper first molars. high values in total bacterial counts were reached after the onset of puberty, followed by a decrease towards the end of the observation period. the frequency of detection of actinomyces odontolyticus and of capnocytophaga sp. increased with time. the frequencies of other selected species, specifically of black pigmenting bacteriodes sp. were not found to increase when tested by linear and quadratic models of time trend. however, a statistically significant rise in the frequency of detecting b. intermedius and b. melaninogenicus was noted in the initial pubertal phase identified by the onset of testicular growth in boys (p = 0.05). a significant relationship also existed between testes growth and increase of a. odontolyticus (p less than 0.01). in girls, a similar increase was obtained for a. odontolyticus when studied in relation to the tanner scores for breast development (p less than 0.01). the changes observed in the subgingival microbiota during puberty may be related to the development of gingivitis, which was demonstrated by a higher tendency for gingival bleeding during the course of the pubertal maturation process.

TI  == microbial changes associated with the development of puberty gingivitis.
AB  == in this study, longitudinal changes in the composition of the subgingival microbiota of children between the ages of 11 and 14 and their association with changes of clinical parameters describing gingival health were investigated. during 4 years, subgingival microbial samples were taken in 22 boys and 20 girls  10 times. at the same time the gingival bleeding tendency was recorded by the papillary bleeding index (pbi). a total of 840 samples was evaluated using darkfield microscopy and anaerobic culturing on non-selective and selective media. children, who developed a marked and sustained increase in mean pbi scores (n = 21), had higher frequencies and mean proportions of spirochetes and eikenella corrodens than children without pronounced puberty gingivitis (p less than = 0.05). the mean proportion of actinomyces viscosus was also higher in these children (p less than = 0.05). among the species discriminated, only capnocytophaga sp. were found at a higher rate in samples taken immediately before a rise of pbi (p less than = 0.05). the detection frequencies of black-pigmented bacteroides (particularly b. intermedius) increased later, and were significantly elevated after the establishment of a high bleeding tendency (p less than = 0.05). these findings implicate capnocytophaga sp. in the initiation of puberty gingivitis, whereas the increased presence of bacteroides may reflect a change in the subgingival environment secondary to increased bleeding.

TI  == microbial patterns in pooled subgingival plaque samples from young adults with advanced marginal periodontitis.
AB  == different bacterial profiles of subgingival plaque have been described for different clinical categories of marginal periodontitis. in the present investigation the subgingival microflora was studied in young adults with advanced marginal periodontitis. from 12 patients pooled subgingival plaque samples from 5 advanced stages of diseased sites were examined by direct differential phase-contrast microscopy and by cultivation on enriched and selective media. the proportions of the following genera and species were calculated: black-pigmented bacteroides sp., b. gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella sp., actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga  sp., eikenella corrodens, campylobacter sp., and candida sp. spirochete identification was carried out ultrastructurally. calculated percent minimum similarity levels between the individuals revealed that each patient harbored its characteristic cultivable subgingival microflora different from the other individuals. the spirochetes seemed to constitute the subgingival bacterial group with the smallest variation as certain morphotypes were dominating in almost all  individuals.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis vaginitis are risk factors for cuff cellulitis after abdominal hysterectomy.
AB  == to assess the relationship between either bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis vaginitis and posthysterectomy infection, preoperative evaluation of the vaginal  secretions was performed in 161 women undergoing abdominal hysterectomy. thirty-two patients (19.9%) and 27 patients (16.8%), respectively, met the diagnostic criteria for bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis vaginitis. patients with either bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis vaginitis were more likely than control subjects to have cuff cellulitis, cuff abscess, or both (relative risk 3.2, 95% confidence interval 1.5 to 6.7 for bacterial vaginosis; relative risk 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 7.1 for trichomoniasis vaginitis). preoperative vaginitis had no effect with respect to the incidence of postoperative wound infection, urinary tract infection, or intravenous line phlebitis. bacteroides sp., peptostreptococcus sp., and/or gardnerella vaginalis  ("bacterial vaginosis organisms") were isolated from the vaginal cuff in the majority of patients with postoperative cuff cellulitis. bacterial vaginosis and  trichomoniasis vaginitis are risk factors for the development of posthysterectomy cuff cellulitis.

TI  == microbiologic efficacy of intravaginal clindamycin cream for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is characterized by replacement of the normal lactobacillus-predominant vaginal flora with gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria, and mycoplasma hominis. the present study evaluated the vaginal flora of women with bacterial vaginosis before and after treatment with intravaginal clindamycin cream. sixty-seven nonpregnant women with symptoms and signs of bacterial vaginosis, and without other genital tract infections, were randomly assigned to receive placebo cream or 0.1, 1, or 2% clindamycin cream. quantitative vaginal cultures for facultative and anaerobic bacteria and genital  mycoplasmas were performed at enrollment and at 4-7 days and 4-5 weeks after completion of therapy. at enrollment, g vaginalis was recovered from 99%, bacteroides sp from 94%, peptostreptococcus sp from 81%, and m hominis from 58% of the 67 women with bacterial vaginosis. the vaginal cultures yielded a median of 12 isolates per specimen, with equal numbers of aerobic and anaerobic species. the mean log concentration was 1.2 x 10(9) cfu/ml for aerobic and 2.6 x 10(8) cfu/ml for anaerobic bacteria. after treatment, the frequency and concentration of bacteria per milliliter of vaginal fluid decreased for g vaginalis, bacteroides sp, peptostreptococcus sp, and m hominis. the 2% clindamycin cream had the greatest effect on the bacterial vaginosis-associated flora and resulted  in clinical resolution of bacterial vaginosis in 15 (94%) of 16 women. treatment  with lower concentrations of clindamycin cream had less effect on the vaginal flora and resulted in clinical cure in 25 (71%) of 35 women. therapy was associated with an increase in the frequency and concentration of lactobacillus,  and a probably transient increase in the frequency of escherichia coli and enterococcus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == in the western world, bacterial vaginosis is now being recognised as the commonest cause of vaginitis. bacterial vaginosis represents a major disturbance  in vaginal microbiology with the massive overgrowth of predominantly anaerobic bacteria normally found in the vagina. accordingly, high population levels of non-fragilis bacteroides sp., peptostreptococci, gardnerella vaginalis and mobiluncus sp. are found, with a corresponding decline in lactobacillus sp. excessive polyamine production by anaerobes is responsible for the offensive vaginal discharge, and g. vaginalis adherent to epithelial cells produces pathognomonic clue cells, which together with elevated vaginal ph constitute the  hallmark of diagnosis. the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis remains poorly understood and the role of sexual transmission is controversial. bacterial vaginosis may cause symptoms but is frequently asymptomatic. it is more than a nuisance vaginal infection in that (a) many patients have recurrent episodes, and (b) it has recently been associated with post-partum and post-operative fever, upper genital tract infection, amnionitis and prematurity. therapy for symptomatic bacterial vaginosis is currently dominated by metronidazole; however, clindamycin and a host of new agents may enjoy similar success. women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis constitute a major therapeutic problem, as do pregnant women. the cause of frequently recurring bacterial vaginosis remains obscure. new data are presented here indicating that early recurrences are due to relapse and not reinfection. no evidence has emerged that suggests that relapse is due to antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == azoreductase activity of anaerobic bacteria isolated from human intestinal microflora.
AB  == a plate assay was developed for the detection of anaerobic bacteria that produce  azoreductases. with this plate assay, 10 strains of anaerobic bacteria capable of reducing azo dyes were isolated from human feces and identified as eubacterium hadrum (2 strains), eubacterium spp. (2 species), clostridium clostridiiforme, a  butyrivibrio sp., a bacteroides sp., clostridium paraputrificum, clostridium nexile, and a clostridium sp. the average rate of reduction of direct blue 15 dye (a dimethoxybenzidine-based dye) in these strains ranged from 16 to 135 nmol of dye per min per mg of protein. the enzymes were inactivated by oxygen. in seven isolates, a flavin compound (riboflavin, flavin adenine dinucleotide, or flavin mononucleotide) was required for azoreductase activity. in the other three isolates and in clostridium perfringens, no added flavin was required for activity. nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that each bacterium expressed only one azoreductase isozyme. at least three types of azoreductase enzyme were produced by the different isolates. all of the azoreductases were produced constitutively and released extracellularly.

TI  == relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  == bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with  bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. we obtained semen samples from 37  men attending a special infertility clinic and assessed the relationship between  seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. one hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. the microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), peptostreptococcus sp (62%), bacteroides sp (27%), gardnerella vaginalis (19%), lactobacillus sp (16%), actinomyces sp (16%), enterococcus (11%), and veillonella (11%). other microorganisms including group b streptococcus, hemophilus, escherichia coli, mobiluncus, and clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. when the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (p greater  than .05 for each comparison). the proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == digestive tract microflora liberates low molecular weight peptides with immunotriggering activity.

TI  == [microbiological study in clinically characterized rapidly progressive periodontal disease].
AB  == samples of subgingival bacteria were collected from two sites of offanteriors with greater than or equal to 6 mm deep pockets in each ten patients in a clinically characterized rapidly progressive periodontal disease. the purpose of  this investigation was to study the predominant cultivable microflora at pre- and post-periodontal treatment stages, in order to monitor the clinical effects of periodontal treatment and possibly to determine the presence or absence of active disease. "non effective site" was defined as little elimination of periodontal pocket. some patients responded remarkably well to root curettage. however the subgingival flora of effective sites, which had been successfully treated and maintained over a period of three weeks, was still significantly different from the subgingival floras of people with healthy gingiva. the predominant cultivable microflora of diseased lesions at the pre-treatment stage, in which a similar proportion of microbiota were detected on both sites in each patient, were significantly increased proportions of bacteroides sp., b. intermedius and b. gingivalis. although b. gingivalis has been implicated as the etiologic agent of  the disease, to which marked antibody response has been found in periodontal pockets, there were decreased proportions of b. intermedius and b. gingivalis after treatment, compared to pre-treatment stage. the results showed that non-effective lesions were associated with subgingival microflora which were populated by higher proportions of b. intermedius and e. corrodens. h. actinomycetemcomitans were detectable during the experimental periods in all sites. it was possible to indicate progressing periodontitis by examining these microflora at the pre-treatment stage. however active or progressing disease in young adults might represent not only an overgrowth of existing organisms but also an abnormality in host resistance.

(atcc 33076), which comprises three closely related polypeptides, each containing chlorinated phenyl  moieties and d-mannose. the in-vitro activity of ramoplanin was compared with those of vancomycin and teicoplanin. ramoplanin was very active against staphylococcus spp., irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, with all isolates inhibited by 1 mg/l or less. concentrations of vancomycin and teicoplanin required to inhibit the same population of bacteria were 4 and 16 mg/l, respectively. ramoplanin was also very active against streptococcus spp. (alpha- and beta-haemolytic species, str. pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium spp. (including cory. jeikeium), listeria monocytogenes, gardnerella vaginalis, propionibacterium acnes and gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, with all isolates inhibited by 2 mg/l, or less. in general, the activity of ramoplanin against these species was either equal to or only slightly less than teicoplanin and equal to or somewhat greater than vancomycin. with the  exception of bacteroides melaninogenicus and bact. bivius, ramoplanin was not active against gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis as a risk factor for post-cesarean endometritis.
AB  == bacterial species associated with bacterial vaginosis have been isolated more frequently from endometrial cultures of patients with postpartum endometritis than expected from the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis among pregnant women. to further assess the association between bacterial vaginosis and postpartum endometritis, vaginal gram smears were obtained from women admitted for delivery. vaginal smears of women delivered by cesarean were scored as normal or as indicating bacterial vaginosis. factors related independently to postpartum endometritis by multiple logistic regression analysis included maternal age less  than 25 years, any duration of membrane rupture, and bacterial vaginosis. the unadjusted odds ratio for the development of postpartum endometritis associated with bacterial vaginosis (odds ratio = 6.1, 95% confidence interval 3.3-15.9) was not appreciably changed in the multivariable analysis (odds ratio = 5.8, 95% confidence interval 3.0-10.9) after adjusting for maternal age, duration of labor, and duration of membrane rupture. at the time of endometritis, bacteroides sp, peptostreptococcus sp, and gardnerella vaginalis were isolated more frequently from the endometrium using a triple lumen endometrial sampling method  among patients with bacterial vaginosis than among those with a normal gram stain. bacterial vaginosis appears to be an important risk factor for postpartum  endometritis after cesarean delivery.

TI  == the role of bacterial vaginosis as a cause of amniotic fluid infection, chorioamnionitis and prematurity--a review.
AB  == antepartum bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy has been related to premature delivery, the recovery of microorganisms from amniotic fluid of women in premature labor with intact membranes, to histologic chorioamnionitis and to the  recovery of microorganisms from the placenta or membranes. microorganisms associated with bacterial vaginosis are commonly recovered from the amniotic fluid and chorioamnion of patients who deliver prematurely. in addition, bacterial vaginosis is associated with maternal infectious morbidity during labor and in the postpartum period. very little is known of the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which bacterial vaginosis may cause preterm labor and/or premature  rupture of the membranes. however, it is of interest to speculate on possible mechanisms. the high concentration of potentially pathogenic microorganisms in the vagina and cervix of pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis may increase the possibility of an ascending infection via the cervix, decidua, fetal membranes, maternal placenta, and amniotic fluid. some of the bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis such as bacteroides sp. are particularly virulent. certain bacteria produce enzymes that potentially could affect the fetal membranes or maternal deciduae. bacteroides sp. and group b streptococcus produce proteases. protease enzymes reduce the chorioamniotic membrane strength in vitro. it is even possible that a high concentration of bacteria in the lower genital tract could produce enough proteases to weaken the fetal membrane strength causing premature  rupture of the membranes. bacterial lipases could also produce tissue injury. schwarz et al. demonstrated that lysosomes within fetal membrane cells contain phospholipase a2 in high concentrations. phospholipase a2 is a precursor of prostaglandin synthesis and the destruction of lysosomes within deciduae or chorioamnion cells may induce prostaglandin synthesis resulting in uterine contractions. bejar et al. found a high rate of phospholipase a2 production by bacteroides sp., anaerobic streptococci, fusobacterium sp., and g. vaginalis. benett et al. demonstrated that bacterial products of group b streptococci, viridans streptococci, escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis but not of lactobacillus sp. increase the synthesis of prostaglandins in the membranes. thus, selected bacteria, including some closely related to bacterial vaginosis may play a role in the initiation of uterine contractions by stimulating prostaglandin synthesis. in an alternative mechanism, either the release of prostaglandin in the membrane or uterine contraction could cause microbreaks of the membrane that allow bacterial colonization of the membrane.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [significance of the bacterial flora in the etiology of apical periodontitis. qualitative, quantitative and topographical aspects].
AB  == in the international literature it is shown the central role of root canal infection in the etiology of periapical lesions. as a matter of fact it has been  proved (13) that sterile necrotic pulp tissue is completely unable to cause inflammatory reactions at the periapex. infection of endodontic origin extends to the supporting tissues of the tooth only in the case of their acute inflammation  (e.g. acute apical periodontitis, acute alveolar abscess, phoenix abscess). on the other hand in chronic inflammation bacteria remain confined in the endodontic space. only few exceptions to this general rule have been experimentally proved.  in endodontics we deal with a mixed infection which is composed by obligate anaerobes and by facultative anaerobes. the most frequently found obligate anaerobes are bacteroides sp. and fusobacterium sp. (gram- rods) anaerobic diphtheroides (gram+ rods) peptostreptococcus sp. (gram+ cocci) and veilonella sp. (gram- cocci). actinomyces sp., lactobacillus sp., streptococcus sp., and staphilococcus sp. are the facultative anaerobes most frequently found.

TI  == apparition of clostridium sp. and bacteroides in the intestine of the newborn delivered by cesarian section.
AB  == anaerobic flora plays a key role in preventing intestinal colonization with potential pathogens. nowadays, the mechanisms involved in the colonization resistance provided by the anaerobic microflora are to be clarified. numerous factors seem to intervene in the regulation of the intestinal flora. the purpose  of the present study was to correlate the presence or relative absence of clostridium sp. and bacteroides with the colonization by c. perfringens, which is involved in lethal infections in an immunologically compromised host. the intestinal bacterial colonization of 20 newborns delivered by cesarian section was assessed sequentially over the first 14 days of life. c. perifringens is a strongly reducing microorganism and undoubtedly causes a decrease in the oxidoreduction potential of the newborn feces favouring the subsequent colonization by other putrefactive bacteria. c. perfringens seems to be the precursor for installation of putrefractive bacteria, as bacteroides and other clostridium sp.

TI  == glucanase-producing organisms in human dental plaques.
AB  == selective media were used to isolate a wide range of bacteria from sixty human dental plaques. glucanase activities of the isolates were determined on dextran-  and starch-containing media. all sixty samples of dental plaque yielded some colonies showing amylolytic and dextranolytic activities. the glucanase-producing organisms comprised 20% of the isolates. of these 38% were gram-positive rods, 27% gram-positive cocci, 28% gram-negative rods and 7% were gram-negative cocci.  the cultural groups most commonly represented among the glucanase-producing isolates were actinomycetaceae, streptococci, haemophili and gram-negative anaerobes. species prominent among these isolates included streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitior, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, bacterionema  matruchotii, bifidobacterium sp. and bacteroides sp. no isolates capable of degrading starch or dextran were identified as streptococcus milleri, rothia dentocariosa or fusobacterium sp. this study has shown that a wide range of bacterial species commonly isolated from human dental plaques exhibit both amylolytic and dextranolytic activities. in order to understand glucan metabolism in human dental plaques further investigation of these catabolic activities is necessary.

TI  == [osseointegrated implants in clinical dentistry. follow up maintenance phase].
AB  == the aim of this study is to determine the method of maintenance care for support  the functional condition during long period. the present paper reports on the result of osseointegrated titanium fixture in four complete denture patients. the marginal soft tissue reactions were investigated at the 1st, 3rd, 6th, 12th and 18th month after prothetic restrations by clinical examination and microbiological observations. all abutments were surrounded by clinically in healthy gingiva, however most individuals with the implant fixture had used as a  complete denture for many years, without oral hygiene. for a favorable prognosis  of the implant-recipients, self plaque control should be acquired for the patients shortly after prothetic restration. before the healing phase, it is necessary to recall frequently for maintenance marginal soft tissue and prothetic restoration. after healing and remodeling phase, the interval of maintenance care was decided on each 3rd months. the interval seemed practically reasonable because the 18th month later the prognosis was satisfactory. this report presents two cases of complications during the maintenance phase of osseointegrated implants. case i: a 72-year-old female patient presented gingival hyperplasia formation around the abutment after 19th months on abutment setting. we performed excision of the hyperplastic gingiva and apically positioned flap. probing depth  (pd) could not be determined because of gingival hyperplasia formation before operation, but there was marking reduction of probing depth after operation. the  gingival bleeding index (gbi) was improved and the amount of gingival crevicular  fluid (gcf) was reduced after operation. in pre-operative anaerobic culture, the  proportions of capnocytophaga species and haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans were  found. post-operatively, capnocytophaga sp. was not found, but h. actinomycetemcomitans was unchanged. case ii: a 47-year-old male patient presented gingivitis around the abutment after 13th months on abutment setting. we performed cleaning of the abutment surface with the flap procedure. furthermore, a joint screw between the fixture and abutment was adapted due to loosening after operation, pd was unchanged, gbi was improved and gcf was slightly reduced. in pre-operative anaerobic culture, bacteroides intermedius was rich. post-operatively, b. intermedius was not found. in conclusion, we advocate  that maintenance care of osseointegrated implants is the most important factor in the procedure.

TI  == modulation of colonization by black-pigmented bacteroides species in squirrel monkeys by immunization with bacteroides gingivalis.
AB  == periodontal diseases are inflammatory responses thought to be triggered by specific microorganisms colonizing in the gingival crevice. theoretically, periodontal diseases could be prevented if the etiologic organisms were not allowed to colonize the subgingival area. the humoral immune response is one mechanism which may modulate bacterial colonization in the gingival crevice. to test the effect of systemic humoral immunity on subgingival colonization by bacteria, squirrel monkeys (saimiri sciureus) were immunized with bacteroides gingivalis, a black-pigmented bacteroides sp. and putative periodontal pathogen.  immunized and sham-immunized monkeys were orally inoculated with 10(10) viable b. gingivalis during ligation of five teeth in one quadrant with bacterium-soaked suture material and distribution over the entire dentogingival margin. immunization resulted in an increased level of immunoglobulin g anti-b. gingivalis in serum and was associated with a strong trend toward a statistically significant reduction in colonization of the gingival crevice by black-pigmented  bacteroides.

AB  == examining the relationships among indicators of the acute inflammatory response in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) and specific bacterial species in subgingival  plaque may provide indications of which bacterial species or groups of species may be associated with potentially destructive host-derived processes. here we report on the relationship of the subgingival plaque flora to the activity of mammalian forms of the enzymes beta-glucuronidase (beta g), lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), and arylsulfatase (as) in gcf from a total of 54 4-6 mm periodontal sites  from 13 periodontitis patients. sites were scored for probing depth (pd) and bleeding on probing, and gcf was collected using filter paper strips inserted into the sulcus for 30 s, eluted in buffer and assayed for enzyme activity. 1 week later, the patients were again evaluated for pd and bleeding, and subgingival plaque was removed with a curette oriented toward the pocket epithelium. plaque samples were examined by darkfield microscopy and cultured anaerobically on selective and non-selective media. various groups of bacteria, including species of black pigmenting bacteroides (bpb), fusobacterium sp., capnocytophaga sp, streptococcus sanguis, and total facultative organisms were enumerated. relationships among the enzymes and bacterial groups expressed as colony-forming unit (cfu) counts or as a % of the total cultivable flora were assessed by spearman correlation analysis. beta g levels were significantly correlated with populations of spirochetes, b. intermedius, b. gingivalis, and total lactose negative bpb's. correlation between beta g and f. nucleatum sp. or  capnocytophaga sp. approached but did not reach statistically significant levels. in contrast, ldh activity showed a significant positive correlation with levels of b. gingivalis and total lactose negative bpb's. as levels were significantly correlated only with b. gingivalis. beta g and ldh showed a significant negative  correlation with levels of coccoid forms. thus, beta g, an acid hydrolase which can serve as a marker for primary granule release from polymorphonuclear leukocytes, was most closely correlated with the micro-organisms found in other studies to be associated with chronic adult periodontitis.

TI  == ruminal cellulolytic bacteria and protozoa from bison, cattle-bison hybrids, and  cattle fed three alfalfa-corn diets.
AB  == ruminal cellulolytic bacteria and protozoa and in vitro digestibility of alfalfa  fiber fractions were compared among bison, bison hybrids, and crossbed cattle (five each) when they were fed alfalfa and corn in a ratio of 100:0, 75:25, and 50:50, respectively. the total number of viable bacteria (2.16 x 10(9) to 5.44 x  10(9)/ml of ruminal fluid) and the number of cellulolytic bacteria (3.74 x 10(7)  to 10.9 x 10(7)/ml) were not different among groups of animals fed each diet. the genera of protozoa in all of the animal groups were similar; however, when either the 100:0 or 50:50 diet was used the percentage of entodinium sp. was lower and the percentage of diplodiniinae was higher (p less than 0.05) in bison than in bison hybrids or cattle. bacteroides succinogenes made up the largest number of cellulolytic isolates from bison (58 and 36%, respectively, on the 100:0 and 75:25 diets), which were more numerous (p less than 0.05) than those from bison hybrids (36 and 12%) and cattle (33 and 18%). this was offset by a lower number of cellulolytic butyrivibrio isolates. the numbers of ruminococcus albus and r. flavefaciens isolates, in general, were similar among the bovid species, although r. flavefaciens generally made up less than 10% of the cellulolytic isolates. in  vitro digestibility coefficients were greater (p less than 0.05) for the bison when the 75:25 diet was used and similar for the other two diets. the concentration of ruminal volatile fatty acids was larger (p less than 0.05) in bison than in bison hybrids and cattle when the 50:50 diet was used.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == direct and indirect pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in mixed infections in children.
AB  == the recent emergence of numerous aerobic and anaerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacterial strains has been associated with an increase in the failure rate of penicillins in the therapy of infection caused by these organisms. these include  respiratory tract, skin of soft tissue, female genital tract, intra-abdominal, and other miscellaneous infections. the important aerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) include staphylococcus aureus, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus sp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and legionella sp. the anaerobic blpb are all bacteroidiaceae and include bacteroides fragilis group, b. melaninogenicus group, b. oralis, b. oris-buccae, and fusobacterium sp. laboratory, animal, and clinical studies that support the indirect pathogenicity  of these organisms and the distribution of these blpb in various infections are reviewed. blpb may not only have a direct pathogenic role in causing the infection, but also an indirect pathogenic role. the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin  therapy, but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from that drug. these direct and indirect virulence characteristics of aerobic and anaerobic blpb require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against  all pathogens in mixed infections.

TI  == pig bite injuries and infection: report of seven human cases.
AB  == six patients developed local infection after being bitten or gored by swine. wounding was often deep and occurred characteristically on the posterior aspect of the thigh. severity of infection varied from simple wound infection with discharge and slough to cellulitis and abscess formation; pathogens included haemolytic streptococci, pasteurellae, bacteroides sp., proteus sp. and escherichia coli and were usually isolated in mixed culture. a patient with pasteurella aerogenes infection appears to be the first reported in england. a seventh patient developed streptococcus milleri septicaemia after wounding himself while cutting teeth from piglets. it is suggested that a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics should be given as part of the initial treatment when  patients present with the more severe pig bite injuries.

TI  == [aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of crural ulcers].
AB  == in a group of 600 patients treated in the metropolitan dermatological hospital in warsaw bacteriological examination were carried out of swabs from the untreated crural ulcers. in 95% of these cultures growth of pathological aerobic organisms  was obtained. coagulase-positive staphylococci (st. aureus) and gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, enterobacter sp and e. coli)  prevailed. in 27% of cases the cultured strains were resistant to the generally available antibiotics. in the second group in 70 patients no growth of anaerobes  exclusively was noted. pathological aerobes and anaerobes in the same case were found in 45% of cultures. in the remaining ones pathogenic aerobes were present with a similar frequency as in the preceding group. of the anaerobes the most frequently cultured species were gram-negative bacteria such as bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides sp, and bacteroides fragilis. among pathogenic anerobic cocci peptostreptococcus and peptococcus were most frequent. in 2 cases  spore-forming anaerobic bacteria (clostridium perfringens) were obtained. forty-eight percent of anaerobes were resistant to the commonly used antibiotics.

TI  == pathogenicity of capsulate and non-capsulate members of bacteroides fragilis and  b. melaninogenicus groups in mixed infection with escherichia coli and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the relationships between capsulate and non-capsulate bacteroides fragilis strains and escherichia coli, and between capsulate and non-capsulate strains of  the b. melaninogenicus group and streptococcus pyogenes, were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. selective antimicrobial agents directed against either aerobic or anaerobic bacteria were used alone or in combination to explore the effect of eradication of one component of the mixed infection. single agent therapy effective against both aerobic and anaerobic flora was also employed. single therapy of mixed infection directed at the elimination of only one organism (s. pyogenes, e. coli or bacteroides sp.) caused significant reductions in the numbers of sensitive organisms and also smaller yet significant decreases in the numbers of insensitive organisms. however, the abscesses were not eliminated after such therapy. combination therapy or use of a single agent (cefoxitin) directed against the aerobic and anaerobic components of the infection was more effective. non-capsulate bacteroides spp. became capsulate after passage in mice mixed with either s. pyogenes or e. coli. therapy directed  at the elimination of s. pyogenes and e. coli did not prevent the emergence of capsulate bacteroides spp. these data demonstrate the synergy between all members of the b. fragilis group and e. coli and between the b. melaninogenicus group and s. pyogenes, and reiterate the need to direct antimicrobial therapy at the eradication of the aerobic and anaerobic components of mixed infections.

(two), and fusobacterium sp. (two). it was the practice of five of the six patients to wet their lenses with saliva. it is recommended that a culture for anaerobes be obtained from any patient who uses contact lenses and develops conjunctivitis.

TI  == use of expanded spectrum cephalosporins for the treatment of obstetrical and gynecological infections.
AB  == the antianaerobic cephalosporins, cefoxitin, ceftizoxime, cefotetan, and moxalactam, are compared in the treatment of obstetric/gynecologic infections associated with mixed aerobic and anaerobic pathogens. all of the antianaerobic cephalosporins have demonstrated similar efficacy in the treatment of mixed female genital tract infections. thus, antibiotic selection requires a comparison of the antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, and overall cost of therapy. all agents have excellent activity against the gram-negative bacilli, and recent comparative data show that ceftizoxime is highly active against the bacteroides sp. dosing frequency and drug toxicity contribute to the  overall cost of drug therapy. cefoxitin is the only antianaerobic cephalosporin that cannot be dosed on a 12-hour basis. ceftizoxime and cefoxitin, unlike moxalactam and cefotetan, do not contain the mtt group that has been associated with bleeding abnormalities. substantial cost savings can be realized by using an antianaerobic cephalosporin administered every 12 hours. the experience at the chicago lying-in hospital is presented.

TI  == relationship of subgingival microbial complexes to clinical features at the sampled sites.
AB  == subgingival plaque samples from 100 active destructive periodontal lesions and 150 inactive subgingival sites in 33 subjects were analyzed by predominant cultivable microbiota techniques. 50 isolates were characterized from each sample and where possible, the isolate was placed in 1 of 134 microbial species or groups. the sites were clustered on the basis of the proportions of all of the species detected in each sample using a minimum similarity matching coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. 10 clusters containing 166 sites were formed which exhibited greater than 35% minimum similarities. all clusters were made up of sites from multiple subjects and were formed on the basis of different combinations of micro-organisms. certain complexes of micro-organisms appeared to relate to the severity of periodontal destruction and the activity of the sampled site. the combination of f. nucleatum, b. forsyth and w. recta (cluster vii) or b. gingivalis, b. intermedius and s. intermedius (cluster viii) distinguished clusters made up of sites which on average had the most attachment loss and the deepest pockets. these clusters contained the highest proportions of active sites and sites which lost greater than 3 mm of attachment after therapy. clusters dominated by v. parvula (cluster iii), the actinomyces sp. (cluster x) or the combination of s. sanguis ii, s. mitis, v. parvula and s. intermedius (cluster ii) were made up of sites which exhibited less active disease and responded more  favorably to therapy. sites in other clusters exhibited moderate levels of prior  destructive disease and disease activity status closer to the mean values for all 250 sites.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == use of antibiotics in the management of postirradiation wound infection and sepsis.
AB  == ionizing gamma irradiation depresses the host defenses and enhances the susceptibility of the immunocompromised host to local and systemic infection due  to endogenous or exogenous microorganisms. trauma and wounding act synergistically and decrease the survival after exposure to irradiation. the current antimicrobial agents suitable for controlling serious infections and their use in post irradiation local and systemic infection with and without trauma are discussed. the experience gained in managing immunocompromised patients following chemotherapy is reviewed. empiric single agent or combination  agent therapy should be directed at the eradication of potential gram-negative as well as gram-positive pathogens. the most important organisms known to cause these infections are pseudomonas sp. and enterobacteriaceae. management of intra-abdominal infections following trauma should include early surgical correlation and antimicrobials directed against the bacteroides fragilis group and enterobacteriaceae. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes cause most skin and soft tissue infections following trauma. chemoprophylaxis of enteric sources of systemic infection can be achieved by antimicrobials that selectively inhibit the enterobacteriaceae sp. and preserve the anaerobic flora.  the management of infection in the injured and irradiated host includes supportive and restorative therapy. supportive therapy includes debridement and cleansing of wounds, fluids, immunoglobulin, and antimicrobials. restorative therapy includes definite surgery repair and replenishment of the immune system by use of immunomodulators, growth factors, and bone marrow transplantation. further studies are needed to examine the usefulness of presently available drugs and experimental agents in the irradiated and traumatized host.

TI  == enumeration and isolation of cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic bacteria from human feces.
AB  == the fibrolytic microbiota of the human large intestine was examined to determine  the numbers and types of cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic bacteria present. fecal samples from each of five individuals contained bacteria capable of degrading the hydrated cellulose in spinach and in wheat straw pretreated with alkaline hydrogen peroxide (ahp-ws), whereas degradation of the relatively crystalline cellulose in whatman no. 1 filter paper (pmc) was detected for only one of the five samples. the mean concentration of cellulolytic bacteria, estimated with ahp-ws as a substrate, was 1.2 x 10(8)/ml of feces. pure cultures  of bacteria isolated on ahp-ws were able to degrade pmc, indicating that interactions with other microbes were primarily responsible for previous low success rates in detecting fecal cellulolytic bacteria with pmc as a substrate. the cellulolytic bacteria included ruminococcus spp., clostridium sp., and two unidentified strains. the mean concentration of hemicellulolytic bacteria, estimated with larchwood xylan as a substrate, was 1.8 x 10(10)/ml of feces. the  hemicellulose-degrading bacteria included butyrivibrio sp., clostridium sp., bacteroides sp., and two unidentified strains, as well as four of the five cellulolytic strains. this work demonstrates that many humans harbor intestinal cellulolytic bacteria and that a hydrated cellulose source such as ahp-ws is necessary for their consistent detection and isolation.

TI  == susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the antimicrobial susceptibility of 1,117 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined by the agar dilution technique. metronidazole was the most active  agent; only propionibacterium acnes and actinomyces sp. isolates were resistant.  clindamycin and chloramphenical were the next most effective agents. beta-lactam  antibiotics, with the exception of penicillin, were active against most anaerobes other than the bacteroides fragilis group. at a breakpoint of 8 mg/l, 25% of fusobacterium spp. and 30% of the non-fragilis bacteroides spp. were resistant to penicillin. the highest resistance to beta-lactams was seen in the b. fragilis group. within the indole-positive members of the group, resistance rates of 71% were seen for cefoxitin, 49% for moxalactam, 79% for cefotaxime, 22% for piperacillin and 89% for penicillin. we conclude that metronidazole has the most  predictable in vitro activity against common clinical anaerobic isolates and that resistance to beta-lactams was frequent and of potential clinical importance as these latter agents are frequently used in the prophylaxis and therapy of mixed anaerobic infections.

TI  == the role of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in respiratory tract infections.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, bacteroides sp. (bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides oralis, and bacteroides fragilis), peptostreptococci and fusobacterium sp. are important pathogens in respiratory tract infections (rti). these organisms are often recovered mixed with other aerobic, facultative  and anaerobic bacteria. a recent increase in numbers of bet-lactamase producing strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria in rti has been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in eradication of these infections. these  infections include chronic otitis media, chronic sinusitis and mastoiditis, chronic recurrent tonsillitis and lung abscesses. the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin  therapy but also to protect penicillin susceptible pathogens from that drug. these direct and indirect virulence characteristics of anaerobic bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections.

TI  == trospectomycin, a novel spectinomycin analogue: antibacterial activity and preliminary human pharmacokinetics.
AB  == trospectomycin (tsp; u-63366f) is a novel spectinomycin (sp) analogue with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. the in vitro activity of the analogue was  compared to that of sp against approximately 400 bacterial isolates. the in vivo  activity of the compound was assessed using experimental infection models for both gram-positive and gram-negative facultative bacteria. the preliminary human  pharmacokinetics of tsp were evaluated following single-dose i.v. or i.m. administration. tsp was more active in vitro than sp (2 to 32-fold) against strains of numerous bacterial species, including staphylococci, streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, proteus spp., bacteroides spp., gardnerella vaginalis and chlamydia trachomatis. the activity of tsp for most species of the family enterobacteriaceae was comparable  to that of sp. tsp was more active than sp (2 to 32-fold) in curing experimental  infections due to streptococci, salmonella typhi, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. tsp was well-absorbed following both i.v.  and i.m. administration. pharmacokinetic analysis of microbiological assay data for the 1000 mg dose yielded the following mean values for the i.v. and i.m. routes, respectively: cmax = 81.2, 28.7 micrograms/ml; serum half-life = 2.2, 2.2 h; tmax = 25, 75 min; and auc = 156.6, 116.2 h micrograms/ml. pharmacokinetic analysis of assay data derived using the more sensitive hplc assay revealed the biphasic nature of trospectomycin elimination, highlighted by a short apparent serum half-life (2.2 h) and a prolonged tissue half-life (approximately 36 h). tsp inhibits a variety of clinically important organisms, including agents of sexually transmitted diseases and pelvic inflammatory disease, and demonstrates favourable pharmacokinetic properties.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the in vitro activity of the combination of cefotaxime and hre 664.
AB  == cefotaxime (ctx) and hre 664 (a novel penem antibiotic) possess complementary in  vitro properties. differences can be observed in their antibacterial spectra, their beta-lactamase stability and -inhibition, and their affinity to penicillin-binding proteins. these differences suggested that combinations of the cephalosporin and the penem antibiotic would be advantageous and should be studied. the fractional inhibitory concentration values of checkerboard studies confirmed that ctx and hre 664 act synergistically against various gram-positive  and gram-negative bacteria. fixed combinations containing 80% ctx and 20% hre 664 possess broader antibacterial spectra and in certain cases higher antibacterial activities than each of the components alone. the combinations had improved activity against staphylococci including methicillin-resistant strains, beta-lactamase producing strains of enterobacter sp. and bacteroides fragilis. the combination as well as the single antibiotics had only limited activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == rapidly progressive periodontitis. neutrophil chemotaxis inhibitory factors associated with the presence of bacteroides gingivalis in crevicular fluid.
AB  == in the last few years several bacteriological and immunological studies have investigated the role of bacteria and immune defects in order to establish the etiopathogenesis of periodontal disease. with regard to the immune system, a defect in polymorphonuclear neutrophil (pmn) chemotaxis has been frequently reported in patients with rapidly progressive or juvenile periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to investigate in five patients with rapidly progressive periodontitis and normal chemotaxis of peripheral blood pmns the presence of chemotaxis inhibitory activity in gingival fluid and to relate such activity to three types of bacteria, often involved in rapidly evolving periodontal lesions, that are able to inhibit in vitro pmn chemotaxis: bacteroides gingivalis, capnocytophaga sp., and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. we found strong inhibitory activity in three of these patients. this activity was consistently associated with the finding of b. gingivalis in gingival pockets. we cannot rule out, however, that other substances not of bacterial origin could be responsible for such inhibitory activity. the strict association with b. gingivalis, known to secrete blocking factors, is highly suggestive, although this data must be considered preliminary.

TI  == establishment of specific pathogen-free rabbits by inoculation of hysterectomy-derived rabbits with fecal suspension and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == establishment of a specific pathogen-free (spf) rabbit colony was attempted by transferring a total of 127 hysterectomy-derived rabbits directly into a barrier  room where spf rats had been reared. all rabbits except four died of mucoid enteritis-like diarrhea during 2 and 6 weeks of age. a second experiment consisted of four groups of hysterectomy-derived rabbits including: (1) noninoculated controls; (2) rabbits inoculated with suspension of feces from the  survivors; (3) rabbits inoculated with a bacterial inoculum (bacteroides spp. and eubacterium sp. isolated from conventional rabbits); and (4) rabbits inoculated with streptococcus faecalis in addition to the inoculum used for group 3. all rabbits in group 1 died of diarrhea by 3 weeks of age. survival rates of groups 2, 3 and 4 are 53%, 38% and 40%, respectively. on 7 days after the inoculation, bacteroides was not recovered from fecal samples of group 1, but was recovered from many samples of the inoculated groups. populations of enterobacteriaceae and clostridium in the samples in group 1 were larger than each of those in the inoculated groups. the present results suggest that the lethal diarrhea, after transferring hysterectomy-derived animals directly into a barrier room, can be controlled by inoculation with non-pathogenic anaerobes, especially bacteroides.

TI  == light and electron microscopic features of tropical ulcer.
AB  == the histopathological features of 20 tropical ulcers with the electron microscopic findings on seven biopsy specimens are reported. the main findings were loss of epidermis associated with extensive dermal oedema, infiltration by polymorphonuclear leucocytes, and disruption of collagen bundles. the presence of micro-organisms at the site of tissue damage was shown and compared with the morphology of the organisms grown in culture. the most commonly identified bacteria were pleomorphic rods whose electron microscopic appearances accorded most closely with fusobacteria grown in vitro. spirochaetes, identified ultrastructurally as treponema sp, were also present. there was no evidence of vasculitis to explain the rapid onset of ulceration, but necrotic changes seen in the dermis and the inflammatory cell infiltrate suggest that, associated with cell necrosis, bacteria previously shown in vitro have an important role in the pathogenesis of tropical ulcers.

AB  == a randomized prospective study compared the efficacy of a three-dose perioperative course of intravenously administered cefuroxime and metronidazole versus suction drainage of the vaginal vault for preventing postoperative infection in abdominal and vaginal hysterectomies. in vaginally operated patients, a significant difference in the rate of vaginal cuff abscess formation  was found between the drain group and the antibiotic group (33 versus 0%). in the abdominally operated patients, no significant difference was found (7 versus 0%). the rate of cystitis was not influenced by the prophylactic method. a positive correlation was found between bacteroides sp isolated from the vaginal fluid and  vaginal cuff abscesses in the vaginally operated women. the complications of infection are explained by the decrease in host defense, occurring more frequently in patients treated with the vaginal approach than with the abdominal  technique.

TI  == antimicrobial substance from a human lactobacillus strain.
AB  == lactobacillus sp. strain gg, which was isolated from the feces of a normal person, produced a substance with potent inhibitory activity against a wide range of bacterial species. it inhibited anaerobic bacteria (clostridium spp., bacteroides spp., bifidobacterium spp.), members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas spp. staphylococcus spp., and streptococcus spp., as demonstrated by a microbiological assay; however, it did not inhibit other lactobacilli. the inhibitory activity occurred between ph 3 and 5 and was heat stable. bactericidal activity against escherichia coli was demonstrated at a dilution of 1:128. the inhibitory substance was distinct from lactic and acetic acids. it had a low molecular weight (less than 1,000) and was soluble in acetone-water (10:1). because of these characteristics, the inhibitory material could not be considered a bacteriocin; it most closely resembled a microcin, which has been associated previously with members of the family enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == susceptibility and resistance of ruminal bacteria to antimicrobial feed additives.
AB  == susceptibility and resistance of ruminal bacterial species to avoparcin, narasin, salinomycin, thiopeptin, tylosin, virginiamycin, and two new ionophore antibiotics, ro22-6924/004 and ro21-6447/009, were determined. generally, antimicrobial compounds were inhibitory to gram-positive bacteria and those bacteria that have gram-positive-like cell wall structure. mics ranged from 0.09  to 24.0 micrograms/ml. gram-negative bacteria were resistant at the highest concentration tested (48.0 micrograms/ml). on the basis of their fermentation products, ruminal bacteria that produce lactic acid, butyric acid, formic acid, or hydrogen were susceptible and bacteria that produce succinic acid or ferment lactic acid were resistant to the antimicrobial compounds. selenomonas ruminantium was the only major lactic acid-producing bacteria resistant to all the antimicrobial compounds tested. avoparcin and tylosin appeared to be less inhibitory (mic greater than 6.0 micrograms/ml) than the other compounds to the two major lactic acid-producing bacteria, streptococcus bovis and lactobacillus sp. ionophore compounds seemed to be more inhibitory (mic, 0.09 to 1.50 micrograms/ml) than nonionophore compounds (mic, 0.75 to 12.0 micrograms/ml) to the major butyric acid-producing bacteria. treponema bryantii, an anaerobic rumen spirochete, was less sensitive to virginiamycin than to the other antimicrobial compounds. ionophore compounds were generally bacteriostatic, and nonionophore compounds were bactericidal. the specific growth rate of bacteroides ruminicola was reduced by all the antimicrobial compounds except avoparcin. the antibacterial spectra of the feed additives were remarkably similar, and it appears that mics may not be good indicators of the potency of the compounds in altering ruminal fermentation characteristics.

TI  == the role of anaerobic bacteria in otitis media: microbiology, pathogenesis, and implications on therapy.
AB  == the current knowledge of the recovery of anaerobic bacteria from cases of acute and chronic otitis media is reviewed. although techniques for cultivation of anaerobes were used in the studies presented, the methodologies of collection, transportation, and cultivation of the specimens varied. consequently, there were differences in the rates of recovery of these organisms and the species isolated. anaerobes, mainly gram-positive cocci, were recovered from a quarter of ear aspirates in acute otitis media in about one third mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria. in a study of otitis media with effusion, anaerobic bacteria were recovered in 12% of the culture-positive aspirates. the predominant anaerobes were gram-positive cocci and bacteroides melaninogenicus. several studies reported the recovery of anaerobes in about half of the patients with chronic otitis media and in those with cholesteatoma. the predominant anaerobes were gram-positive cocci, bacteroides sp, and fusobacteria sp. many of these organisms produced beta-lactamase and might have contributed to the failure of these patients to respond to penicillins. the potential synergistic relationships between the various aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and the role of the capsule of anaerobic bacteria as a virulence factor are discussed.

AB  == our purpose was to study bacterial antagonism between a limited number of strictly anaerobic strains and clostridium perfringens in the intestinal tract of gnotobiotic rodents. gnotobiotic mice harboring a bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a fusobacterium necrogenes, and a clostridium sp. strain were protected against pathogenic b, c, and d c. perfringens serotypes. a drastic antagonistic effect of this three-strain association was also observed against a nonpathogenic c. perfringens serotype a (cpa). it was less efficient in gnotobiotic rats than in mice and less efficient in gnotobiotic mice fed an autoclaved diet than in mice fed the same diet sterilized by irradiation. no diffusible inhibitory substances  against cpa were detected in feces of gnotobiotic mice harboring the three antagonistic strains, and no nutrient depletion was demonstrated in filtrates prepared from 10-fold diluted feces of these mice. in vitro mixed cultures of the three antagonistic strains failed to inhibit growth of cpa, whereas cpa did not multiply in a 10-fold diluted feces from gnotobiotic mice. a reverse correlation  between the initial number of antagonistic strains and the division number of cpa was determined using serially diluted fecal suspensions. thus, large numbers of viable cells of both antagonistic strains were required to inhibit the target strain in fecal suspensions as was also found in gnotobiotic mice intestines. however, no diffusible inhibitory substance was detectable nor could depletion of growth factors be identified as causing antagonism. whatever factors that may be  responsible for antagonism were found to be influenced by the host and its diet.

TI  == microbiology of the female genital tract.
AB  == patients who contract genital tract infections are predominantly young, are otherwise healthy, and generally respond well to treatment for bacterial infections. these infections are most commonly polymicrobial in etiology, with several noteworthy exceptions. often there is an inciting event such as childbirth, surgical intervention, pregnancy termination or intrauterine contraceptive device insertion. with treatment, prognosis for cure is excellent;  however, sequelae such as recurrent infections, infertility, or ectopic pregnancy can be serious. bacteria encountered in the female genital tract can be divided into aerobic and anaerobic organisms. among the aerobic gram-positive organisms,  several varieties of streptococci such as group b streptococci and enterococci occur frequently. staphylococcus aureus is an infrequent but important pathogen.  among the aerobic gram-negative organisms, the most common is escherichia coli. klebsiella sp. and proteus sp. occur in about 5% of genital tract infections. species that are more resistant to antibiotics, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter sp., occur in approximately 1% or 2% of these cases and are more likely to appear in patients who have previously received antibiotic therapy or who have been hospitalized for some time. among the anaerobic organisms, the most common gram-positive isolates are peptostreptococci and peptococci. clostridia sp. occurs less frequently. among the anaerobic gram-negative organisms, the bacteroides sp. most frequently encountered are bacteroides bivius and bacteroides disiens. bacteroides fragilis is still a common problem but appears to be less predominant. other organisms encountered are chlamydia trachomatis, the genital mycoplasmas, yeasts, protozoa, and viruses.

TI  == role of encapsulated anaerobic bacteria in synergistic infections.
AB  == the effect of encapsulation on the virulence, survival, and protection of anaerobic bacteria from phagocytosis is reviewed. support for the importance of encapsulated bacteroides sp. and anaerobic and facultative gram-positive cocci (afgpc) was provided by their higher recovery rate in oropharyngeal infections, compared to their number in the normal oral flora. studies of the pathogenicity of anaerobic bacteria of the bacteroides, fusobacterium, and clostridium genera and afgpc are also presented. the organisms were inoculated into mice and their ability to induce subcutaneous abscesses was determined. encapsulated bacteroides, fusobacteria, and afgpc generally induced abscesses, whereas unencapsulated organisms did not. however, many of the strains that had only a minimal number of encapsulated organisms (less than 1%) survived in the abscess,  and became heavily encapsulated when inoculated with other viable or nonviable encapsulated bacteria. these strains were thereafter able to induce abscesses when injected alone. encapsulated bacteroides sp. and anaerobic cocci induced bacteremia and translocation, and increased the mortality of the infected animals more often than did the unencapsulated form of the same strains. the relative importance of encapsulated anaerobes in relation to their aerobic and facultative counterparts in mixed infection was studied, using selective antimicrobial therapy and quantitative cultures of abscesses induced in mice. with few exceptions, possession of a capsule made bacteroides sp. more important than their aerobic counterparts. synergistic potentials were seen between encapsulated bacteroides sp. and all tested aerobic bacteria and most afgpc, and between most  afgpc and pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus. these studies demonstrated the importance of encapsulated anaerobes in mixed infections.

AB  == polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic flora are responsible for pelvic inflammatory disease (pid). the most frequent pathogens appear to be neisseria gonorrhoea and  anaerobic bacteria (most commonly anaerobic cocci and bacteroides sp.). recent studies have demonstrated the recovery of chlamydia trachomatis in up to a third  of these infections. although n. gonorrhoea is frequently recovered from cervical cultures, it is less commonly recovered from intra-abdominal sites. recent studies have demonstrated the in-vivo synergistic relationship between n. gonorrhoeae and bacteroides fragilis. the growth of each component of the mixed infection was enhanced when these were present together in an abscess. furthermore, the emergence of encapsulated strains was enhanced in these infections. this synergy enables the organisms to cause more severe local and systemic damage to the host. therapeutic intervention should include the use of antimicrobial agents effective against both the aerobic and anaerobic components  of the mixed infection. unless such therapy is given, the infection may persist.  it is also recommended to use antimicrobials that possess synergy between them against the bacterial pathogens. agents effective against the anaerobic pathogens are metronidazole, clindamycin and cefoxitin. antimicrobials effective against the gram-positive aerobic pathogens and n. gonorrhoeae are spiramycin and penicillins. aminoglycosides or third generation cephalosporins are effective against gram-negative enterics. the combination of metronidazole and spiramycin has shown to be synergistic against mixed infections of bacteroides sp. and n. gonorrhoeae.

TI  == direct and indirect pathogenicity of anaerobic bacteria in respiratory tract infections in children.
AB  == bacteroides sp (bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides oralis, and bacteroides  fragilis), peptostreptococci, and fusobacteria are important pathogens in respiratory tract infections (rti). these organisms are often recovered mixed with other aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic bacteria. evidence supporting their virulence is provided by studies showing their synergistic potentials in mixed infections and their increased virulence when encapsulated. a recent increase in numbers of beta-lactamase producing strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria in rti has been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in eradication of these infections. these infections include chronic  otitis media, chronic sinusitis and mastoiditis, chronic recurrent tonsillitis, and lung abscesses. the pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy but also to protect penicillin susceptible pathogens from that drug. these direct and indirect virulence characteristics of anaerobic bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections. the synergy that exists between different aerobic and anaerobic organisms in the respiratory tract is due to several pathogenic mechanisms. these mechanisms include the production of a capsule, which protects organisms from phagocytosis, and the production of beta-lactamase, which inactivates penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins. both of these mechanisms enhance infection and induce complications. however, more work is necessary to prevent encapsulation and the production of enzymes. data, thus far, indicate that there  are therapeutic modalities that can be used to prevent these occurrences and eliminate many mixed rti.

TI  == [in vitro studies on microbial incorporation of nitrogen from [15n2] urea and [15n]ammonium chloride by human intestinal flora].
AB  == 6 typical bacteria species of the human intestinal flora (e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, streptococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, bifidobacterium sp.) were incubated in a liquid medium for 48 h with [15n2]-urea  and [15n]-ammonium chloride. the rates of [15n]-incorporation were calculated. they depend reproducible on the species examined, on the kind of the offered npn-substance and on the amount of npn-substance in the medium. with [15n2]-urea  the minimal rate of incorporation was 3.8% (e coli) and the maximal one 95.6% (bifidobacterium sp.). with [15n]-ammonium chloride the corresponding figures were 31.0 (proteus vulg.) and 98.0% (bifidobacterium sp.). the findings are discussed with regard to a possible enteral detoxification in uremic patients by  bacterial utilization and elimination of urea and ammonia.

TI  == bacteroides pectinophilus sp. nov. and bacteroides galacturonicus sp. nov.: two pectinolytic bacteria from the human intestinal tract.
AB  == studies on the physiological characteristics of two obligately anaerobic, rod-shaped bacteria from the human intestinal tract indicated that the organisms  represented two previously undescribed species of bacteroides, for which we propose the names bacteroides pectinophilus (type strain, n3) and bacteroides galacturonicus (type strain, n6). both strains were pectinophilic; that is, they  utilized as fermentable substrates for growth only pectin and a few related compounds. the two species differed significantly from each other in guanine plus cytosine content of the dna, in substrate utilization patterns, and in other phenotypic characteristics. both species deesterified pectin by means of an extracellular pectinesterase (ec 3.1.1.11) activity. polygalacturonate (the main  component of deesterified pectin) was depolymerized extracellularly with formation of unsaturated products by both species. the depolymerizing activity required ca2+, functioned at a higher rate when polygalacturonate was the substrate as compared with pectin, and had an alkaline ph optimum. these data, as well as viscosity decrease studies and identification of products formed from polygalacturonate, indicated that the extracellular depolymerizing activity of either species was characteristic of an exopectate (exopolygalacturonate) lyase.  the exopectate lyase activity had an unusual action pattern that resulted in terminal cleavage of unsaturated trigalacturonic acid units from polygalacturonate. an unsaturated trimer was the major product that accumulated in cell-free reaction mixtures, where it was not cleaved further. growing cells of both bacteroides species released the exopectate lyase into the external environment by processes that did not involve cell lysis to any significant extent.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == metabolism of polyethylene glycol by two anaerobic bacteria, desulfovibrio desulfuricans and a bacteroides sp.
AB  == two anaerobic bacteria were isolated from polyethylene glycol (peg)-degrading, methanogenic, enrichment cultures obtained from a municipal sludge digester. one  isolate, identified as desulfovibrio desulfuricans (strain dg2), metabolized oligomers ranging from ethylene glycol (eg) to tetraethylene glycol. the other isolate, identified as a bacteroides sp. (strain pg1), metabolized diethylene glycol and polymers of peg up to an average molecular mass of 20,000 g/mol [peg 20000; ho-(ch2-ch2-o-)nh]. both strains produced acetaldehyde as an intermediate, with acetate, ethanol, and hydrogen as end products. in coculture with a methanobacterium sp., the end products were acetate and methane. polypropylene glycol [ho-(ch2-ch2-ch2-o-)nh] was not metabolized by either bacterium, and methanogenic enrichments could not be obtained on this substrate. cell extracts of both bacteria dehydrogenated eg, pegs up to peg 400 in size, acetaldehyde, and other mono- and dihydroxylated compounds. extracts of bacteroides strain pg1 could not dehydrogenate long polymers of peg (greater than or equal to 1,000 g/mol), but the bacterium grew with peg 1000 or peg 20000 as a substrate and therefore possesses a mechanism for peg depolymerization not present in cell extracts. in contrast, extracts of d. desulfuricans dg2 dehydrogenated long polymers of peg, but whole cells did not grow with these polymers as substrates.  this indicated that the bacterium could not convert peg to a product suitable for uptake.

TI  == anaerobic osteomyelitis in children.
AB  == twenty-six pediatric patients with osteomyelitis caused by anaerobic bacteria are presented. the etiologic factors were chronic mastoiditis (7 patients), decubitus ulcers (5), chronic sinusitis (4), periodontal abscesses (3), bites (3), paronychia (2), trauma (1) and scalp infection after fetal monitoring (1). seventy-four organisms (2.8 isolates/specimen), including 63 anaerobes (2.4/specimen), and 11 facultative and aerobic bacteria (0.4/specimen) were recovered. the predominant organisms were anaerobic cocci (29 isolates), bacteroides sp. (21), fusobacterium sp. (8), streptococcus sp. (5) and clostridium sp. (4). the organisms generally reflected the microbial flora of the mucous surface adjacent to the infected site. ten beta-lactamase-producing organisms were recovered from 7 (27%) patients. these included all isolates of the bacteroides fragilis (4) and of staphylococcus aureus (3), 2 of the 12 bacteroides melaninogenicus group and 1 of 3 bacteroides oralis. the clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of anaerobic osteomyelitis in children are discussed.

TI  == occurrence of clindamycin-resistant anaerobic bacteria isolated from cultures taken following clindamycin therapy.
AB  == mics of clindamycin were determined by the agar dilution method against anaerobic organisms isolated from endometrial cultures in women with pelvic soft tissue infections. cultures were obtained from 100 women both before and after clindamycin therapy, from 107 women before therapy with clindamycin or another antimicrobial agent or after treatment with an antimicrobial agent other than clindamycin, and from 9 women 1 to 9 weeks after they were discharged from the hospital following clindamycin therapy. only 5 (0.7%) of 685 isolates tested from women who had not received clindamycin therapy were resistant to clindamycin. from the 100 cultures taken immediately after clindamycin therapy, 57 anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 28 cultures. of the 40 anaerobic organisms for which  mics of clindamycin were determined, 25 (62.5%) were resistant to clindamycin (mic greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). the most common organisms isolated after therapy were the anaerobic gram-positive cocci (of which 32 isolates were discovered); of 28 coccal isolates tested, 64% were clindamycin resistant. four of seven (57%) of the bacteroides isolates tested, one unidentified gram-positive nonsporing rod, one unidentified gram-negative coccus, and one mobiluncus sp. were also clindamycin resistant. of 18 anaerobic isolates  from the nine cultures taken 1 to 9 weeks after hospital discharge, 55% were resistant to clindamycin. the clinical significance of these findings is unknown  since all patients recovered without incident and remained well. however, the data suggest that physicians need to be aware that patients with recent exposure  to clindamycin may have clindamycin-resistant anaerobic organisms in a current infection. this may prevent the infection from responding to clindamycin treatment.

TI  == microbiologic features and treatment of persistent peritonitis in patients in the intensive care unit.
AB  == the charts of 25 patients who died in the intensive care unit of persistent peritonitis after abdominal operations were reviewed to determine the microbial flora and the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. all patients had undergone two or more surgical procedures for abdominal sepsis and 23 had at least three-system organ failure. the most common organisms cultured were: staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 cultures from 16 patients, candida albicans, 19 cultures from 10  patients, pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 cultures from 12 patients, enterobacter, 16  cultures from 8 patients and enterococcus, 14 cultures from 8 patients. the classic isolates, escherichia coli (11 cultures from six patients) and bacteroides fragilis (4 cultures from three patients) were found infrequently. to determine the adequacy of antimicrobial therapy for this "new" flora, we examined the ability of appropriate agents to eradicate the micro-organism upon subsequent culture. candida sp. were eradicated in 54% (6 of 11) of the assessable cases, while enterococcus and s. epidermidis were cleared in only 25% and 28% respectively. the spectrum of intra-abdominal organisms cultured from critically  ill surgical patients in the intensive care unit differs from that seen in those  with acute peritonitis. despite administration of appropriate antimicrobial agents, these organisms tend to persist, probably reflecting impaired host defences with multiple-system organ failure rather than antimicrobial failure.

TI  == evidence that polygalacturonic acid may not be a major source of carbon and energy for some colonic bacteroides species.
AB  == five bacteroides species that are found in the human colon can utilize polygalacturonic acid (pga) when they are grown in laboratory media: bacteroides  thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides fragilis  subsp. a, and bacteroides sp. strain 3452a (an unnamed dna-dna homology group). pga-degrading enzymes from b. thetaiotaomicron have been isolated and characterized previously. to determine whether a pga lyase activity in human feces could be attributed to any of these species, we first determined the properties of pga lyases from the other four bacteroides species. pga lyases from all the bacteroides species were soluble, cell associated, and inducible by pga.  all had similar ph optima (8.4 to 8.8) and similar molecular weights (50,000). all activities were enhanced by calcium. the pga lyases from the five species differed with respect to isoelectric point: b. thetaiotaomicron (pi 7.5), b. vulgatus (pi 7.7), b. ovatus (pi 5.8, 7.2), b. fragilis subsp. a (pi 6.1), and bacteroides sp. strain 3452a (pi 7.7). the pga lyase activity in human feces resembled those of the bacteroides pga lyases in that it had a ph optimum of 8.4  to 8.8 and was enhanced by calcium. however, it differed from the bacteroides pga lyases both with respect to isoelectric point (pi 4.2 to 4.4) and molecular weight (100,000). on the basis of these findings, it appears that the pga lyase activity in human feces is not produced by any of the bacteroides species surveyed in this survey. moreover, there was no detectable pga lyase activity in  feces that had the same properties as the bacteroides enzymes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == antibacterial activity of roxithromycin: a laboratory evaluation.
AB  == roxithromycin, formerly known as ru 28965 (9-[o [(2-methoxyethoxy)methyl]oxime]-erythromycin), is a novel 14 atom-membered semisynthetic macrolide with an antibacterial spectrum directed towards gram-positive cocci and bacilli, gram-negative cocci and some parvobacteriaceae.  the in vitro antibacterial activity of roxithromycin was compared with those of erythromycin and spiramycin against 275 clinical isolates by using 2-fold broth macro-dilution tests. the antibacterial spectrum of roxithromycin and erythromycin were qualitatively comparable (including the bacteriostatic type of  activity and the profile of resistance), but minimal inhibitory concentrations of erythromycin were generally one half those of roxithromycin, except for corynebacterium sp. and bacteroides fragilis against which the new macrolide was  more active. on the other hand, roxithromycin exhibited a superior in vivo antibacterial activity in laboratory animals, being up to six times more potent than erythromycin in curing experimentally infected mice. roxithromycin showed high blood levels and long half-lives of elimination in rodents after oral administration, and its bioavailability amounted to 72% in mice and 85% in rats,  compared to less than 10% for erythromycin. roxithromycin was widely distributed  throughout the body with a high degree of penetration into all tissues, particularly in the lungs.

(1 strain), beta-streptococcus (1 strain), gram-positive rods (2  strains), enterobacter cloacae (1 strain), bacteroides bivius (1 strain), pseudomonas sp. (1 strain), pseudomonas cepacia (1 strain) and gram-negative rods (1 strain) were eradicated by the mk-0787/mk-0791 treatment. the safety of the drug was analyzed in 22 patients, effects occurred in 3 (13.6%). among those 3 patients, diarrhea occurred in 1 patient, rash in another and nausea and vomiting in yet another. one patient had an increased bun after the mk-0787/mk-0791 treatment. in the other 21 patients, no abnormalities in creatinine, got, gpt, or t. bil. values were observed. it may be concluded that mk-0787/mk-0791 is useful  for the treatment of obstetrical and gynecological infections.

TI  == comparison of proteins involved in chondroitin sulfate utilization by three colonic bacteroides species.
AB  == three species of colonic bacteria can ferment the mucopolysaccharide chondroitin  sulfate: bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides sp. strain 3452a (an unnamed dna homology group), and b. thetaiotaomicron. proteins associated with the utilization of chondroitin sulfate by b. thetaiotaomicron have been characterized previously. in this report we compare chondroitin lyases and chondroitin sulfate-associated outer membrane polypeptides of b. ovatus and bacteroides sp. strain 3452a with those of b. thetaiotaomicron. all three species produce two soluble cell-associated chondroitin lyases, chondroitin lyase i and ii. purified  enzymes from the three species have similar ph optima, km values, and molecular weights. however, peptide mapping experiments show that the chondroitin lyases from b. ovatus and bacteroides sp. strain 3452a are not identical to those of b.  thetaiotaomicron. a cloned gene that codes for the chondroitin lyase ii from b. thetaiotaomicron hybridized on a southern blot with dna from b. ovatus or bacteroides sp. strain 3452a only when low-stringency conditions were used. antibody to chondroitin lyase ii from b. thetaiotaomicron did not cross-react with chondroitin lyase ii from b. ovatus or bacteroides sp. strain 3452a. chondroitin lyase activity in all three species was inducible by chondroitin sulfate. b. ovatus and bacteroides sp. strain 3452a, like b. thetaiotaomicron, have outer membrane polypeptides that appear to be regulated by chondroitin sulfate, but the chondroitin sulfate-associated outer membrane polypeptides differ in molecular weight. despite these differences, the ability of intact bacteria to utilize chondroitin sulfate, as indicated by growth yields in carbohydrate-limited continuous culture and the rate at which the chondroitin lyases were induced, was the same for all three species.

AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of pefloxacin were evaluated by agar dilution for 3422 bacterial strains isolated in nine hospitals. enterobacteriaceae proved very sensitive to pefloxacin: 62 p. 100 of 1743 strains tested had mic less than or equal to 0.12 and 90 p. 100 less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml; but the percent of strains with mic greater than or equal to 2 varied among the different groups of enterobacteriaceae: 2.7 p. 100 for e. coli to 39 p. 100 for serratia. 55 p. 100 for pseudomonas and 81 p. 100 of acinetobacter were inhibited by 1 micrograms/ml or less (mode mic 1 and 0.5 micrograms/ml). haemophilus sp.: 0.03 and 0.06 micrograms/ml and gonococci were very sensitive to pefloxacin. the spectrum of pefloxacin extended to gram positive cocci: mic of staphylococci were 0.06 to 8 micrograms/ml (mode mic: 0.5); enterococci, other streptococci and pneumococci were less sensitive: 2 and  4 micrograms/ml for the majority of strains. concerning anaerobic bacteria, pefloxacin was more active against clostridium (0.5 to 1 microgram/ml generally), than against bacteroides (4 to 16 micrograms/ml).

TI  == dna probes for identification of clinically important bacteroides species.
AB  == conventional procedures for identifying gram-negative anaerobes such as bacteroides spp. are cumbersome and time-consuming. a simpler approach would be to use dna probes to identify these organisms. since many different species of gram-negative anaerobes are isolated from clinical specimens, the most useful dna probes would be probes that identify a few clinically significant groups of anaerobes. to obtain such probes, we cloned hindiii-digested chromosomal dna from various bacteroides species and then screened these probes, labeled with 32p by nick translation, for hybridization to dna from various species of bacteroides, fusobacterium, and other gram-negative bacteria. we identified three dna probes (pbfii-4, pbfii-5, and pbfii-6) that hybridized specifically to dna from bacteroides fragilis, the species that accounts for about half of all isolates from clinical specimens containing anaerobes. we identified one dna probe (pbe-3) that hybridized to all members of the b. fragilis group, a group of species that  resemble b. fragilis with respect to fermentation pattern and antibiotic resistances. we also identified one probe (pbo-21) that hybridized to dna from all bacteroides sp. strains as well as to dna from strains of fusobacterium necrophorum and fusobacterium nucleatum. pbo-21, but not pbe-3, cross-hybridized  with a cloned bacteroides sp. 16s rrna gene. the limit of detection for these probes was 10(6) bacteria. the probes could detect b. fragilis in blood culture medium and in mixed cultures with other gram-negative bacteria. attempts to use biotin-labeled dna probes instead of 32p-labeled probes were not successful because the bacteroides sp. extracts contained material that bound the streptoavidin-peroxidase detection reagent.

TI  == bacteroides xylanolyticus sp. nov., a xylanolytic bacterium from methane producing cattle manure.
AB  == as part of a study of the biogas production from cattle waste, xylanolytic bacteria were isolated from enrichments of fermenting cattle manure. from 34 isolates, mostly gram-negative rods, a typical strain was investigated in more detail. it was an anaerobic non-sporeforming, gram-negative rod, which was motile with peritrichous flagella. this organism fermented xylan and many soluble sugars (glucose, cellobiose, mannose, xylose, arabinose). other hemicelluloses such as gum xanthan, laminaran, locust bean gum, and gum arabic were not utilized. it also could not use cellulose. fermentation products were carbon dioxide, hydrogen, acetate and ethanol. the bacterium produced carboxymethylcellulase and  xylanase, especially when growing on xylan. growth was optimal between 25 degrees c and 40 degrees c and between ph 6.5 and 7.5. the guanine plus cytosine content  of the dna was 34.8 +/- 0.8%. the isolate was identified as a member of the genus bacteroides, and a new species is proposed: bacteroides xylanolyticus (xylan dissolving). the type strain of b. xylanolyticus is strain x5-1 (dsm 3808).

AB  == s6472 is a mixture of cefaclor (ccl) granules with gastric-soluble coating and those with enteric-soluble coating at the ratio (in potency) of 4 to 6. with administration of this formulation, a prolonged blood level of ccl is obtained. s6472 and ccl were administered orally to 19 healthy male volunteers between 20 and 27 years of age (mean: 23 years) weighing between 51 and 80 kg (mean: 64.7 kg). four subjects were given 2 capsules and 5 subjects were given 4 capsules each containing 187.5 mg of s6472, 30 minutes after breakfast and supper for 5 days. five subjects were given 1 capsule and 5 subjects were given 2 capsules each containing 250 mg of ccl 30 minutes after breakfast, lunch and supper for 5  days. the number of fecal bacteria was examined 5 days before the start of administration, the day of the start of administration, 3 and 5 days after the start of administration, and 3, 5 and 10 days after the end of administration. concentration of ccl in feces and susceptibility of isolated fecal bacteria (at the inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml) to ccl were examined. adverse reactions and  the effects on laboratory test values were also checked. in 4 subjects receiving  375 mg of s6472 twice a day, the mean population of e. coli was 10(7)-10(9) cells/g feces on all days of observation. there was no effect on the population of klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp. enterobacter sp. and other enterobacteriaceae. the mean population of all enterobacteriaceae was 10(8)-10(9) cells/g feces on all days of observation. the population of other gram-negative bacilli did not show a consistent change, either. there was no effect on the population of gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus sp., enterococcus, sp., micrococcus sp., and of candida sp. among anaerobic bacteria, bacteroides sp. showed the mean population of 10(10) cells/g feces on all days of examination. c. difficile was isolated from 2 subjects out of 4 at the level of 10(2)-10(3) cells/g feces 5 days after the start of administration and 3 days after the end of administration. however, there was no production of toxin in either of the 2 subjects. in another subject, c. difficile was isolated at 10(2)-10(4) cells/g feces with a toxin titre of 10(-3)-10(-4) 3 and 5 days after the start of administration and 10 days after the end of administration. the total population  of anaerobic bacteria was 10(10)-10(11) cells/g feces on all days of examination.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == evaluation of selective media for primary isolation of treponema hyodysenteriae and treponema innocens.
AB  == a total of 2450 samples of feces, intestinal contents and colon mucosal scrapings were bacteriologically examined. a total of 53 strains of treponema sp. were isolated, and 45 strains of bacteroides sp., 30 strains of e. coli, 30 strains of micrococcus sp. and 10 strains of streptococcus d isolates were randomly selected. growth promoting studies showed statistically significant stimulation of treponema sp. growth by yeast extract, chicken egg yolk and rumen fluid. different growth inhibitors were also tested. for selective medium the following  inhibitors were selected: spectinomycin, colistin, vancomycin, brilliant green. optimal concentrations of these inhibitors in the medium were determined. finally tsa medium supplemented with 0.05% yeast extract, 5% bovine blood, 0.01% dtt, 400 micrograms spectinomycin, and 250 micrograms/ml vancomycin, appeared to be optimal selective medium for intestinal treponema sp. isolation. quantitative studies showed that the number of treponema c.f.u. on songers et al. medium with  spectinomycin and on spectinomycin-vancomycin medium, did not differ significantly. the number of overgrowing bacteria was statistically significantly lower on spectinomycin-vancomycin medium, than songers et al. selective medium with spectinomycin. the tsa supplemented with blood, yeast extract 50 micrograms/ml of colistin and 1 microgram/ml of brilliant green was less selective than spectinomycin-vancomycin medium and inhibited some strains of treponema sp. in the case of spectinomycin-vancomycin resistant of overgrowing bacteria, colistin-brilliant green medium may be suitable for isolation of treponema sp.

AB  == clinical isolates of agar-pitting, formate-fumarate-requiring, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were recharacterized in consideration of the species descriptions of bacteroides ureolyticus and the newly described b. gracilis, campylobacter concisus, and wolinella sp. during an 11-year period, 7.5% (101 of  1,341) of all specimens yielding anaerobes were found to contain an organism in this group. of the 71 isolates that were available for study, 43 were b. ureolyticus, 23 were b. gracilis, and 5 were in the wolinella-c. concisus group.  the role in infection and patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility for b. ureolyticus and b. gracilis were studied. review of the clinical data indicated that 83% of b. gracilis strains were recovered from patients with serious visceral or head and neck infection, whereas 73% of b. ureolyticus isolates were  recovered from superficial soft-tissue or bone infections. the strains of b. ureolyticus were uniformly susceptible to the tested antimicrobial agents. b. gracilis, however, showed some striking resistance, with penicillin active against only 67% and the cephalosporins active against 67 to 84% of the isolates  tested. the association of b. gracilis with serious deep-tissue infection, coupled with the relatively high frequency of antibiotic resistance, indicates that it is an important, previously unrecognized, pathogen.

TI  == the establishment of reproducible, complex communities of oral bacteria in the chemostat using defined inocula.
AB  == nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant ph 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. the bacterial populations were streptococcus mutans atcc 2-27351, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitior ef 186, actinomyces viscosus wvu 627, lactobacillus casei ac 413, neisseria sp. a1078, veillonella alkalescens atcc 17745, bacteroides intermedius  t 588 and fusobacterium nucleatum nctc 10593. all nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although strep. sanguis and neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. in contrast, even following repeated inoculations, strep. mutans, b. intermedius and neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. a more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring  among community members. to compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. the bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used  as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities  of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.

TI  == [clinical studies on fosfomycin sodium following intravenous administration (tissue concentration and clinical efficacy)].
AB  == fosfomycin (fom) is a synthetic antibiotic having a unique structural formula and bactericidal mechanism and a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against various bacterial species. it has higher activity in vivo than in vitro. as therapy, fom-na in a daily dose of 4 g (2 g x 2) was given by intravenous drip infusion for 5 to 10 days to 6 cases with infectious diseases (2 cases of acute cholecystitis, 3 cases of acute localized peritonitis due to phlegmonous appendicitis and 1 case of acute diffuse peritonitis due to perforative appendicitis). the clinical response was rated as "excellent" in 1 case, "good" in 4 cases, "fair" in 1 case and "poor" in none. no adverse effects were observed in any of the patients. six clinical isolates were obtained, and these consisted  of 4 strains of escherichia coli and 1 strain each of klebsiella pneumoniae, and  bacteroides fragilis. the mics of fom were from 6.25 to 12.5 micrograms/ml for e. coli, 50 micrograms/ml for k. pneumoniae, and 100 micrograms/ml for b. fragilis.  fom-na was administered to the 6 cases intravenously in a dose of 2 g before surgery, and tissue specimens and body fluid samples were taken during the operation. the fom concentration was determined by bioassay with a proteus sp. (mb 838) as the test organism. the mean fom concentration in bile from the common bile duct was 61.85 +/- 17.13 micrograms/ml (n = 5) at 95 to 108 minutes after fom-na intravenous bolus injection. the mean fom concentration in the gall bladder bile was 80.06 +/- 92.36 micrograms/ml, while that in the gall bladder wall was 146.65 +/- 39.10 micrograms/g. the mean fom concentration in purulent ascites was 58.20 +/- 13.29 micrograms/ml, 36.22 +/- 14.63 micrograms/g in the appendix wall and 12.64 +/- 11.34 micrograms/ml in pus in the appendix. the fom concentrations in the infected tissues and body fluids thus exceeded the mics of  fom for the pathogenic bacteria. therefore, fom-na appears to be a very useful drug when used for chemotherapy of infections encountered in the surgical field.

(mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

AB  == in the present study we sought to determine whether serum antibody was present against microorganisms which predominate in the subgingival flora of young adults with generalized severe periodontitis (sp). subjects with sp were often seropositive for eubacterium brachy, fusobacterium nucleatum e3c22, and peptostreptococcus micros, whereas subjects with juvenile periodontitis (jp) and  subjects with healthy periodontium (hp) were not. both sp and jp subjects were more frequently seropositive for bacteroides gingivalis, f. nucleatum d52b16, and f. nucleatum e1d1 than were hp subjects. the data were most striking for b. gingivalis, for which both the incidence and the magnitude of specific antibody was clearly elevated for sp and jp subject groups. however, sp subjects generally had either a high antibody titer or no detectable titer. in contrast, jp and hp subjects generally had at least very small amounts of antibody. except at very low levels of antibody, neither sp nor jp groups differed significantly from the  hp group for antibody to eubacterium nodatum, bacteroides intermedius (homology group 4197 or 8944), or lactobacillus minutus antibody. there was a high frequency of antibody to e. nodatum, with very high titers in all groups despite  the fact that this organism is rarely found in hp subjects. for eubacterium timidum, the jp group was clearly more frequently seropositive than the hp group. despite high levels of l. minutus in subgingival flora, none of the 50 sp subjects had a detectable antibody titer, and only four of the hp and jp subjects had detectable antibody. these results indicate that many organisms in the subgingival flora elicit antibody responses. b. gingivalis is probably the best example among the species tested. however, some organisms that are present in high concentration, e.g., l. minutus, apparently fail to induce significant antibody responses.

AB  == pyogenic infections of cattle, sheep and goats were examined for the presence of  a gram positive bacterium that has been designated "microaerophilic coccus" by other workers. the bacterium was found to be involved in a range of disease processes, including foot and soft tissue abscesses, mastitis, pericarditis and pyometra in cattle, joint and foot abscesses in sheep and foot abscesses in goats. the characteristic feature of the bacterium was its satellitic growth around colonies of other organisms. the microaerophilic coccus was usually part of a mixed flora, which included corynebacterium pyogenes, fusobacterium necrophorum, peptostreptococcus indolicus and bacteroides sp.

TI  == impact of injectable cephalosporins on the gastrointestinal microflora: observations in healthy volunteers and hospitalized patients.
AB  == a disturbed microbiological ecosystem of the gut flora is frequently seen as a consequence of antibiotic therapy. because this impact on the physiological balance is known to be causative for severe nosocomial infections and is mainly seen with antibiotics that are massively excreted via the bile (e.g. broadspectrum penicillins, ceftriaxone and cefoperazone), we investigated cefotaxime (ctx), cefotiam (ctm), cefmenoxime (cmx), ceftazidime (caz), ceftizoxime (czx) and cefazolin + netilmicin (cez + ntl) in healthy volunteers. the respective daily i.v. doses, days of medication and numbers of volunteers were: ctx 3 g, 1 d, n = 8; ctm 6 g, 3 d, n = 15; cmx 4 g, 3 d, n = 15; caz 4 g, 1 d, n = 8; czx 4 g, 1 d, n = 8; cez + ntl 2 x 3 g + 1 x 3 mg/kg/day, 4 d, n = 15.  ctx was also investigated in 11 selected hospitalized patients. one or two stool  specimens were taken before, during and several days after medication. the microorganisms were also tested for ampicillin and cez resistance on selective media. ampicillin and cez resistance was much higher in hospitalized patients than in volunteers (mainly proteus and serratia sp.): 90% vs. 42% and 63.6% vs. 43%, respectively. ctx did not affect the anaerobes (bacteroides sp. and lactobacilli) that are antagonistic to clostridia and candida. no selection of strains resistant to ampicillin or cez occurred. in hospitalized patients, the level of resistance to these drugs was lower after treatment than before.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == respiratory infections: clinical evaluation.
AB  == a review of clinical studies of piperacillin shows that it is valuable for the treatment of respiratory infections due to enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas sp, anaerobes, and mixed flora including anaerobes. various studies of a total of 420 patients treated with piperacillin for lower respiratory tract infections found that 97% of the patients were cured or markedly improved. piperacillin has also been found as effective as combination therapy (gentamicin or tobramycin plus carbenicillin or ticarcillin) in the treatment of serious infections, including pneumonia and several caused by gram-negative organisms and anaerobic organisms.  a review of the literature on bacteriological responses to piperacillin shows that 126 of 153 (82%) of the susceptible strains could be eradicated. streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, peptostreptococcus sp, bacteroides sp, and fusobacterium sp have been completely  eradicated by treatment with piperacillin. most of the published studies indicate that therapy with the drug is usually well tolerated.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of three new quinolone antibiotics against recent clinical isolates.
AB  == new orally absorbable quinolone derivatives, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin demonstrated excellent activity in vitro against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, proteus mirabilis, proteus sp. indole-positive, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococci. none of the 3 drugs was more than moderately effective against bacteroides fragilis. ciprofloxacin was 2-4 times more effective against most gram-negative strains than was either norfloxacin or  ofloxacin, and was also the most effective against gram-positive strains, though  the difference was less marked. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were almost equally effective against s. aureus. results with agar and with broth were comparable. the activities of all 3 drugs were essentially independent of inoculum size, as the mic values increased less than one dilution step when the inoculum was increased from 10(3) to 10(6). the new quinolone derivatives would appear to be promising alternatives to injectable drugs such as the aminoglycosides and cephalosporins.

TI  == risk factors for prematurity and premature rupture of membranes: a prospective study of the vaginal flora in pregnancy.
AB  == prematurity remains a major cause of perinatal mortality in the united states. some research has indicated that infectious agents play a role in either initiating preterm labor, causing premature rupture of the membranes, or preventing tocolysis. this study attempted to determine if the presence of various vaginal pathogens in early pregnancy was associated with the subsequent development of premature rupture of membranes or preterm labor. we found that among 233 evaluable patients those with trichomonas vaginalis were significantly  more likely to have premature rupture of the membranes (p less than 0.03), and those with bacteroides sp. were more likely to be delivered of their infants before 37 weeks (p less than 0.03) and to have infants weighing less than 2500 gm (p less than 0.05). those with ureaplasma urealyticum more frequently began preterm labor (p less than 0.05). preterm premature rupture of the membranes was  found significantly more often among patients with bacteroides sp. stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that those associations were not  related to the number of previous abortions, deliveries, or preterm deliveries or to maternal age. we conclude that microbiologic screening in early pregnancy may  aid in the assessment of patient risk for preterm delivery.

AB  == tonsils were obtained from 22 young adults (mean age, 23 years) suffering from chronic tonsillitis. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained from core tonsillar cultures in all patients, yielding an average of 9.0 isolates (5.3 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. the predominant anaerobic isolates were  bacteroides sp, fusobacterium sp, and gram-positive cocci. the predominant aerobic isolates were alpha-hemolytic streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, branhamella catarrhalis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and hemophilus sp. beta-lactamase-production was noted in 32 isolates recovered from 18 tonsils (82%). these included all eight isolates of s aureus and five b fragilis, and 11  of 24 b melaninogenicus group (46%). our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature of deep tonsillar flora in young adults with chronic tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of beta-lactamase-producing organisms in most of the patients.

AB  == aural fistula is a congenital deformity of the external ear relatively common in  orientals and rare in caucasians. suppuration tends to occur, and chemotherapy rather than surgical drainage should be attempted. however, the lack of information concerning infected aural fistulas has made appropriate chemotherapy  difficult. microorganisms isolated from 13 cases of infected aural fistulas were  studied from january 1981 to december 1982. six species and 22 strains were isolated; nonsporeforming faculative anaerobes were detected in 12 cases. the isolated pathogens included peptococcus sp (10 cases), peptostreptococcus sp (3), bacteroides sp (3), and fusobacterium sp (2). one case exhibited only staphylococcus aureus. our data also stresses the etiologic importance of anaerobic gram-positive cocci in infected aural fistulas.

TI  == human neutrophil migration under agarose to bacteria associated with the development of gingivitis.
AB  == in clinically healthy gingiva and increasingly with the development of inflammation, neutrophils are found in the gingival tissues and sulcus. this study evaluated the relative ability of bacteria associated with gingival health  and developing inflammation to stimulate this increase in neutrophil accumulation. dialyzed bacterial sonic extracts (be) in buffer and pooled human serum (phs) from pure cultures of streptococcus sanguis. actinomyces viscosus, a  naeslundii, bacteroides intermedius, fusobacterium sp and veillonella sp were tested for stimulation of human neutrophil migration under agarose. in addition,  fractions of s sanguis culture fluids (cfs) from sephadex g-10 chromatography were evaluated. all be solutions were incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees c and heat-inactivated prior to testing. all bes in buffer attracted neutrophils, with  the greatest responses seen to s sanguis and b intermedius followed by a viscosus. migration to all bes in phs was greater than in buffer, suggesting that all bes are capable of generating serum chemoattractants. a viscosus be activated serum attractants to the greatest degree. cfs of s sanguis, a viscosus, and to a  lesser degree, fusobacterium sp, also attracted neutrophils. evidence from [3h]fmlp competitive ligand-binding assays indicated that s sanguis cfs contained low molecular weight (less than 700) chemoattractants, which were probably formylmethionyl oligopeptide-like materials. of the bacteria associated with health, s sanguis and a viscosus appeared at least as able to generate chemoattractants during growth or with exposure to serum as bacteria associated with gingivitis. this observation suggests that these "healthy" bacteria, which are found in greater numbers with developing inflammation, may mediate increased  neutrophil transmigration in early disease.

TI  == infection and the use of antibiotics in crohn's disease.
AB  == many patients with crohn's disease present with the complications of infection. hence, antibiotics play an important role in the medical management of acute inflammatory disease, persistent perianal disease and as prophylaxis for surgical operations. the author's group has demonstrated that bacteria colonize the serosa of the bowel in patients with crohn's disease in 27% of cases. furthermore, pathogenic bacteria could be recovered from the lymph nodes in 33% of patients with crohn's disease, compared with only 5% in a controlled population. extraintestinal bacterial colonization was, therefore, present in approximately half of all patients requiring an operation for crohn's disease. the principal bacteria isolated at these sites were escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, proteus sp and diphtheroids. a prospective controlled trial on the use of 1 month's antimicrobial therapy in patients with relapse of crohn's disease revealed that metronidazole was associated with a 57% response rate, compared with a response of only 17% in patients receiving no metronidazole. these interim findings suggest that metronidazole may have a role in the management of acute relapse in patients with crohn's disease.

(mode mic 32 and 8 micrograms/ml respectively).  haemophilus sp. (mic 0.01-0.03) and neisseria (mic less than 0,008-0,016) are very susceptible to the drug. the mic of methicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococcus aureus varies from 1 to 4 micrograms/ml ; enterococci are less susceptible, whereas other streptococci and pneumococci have low mics (less than  0.008-0.025). the susceptibility of anaerobic pathogens varies widely between species, and within species ; mic ranges from 0.008 to 32 micrograms/ml for clostridium sp. and 0.25 to 128 micrograms/ml for bacteroides sp.

TI  == isolation and identification of adherent epimural bacteria during succession in young lambs.
AB  == successive changes in aerobic and anaerobic bacterial counts and changes in the generic composition of the epimural community in lambs from 1 to 10 weeks were determined. bacterial culture counts revealed a predominantly anaerobic community, with the mean anaerobic count being 1.4 x 10(7) cfu/cm2 of tissue surface. the aerobic count was highest at 1 week of age and declined significantly thereafter to a mean of 1.8 x 10(4) cfu/cm2, thus representing only 0.13% of the mean anaerobic count after week 1. of the 345 strains isolated anaerobically at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks of age, 47, 32, 12, 32, 2, and 5% were capable of growth in a partially reduced medium, indicating a reduction in the number of facultative anaerobes with time. the majority of isolated strains were identified as belonging to genera commonly isolated from rumen contents. in  some instances, however, strains did not correspond to previously described species, and some genera were present in proportions different from those expected in rumen fluid. at three of the sampling times, one genus was dominant,  constituting 45 to 55% of the isolates. these dominant isolates were streptococcus bovis, bacteroides sp., and an anaerobic streptococcus sp. for weeks 1, 2, and 10, respectively. during the transition period (weeks 4 to 8), two or more groups were codominant.

AB  == the gnotobiotic gerbil was selected as a model with which to study the effects of colonization with a defined microflora on organ morphology, histology, and selected blood biochemical parameters. gerbils were maintained germfree for 13 months but failed to reproduce, presumably because of the enlarged cecum. a colony of gnotobiotic gerbils that was associated with a bacterial flora consisting of lactobacillus brevis, streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacteroides vulgatus, enterobacter aerogenes, and a fusobacterium sp. was established. these gnotobiotic gerbils had smaller ceca than germfree gerbils and proved capable of reproduction. except for the presence of large numbers of bacteroides organisms in the stomach and greater numbers of s. epidermidis in gnotobiotic gerbils, the number and location of gastrointestinal bacteria were similar in conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils. bacteroides sp. was the second most predominant microorganism present in gnotobiotic gerbils, whereas clostridia were reported to be the second most predominant microorganism  in conventional gerbils. microscopic examination of direct-impression smears indicated that fusobacteria were present on mucosal surfaces. intestines of gnotobiotic gerbils weighed twice as much as the intestines of conventional gerbils. intestinal tissue water weight values from conventional and gnotobiotic  gerbils were similar. histological examination of gerbil intestinal tissue revealed no cellular hypertrophy and no evidence of inflammation in gnotobiotic gerbil intestines. spleens of gnotobiotic gerbils showed no germinal center stimulation. statistical differences in total serum glucose, serum protein, and hematocrit levels were found between conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils.

AB  == the development of the normal intestinal microflora of the small intestine, caecum and large intestine of specific pathogen-free (spf) chickens, was studied  in the period from hatching to 84 days of age. no bacteria were detected in any of the sites at hatchery (day 1), but by day 3 significant levels of faecal streptococci and coliforms were isolated from all sites. the flora of the small intestine was limited to faecal streptococci and coliforms for the first 40 days  and then lactobacilli became established and dominated the flora. a large variety of facultative and strictly anaerobic organisms colonized the caecum. many of these species were transient and were only present for a limited period; after 40 days the flora stabilized to consist predominantly of faecal streptococci, escherichia coli, bacteroides spp. and lactobacillus sp. the flora of the large intestine was composed of organisms also present in the small intestine or the caecum. these findings differ from previously published studies on conventionally reared chickens in that the number of species isolated and the population levels  of organisms are much lower. this probably reflects the absence of continuous environmental challenge to the chickens because of the housing and feeding facilities in which the chickens were maintained.

TI  == motility as a factor in bowel colonization by roseburia cecicola, an obligately anaerobic bacterium from the mouse caecum.
AB  == roseburia cecicola strain gm is a motile obligate anaerobe that was isolated from mouse caecal mucosa. twenty-five strains of motility mutants were obtained from populations of strain gm (wild-type) that had been exposed to uv light. unlike gm cells, mutant bacteria were either non-motile and non-flagellated (fla-) or migrated slowly or atypically in semi-solid medium. strain gm and two mutant strains, sls (fla-) and wes (atypically motile), were used in mouse colonization  experiments. in separate experiments, each strain colonized (4.8 x 10(9) to 1.5 x 10(10) c.f.u. per g caecum) the caecum of germfree mice inoculated intragastrically with pure cultures of the bacteria. in mice mono-associated with either mutant strain, bacteria which were non-motile or atypically motile predominated in their caeca (greater than 99% of total bacteria recovered). in mice mono-associated with motile cells of strain gm, mutant strains which had lost wild-type motility became predominant in the caecal populations (97% of total bacteria recovered at 48 to 70 days after inoculation). mice mono-associated with either strain sls or strain gm were colonized by one strain  each of escherichia coli, candida pintolopesii, a bacteroides sp., and a clostridium sp. most (99%) of the r. cecicola cells recovered from the caeca of these animals had typical wild-type motility. motility, although not essential for r. cecicola to colonize germfree mice, is apparently advantageous to this bacterium when other micro-organisms are present with it in the mouse caecum. motility may thus be essential for r. cecicola to colonize conventional laboratory mice.

TI  == trends in the development of beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == in many ways it is ironic that the first description of a beta-lactamase occurred in 1940 with an enzyme isolated from escherichia coli since in recent years there has been a major interest in gram-negative species and the development of agents  to overcome the hydrolytic action of beta-lactamases of gram-negative species. there have been four distinctly different approaches to the development of new beta-lactam antibiotics. these have been the search for inhibitors of beta-lactamases and agents such as clavulanic acid and sulbactam are examples of  compounds which by virtue of kcat function act as suicide inhibitors and make old antibiotics new. there has been the modification of the penicillin and cephem nucleus to increase beta-lactamase stability or failing that to improve the ability of the compounds to pass through the cell wall and increase affinity for  critical beta-lactam receptors, i.e. penicillin-binding proteins. there has been  the development of carbapenem type of agents such as imipenem which would have broad activity including aerobic, anaerobic, gram-positive and gram-negative species. there has been the discovery of the monobactam agents of which aztreonam is an example of a compound with great beta-lactamase stability but with activity limited to gram-negative aerobic species. bacterial resistance has indeed been the major factor that has modified use of beta-lactams and influenced the development of the aforementioned types of drugs. the widespread presence of beta-lactamases in common pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis has made it necessary to have beta-lactamase stable compounds for initial therapy of infection. it is possible to analyze structure-activity relations of beta-lactam compounds to determine changes which  will be most advantageous in light of known and expected resistance patterns. but the increased realization in recent years of the importance of the pharmacokinetics of beta-lactam drugs has made it essential that the development  of new compounds be based on an integration of microbiological and pharmacokinetic parameters. interest in the prevention of resistant flora has also affected the development of new drugs since it is increasingly appreciated that alteration of intestinal flora contributes to selection of drug resistant microorganisms. finally, new toxicities or adverse effects associated with the use of certain new agents has modified the development of certain compounds.

AB  == the predominance of anaerobic bacteria in subgingival plaque samples suggests that the pocket environment is anaerobic. in the present investigation, a small oxygen tension (po2) electrode was inserted into the base of the pocket and the po2 was recorded. in addition, the plaque in these pockets was examined culturally and microscopically. the oxygen tension at the bottom of 36 pockets (5 to 10 mm in depth) ranged from 5 to 27 mmhg (1 mmhg congruent to 133.3 pa) with a mean value of 13.3 mmhg. moderate pockets (5 and 6 mm) exhibited a mean po2 of 15.7 mmhg, which was significantly higher than the 12.0 mmhg found in the deeper  pockets. the deep pockets had higher percentages of spirochetes and bacteroides intermedius, whereas the moderate pockets had elevated proportions of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus mutans. the sites with oxygen tensions equal to or less than 15 mmhg had significantly higher percentages of spirochetes, whereas the microaerophilic capnocytophaga species were found in pockets with a po2 greater than 15 mmhg. the presence of bleeding in the pocket was associated with  higher proportions of b. intermedius, capnocytophaga sp., and a. naeslundii. these po2 readings of periodontal pockets indicated that there is a spectrum of po2 values which seem to define, in a general way, the microbiological composition of the pocket.

TI  == in vitro activity of enoxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid, compared with those of norfloxacin, new beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  == enoxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. its activity against 740 bacterial isolates was determined. it inhibited 90% escherichia coli, klebsiella  sp., aeromonas sp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus mirabilis, and morganella morganii at less than or equal to 0.8 micrograms/ml. the majority of pseudomonas aeruginosa was inhibited by less than or equal to 3.1 micrograms/ml.  haemophilus spp. and neisseria spp. were inhibited by less than 0.1 micrograms/ml. although most staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml, some streptococcal species had minimal inhibitory concentrations of 6.3 to 12.5 micrograms/ml and bacteroides sp. had minimal inhibitory concentrations greater than or equal to 25 micrograms/ml. activity of enoxacin and norfloxacin was similar. enoxacin inhibited organisms resistant to cefotaxime, moxalactam, gentamicin, and piperacillin. enoxacin was less active in urine at an acid ph than in broth, but serum did not decrease minimal inhibitory  concentrations or minimal bactericidal concentrations. there was no major difference between minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations. resistance frequency development was less than 10(-9) for most bacterial species.

TI  == pathogenicity of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus group, b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.

TI  == metabolism of bile acid oxazoline derivatives by hepatocyte monolayer cultures and intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == certain bile acid oxazoline derivatives (100 microm), but not corresponding unconjugated bile acids (100 microm), were found to inhibit the growth of eubacterium sp. v.p.i. 12708. the growth inhibition was correlated with the polarity of the steroid portion of the bile acid oxazoline. primary cultures of adult rat hepatocyte monolayer cultures converted [7 epsilon-14c]methylchenooxazoline3 into meoh-h2o soluble derivatives. certain intestinal bacteria were capable of metabolizing [17 epsilon-14c]methylchenooxazoline as well as the meoh-soluble hepatocyte derivative(s). these results suggest that bile acid oxazoline derivatives may undergo hepatic, as well as bacterial metabolism during enterohepatic circulation.

TI  == a descriptive study of rumen digestion in meroxenic lambs according to the nature and complexity of the microflora.
AB  == we studied in meroxenic lambs, i.e. in lambs with a simplified digestive microflora, the effect of the microflora on the quantities of solid feed intake and on the main digestive parameters in the rumen. axenic lambs were inoculated with a more or less complex flora, obtained by diluting (10(-8), 10(-7), 10(-8) a pool of rumen fluid taken either from young conventional lambs before weaning from adult sheep (pool a) or from meroxenic lambs (pool b). a few of these lambs  then were inoculated with a genus of protozoa (entodinium sp. or polyplastron multivesiculatum). the results show that the main digestive parameters depended on the nature of the inocula which the lambs had received. food consumption and volatile fatty acid concentration of the rumen fluid, low in lambs inoculated with the 10(-8) dilution, were higher in lambs inoculated with a more complex microflora (10(-6) and 10(-7) dilutions). the vfa concentration measured in these lambs however was approximately two times lower than that observed in conventional animals at the same age and fed the same feed. food intake and the development of the fermentation pattern were favoured by an early inoculation of  the animals. the complexity of the microflora appears to have influenced the composition of the vfa mixture. the latter was found to consist mainly of acetic  acid in lambs inoculated with the 10(-8) dilution. in lambs which received the 10(-6) dilution, the composition of the vfa mixture was similar to that observed  in conventional lambs. in all animals, except in lambs 10(-8), the ammonia nitrogen concentration of the rumen fluid was found to be higher during the first month after birth (between 100 and 200 mg/l). a subsequent decrease in ammonia nitrogen concentration was observed at two and a half months of age (20 to 40 mg/l). the establishment of protozoa ciliates in the rumen of these lambs was followed by an increase in butyric acid and ammonia nitrogen concentration.

AB  == piperacillin sodium is a beta lactam antibiotic with a broad range of antibacterial activity that includes gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci (except penicillinase-producing s. aureus) and anaerobic pathogens such as clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis. piperacillin inhibits many of the members of the enterobacteriaceae, including klebsiella sp and pseudomonas, at lower concentrations than required for carbenicillin and ticarcillin. piperacillin sodium is administered by intramuscular and intravenous injection and is widely distributed throughout body fluids and tissues. like other newer penicillins, piperacillin is excreted by both renal and biliary mechanisms. the primary route of elimination is by glomerular filtration, which results in high urinary concentrations of the unchanged compound. piperacillin has been approved  for patients with serious infection caused by susceptible strains of specific organisms in intra-abdominal, urinary tract, gynecologic, lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structure, bone and joint, and gonococcal infections and septicemia. as with other penicillins, piperacillin has a low frequency of toxicity. the usual dose of piperacillin in adults with serious infections with normal renal function is 3-4 g every 4-6 hr as a 20-30 min infusion, with a maximum dose of 24 g per day. it is stable in most large volume parenteral solutions. less serious infectins (requiring smaller dosages) may be treated by intramuscular injection; however, no more than 2 g should be given at any one injection site. overall, piperacillin has a greater degree of activity than other penicillins. evidence from prospective studies indicates that piperacillin is a highly effective agent for the treatment of patients with infections caused by susceptible organisms.

(27 strains) and bacteroides fragilis (27 strains).  activities were evaluated at bacteriostatic and also bactericidal levels with particular reference to time of exposure of microbes to the drug. the minimal drug concentrations producing minimal reduction of colony-forming units at time intervals of 3, 6 and 24 hours after exposure to the drug--approximations to the  theoretical bacteriostatic concentrations--were designated as 3-h, 6-h and 24-h mrcs, respectively. conventional mic yielding no turbidity after incubation of antibiotic-containing broth for 24 hours was also determined. the minimal concentrations of the drug producing 99.9% killing at time intervals of 3, 6 and  24 hours after exposure to the drug were designated as 3-h, 6-h and 24-h mlcs, respectively. assuming that the apparent mode of action of a drug is bactericidal when the ratio of bactericidal-bacteriostatic concentrations is low (less than or equal to 4) and bacteriostatic when high (greater than or equal to 8), then cefmetazole appeared to be a bactericidal drug to a considerable number of gram-negative strains when the exposure time exceeded a period of 6 hours. the data that the mode of action of this drug is bactericidal with such relatively brief exposure times--indicating rapid decrease of colony-forming units--would suggest cefmetazole is an excellent antibacterial agent and would be a useful drug in treatment of bacterial infections.

TI  == [fundamental and clinical studies on piperacillin in the field of obstetrics and  gynecology].
AB  == fundamental and clinical studies were made on piperacillin (pipc) and the results were obtained as follows. serum and uterine tissue concentrations of pipc were obtained from 36 to 215 minutes after intravenous single shot of 2 g of pipc. the cervix uteri, endometrium and corpus uteri showed the highest antibiotic levels of 38.0, 43.0 and 33.0 mcg/g, respectively, at 65 minutes after injection, and oviduct and ovary showed the highest level of 31.5 and 28.5 mcg/g at 36 minutes.  its concentrations were sufficiently effective against the major pathogens (gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes) demonstrated in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. pipc was administered 6 patients, including 3 of pelvic peritonitis (isolated organism was e. coli 1), 2 of acute endometritis (klebsiella sp. 1, peptococcus sp. + bacteroides sp. 1) and 1 of acute adnexitis, in a dosage of 1 or 2 g twice or 3 times a day for a period of 5 to 8 days by intravenous administration or intravenous drip infusion. clinical response was obtained excellent in 1 and good in 5. no adverse reaction as observed in any of the cases treated with pipc, nor was there any marked changes in the laboratory findings.

TI  == vulvovaginitis in premenarcheal girls: clinical features and diagnostic evaluation.
AB  == fifty-four premenarcheal patients (median age 5.8 years) with symptoms or signs of vulvovaginitis were studied, and the results of cultures of vaginal secretions were compared with those from an age-matched control group. vaginal discharge was found on examination in 24 of 42 patients with a complaint of discharge, and in two of 12 patients without a complaint of discharge. convincing evidence of bacterial or monilial infection was found in 14 of the 26 patients with discharge on examination, but in none of the 28 patients without discharge (p less than .001). in the latter group pinworm infestation was present in one patient. moniliasis occurred exclusively in girls who were pubertal (p less than .001). four patients were found to have gonorrhea. no patient appeared to have symptoms  or signs caused by bacteroides sp, chlamydia trachomatis, viruses, or trichomonas vaginalis. noninfectious causes were identified in four patients with and 13 without discharge (p less than .025); the most common cause was poor hygiene, implicated in six patients. bubble bath use was implicated in only one patient. in 22 patients, no specific cause could be identified. all patients with poor hygiene as the only cause, and most with no demonstrable etiology, recovered after being advised to institute improved perineal hygiene. patients with vaginal discharge are likely to have specific infections, and therefore cultures should be taken, in particular for neisseria gonorrhoeae. genital pruritus in prepubertal girls has little or no etiologic specificity, but in pubertal girls with vaginal discharge it suggests the presence of monilial vaginitis.

AB  == to evaluate the effects of parenteral cefoperazone therapy upon human fecal flora, fecal specimens obtained from four patients before and during therapy (as  well as after therapy for one patient) were cultured quantitatively for facultative, aerobic, and anaerobic bacteria and for fungi. cefoperazone therapy  was associated with major changes in fecal flora. there was suppression to undetectable levels or an appreciable reduction in all anaerobic bacteria as well as suppression of all initially detected enterobacteriaceae. during therapy, there was acquisition or an increase in counts of candida spp., so that these became the most numerous fecal microorganisms in all patients. in addition, pseudomonas spp. and coagulase-negative staphylococcus sp. were acquired by three patients. these marked alterations in flora have potentially important consequences.

TI  == susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria to n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk0787) and  to other antibiotics.
AB  == the susceptibilities of 462 clinical anaerobic bacterial isolates to n-formimidoyl thienamycin and 16 other currently available and investigational antibiotics were determined by the agar dilution technique. n-formimidoyl thienamycin was significantly more active than the reference antibiotics against  most organisms tested, especially bacteroides sp., including clindamycin-resistant strains. all 462 isolates were inhibited by 4 micrograms of n-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml, and no resistant strains were found in the species tested. n-formimidoyl thienamycin was less active (i.e., had a higher 50% minimal inhibitory concentration) against fusobacterium sp. than clindamycin, sm-1652, and piperacillin, and less active against clostridium difficile than metronidazole, but was equally active or more active than the other reference antibiotics tested.

TI  == bacteremia following dental extractions in patients with and without penicillin prophylaxis.
AB  == this study describes the type, rate and magnitude of bacteremia in 128 patients undergoing dental extractions with and without penicillin prophylaxis. the most prolonged and highest rates of bacteremia occurred in patients undergoing extractions and alveoplasty while under general anesthesia following nasotracheal intubation. the most common aerobes in patients receiving no penicillin were streptococci. bacteroides sp. were detected most often in patients receiving penicillin prophylaxis. the overall bacteremia, streptococcal and polymicrobial bacteremia rates were lowest for the patients receiving penicillin. only two of 66 patients given penicillin prophylaxis had recoverable streptococci in blood cultures. our study indicates that both intravenous and oral penicillin g prophylaxis for dental extractions decreased bacteremia rates significantly, including the recovery of streptococci.

TI  == recovery of microorganisms from synovial and pleural fluids of animals using hyperosmolar media.
AB  == l-phase (cwd) broth and plate media were used in parallel with conventional microbiological media during a 3-year period for culturing synovial and pleural fluids of animals. two kinds of recoveries were obtained where parallel conventional methods were negative: (1) parent or normal bacteria, in very low numbers; and (2) type b cwd variants in equally low numbers. organisms in group 1 were: streptococcus zooepidemicus from horses (2x); beta-hemolytic streptococci,  lancefield gp. g (2x); staphylococcus aureus; actinobacillus, and actinomyces viscosus. group 2 consisted of bacteroides sp., propionibacterium acnes, and three "nocardia-like" sp. catalase + actinomyces was not recovered equally well on cwd plates as on conventional media with fluids obtained during ampicillin treatment. this occurred in spite of the fact that the cwd media was shown to support growth and reversion of laboratory induced l-phase variants of nocardia caviae and n. asteroides, and had facilitated recovery of a bacteroides l-phase variant from a pleural fluid. the nature of this fault in the media is under investigation in this laboratory.

TI  == bacteremia in obstetrics: clinical course.
AB  == the authors reviewed all documented cases of bacteremia in obstetric patients between 1975 and 1979, with emphasis on the clinical course. the incidence of bacteremia was 7.5:1000 obstetric admissions and 9.7% of those patients sampled.  one hundred seventy-six bacteremic obstetric patients had the following diagnoses: endoparametritis (123), pyelonephritis (29), chorioamnionitis (14), and other (10). no deaths, clinical evidence of septic shock, or cases of postinfection endocarditis were found. the most common bloodstream isolates were  escherichia coli (57), group b streptococcus (28), and bacteroides sp (26). the patients with endoparametritis had a fever index of 86.2 +/- 47.1f-hours, an average hospital stay of 6.5 +/- 3.1 days, a 7.3% rate of complications, and a 19.5% rate of failure of primary antibiotics. the patients with chorioamnionitis  had a fever index of 32.7 +/- 48.9f-hours and an average hospital stay of 4.8 +/- 2.3 days. these clinical measures are comparable with those in the general population with the same diagnoses at the authors' hospital. in this obstetric population, prompt, vigorous treatment rendered the clinical course of bacteremic patients with genital infections remarkably similar to that of nonbacteremic patients with the same kinds of infection.

(including 23 b. melaninogenicus, 5 b. oralis and 4 b. ruminicola ss. brevis); 18 anaerobic gram-positive cocci (including 10 peptostreptococcus sp., 4 peptococcus sp. and 4 microaerophilic streptococci); 15 fusobacterium sp.; and 3 clostridium sp. there  were 32 aerobic isolates (2.0 per specimen): 11 gamma-hemolytic streptococci, 8 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 4 group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, 4 haemophilus sp. and 3 s. aureus. beta-lactamase production was noted in 13 isolates recovered from 11 patients (68%). these were all isolates of s. aureus (3), 8 of 23 b. melaninogenicus (35%), and 2 of 5 b. oralis (40%). our findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of peritonsillar abscesses in children, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in two thirds of the patients.

AB  == the upper vaginal and cervical bacterial flora, especially the anaerobic one which has a particular role in postoperative morbidity, was studied in 78 menopausal women between 48 and 78 yr of age. the aim of the present study was to compare the results obtained with those reported for bacterial flora in women of  other age groups. the patients were divided into the following 3 groups. (i) twenty-eight healthy women with a natural menopause; (ii) 30 women, 2-6 mth after surgical menopause due to panhysterectomy; and (iii) 20 menopausal women 3 mth after vaginal hysterectomy. 30.7% of the cultures were found to be sterile. the anaerobic bacteria, developed only in the presence of aerobic germs, represented  11.5% of the total number of cultures and was found to be formed by streptococcus bacteroides sp. and bacteroides fragilis. the vaginal flora of menopausal women is not different from that found in children, young women, in pregnancy or postpartum. the anaerobic germs isolated in our study are normal inhabitants of the vagina and cervix which may occasionally become pathogens.

AB  == the role of obligate anaerobic bacteria in the aetiology of mastitis of lactating dairy cows was investigated. anaerobes were isolated from 12% of lactating mastitic cows, which were representative of 50% of the 10 dairy herds examined. bacteroides fragilis was the most frequently isolated organism of (50%), followed by peptococcus indolicus (33%), eubacterium lentum (33%), e. aerofaciens (17%), propionibacterium granulosum (17%) and an anaerobic streptococcus sp. (17%). these obligate anaerobes were always isolated together with organisms classically involved in mastitis. it was possible to induce overt clinical mastitis in healthy lactating udders within 24 hours by infection with single pure cultures of anaerobes via the teat canal. all b. fragilis strains were resistant to penicillin g and tetracycline. in addition, one strain was also resistant to ampicillin, cephalothin and amoxicillin. anaerobic gram positive cocci and bacilli were sensitive to most antibiotics. these findings imply an important role for anaerobes in the aetiology of mastitis.

TI  == isolation and presumptive identification of adherent epithelial bacteria ("epimural" bacteria) from the ovine rumen wall.
AB  == one hundred sixty-one strains of adherent bacteria were isolated under anaerobic  conditions from four sites on the rumen epithelial surface of sheep fed hay or a  hay-grain ration. before isolation of bacteria, rumen tissue was washed six times in an anaerobic dilution solution, and viable bacteria suspended in the washings  were counted. calculation indicated that unattached bacteria would have been removed from the tissue by this procedure, but a slow and progressive release of  attached bacteria also occurred. nevertheless, a wide range of characteristic morphological types remained associated with the epithelium as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. most of these types were represented among the isolates. characterization and presumptive identification of the isolates showed  that 95.0% belonged to previously described genera of functionally significant rumen bacteria, including butyrivibrio sp. (31.1%), bacteroides sp. (22.4%), selenomonas ruminantium (9.9%), succinivibrio dextrinosolvens (8.7%), streptococcus bovis (8.1%), propionibacterium sp. (4.3%), treponema sp. (3.1%), and eubacterium sp., lachnospira multiparus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens (2.5%  each). eight isolates (5.0%) were not identified. l. multiparus was recovered only from hay-fed animals; all other genera were obtained from animals fed either ration. all s. bovis strains and two strains each of bacteroides sp. and butyrivibrio sp. were aerotolerant; all other strains were strictly anaerobic. bacteria representing the gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic flora associated with rumen wall tissue (r. j. wallace, k.-j. cheng, d. dinsdale, and e. r. orskov, nature (london) 279:424-426, 1979) were therefore not recovered by the techniques used; instead a different fraction of the adherent population was isolated. the term "epimural" is proposed to describe the flora associated with the rumen epithelium.

(10,  including two b. fragilis); fusobacterium sp. (nine isolates); and actinomyces sp. (five isolates). a total of eight aerobic isolates (0.4 per specimen), including five gram-positive cocci and three haemophilus sp., were recovered. antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients. five patients, four with  sinusitis and subdural empyema and one with sinusitis and brain abscess, did not  respond to antimicrobial therapy and aspiration of the abscess, and required surgical drainage of their inflamed sinuses. these findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of intracranial abscess in children.

(including b. melaninogenicus and b. oralis), fusobacterium sp., gram-positive anaerobic cocci, and veillonella sp. there were 138 aerobic isolates. the predominant isolates in both groups were: alpha and gamma hemolytic streptococci, beta hemolytic streptococci (group a, b, c, and f), s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, and hemophilus sp. hemophilus influenzae type b, and s. aureus were more frequently isolated in group a. b. fragilis was only recovered in group a. beta lactamase production was noted in 27 isolates obtained from 18 patients. fifteen of these patients belonged to group a (83% of group a), while 3 were members of group b (25% of group b). these bacteria were all isolates of s. aureus (11) and b. fragilis (2), 8 of 22 b. melaninogenicus group, 4 of 11 b. oralis, and two of 8 h. influenza type b. our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature of deep adenoid flora and demonstrate the presence of many beta lactamase-producing organisms in children with recurrent adenotonsillitis.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of normal maxillary sinuses.
AB  == the bacterial flora of non-inflamed maxillary sinuses were studied in 12 adults.  patients' median age was 35 years (range 25 to 53 years): 8 were females and 4 were males. aseptic aspiration of the sinus was made when the patients were under general anaesthesia for corrective plastic surgery of the nasal septum. all aspirates were cultured for aerobes and anaerobes. anaerobes were isolated in all 12 specimen patients; in 5 patients (42%), they were the only organisms isolated, and in 7 (58%), they were recovered mixed with aerobes. there were 33 anaerobic isolates (2.75 pr specimen) and the predominant ones were: 11 bacteroides sp. (including 6 b. melaninogenicus), 10 anaerobic gram-positive cocci and 5 fusobacterium sp. there were 16 aerobic isolates (1.3 per specimen) and the predominant ones were: 5 beta hemolytic streptococci, 3 alpha hemolytic streptococci, and 2 each of s. pneumoniae and hemophilus parainfluenzae. beta lactamase production was noted in 4 isolates recovered from 3 patients. these included all isolates of s. aureus (2) and 2 of 6 isolates of b. melaninogenicus. the presence of aerobic and anaerobic organisms in the non-inflamed sinus demonstrates the non-sterility of the sinus cavity. in the events that follow closure of the sinus ostium, these bacteria may become pathogenic.

TI  == rapid method that aids in distinguishing gram-positive from gram-negative anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == several species of anaerobic bacteria display variable gram stain reactions which often make identification difficult. a simple, rapid method utilizing a 3% solution of potassium hydroxide to distinguish between gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial was tested on 213 strains of anaerobic bacteria representing 19 genera. the gram stain reaction and koh test results were compared with the antibiotic disk susceptibilities (vancomycin and colistin) the  preliminary grouping of anaerobic bacteria. all three procedures were in agreement for the majority of strains examined. some strains of clostridia, eubacteria, and bifidobacteria stained gram negative or gram variable; the koh and antibiotic disk susceptibility tests correctly classified these strains as gram-positive. the koh test incorrectly grouped some strains of bacteroides sp.,  fusobacterium sp., leptotrichia buccalis, and veillonella parvula, but all gram stain results for these strains were consistent for gram-negative bacteria. the koh test is a useful supplement to the gram stain and antibiotic disk susceptibility testing for the initial classification of anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of cholesteatoma.
AB  == cholesteatoma specimens were obtained from 28 patients undergoing surgery for chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma. all specimens were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic organisms. bacterial growth was present in specimens of 24 of the 28 patients. a total of 74 bacterial isolates were present (40 aerobes and 34 anaerobes). aerobes alone were isolated from 8 (33%) of culture positive patients, 4 patients (26.7%) yielded only anaerobes, and 12 (50%) had both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. fifty isolates (27 aerobes and 23 aerobes) were present in a concentration greater than 10(6) cfu/gm. the most commonly isolated  aerobic organisms were p. aeruginosa (9), proteus sp. (7), k. pneumoniae (5), s.  aureus (5), and e. coli (4). the anaerobic bacteria most commonly isolated were gram-positive anaerobic cocci (12), bacteroides sp. (12, including 5 b. fragilis  group), clostridium sp. (3), and bifidobacterium sp. (3). the above findings indicate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of cholesteatoma.

TI  == tinidazole as preventive treatment in elective colonic surgery.
AB  == peroperative tinidazole and placebo treatment were compared with respect to incidence of postoperative infections in a double blind investigation on patients admitted for elective bowel surgery. patients in the tinidazole group had a significantly reduced postoperative infection rate, compared with the placebo group (7.4% and 46%, respectively). complications in general were fewer in the tinidazole group and costs for antibiotic treatment decreased. all tinidazole-treated patients had clinically effective blood concentrations of the  drug at the time of the operation. in contrast with the placebo-treated subjects, the individuals who developed postoperative wound infections from the tinidazole  group had no growth of anaerobic bacteria and no antibody response to bacteroides sp. the use of tinidazole may therefore be recommended for the prevention of postoperative anaerobic infections in patients undergoing bowel surgery.

TI  == the treatment of the carrier state of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci with clindamycin.
AB  == 20 children who were chronic carriers of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (gabhs) were treated with oral clindamycin. surface tonsillar cultures were obtained prior to therapy and 2 weeks after termination of therapy. they were processed for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained from all cultures. prior to therapy, the average yield was 9  isolates (5 aerobes and 4.1 anaerobes) per specimen; after completion of therapy, the average yield was 5.7 isolates (3 aerobes and 2.7 anaerobes). gabhs, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, and bacteroides oralis were completely eliminated after clindamycin therapy and the number of isolates of bacteroides melaninogenicus and fusobacterium sp. was reduced. beta lactamase production was detected prior to therapy in 21 isolates recovered from 16 tonsillar surfaces (80%). these included all isolates of s. aureus (8) and b. fragilis (2), 8 of 18 b. melaninogenicus (44%), and 3 of 5 b. oralis (60%). only  one isolate of beta-lactamase-producing strain of b. melaninogenicus was recovered after conclusion of therapy. follow-up of the patients for 18 - 24 months (average 22 months) showed no recurrence of gabhs in 19 of the 20 children.

TI  == surface vs core-tonsillar aerobic and anaerobic flora in recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == specimens from both the surface and the core of tonsils from 23 children with recurrent tonsillitis were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained from all patients. the predominant anaerobic isolates were bacteroides sp, fusobacterium nucleatum, anaerobic gram-positive cocci, and eubacterium sp. the predominant aerobic isolates were alpha-hemolytic streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and haemophilus sp. beta-lactamase production was noted in 49 isolates from 19 patients (83%). seventy percent of the aerobic isolates were recovered in both core and surface specimens, compared with 57% of the anaerobic  isolates. ten percent of aerobes were recovered only in the core, compared with 33% of the anaerobes, and 20% of the aerobes in the surface only, compared wtih 10% of the anaerobes. these data demonstrate the discrepancies between surface and core cultures in the isolation of anaerobic bacteria, and raise the question  whether surface cultures can accurately predict the presence of beta-lactamase-producing organisms or other pathogens in the recurrently infected tonsil.

TI  == treponema bryantii sp. nov., a rumen spirochete that interacts with cellulolytic  bacteria.
AB  == a saccharolytic spirochete that associated and interacted with cellulolytic bacteria was isolated from bovine rumen fluid. isolation was accomplished by means of a procedure involving serial dilution of a sample of rumen fluid into a  cellulose-containing agar medium. clear zones appeared within the medium as a result of cellulose hydrolysis by rumen bacteria. the saccharolytic spirochete and a cellulolytic bacterium later identified as a strain of bacteroides succinogenes were isolated from the clear zones. the spirochete did not utilize cellulose, but grew in coculture with the cellulotytic bacterium in cellulose-containing media. when cocultured in these media the spirochete used, as fermentable substrates, soluble sugars released from cellulose by the cellulolytic bacterium. in cellulose-containing agar medium the spirochete enhanced cellulose breakdown by the b. succinogenes strain. electron microscopy showed that the helical spirochete cells possessed an outer sheath, a protoplasmic cylinder, and two periplasmic fibrils. under a co2 atmosphere, in a  reduced medium containing inorganic salts, rumen fluid, glucose, and nahco3, the  spirochete grew to a final density of 1.9 x 10(9) cells/ml. succinate, acetate, and formate were products of the fermentation of glucose by growing cells. co2 (hco3-), branched short-chain fatty acids, folic acid, biotin, niacinamide, thiamine, pyridoxal, and a carbohydrate were required for growth of the spirochete. the results of this study indicated that the rumen spirochete represents a new species of treponema. it is proposed that the new species be named treponema bryantii.

AB  == this study reports bacterial specimens obtained from 112 children presenting with a ruptured appendix. additional samples were studied from 11 of these patients who developed a postoperative surgical draining wound. bacterial growth occurred  in 100 peritoneal fluid specimens. anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 14 specimens, aerobes alone in 12, and mixed aerobic an anerobic flora in 74 specimens. there were 144 aerobic isolates (1.4 per specimen). the predominant isolates were: e. coli (57 specimens); alpha-hemolytic steptococcus (16 specimens); gamma-hemolytic streptococcus (15 specimens); group d streptococcus (12 specimens); and p. aeruginosa (9 specimens). there were 301 anaerobic isolates (three per specimen). the predominant isolates were: 157 bacteroides spp. (including 92 b. fragilis group and 26 b. melaninogenicus group); 62 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (including 30 peptococcus sp.; 29 peptostreptococcus sp.); 27 fusobactenium sp.; and 16 clostridium sp. b. fragilis and peptococcus sp. occurred in 23 patients. beta lactamase production was detectable in 98 isolates recovered from 74 patients. these included all isolates of b. fragilis and six of the 23 bacteroides sp. forty-nine organisms (16 aerobic and 33 anaerobic) were recovered from the draining wounds. the predominant organisms were: b. fragilis (8 specimens); e. coli (6 specimens); peptostreptococcus sp. (5 specimens); and three specimens each of p. aeruginosa and peptococcus sp. most of these isolates were also recovered from the peritoneal cavity of the patients. these findings demonstrate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of peritoneal cavity and postoperative wound flora in children with perforated appendix, and demonstrate the presence of beta lactamase-producing organisms in three-fourths of the patients.

TI  == uric acid-degrading bacteria in guts of termites [reticulitermes flavipes (kollar)].
AB  == uricolytic bacteria were present in guts of reticulitermes flavipes in populations up to 6 x 10 cells per gut. of 82 strains isolated under strict anaerobic conditions, most were group n streptococcus sp., bacteroides termitidis, and citrobacter sp. all isolates used uric acid (ua) as an energy source anaerobically, but not aerobically, and nh(3) was the major nitrogenous product of uricolysis. however, none of the isolates had an absolute requirement  for ua. utilization of heterocyclic compounds other than ua was limited. fresh termite gut contents also degraded ua anaerobically, as measured by co(2) evolution from [2-c]ua. the magnitude of anaerobic uricolysis [0.67 pmol of ua catabolized/(gut x h)] was entirely consistent with the population density of uricolytic bacteria in situ. uricolytic gut bacteria may convert ua in situ to products usable by termites for carbon, nitrogen, energy, or all three. this possibility is consistent with the fact that r. flavipes termites from ua, but they do not void the purine in excreta despite the lack of uricase in their tissues.

AB  == streptococcus lactis and bacteroides sp., isolated from hindguts of reticulitermes flavipes termites, were grown anaerobically in monoculture and coculture. when grown in a glucose medium, s. lactis monoculture produced lactate as the major fermentation product, with small amounts of formate, acetate, ethanol, and co(2). in coculture, glucose was completely consumed during growth of s. lactis. lactate, produced by s. lactis, then supported much of the growth of bacteroides and was fermented to propionate, acetate, and co(2). small amounts of succinate were formed during growth of bacteroides in the coculture, but little change in the formate or ethanol concentration was observed. monoculture growth of bacteroides in a tryptone-yeast extract medium revealed that incorporation of 20 to 40 mm lactate increased cell yields and production of organic acids. however, initial lactate concentrations greater than 40 mm suppressed not only growth of bacteroides but also acidic product formation. results suggest that cross-feeding of lactate between streptococci and bacteroides constitutes one aspect of the overall hindgut fermentation in termites.

TI  == factors affecting the incidence and anti-salmonella activity of the anaerobic caecal flora of the young chick.
AB  == thirty-two different types of anaerobic bacteria isolated from chickens have been tested for anti-salmonella activity in vitro. under the conditions of the test only bacteroides hypermegas and a bifidobacterium sp. were shown to inhibit the salmonellas and this was attributed to the production of volatile fatty acids (vfa's) coupled with a low ph. when these organisms were tested in newly hatched  chicks no inhibition of s. typhimurium occurred. possible explanations for this observation are considered. the ph value and concentration of vfa's in the caecal material were determined in chicks from 0-84 days. in vitro tests with s. typhimurium indicated that, whilst the organism would be able to multiply at the  ph and concentration of vfa's found during the first few days after hatching, the rapid increase in vfa concentration during the first 21 days would make this increasingly difficult. the significance of the developing caecal flora in relation to vfa production and ph is discussed. because certain feed additives are known to influence the carriage of salmonellas, the sensitivity of various caecal anaerobes to these compounds was determined in vitro, generally at 1, 10 and 100 microgram/ml. the additives tested included flavomycin, furazolidone, nitrovin, tetracyline, tylosin, sulphaquinoxaline, virginiamycin and zinc bacitracin. all the organisms tested were inhibited by 100 microgram/ml furazolidone; none were inhibited by 500 microgram/ml sulphaquinoxaline. changes  occurring in the vfa concentration, ph value and microflora of the caeca of chicks fed for 49 days or longer on a normal starter diet or the same diet containing 10 or 100 mg/kg nitrovin have been compared. when the chicks were fed  on the diet containing 100 mg/kg nitrovin, the gram-negative non-sporing anaerobes were eliminated as a significant part of the caecal flora. however, the vfa concentration combined with a low ph in chicks from 2 weeks onwards was still sufficient to inhibit salmonella multiplication. other possibly interrelated factors which might lead to an increased salmonella carrier rate in the nitrovin-treated chickens are discussed.

(all of the former b. fragilis subspecies). the findings were compared with those of routine anaerobic bacteriology and gas liquid chromatography for short chain fatty acids. examination by i.f.a. was a sensitive (100%) and specific (90.3%) means of identifying b. fragilis. use of the pooled serum was sensitive (100%) but less specific (64.3%) than the capsular antiserum (90.3%) although it had the advantage of detecting bacteroides species  other than b. fragilis. the capsular serum i.f.a. gave 9.7% false positives and no false negatives. the predictive value of a positive identification of b. fragilis in a clinical specimen using this anticapsular serum i.f.a. test was 80%; with the pooled bacteroides group-serum it was 60%. the predictive value of  a negative test was 100% for both sera, indicating that a negative i.f.a. test is a reliable index of the absence of bacteroides from the culture i.f.a. of clinical material provides a rapid (less than 2 h) specific and sensitive means for the diagnosis of b. fragilis infections and would be of use in a clinical laboratory.

TI  == vaginal flora in women undergoing hysterectomy with antibiotic prophylaxis.
AB  == one objection occasionally raised against the use of routine antibiotic prophylaxis for pelvic surgery is the concern that the flora of treated patients  will be altered, thus favoring the emergence of different, potentially more resistant organisms. this report summarizes experience with 100 women undergoing  elective hysterectomy who were subjected to short-term cefazolin, penicillin, or  placebo prophylaxis. the changes in preoperative versus postoperative flora were  similar among antibiotic-treated and placebo-treated groups. in general, postoperative isolation of gram-negative aerobes and bacteroides sp increased, and isolation of gram-positive aerobes (except group d streptococci) decreased in antibiotic-treated and placebo-treated groups. the clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  == tympanocentesis was performed in 32 pediatric patients with chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media. the aspirate was cultured aerobically and anaerobically. aerobes were isolated from ten patients (31.2%); anaerobes from one patient; and both aerobes and anaerobes from 21 patients (65.6%). there were  46 aerobic isolates. the aerobes commonly recovered were pseudomonas aeruginosa (24 isolates) proteus sp. (5) and staphylococcus aureus (3). there were 32 anaerobes isolated including anaerobic gram-positive cocci (19 isolates) and bacteroides sp., the latter of which included bacteroides fragilis group and bacteroides melaninogenicus (9). the patients were treated by parenteral carbenicillin 300 to 400 mg per kg per day given in four dosages administered for a period of 12 to 21 days (average 17 days). an aminoglycoside (gentamicin) was added in 15 patients. the clinical response was good in 17 patients and poor in 15. there were no side effects or adverse reactions noted during therapy. the above findings demonstrate the polymicrobial etiology of chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media and suggest that treatment directed against the aerobic  and anaerobic isolates is efficacious in more than half of the cases.

TI  == bacteriology of human experimental gingivitis: effect of plaque and gingivitis score.
AB  == the plaque flora isolated from discrete dentogingival sites during a human gingivitis experiment was analyzed as a function of the plaque score and of the gingivitis score. when the gingivitis score was plotted as a function of the plaque score, a nonbleeding gingivitis was associated with a proportional increase in the actinomyces sp. at the expense of the streptococcus sp. in particular, the percentage of actinomyces israelii increased significantly, while the percent streptococcus sanguis decreased significantly. a. israelii also increased significantly when a bleeding gingivitis developed. when the plaque score was plotted as a function of the gingivitis score, a. israelii increased significantly as the nonbleeding gingivitis developed, but a. viscosus and bacteroides melaninogenicus increased significantly when the bleeding gingivitis  developed. the availability of a sufficient number of plaques with a plaque score of 2.0 permitted the examination of the interrelationship of gingivitis and flora minus the effect of plaque biomass. the bacteriological profile showed that when  bleeding occurred, the levels and proportions of a. viscosus and b. melaninogenicus increased significantly. these findings raise the possibility that proportional changes in the gingival plaque flora may uniquely contribute to the development of gingival inflammation in this experimental model.

TI  == influence of high luminal po2 on the anaerobic bacteria of the rat colon.
AB  == the influence of high luminal po2 on colonic anaerobes was investigated by chronically perfusing the colon of unrestrained rats with o2 or n2. a luminal po2 of approximately 700 mm hg did not significantly influence the fecal concentration of total anaerobes recovered on rabbit blood agar or of bifidobacterium sp. and bacteroides sp. recovered on selective media. however, the o2 infusion reduced the rat's excretion of ch4 (a metabolic product of anaerobic bacteria) to about 5% of the control value, although the feces of o2-treated rats produced ch4 normally. this study suggests that the production of metabolites by the colonic bacteria may sometimes be more accurately studied in situ rather than in culture. measurement of volatile bacterial metabolites in breath may provide a simple means of studying the in situ metabolism of a variety of colonic bacteria in man.

TI  == increase in the population of duodenal immunoglobulin a plasmocytes in axenic mice associated with different living or dead bacterial strains of intestinal origin.
AB  == various bacterial strains were tested for their ability to stimulate immunoglobulin a (iga) plasmocytes to populate the duodenal lamina propria in axenic mice. the mice were associated with the strains for at least 4 weeks. the  strains inhabiting the conventional mouse intestine and belonging to the genera lactobacillus, streptococcus, eubacterium, actinobacillus, micrococcus, corynebacterium, and clostridium (including the extremely oxygen-sensitive ones)  are only slightly or nonimmunogenic, whereas the strains belonging to the genera  bacteroides and escherichia have an immunogenic effect. the same result was obtained with bacteroides and escherichia strains isolated from the digestive tract of other animal species. the kinetics of appearance of intestinal iga plasmocytes are similar in axenic mice monoassociated with a stimulatory strain and in conventional mice. the association of two or more strains with axenic mice leads either to the same or a greater number of duodenal iga plasmocytes as that  obtained with the most stimulatory strain monoassociated with axenic mice. the maximum stimulation recorded in all of these trials represents about two-thirds of that observed in conventional mice and was obtained in the duodenum of gnotoxenic mice harboring four bacterial strains isolated from the conventional mouse microflora. the orally administered killed cells of two immunogenic strains, e. coli and bacteroides sp., are as immunogenic as the living cells, provided that their concentration in the digestive tract is sufficient.

AB  == the in vitro susceptibility to thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol of 272 anaerobes, most of which were recent clinical isolated, was determined by broth dilution tests, with chloramphenicol, 133 anaerobic gram-negative non-sporing rods (48 bacteroides fragilis, 13 b. thetaiotaomicron, 14 b. oralis, 16 sphaerophorus varius etc.) had mic values of 0.03 through 16 microng/ml. very similar results (mic, 0.06-16 microng/ml) were obtained with thiamphenicol. in concentrations of 4 microng/ml or less chloramphenicol inhibited 90.2% and thiamphenicol 78.95% of the strains. strains with only moderate sensitivity to both antibiotics (mic, 8 or 16 microng/ml) belonged to b. fragilis or other bacteroides species. members of the fusobacterium and sphaerophorus group were susceptible to less than or equal to 2 microng chloramphenicol/ml and less than or equal to 4 microng thiamphenicol/ml respectively. with both antibiotics, 102 strains of gram-positive non-sporing anaerobes (p. acnes, peptostreptococcus spp., peptococcus spp.) were susceptible to less than or equal to 8 microng/ml. of 37 clostridium isolates, 35 (belonging to c. perfringens, c. septicum, c. cadaveris etc.) were inhibited by concentrations of 8 microng/ml or less of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. only one strain each of c. perfringens and clostridium sp. had an mic of 16 microng thiamphenicol/ml. accordingly, resistance to thiamphenicol or chloramphenicol was not observed. a standardized monodisk agardiffusion test was performed on 40 bacteroidaceae, 18 peptococcaceae and 20 c, (p.) acnes strains. only a poor correlation was observed between mic and zone size for thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol. therefore, inhibition zone diameter measurement cannot be regarded as a reliable method to detect chloramphenicol or thiamphenicol resistance in anaerobes. thiamphenicol, which is virtually as active against anaerobes as chloramphenicol but lacks serious toxicity, may well play an important role in the therapy of various anaerobic infections.

AB  == a 4-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency is presented, and the impact of this disease on various aspects of his growth and development is examined. there is no evidence of immune deficiency in either parent or in the genetic background on the maternal side. three children of a brother of the mother's father may have had immune deficiencies but two have grown to be teenagers with no problems. another died. at autopsy, however, lymph nodes appeared normal. the deceased older brother had severe combined immune deficiency (scid). the autopsy findings showed pneumocystis carinii pneumonia to be the direct cause of death and these findings contributed to the diagnosis of scid. after a successful germ-free birth, the male infant (dv) was placed in the isolator. laboratory tests were normal except that the x-rays showed no thymic shadow, his absolute lymphocyte count ranged from 399-440/mm and the lymphocytes  showed no proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (pha). specific tests showed the antibody-producing immune system and the cell-mediated immune system to be severely defective. the patient's lymphocytes elicited positive responses by lymphocytes from father, mother, and sister. subsequent search in national and international tissue-typing laboratories has shown four hla matches but none has  been nonreactive in mixed lymphocyte culture (mlc). therefore, this patient has remained in isolation to the present; now he is 4 years old. approximately 35 species of microorganisms, mostly transient contaminants, have been isolated, taking into account that the same organism may have been identified under different names in different laboratories. those isolated frequently and in sufficiently high concentration to indicate colonization have been speciated as follows: anaerobes-propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus catenaforme (disappeared spontaneously), bacteroides oralis ss. elongatus, clostridium (perenne, hastiforme, bifermentans), bacteroides clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis; aerobes-alcaligenes faecalis (eradicated by antibiotics), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter agglomerans, microcossu sp. subgroup 1,  bacillus pulvifaciens (disappeared spontaneously); yeasts-candida (tropicalis, parapsilosis). seven are considered to be probable components of the current autoflora: p. acnes, c. bifermentans, b. clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis, s. epidermidis, micrococcus sp. subgroup 1, e. agglomerans, c. parapsilosis. no viruses or protozoa have been isolated. at age 3 years, the mean quantitation of  anaerobic cells was 7.9 x 10(7) viable cells/g feces; this falls short of the mean anaerobic load from normal children. the mean aerobic concentration was 1.2  x 10(8) viable cells/g feces, not unlike normal children. qualitatively his flora has abnormally few species and lacks those most common in normal subjects. this child has had no evidence of infection and has always been in excellent health even though some organisms which could be pathogenic under some circumstances have been isolated...

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in diabetic foot ulcers.
AB  == twenty diabetic foot ulcers were cultured using optimal microbiologic techniques. anaerobic bacteria coexisted with the more commonly recognized aerobic bacteria in 18 specimens. there were a total of 116 isolates with an average of 5.8 species per specimen (3.2 aerobes and 2.6 anaerobes). the principal isolates were bacteroides species (sp.) (17 strains), peptococci (16), proteus sp. (11), enterococci (9), staphylococcus aureus (7), clostridia (7), and escherichia coli  (6). when antimicrobial therapy is indicated the selection of agents should consider the likelihood of a complex aerobic-anaerobic flora.

TI  == influence of certain indigenous gastrointestinal microorganisms on duodenal alkaline phosphatase in mice.
AB  == alkaline phosphatase activity was assayed in duodenal homogenates or extracts from adult specific pathogen-free (spf) and germfree mice and gnotobiotic mice monoassociated with a lactobacillus sp., a bacteroides sp., or a coliform strain  indigenous to spf mice. activity levels of the enzyme were much higher in the preparations from germfree mice than in those from the spf controls. in the gnotobiotes monoassociated either with a freshly isolated lactobacillus sp. or a  bacteroides sp., the levels of alkaline phosphatase activity were intermediate between the values for germfree and spf mice. by contrast, in the gnotobiotes monoassociated with a coliform strain, alkaline phosphatase activity remained at  high germfree levels. butanol extracts of duodenal tissue from spf mice, germfree mice, and exgermfree mice associated with an indigenous microflora from spf mice  (conventionalized) were subjected to acrylamide gel electrophoresis. a stain for  alkaline phosphatase activity revealed three major bands in the gels prepared with extracts from spf and conventionalized mice, but only two in the gels prepared with extracts from germfree mice. all three bands may have been present  in the latter gels. one of the bands (the middle one) may have been obscured, however, by high activity in the slowest moving band. as determined by densitometric scanning, the slowest moving band had much higher activity in the preparations from germfree animals than in those from spf or conventionalized mice. these findings suggest that the indigenous microbial flora affects not only quantitatively, but also qualitatively, the activity of alkaline phosphatases in  the mouse intestinal mucosa.

AB  == antibacterial activity of tinidazole (1-2-(ethylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole) against anaerobic bacteria including peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium, bacteroides and fusobacterium was studied by agar dilution method comparing with  metronidazole. in addition to this work, bactericidal effect of tinidazole and metronidazole against p. prevotii, b. fragilis ss. fragilis and f. varium was examined by quantitative culture method after incubation in gam broth containing  of 4 mic, 2 mic, 1 mic and 1/2 mic of both drugs against each of three strains for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. all the strains of peptococcus and peptostreptococcus including p. anaerobius, p. saccharolyticus, p. prevotii and ps. anaerobius and others were susceptible to a concentration of 6.25 mcg/ml of this drug. a concentration of 3.13 mcg/ml inhibited all strains of bacteroides including b. fragilis ss. fragilis (12 strains), ss. vulgatus (5 strains), ss. thetaiotaomicron (4 strains) and ss. distasonis (2 strains). to this concentration all strains of fusobacterium including f. varium (20 strains), f. mortiferum (2 strains) and other fusobacterium sp. (5 strains) were susceptible.  on the contrary, propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml  or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. the antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium and fusobacterium. tinidazole was bactericidal against f. varium in a concentration of 2 mic till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on b. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. on the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against b. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against f. varium. against p. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding propionibacterium acnes and bifidobacterium adolescentis.

TI  == [on the acute respiratory infections of anaerobes bacteria: clinical, bacteriological and therapeutic results (author's transl)].
AB  == in order to isolate and identify aerobe and obligate anaerobe (o.a.) bacteria investigations were carried out on 11 patients with acute respiratory tract infections (7 of them severely ill and hospitalized in an intensive care unit). o.a. species were isolated in 7 subjects, in all cases in mixed culture (from 2 to 5 species per sample), including also potentially pathogenic aerobe bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, etc). on the 24 strains of o.a. bacteria identified, m.i.c. was determined for penicillin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, and thiamphenciol. the data obtained have been compared with the m.i.c. of 28 strains isolated from uro-gynecological infections. the strains isolated from the respiratory tract presented a sensitivity spectrum to antibiotic similar to those isolated from the urogenital tract. chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol inhibited growth in 100% of the cases at concentrations equivalent or inferior to plasma levels obtained with normal therapeutical doses; clindamycin was active at lower concentrations but not on all the strains isolated (3 bacteroides, 1 fusobacterium sp., 1 peptococcus sp. were resistent).  penicillin g was active on 21 out of 25 gram-positive strains, but only on 7 out  26 gram-negative bacilli. in view of these results the difficulty of obtaining a  correct etiologic diagnosis and the consequent use of a correct antibiotic therapy are discussed. the usefulness of the association of different antibiotics is suggested.

TI  == [in vitro examination on antibacterial activities of broad-spectrum antibiotics against gram-negative clinical isolates (author's transl)].
AB  == in vitro studies were undertaken on clinically isolated strains of various bacteria to examine the antibacterial activity of ampicillin (ab-pc), carbenicillin (cb-pc), sulbenicillin (sb-pc) cephalothin (cet), cefazolin (cez) and gentamicin (gm). fifty three % of escherichia coli strains 53.3% of citrobacter sp., 80% of proteus mirabilis, 42.9% of morganella and 80% of bacteroides sp. were susceptible (mic being not higher than 12.5 mug/ml) to ab-pc. the eight other species were not so susceptible to this penicillin. cb-pc  and sb-pc were almost as effective as ab-pc against escherichia coli and citrobacter sp. they were less active against klebsiella sp., but more active against enterobacter sp., serratia sp., indole-positive proteus group and pseudomonas sp. than ab-pc, sb-pc was more effective than cb-pc against pseudomonas sp. the strains of pseudomonas sp. which were resistant to higher concentrations of cb-pc and sb-pc were pyocyanine-negative strains. all strains (100%) of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp. and citrobacter sp. were susceptible to cet and cez, while none of enterobacter sp. , serratia sp., proteus vulgaris.  morganella, rettgerella, providencia and pseudomonas sp. were susceptible to these cephalosporins. the mics of cet and cez against bacteroides sp. were moderately low. some strains of providencia and alkaligenes sp. were resistant of gm but the other 10 species were not resistant to this antibiotic, though it showed comparatively high mics against bacteroides sp. when seen from the mic distribution of each antibiotic, there was a tendency that the strains isolated from the pus were more resistant than those isolated from the other sources (urine, sputum and bile).

TI  == the reduction of n-hydroxy-4-acetylaminobiphenyl by the intestinal microflora of  the rat.
AB  == the role of the intestinal flora in the conversion of n-hydroxy-4-acetyl-aminobiphenyl (n-oh-aabp) to 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has been examined. this reaction, which reverses the metabolic activation of the parent carcinogen, can be demonstrated in cultures of some bacteria indigenous to the intestinal microflora. these include cultures of clostridium sp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus productus i, and bacteroides fragilis ss. thetaiotaomicron and ss. vulgatus. in contrast, cultures of lactobacillus plantarum and escherichia coli show little or no capacity for this reaction. the  reduction of n-oh-aabp is also carried out by homogenates of liver, kidney, and brain. on a weight basis, the cecal flora is considerably more active in reducing n-oh-aabp than are homogenates of tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. the cecal flora also has a greater activity for reducing n-oh-aabp than the stomach flora, an observation which may relate to the induction of tumors in the forestomach but not in the cecum of rats fed this compound. the products of the metabolism of n-oh-aabp have been compared in germ-free and conventional animals. glucuronide conjugates of n-oh-aabp are found in the cecal contents and feces only of the germ-free rats, while 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is found in the feces only of conventional rats. these results suggest that the flora, by hydrolyzing glucuronides and reducing n-oh-aabp, may influence the level of metabolities of 4-acetylaminobiphenyl which are critical for carcinogenesis.

AB  == bacteroides infection frequently complicates surgery, instrumentation, or trauma  to the alimentary, upper respiratory, and female genitourinary tracts. bacteroides sp, alone or with other organisms, also may cause infections in the ear, nose, and throat, and other tissues where defeneses are lowered. foul-smelling pus, sinus drainage, material from an abscess or infected traumatic wound, or a blood culture made because of a suspected anaerobic complication should be subjected to anaerobic study in the laboratory. treatment of clinical bacteroidosis consists of specific antibiotics, surgery, oxygen under pressure, and appropriate local dressings. treatment is often more effective if at least two antibiotics are given concurrently, and antibiotic sensitivity tests are recommended to select the best combination.

TI  == the relationship between nitro group reduction and the intestinal microflora.
AB  == the capacity of rats to reduce a 25-mg dose of p-nitrobenzoic acid (pnba) was measured by quantifying the amount of this compound recovered in the urine as p-aminobenzoic acid (paba) and its conjugates. it was found that germfree rats converted approximately 1% of pnba to paba; in conventional rats the conversion was approximately 25%. various bacteria isolated from the rat cecum were selectively associated with germfree rats and it was demonstrated that these bacteria colonized their gastrointestinal tracts. in assoication with lactobacillus plantarum, the conversion of pnba to paba increased to 3.9%. when these rats were further associated with clostridium sp. and streptoccocus faecalis, the conversion increased to approximately 12%. a general correlation was found between the capacity of constituents of the microflora to reduce pnba in vitro and when associated with the germfree rat. cecectomy, which removes a substantial portion of the microflora of the rat, decreases the capacity of the conventional rat to reduce pnba. similar experiments with p-nitrobenzenesulfonamide indicate that this compound is also largely reduced by  the flora. evidence that the reduction of the nitro group in these compounds is carried out by the intestinal microflora explains previous observations in which  the reduction of these compounds in rats did not correlate with the activity of liver enzymes putative for these reactions.

TI  == tryptophanase of fecal flora as a possible factor in the etiology of colon cancer.
AB  == twenty-three strains of intestinal anaerobes obtained from two laboratories were  examined for indole production from tryptophan. among the 23 isolates tested, three of bacteroides fragilis thetaiotaomicron and one citrobacter sp. were indole positive. the tryptophanase of the indole-positive strains of intestinal anaerobes was inducible by tryptophan and was susceptible to glucose repression.  the products of tryptophanase activity were formed in stoichiometric amounts by dialyzed, freshly prepared extracts. the tryptophan concentration and tryptophanase activity in feces from rats on an all-meat diet were significantly  higher than those in feces from rats on a normal diet. the results indicated that the higher tryptophanase activity in the feces of rats fed an all-meat diet is due to the inducibility of this enzyme by tryptophan and is not due to any inhibitor in the feces of rats on a normal diet. the results also suggested that  a population with a diet rich in meat has a greater chance for exposure to possible carcinogens such as indole and other tryptophan metabolites. this agrees with the hypothesis, based on epidemiologic data, that a high intake of meat may  be related to the development of colon cancer in man.

AB  == based on agglutination, complement fixation, bactericidal, and opsonization tests, it is evident that suspensions of a bacteroides sp. isolated from the mouse intestine and given by parenteral routes do not initiate antibody formation in mice. rats also respond poorly to the antigenic stimulus. in contrast, suspensions of other bacterial species isolated from the rodent intestine are highly immunogenic. furthermore, high titers of antibody are produced in rabbits, guinea pigs, and sheep after parenteral injection of the bacteroides suspensions. marked differences in the absolute and relative numbers of bacteroides in the intestinal contents of rodents and the latter three animal species have been demonstrated. it is proposed that the immunological unresponsiveness of rodents to this organism is related to its existence as a member of the autochthonous microflora in these animals.

TI  == oxygen sensitivity of various anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == anaerobes differ in their sensitivity to oxygen, as two patterns were recognizable in the organisms included in this study. strict anaerobes were species incapable of agar surface growth at po(2) levels greater than 0.5%. species that were found to be strict anaerobes were treponema macrodentium, treponema denticola, treponema oralis n. sp., clostridium haemolyticum, selenomonas ruminatium, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and lachnospira multiparus. moderate anaerobes would include those species capable of growth in the presence of oxygen levels as high as 2 to 8%. the moderate anaerobes could be exposed to room atmosphere for 60 to 90 min without appreciable loss of viability. species considered as moderate anaerobes were bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, fusobacteria nucleatum, clostridium novyi type a, and peptostreptococcus elsdenii. the recognition of at  least two general types of anaerobes would seem to have practical import in regard to the primary isolation of anaerobes from source material.

TI  == the effect of pneumostrongylus tenuis (nematoda: metastrongyloidea) on kids.
AB  == kids, 6-28 weeks of age, infected with 200-1000 infective larvae of meningeal worm (pneumostrongylus tenuis) of white-tailed deer (odocoileus virginianus), developed colitis and peritonitis. bacteroides sp., bacillus sp., escherichia coli, proteus sp. and enterococcus sp. were found in the peritoneal cavity. most  kids were moribund or dead 4-11 days after infection and frequently the colon had ruptured. only two kids (of 11) in which the disease was allowed to run its course survived colitis and peritonitis but these two animals developed severe neurologic signs 18 and 38 days after infection. numerous developing worms and various traumatic and other lesions were found in the central nervous system of kids which developed neurologic signs.

TI  == tryptophanase in diverse bacterial species.
AB  == the distribution of tryptophanase was studied. the highest observed specific activity, mumoles per minute per milligram (dry weight) cells, is given in parentheses after each species. tryptophanase was inducible and repressible in escherichia coli (.914), paracolobactrum coliforme (.210), proteus vulgaris (.146), aeromonas liquefaciens (.030), photobacterium harveyi (.035), sphaerophorus varius (.021), bacteroides sp. (.048), and corynebacterium acnes (.042). the enzyme was constitutive and nonrepressible in bacillus alvei (.013),  and was inducible but not repressible by glucose in micrococcus aerogenes (.036). indole-positive bacteria were found in fecal or intestinal samples from a variety of animals among the mammals, reptiles, insects, molluscs, fish, crustaceans, and amphibians.

AB  == albach, richard a. (lutheran general hospital, park ridge, ill.), james g. shaffer, and robert h. watson. morphology, antigenicity, and nucleic acid content of the bacteroides sp. used in the culture of entamoeba histolytica. j. bacteriol. 90:1045-1053. 1965.-certain changes in morphology, antigenicity, and nucleic acid content that occur in a culture of bacteroides sp. in the presence of penicillin g in clg medium are described. this "variant" is one of seven recovered in several laboratories, all of which are descendants of the original bacteroides isolated by shaffer and frye. penicillin-inhibited cells of this culture are currently being used in the routine propagation of entamoeba histolytica in clg medium. evidence is presented for the loss of ability to react with antibody in these penicillin-inhibited bacteria in clg medium, when studied  by fluorescent-antibody techniques. the implications of the antigenic changes observed as they pertain to similar antigenic studies of the amoebas are discussed. a pronounced reduction in the ribonucleic acid (rna) content of such penicillin-inhibited cells was also observed. the potential importance of the changes that occur in the rna of these cells with respect to considerations of the growth requirements of the amoebas is also discussed.

TI  == bacteroides oralis, proposed new species isolated from the oral cavity of man.
AB  == loesche, w. j. (forsyth dental center and harvard school of dental medicine, boston, mass.), s. s. socransky, and r. j. gibbons. bacteroides oralis, proposed  new species isolated from the oral cavity of man. j. bacteriol. 88:1329-1337. 1964.-twenty-seven strains of oral bacteroides were characterized and compared with a national collection of type cultures strain of bacteroides fragilis as well as strains of intestinal bacteroides. a combination of acid end products, gas production, pentose fermentation, and 10% bile tolerance afforded a basis for separation of oral strains from intestinal strains. the oral strains produced succinic, lactic, acetic, and formic acids but no gas. they were inhibited by 10% bile, and did not ferment xylose and arabinose. intestinal strains consistent with the description for b. fragilis produced succinic, formic, acetic, and propionic acids and gas, with a few strains forming lactic acid. they were stimulated by 10% beef bile, and fermented xylose and arabinose. the oral strains are sufficiently different from intestinal strains of the b. fragilis type, so that they appear to constitute a separate species. it is proposed that they be recognized as b. oralis, sp. n.

AB  == fulghum, robert s. (virginia polytechnic institute, blacksburg) and w. e. c. moore. isolation, enumeration, and characteristics of proteolytic ruminal bacteria. j. bacteriol. 85:808-815. 1963.-colony counts of proteolytic ruminal bacteria in the order of 10(9) organisms per g of whole rumen contents, and total colony counts in the order of 2 to 3 x 10(9) organisms per g, were obtained from  rumen contents of cattle fed a maintenance ration of hay and grain. the proteolytic counts averaged 38% of the total counts. an anaerobic, differential medium characterizing proteolytic colonies by clear zones in an opaque skim-milk  suspension was utilized. proteolytic isolates were assigned to the following taxa: butyrivibrio sp., succinivibrio sp., selenomonas ruminantium var. lactilytica, borrelia sp., bacteroides sp., and selenomonadlike organisms similar to the b-385 group of bryant.

TI  == cultivation and classification of "bacteroides," "symbionts," or "rickettsiae" of blattella germanica.
AB  == in blattella germanica, the german roach or "croton bug," bacteriocytes are found in all individuals of both sexes. these bacteriocytes are scattered throughout the fat tissue and their cytoplasm is filled with microorganisms. evidence is presented to show that the intracellular parasites are diphtheroidal bacilli. these diphtheroids are transmitted from one generation to another through the ova. by using a technic previously described, the intracellular parasites were isolated and cultivated from the adult bacteriocytes and from embryos. two diphtheroidal strains were cultivated with approximately equal frequency. these two strains resemble one another closely enough to be considered a single species but show certain minor differences. the sizes, general morphology, and tinctorial reactions of the two cultures correspond to the intracellular parasites of blattella germanica. they may be distinguished from the three types of corynebacterium periplanetae variety americana, previously described. for the species here discussed the name corynebacterium blattellae nov. sp. is proposed.
