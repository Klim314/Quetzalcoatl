antimicrobial activity of essential oils of cultivated oregano (origanum vulgare), sage (salvia officinalis), and thyme (thymus vulgaris) against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, and klebsiella pneumoniae.
background: oregano (origanum vulgare), sage (salvia officinalis), and thyme (thymus vulgaris) are aromatic plants with ornamental, culinary, and phytotherapeutic use all over the world. in europe, they are traditionally used in the southern countries, particularly in the mediterranean region. the antimicrobial activities of the essential oils (eos) derived from those plants have captured the attention of scientists as they could be used as alternatives to the increasing resistance of traditional antibiotics against pathogen infections. therefore, significant interest in the cultivation of various aromatic and medicinal plants is recorded during the last years. however, to gain a proper and marketable chemotype various factors during the cultivation should be considered as the geographical morphology, climatic, and farming conditions. in this frame, we have studied the antimicrobial efficiency of the eos from oregano, sage, and thyme cultivated under different conditions in a region of ne greece in comparison to the data available in literature. methods: plants were purchased from a certified supplier, planted, and cultivated in an experimental field under different conditions and harvested after 9 months. eos were extracted by using a clevenger apparatus and tested for their antibacterial properties (minimum inhibitory concentration - mic) against clinical isolates of multidrug resistant escherichia coli (n=27), klebsiella oxytoca (n=7), and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=16) strains by using the broth microdilution assay. results: our results showed that the most sensitive organism was k. oxytoca with a mean value of mic of 0.9 microg/ml for oregano eos and 8.1 microg/ml for thyme. the second most sensitive strain was k. pneumoniae with mean mic values of 9.5 microg/ml for thyme and 73.5 microg/ml for oregano eos. e. coli strains were among the most resistant to eos antimicrobial action as the observed mics were 24.8-28.6 microg/ml for thyme and above 125 microg/ml for thyme and sage. most efficient were the eos from thyme followed by those of oregano. conclusions: with mic values above 150 microg/ml, sage eos did not show any antibacterial efficiency against the majority of the strains. however, no significant differences were observed concerning the antimicrobial action of all eos originating from irrigated versus non-irrigated cultivated aromatic plants.
antimicrobial co-resistance patterns of gram-negative bacilli isolated from bloodstream infections: a longitudinal epidemiological study from 2002-2011.
background: increasing multidrug resistance in gram-negative bacilli (gnb) infections poses a serious threat to public health. few studies have analyzed co-resistance rates, defined as an antimicrobial susceptibility profile in a subset already resistant to one specific antibiotic. the epidemiologic and clinical utility of determining co-resistance rates are analyzed and discussed. methods: a 10-year retrospective study from 2002-2011 of bloodstream infections with gnb were analyzed from three hospitals in greater vancouver, bc, canada. descriptive statistics were calculated for antimicrobial resistance and co-resistance. statistical analysis further described temporal trends of antimicrobial resistance, correlations of resistance between combinations of antimicrobials, and temporal trends in co-resistance patterns. results: the total number of unique blood stream isolates of gnb was 3280. increasing resistance to individual antimicrobials was observed for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. cloacae, and p. aeruginosa. ciprofloxacin resistance in e. coli peaked in 2006 at 40% and subsequently stabilized at 29% in 2011, corresponding to decreasing ciprofloxacin usage after 2007, as assessed by defined daily dose utilization data. high co-resistance rates were observed for ceftriaxone-resistant e. coli with ciprofloxacin (73%), ceftriaxone-resistant k. pneumoniae with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (83%), ciprofloxacin-resistant e. cloacae with ticarcillin-clavulanate (91%), and piperacillin-tazobactam-resistant p. aeruginosa with ceftazidime (83%). conclusions: increasing antimicrobial resistance was demonstrated over the study period, which may partially be associated with antimicrobial consumption. the study of co-resistance rates in multidrug resistant gnb provides insight into the epidemiology of resistance acquisition, and may be used as a clinical tool to aid prescribing empiric antimicrobial therapy.
e. coli, k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca community-acquired infections susceptibility to cephalosporins and other antimicrobials in lebanon.
objectives: cephalosporin resistance in enterobacteriaceae has become an international concern. this article studies the distribution and trends of resistance of e. coli and klebsiella species isolated from clinical specimens representing community-acquired infections. methods: e. coli, k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca specimen strains were collected from patients presenting to three acute care hospitals in lebanon. the study period extended from january 2010 to january 2011 and included patients presenting with community-acquired infections only. automated microbiological system (vitek 2) was used for identification and antimicrobial susceptibilities. results: data from consecutive non-duplicate 589 e. coli, 54 k. pneumoniae and 40 k. oxytoca strains were collected of which 69.5%, 74.0% and 67.5% were susceptible to 3rd generation cephalosporins (3gc), respectively. out of the 3gc-resistant e. coli strains, around 90% were susceptible to nitrofurantoin, 46% were susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (tmp/smx) and 53% to ciprofloxacin. the patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility in the two klebsiella species did not parallel those in the e. coli strains. yet, the number of klebsiella strains was much lower than that of e. coli. of note is that the 3gc-resistant strains of both klebsiella species were less susceptible to nitrofurantoin compared to the overall groups reaching a maximum of 30%. however, susceptibility to tmp/smx was much higher reaching 79% and that of ciprofloxacin reaching 86%. conclusion: clinical specimens of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca, causing community-acquired infections in lebanon showed that these organisms are significantly resistant to many antibiotics. these patterns of resistance were mainly to internationally recommended drugs for empiric treatment of community-acquired infections like community-acquired urinary tract infections (utis) and intra-abdominal infections. therefore, continuous antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance is advisable to track emerging resistance in enterobacteriaceae and national guidelines would be tailored accordingly.
bioresorbable ureteral stents from natural origin polymers.
in this work, stents were produced from natural origin polysaccharides. alginate, gellan gum, and a blend of these with gelatin were used to produce hollow tube (stents) following a combination of templated gelation and critical point carbon dioxide drying. morphological analysis of the surface of the stents was carried out by scanning electron microscopy. indwelling time, encrustation, and stability of the stents in artificial urine solution was carried out up to 60 days of immersion. in vitro studies carried out with simulated urine demonstrated that the tubes present a high fluid uptake ability, about 1000%. despite this, the materials are able to maintain their shape and do not present an extensive swelling behavior. the bioresorption profile was observed to be highly dependent on the composition of the stent and it can be tuned. complete dissolution of the materials may occur between 14 and 60 days. additionally, no encrustation was observed within the tested timeframe. the ability to resist bacterial adherence was evaluated with gram-positive staphylococcus aureus and two gram-negatives escherichia coli dh5 alpha and klebsiella oxytoca. for k. oxytoca, no differences were observed in comparison with a commercial stent (biosoft((r)) duo, porges), although, for s. aureus all tested compositions had a higher inhibition of bacterial adhesion compared to the commercial stents. in case of e. coli, the addition of gelatin to the formulations reduced the bacterial adhesion in a highly significant manner compared to the commercial stents. the stents produced by the developed technology fulfill the requirements for ureteral stents and will contribute in the development of biocompatible and bioresorbable urinary stents.
ceftolozane/tazobactam activity tested against aerobic gram-negative organisms isolated from intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections in european and united states hospitals (2012).
ceftolozane/tazobactam is under clinical development for treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (iai), complicated urinary tract infections (uti) and ventilator-associated pneumonia. we evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftolozane/tazobactam and comparator agents tested against gram-negative aerobic bacteria causing iai and healthcare-associated uti (hca-uti). the organisms were consecutively collected from january to december 2012 from 59 medical centers located in the united states (usa) and 15 european countries by the program to assess ceftolozane/tazobactam susceptibility (pacts). the collection included 809 organisms from iai and 2474 organisms from hca-uti, and susceptibility testing was performed by reference broth microdilution methods as described by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) m07-a9 document. overall, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequently isolated pathogens from both infection types. ceftolozane/tazobactam was very active against e. coli (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 98.5-99.9% inhibited at an mic of </=8 mg/l) and retained activity against many of the multidrug-resistant (mdr; mic50/90, 0.5/2->32 mg/l) and esbl-phenotype strains (mic50/90, 0.5/2-32 mg/l). ceftolozane/tazobactam was active against most k. pneumoniae strains (mic50/90, 0.25/16 mg/l, 88.9-89.6% inhibited at an mic of </=8 mg/l), but some esbl-phenotype (mic50/90, 4-8/>32 mg/l) and mdr (mic50/90, 16/>32 mg/l) isolates exhibited elevated mic values. ceftolozane/tazobactam was the most active agent tested against p. aeruginosa (mic50/90, 0.5/4 mg/l; 93.4-95.7% inhibited at </=8 mg/l) and retained potency against many mdr (mic50/90, 2-4/>32 mg/l), ceftazidime-nonsusceptible (mic50/90, 2-4/>32 mg/l) and meropenem-nonsusceptible (mic50/90, 2/>32 mg/l) strains. ceftolozane/tazobactam was also active against klebsiella oxytoca (mic50/90, </=0.12-0.25/0.5-1 mg/l), enterobacter spp. (mic50/90, 0.25-0.5/4-8 mg/l), citrobacter spp. (mic50/90, 0.25/2-32 mg/l), proteus mirabilis (mic50/90, 0.5/0.5 mg/l), indole-positive proteae (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5-1 mg/l), and serratia spp. (mic50/90, 0.5/1-2 mg/l). in summary, ceftolozane/tazobactam demonstrated potent in vitro activity when tested against contemporary aerobic gram-negative pathogens causing iai and hca-uti in usa and european medical centers.
pediatric multicenter evaluation of the verigene gram-negative blood culture test for rapid detection of inpatient bacteremia involving gram-negative organisms, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases.
we evaluated the investigational use only (iuo) version of the rapid verigene gram-negative blood culture test (bc-gn), a microarray that detects 9 genus/species targets (acinetobacter spp., citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., escherichia coli/shigella spp., klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens) and 6 antimicrobial resistance determinants (blactx-m, blakpc, blandm, blavim, blaimp, and blaoxa) directly from positive blood cultures. bc-gn was performed on positive bact/alert pediatric fan and bactec peds plus blood cultures with gram-negative organisms at two tertiary pediatric centers. vitek ms (biomerieux, durham, nc) was used to assign gold standard organism identification. the check mdr ct-102 microarray (check points b.v., wageningen, netherlands) was used as an alternative method for detecting resistance determinants. in total, 104 organisms were isolated from 97 clinical blood cultures. bc-gn correctly detected 26/26 cultures with acinetobacter spp., p. aeruginosa, and s. marcescens, 5/6 with citrobacter spp., 13/14 with enterobacter spp., 23/24 with e. coli, 2/3 with k. oxytoca, 16/17 with k. pneumoniae, and 0/1 with proteus spp. bc-gn appropriately reported negative bc-gn results in 8/13 blood cultures that grew organisms that were not represented on the microarray but failed to detect targets in 3/5 cultures that grew multiple gram-negative organisms. bc-gn detected 5/5 and 1/1 clinical blood cultures with blactx-m and blavim. all 6 results were corroborated by check mdr ct-102 microarray testing. the verigene bc-gn test has the potential to expedite therapeutic decision making in pediatric patients with gram-negative bacteremia. sensitivity was satisfactory but may be suboptimal in mixed gram-negative blood cultures.
evaluation of the clinical and laboratory standards institute phenotypic confirmatory test to detect the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases from 4005 escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis isolates.
a subset of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis isolates collected for the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends that were positive for the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) phenotypic confirmatory test (n = 3245) or had an ertapenem mic of >/=0.5 microg ml(-1) (n = 293), or both (n = 467), were analysed for esbl genes. most esbl phenotype e. coli or k. pneumoniae possessed an esbl gene (95.8 and 88.4 %, respectively), and this was 93.1 % if carbapenem-non-susceptible k. pneumoniae were removed. this rate was lower for p. mirabilis (73.4 %) and k. oxytoca (62.5 %). virtually all esbl-positive isolates (99.5 %) were cefotaxime non-susceptible [clsi or european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) breakpoints)]. fewer isolates (82 %) were ceftazidime non-susceptible (clsi breakpoints). in addition, 21.1 % of e. coli, 25 % of k. oxytoca and 78.7 % of p. mirabilis isolates were ceftazidime susceptible but esbl positive. this suggests that clsi breakpoints for ceftazidime are too high to detect esbls. the lower eucast breakpoints detected esbls in e. coli and k. oxytoca better, but 59.6 % of esbl-positive isolates of p. mirabilis were ceftazidime susceptible. for isolates with ertapenem mics >/=0.5 microg ml(-1), more accurate esbl phenotype analysis was observed for e. coli and k. pneumoniae (sensitivity >95 % for both, specificity 94.4 and 54.1 %, respectively). if carbapenemase-positive k. pneumoniae were excluded, the specificity increased to 78 %. the positive predictive values for the esbl phenotypic test with e. coli and k. pneumoniae were 97.6 and 81.8 %, respectively, and negative predictive values were 75.9 and 95.2 %, respectively. we therefore suggest that it would be prudent to confirm phenotypic esbl-positive p. mirabilis, k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca with molecular analysis.
contemporary diversity of beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae in the nine u.s. census regions and ceftazidime-avibactam activity tested against isolates producing the most prevalent beta-lactamase groups.
escherichia coli (328 isolates), klebsiella pneumoniae (296), klebsiella oxytoca  (44), and proteus mirabilis (33) isolates collected during 2012 from the nine u.s. census regions and displaying extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (esbl) phenotypes were evaluated for the presence of beta-lactamase genes, and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were analyzed. the highest esbl rates were noted for k. pneumoniae (16.0%, versus 4.8 to 11.9% for the other species) and in the mid-atlantic and west south central census regions. ctx-m group 1 (including ctx-m-15) was detected in 303 strains and was widespread throughout the united states but was more prevalent in the west south central, mid-atlantic, and east north central regions. kpc producers (118 strains [112 k. pneumoniae strains]) were detected in all regions and were most frequent in the mid-atlantic region (58 strains). thirteen kpc producers also carried blactx-m. shv genes encoding esbl activity were detected among 176 isolates. other beta-lactamase genes observed were ctx-m group 9 (72 isolates), fox (10), tem esbl (9), dha (7), ctx-m group 2 (3), ndm-1 (2 [colorado]), and ctx-m groups 8 and 25 (1). additionally, 62.9% of isolates carried >/=2 beta-lactamase genes. kpc producers were highly resistant to multiple agents, but ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.5/2 mug/ml) and tigecycline (mic50/90, 0.5/1 mug/ml) were the most active agents tested. overall, meropenem (mic50, </=0.06 mug/ml), ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50, 0.12 to 0.5 mug/ml), and tigecycline (mic50, 0.12 to 2 mug/ml) were the most active antimicrobials when tested against this collection. ndm-1 producers were resistant to all beta-lactams tested. the diversity and increasing prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae have been documented, and ceftazidime-avibactam was very active against the vast majority of beta-lactamase-producing strains isolated from u.s. hospitals.
antimicrobial and herbal drug resistance in enteric bacteria isolated from faecal droppings of common house lizard/gecko (hemidactylus frenatus).
from 194 faecal dropping samples of common house geckos collected from offices (60), houses (88), integrated farm units (ifs,18) and hostels, guest houses, and dining rooms of different canteen/mess (hgm, 28), 326 bacterial isolates of enteric bacteria belonging to 17 genera and 34 species were detected. escherichia coli were the most frequently (39) isolated followed by citrobacter freundii (33), klebsiella pneumonia (27), salmonella indica (12), enterobacter gergoviae (12), and ent. agglomerans (11). other important bacteria isolated from gecko droppings were listonella damsela (2), raoultella terrigena (3), s. salamae (2), s. houtenae (3), edwardsiella tarda (4), edwardsiella hoshinae (1), and klebsiella oxytoca (2). of the 223 isolates tested for antimicrobial drug sensitivity, 27 (12.1%) had multiple drug resistance (mdr). none of the salmonellae or edwardsiellae had mdr however, mdr strains were significantly more common among escherichia spp. (p = 1.9 x 10(-5)) and isolates from ifs units (p = 3.58 x 10(-23)). the most effective herbal drug, ageratum conyzoides extract, inhibited growth of only 27.8% of strains tested followed by ethanolic extract of zanthoxylum rhetsa (13.9%), eucalyptus oil (5.4%), patchouli oil (5.4%), lemongrass oil (3.6%), and sandalwood oil (3.1%), and artemisia vulgaris essential oil (3.1%).
in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
impact of ph on activity of trimethoprim, fosfomycin, amikacin, colistin and ertapenem in human urine.
objective: although major impairment of activity at lower ph values has been reported for fluoroquinolones, acidification is a widely recommended practice for the prophylaxis and treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (utis). until now, there is little evidence for the influence of ph on the activity on other antimicrobial classes in urine. methods: bacterial growth curves of staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), klebsiella oxytoca (atcc 700324), proteus mirabilis (atcc 14153), escherichia coli (atcc 25922) and enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212) were performed in mueller-hinton broth and in pooled human urine with a ph of between 5.0 and 8.0. bacterial killing of trimethoprim, fosfomycin, amikacin, colistin and ertapenem against the five strains (where appropriate) was determined consecutively at concentrations equal to the mic. results: while no difference in the bacterial growth of e. coli, s. aureus, p. mirabilis and k. oxytoca was observed at different ph values, bacterial growth of e. faecalis was significantly reduced at low ph. acidification to ph 5 impaired the antimicrobial activity of all investigated antibiotics, i.e. the net effect of bacterial growth and killing resulted in increased colony-forming units/ml at the end of the experiment. conclusion: the present in vitro findings indicate that acidification of urine during the treatment of utis should be carefully considered. while growth curves of one strain supports the concept of therapeutic or prophylactic acidification during utis, the most common pathogen, e. coli, was not affected by low ph. independent of the investigated strain or antibiotic, ph values below 6 lead to a reduction of antimicrobial activity.
[antimicrobial susceptibilityof clinical isolates of aerobic gram-negative bacteria in 2008].
we determined mics of antibacterial agents against 1145 clinical strains of aerobic gram-negative bacteria (22 species) isolated at 16 japanese facilities in 2008. mics were determined using mostly broth microdilution method and antibacterial activity was assessed. strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) accounted for 3.8% of escherichia coli, 2.6% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 6.8% of klebsiella oxytoca, 5.5% of proteus mirabilis and 1.8% of proteus vulgaris. esbl produced strains were 6.8% at k. oxytoca that increased compared with 3.2% and 5.5% at p. mirabilis that decreased compared with 18.8% in 2006. among haemophilus influenzae, 61.7% that decreased compared with 67.7% in 2006, equaled 58.7% in 2004, were strains when classified by penicillin-binding protein 3 mutation. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2006. although two antibacterial agents that tobramycin showed an mic90 of 1 microg/ml and doripenem showed an mic90 of 4 microg/ml against p. aeruginosa have potent activity. of all p. aeruginosa strains, 4.3% were resistant to six agents of nine antipseudomonal agents, that decreased compared to 12.2% in 2004 and 5.7% in 2006. against other glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative rods, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2006.
impact of ph on bacterial growth and activity of recent fluoroquinolones in pooled urine.
acidification of urine is widely recommended for prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections. we set out to describe the effect of modification of ph on bacterial growth of relevant bacteria as well as on activity of modern fluoroquinolones in urine in vitro. bacterial growth of escherichia coli atcc 25922 and klebsiella oxytoca atcc 700324 was determined in pooled human urine adjusted to ph levels between 5.0 and 8.0. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and time-kill curves were performed for ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin in ph-adjusted urine and mueller-hinton broth (mhb). uptake of radioactive labeled [c(14)]-ciprofloxacin into bacterial cells was investigated at different phs. while no difference in bacterial growth of e. coli and k. oxytoca was observed at ph values between 5.0 and 8.0, acidification of urine led to major impairment of antimicrobial activity of all tested fluoroquinolones, indicated by an up to 40-fold increase in mic compared to mhb and nearly total neutralization of activity in time-kill experiments. the most probable mechanism behind this observation may have been reduced uptake of fluoroquinolones into bacterial cells, as indicated by bacterial uptake of [c(14)]-ciprofloxacin and a reversibility of the effect. the observed reduction in activity of modern fluoroquinolones confirms previous observations from older compounds.
trends in antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria isolated from blood in jakarta from 2002 to 2008.
background: this study examined the susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria in the bloodstream to antimicrobials with the aim of providing information relevant to the guidance of therapy. methodology: blood specimens received by the laboratory of clinical microbiology, faculty of medicine, university of indonesia, from 2002 to 2008, were analyzed for the presence of gram-negative bacteria and their susceptibility to four antibiotic groups frequently administered in hospitals and community settings. results: during the seven-year period leading up to 2008, approximately 68% of gram-negative bacteria were identified among all positive isolates from blood specimens. the eight most frequent species found were acinetobacter anitratus (25.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.5%), klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae (14.5%), enterobacter aerogenes (8%), salmonella typhi (7.5%), escherichia coli (6.2%), alcaligenes faecalis (5.6%) and klebsiella oxytoca (3.2%). at 80% susceptibility or greater, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were active only on e. coli and s. typhi. cefepime demonstrated activity on all eight species tested except k. pneumonia while amikacin showed activity against five species, a. faecalis, e. aerogenes, e. coli, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and s. typhi. gentamycin was active against three species: e. aerogenes, k. oxytoca and s. typhi. ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin significantly differed in their spectrum: while ciprofloxacin was active against four of the eight species tested (e. aerogenes, e. coli, k. oxytoca, and s. typhi ), levofloxacin was similar to cefepime and was active against all eight species except k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumonia. conclusions: since antimicrobials are broadly used in jakarta, it is important that the information captured in this study be disseminated.
comparison of chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of essential oils from three conifer trees; pinus densiflora, cryptomeria japonica, and chamaecyparis obtusa.
the chemical compositions, and antibacterial and antifungal effects of essential  oils extracted from three coniferous species, pinus densiflora, cryptomeria japonica, and chamaecyparis obtusa, were investigated. gas chromatography mass analysis of the essential oils revealed that the major components and the percentage of each essential oil were 16.66% beta-phellandrene and 14.85% alpha-pinene in p. densiflora; 31.45% kaur-16-ene and 11.06% sabinene in c. japonica; and 18.75% bicyclo [2, 2, 1] heptan-2-ol and 17.41% 2-carene in ch. obtusa. the antimicrobial assay by agar disc diffusion method showed that 2.2 microg of ch. obtusa oil inhibited most effectively the growth of escherichia coli atcc 33312 and klebsiella oxytoca atcc 10031, whereas the c. japonica oil gave weak antimicrobial activity. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for bacterial strains were in the range of 5.45-21.8 mg/ml depending on essential oils, but most gram-negative bacteria were resistant even at 21.8 mg oil/ml. p. densiflora oil showed the most effective antifungal activity and the mic values for cryptococcus neoformans b42419 and candida glabrata yfcc 062ccm 11658 were as low as 0.545 and 2.18 mg/ml, respectively. cryp. neoformans b42419 was the most sensitive to all essential oils in the range of 0.545-2.18 mg/ml. our data clearly showed that the essential oils from the three conifers had effective antimicrobial activity, especially against fungi.
nationwide surveillance in taiwan of the in-vitro activity of tigecycline against clinical isolates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae.
tigecycline in-vitro surveillance in taiwan (tist), initiated in 2006, is a nationwide surveillance programme designed to monitor longitudinally the in-vitro activity of tigecycline against commonly encountered resistant bacteria. this study compared the in-vitro activity of tigecycline against clinical isolates of resistant gram-negative bacteria determined by the broth microdilution and etest methods. a total of 622 isolates were collected from patients treated at 20 teaching hospitals. tigecycline had excellent in-vitro activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli (n = 275) with mic(90) 0.5 microg/ml and a 99.6% susceptibility rate, and also against esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 324) with mic(90) 2 microg/ml and a 98.5% susceptibility rate. for esbl-producing proteus mirabilis (n = 15) the mic(90) was 4 microg/ml with a 73.3% susceptibility rate. for esbl-producing klebsiella oxytoca (n = 8) the mic(50) and mic(90) were 0.5 and 1 microg/ml, respectively, with a 100% susceptibility rate. limited agreement (<80%) was found between the broth microdilution and the etest methods when determining the in-vitro activity of tigecycline against esbl- producing k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca.
microbiological and toxicological effects of perla black bean (phaseolus vulgaris l.) extracts: in vitro and in vivo studies.
we investigated the microbiological and toxicological effects of three perla black bean extracts on the growth and culture of selected pathogenic microorganisms, the toxicity over vero cell lines and an in vivo rat model. three different solvents were used to obtain perla black bean extracts. all three perla black bean extracts were tested for antibacterial and antiparasitic activity and further analysed for intrinsic cytotoxicity (ic(50)). methanol perla black bean extract was used for acute toxicity test in rats, with the up-and-down doping method. all perla black bean extracts inhibited bacterial growth. pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and listeria monocytogenes showed inhibition, while escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes did not. acidified water and acetic acid perla black bean extract were tested in parasites. the best ic(50) was observed for giardia lamblia, while higher concentrations were active against entamoeba histolytica and trichomonas vaginalis. the vero cells toxicity levels (ic(50)) for methanol, acidified water and acetic acid perla black bean extract were [mean +/- s.d. (95% ci)]: 275 +/- 6.2 (267.9-282.0), 390 +/- 4.6 (384.8-395.2) and 209 +/- 3.39 (205.6-212.4) microg/ml, respectively. in vivo acute toxicity assays did not show changes in absolute organ weights, gross and histological examinations of selected tissues or functional tests. the acetic acid and methanol perla black bean extract proved to exhibit strong antibacterial activity and the acidified water perla black bean extract exerted parasiticidal effects against giardia lamblia, entamoeba hystolitica and trichomonas vaginalis. the three perla black bean extracts assayed over vero cells showed very low toxicity and the methanol perla black bean extract in vivo did not cause toxicity.
non-susceptibility trends among enterobacteriaceae from bacteraemias in the uk and ireland, 2001-06.
background: enterobacteriaceae are common agents of bacteraemia, with escherichia coli accounting for 20% of the cases. reflecting this importance, members of the family constitute 4 of the 12 collection groups in the british society for antimicrobial chemotherapy (bsac) bacteraemia surveillance programme. methods: mics from the bsac surveillance programme were reviewed, along with bacteraemia reports received by the health protection agency (hpa) via its cosurv/labbase system. isolates with unusual resistances were subjected to molecular analysis. results: the bsac and hpa systems both revealed dramatically increasing resistance to cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin among e. coli and klebsiella spp., with cephalosporin resistance largely contingent on the spread of ctx-m extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls); fluoroquinolone resistance also increased among proteus mirabilis and esbl-negative e. coli. carbapenem resistance remained extremely rare, but two enterobacter spp., from the same patient in different years, had kpc carbapenemases, while a few isolates had carbapenem resistance contingent upon combinations of beta-lactamase and impermeability, and ertapenem mics for ampc-derepressed enterobacter spp. rose over time. three new agents-ceftobiprole, doripenem and tigecycline-were tested. ceftobiprole was broadly active, except against esbl producers and klebsiella oxytoca hyperproducing k1 enzyme, and was variable against ampc-derepressed enterobacter spp. and against proteus vulgaris. doripenem was more potent than imipenem. tigecycline was almost universally active against e. coli, but low-level non-susceptibility (mic 2 mg/l) was frequent among klebsiella spp. conclusions: e. coli and klebsiella spp. showed dramatic shifts, with sharply rising non-susceptibility to cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the rise in cephalosporin resistance reflected dissemination of ctx-m esbls. carbapenems remain broadly active and new agents offer potential.
prevalence of plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases in a chinese university hospital from 2003 to 2005: first report of cmy-2-type ampc beta-lactamase resistance in china.
the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalences of plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases (pabls) in isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. from a university hospital in china. a total of 1,935 consecutive nonrepeat clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca were collected between january 2003 and july 2005. the isolates with cefoxitin zone diameters less than 18 mm (screen positive) were selected for pcr of the bla(ampc) genes and sequencing. fifty-four (2.79%) isolates harbored pabls, as demonstrated by pcr and isoelectric focusing. sequence analysis revealed the presence of bla(dha-1) and bla(cmy-2) genes. the southern blot hybridization studies confirmed that bla(cmy-2) and bla(dha-1) were located on plasmids. based on species, pabls were detected in 4.29% (29 isolates of dha-1 and 1 isolate of cmy-2) of k. pneumoniae, 1.91% (11 isolates of dha-1 and 12 isolates of cmy-2) of e. coli, and 3.03% (1 isolate of dha-1) of k. oxytoca isolates. in contrast to our anticipation, the occurrence rate of dha-1-producing k. pneumonia significantly decreased (p < 0.01), from 7.54% in 2003 to 2.72% in 2004. the results of random amplified polymorphic dna analysis indicate that the prevalences of dha-1-producing k. pneumoniae and cmy-2-producing e. coli strains were not due to epidemic strains. in conclusion, dha-1 was the most prevalent acquired ampc beta-lactamase in this collection of isolates from a medical center in china, and dha-1-producing k. pneumoniae was the most prevalent bacterium harboring a pabl. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of cmy-2-type ampc beta-lactamases in the chinese mainland.
effects of chronic triclosan exposure upon the antimicrobial susceptibility of 40 ex-situ environmental and human isolates.
background: triclosan (tcs) exposure of escherichia coli selects for tolerant clones, mutated in their enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (fabi). it has been inferred that this phenomenon is widespread amongst bacterial genera and might be associated with resistance to third party agents. methods: ex-situ, low passage isolates of enteric, human axilla, human oral origin and bacteria isolated from a domestic drain, together with selected type cultures were exposed to escalating concentrations of tcs over 10 passages using a gradient plate technique. one fresh faecal isolate of e. coli was included as a positive control. tcs susceptibility was determined for all strains before and after exposure, whilst enteric isolates were additionally assessed for susceptibility towards chlorhexidine, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin, and the oral isolates towards chlorhexidine, tetracycline and metronidazole. results: triclosan exposure of e. coli markedly decreased tcs susceptibility. tcs susceptibility also decreased for klebsiella oxytoca, aranicola proteolyticus and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. susceptibility of the remaining 35 strains to tcs and the other test agents remained unchanged. conclusions: these data suggest that selection for high level resistance by tcs exposure is not widespread and appears to be confined to certain enteric bacteria, especially e. coli. change in tcs susceptibility did not affect susceptibility towards chemically unrelated antimicrobials. significance and impact: acquired high-level tcs resistance is not a widespread phenomenon.
six groups of the oxy beta-lactamase evolved over millions of years in klebsiella oxytoca.
the diversity and evolution of the class a oxy beta-lactamase from klebsiella oxytoca were investigated and compared to housekeeping gene diversity. the entire bla(oxy) coding region was sequenced in 18 clinical isolates representative of the four k. oxytoca beta-lactamase gene groups bla(oxy-1) to bla(oxy-4) and of two new groups identified here, bla(oxy-5) (with four isolates with pi 7.2 and one with pi 7.7) and bla(oxy-6) (with four isolates with pi 7.75 and three with pi 8.1). genes bla(oxy-5) and bla(oxy-6) showed 99.8% within-group nucleotide similarity but differed from each other by 4.2% and from bla(oxy-1), their closest relative, by 2.5% and 2.9%, respectively. antimicrobial susceptibility to beta-lactams was similar among oxy groups. nucleotide sequence diversity of the 16s rrna (1,454 bp), rpob (940 bp), gyra (383 bp), and gapdh (573 bp) genes was in agreement with the beta-lactamase gene phylogeny. strains with bla(oxy-1), bla(oxy-2), bla(oxy-3), bla(oxy-4), and bla(oxy-6) genes formed five phylogenetic groups, named koi, koii, koiii, koiv, and kovi, respectively. isolates harboring bla(oxy-5) appeared to represent an emerging lineage within koi. we estimated that the bla(oxy) gene has been evolving within k. oxytoca for approximately 100 million years, using as calibration the 140-million-year estimation of the escherichia coli-salmonella enterica split. these results show that the bla(oxy) gene has diversified along k. oxytoca phylogenetic lines over long periods of time without concomitant evolution of the antimicrobial resistance phenotype.
laboratory tests in the detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production: national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) screening test, the e-test, the double disk confirmatory test, and cefoxitin susceptibility testing.
extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production by klebsiella sp. and e. coli  is an emerging problem. in this study, 107 clinical isolates (53 e. coli, 47 k. pneumoniae and 7 k. oxytoca) screened as esbl producers by the nccls disk diffusion procedure were submitted to a double disk confirmatory test (ddt) and to the e-test double strip for confirmation of esbl production by demonstration of clavulanic acid inhibition effect (caie). only 72/107 (67%) of the isolates were confirmed as esbl producers by ddt, with diverse results among species. by the e-test, 58/107 (54%) isolates were confirmed as esbl producers, and 18/107 (17%) were not determinable. susceptibility to cefoxitin was found in 57/68 (83%) of strains that did not show caie. esbl detection remains a controversial issue and clinical laboratories are in need of a simple and effective way to recognize strains with this kind of resistance.
beta-lactam susceptibilities and prevalence of esbl-producing isolates among more than 5000 european enterobacteriaceae isolates.
in vitro susceptibility to 15 beta-lactam antibiotics was evaluated using enterobacteriaceae isolated during the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. piperacillin/tazobactam was the most active penicillin against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella oxytoca and klebsiella pneumoniae (94.9%, 98.3%, 87.4% and 82.9% of isolates susceptible). of the cephalosporins, cefepime was most effective against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and enterobacter cloacae (99.2%, 96.3% and 95.2% of isolates susceptible, respectively) and cefoxitin against klebsiella oxytoca and klebsiella pneumoniae (98.6% and 95.6% of isolates susceptible). carbapenems had excellent activity (> or =99.5% of all isolates). esbl-production was confirmed with the esbl-etest and disk diffusion test in 1.3% of escherichia coli isolates, 18.4% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 12.6% of klebsiella oxytoca and 5.3% of proteus mirabilis isolates.
intestinal microflora in 45 crows in ueno zoo and the in vitro susceptibilities of 29 escherichia coli isolates to 14 antimicrobial agents.
microorganisms from 45 jungle crows (corvus macrorhynchos) captured from july to  december 2002 at ueno zoo, tokyo were identified as escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter agglomerans, pseudomonas maltophila, staphylococcus spp., micrococcus spp., and streptococcus spp. e. coli showed the highest rate of isolation (21.6%). in an in vitro susceptibility test for 29 isolates of e. coli to 14 antimicrobial agents, all the isolates were resistant to penicillin g, vancomycin, erythromycin, lincomycin, bicozamycin, sulfadimethoxine, and olaquindox. several isolates of them were also resistant to tetracycline, oxytetracycline, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. twenty-nine isolates were divided into 19 serogroups and the most frequently identified serogroups were o8, o114 and o144, which showed the same multidrug-resistant patterns.
evaluation of parameters affecting quantitative detection of escherichia coli o157 in enriched water samples using immunomagnetic electrochemiluminescence.
we report here the use of immunomagnetic (im) electrochemiluminescence (ecl) for  quantitative detection of esherichia coli o157:h7 in water samples following enrichment in minimal lactose broth (mlb). im beads prepared in-house with four commercial anti-o157 monoclonal antibodies were compared for efficiency of cell capture. im-ecl responses for e. coli o157:h7 (strain sea13b88) were similar for all four commercial anti-o157 lps monoclonal antibodies. the ecl signal was linearly correlated with e. coli o157:h7 cell concentration, indicating a constant ecl response per cell. twenty-two strains of e. coli o157:h7 or o157:nm gave comparable ecl signals using im beads prepared in-house. to assess the potential for interference from background bacteria in mlb-enriched water samples, 10(4) cells of e. coli o157:h7 (strain sea13b88) were added to enriched samples prior to analysis. there was considerable variability in recovery of e. coli o157:h7 cells; net ecl signals ranged from 1% to 100% of expected values (i.e., percent inhibition from 0% to 99%). cultures of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, and enterobacter cloacae, subsequently isolated from mlb-enriched water samples via im separation (ims), were observed to interfere with the binding of e. coli o157:h7 cells to im beads. recoveries of 10(4) e. coli o157:h7 cells were </=10% in the presence of ca. 10(8) k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, or e. cloacae cells. none of these strains gave a positive im-ecl signal. although competitive binding decreased sensitivity, there still was a linear correlation between ecl signal and higher e. coli o157:h7 cell concentrations. these studies indicate that im-ecl in conjunction with mlb enrichment is capable of quantitatively detecting as few as 10(3) to 10(5) e. coli o157:h7 cells ml(-1), depending on percent recoveries, in enriched samples that contain ca. 10(9) total lactose-fermenting bacteria ml(-1). assuming comparable growth rates for e. coli o157:h7 and other lactose-fermenting bacteria in mlb, it may be possible to detect as few as one e. coli o157:h7 in 100 ml of raw water containing as many as 10(4) to 10(6) lactose-fermenting bacteria (i.e., total coliforms).
indole can act as an extracellular signal to regulate biofilm formation of escherichia coli and other indole-producing bacteria.
we demonstrated previously that genetic inactivation of tryptophanase is responsible for a dramatic decrease in biofilm formation in the laboratory strain escherichia coli s17-1. in the present study, we tested whether the biochemical inhibition of tryptophanase, with the competitive inhibitor oxindolyl-l-alanine, could affect polystyrene colonization by e. coli and other indole-producing bacteria. oxindolyl-l-alanine inhibits, in a dose-dependent manner, indole production and biofilm formation by strain s17-1 grown in luria-bertani (lb) medium. supplementation with indole at physiologically relevant concentrations restores biofilm formation by strain s17-1 in the presence of oxindolyl-l-alanine and by mutant strain e. coli 3714 (s17-1 tnaa::tn5) in lb medium. oxindolyl-l-alanine also inhibits the adherence of s17-1 cells to polystyrene for a 3-h incubation time, but mutant strain 3714 cells are unaffected. at 0.5 mg/ml, oxindolyl-l-alanine exhibits inhibitory activity against biofilm formation in lb medium and in synthetic urine for several clinical isolates of e. coli, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter koseri, providencia stuartii, and morganella morganii but has no affect on indole-negative klebsiella pneumoniae strains. in conclusion, these data suggest that indole, produced by the action of tryptophanase, is involved in polystyrene colonization by several indole-producing bacterial species. indole may act as a signalling molecule to regulate the expression of adhesion and biofilm-promoting factors.
beta-lactamases involved in resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins in escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. clinical isolates collected between 1994 and 1996, in barcelona (spain).
the aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of decreased susceptibility to broad-spectrum cephalosporins in enterobacteriaceae that lack inducible chromosomal bla genes, and to determine the enzymes responsible for resistance. from all clinically relevant enterobacteriaceae strains isolated between 1994 and 1996, 88 of 7054 escherichia coli, seven of 581 klebsiella pneumoniae and 23 of 166 klebsiella oxytoca strains were studied because of their decreased susceptibilities to broad-spectrum cephalosporins (as reflected in intermediate susceptibilities and/or positive synergy tests and/or irregular crenellated inhibition zones). the most frequent mechanism implicated in decreased susceptibility to broad-spectrum cephalosporins displayed by e. coli and k. oxytoca was hyperproduction of chromosomal beta-lactamase, followed by plasmid-mediated shv-1 hyperproduction in e. coli. in our hospital, the incidence of plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) between 1994 and 1996 was low. esbls were found in only 10 (0.14%) e. coli strains (six ctx-m-9, two tem-12 and two shv-2), in one (0.17%) k. pneumoniae strain (shv-2) and in no k. oxytoca strains. the relatively wide variety of beta-lactamases that were detected among these common bacteria isolated from a single medical centre, including non-tem- and non-shv-derived esbls, appears epidemiologically remarkable.
extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella species: risk factors for colonization and impact of antimicrobial formulary interventions on colonization prevalence.
objective: the incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbetal)-mediated resistance has increased markedly during the past decade. risk factors for colonization with esbetal-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella species (esbetal-ek) remain unclear, as do methods to control their further emergence. design: case-control study. setting: two hospitals within a large academic health system: a 725-bed academic tertiary-care medical center and a 344-bed urban community hospital. patients: thirteen patients with esbetal-ek fecal colonization were compared with 46 randomly selected noncolonized controls. results: duration of hospitalization was the only independent risk factor for esbetal-ek colonization (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.21). of note, 8 (62%) of the patients had been admitted from another healthcare facility. in addition, there was evidence for dissemination of a single k oxytoca clone. finally, the prevalence of esbetal-ek colonization decreased from 7.9% to 5.7% following restriction of third-generation cephalosporins (p = .51). conclusions: esbetal-ek colonization was associated only with duration of hospitalization and there was no significant reduction following antimicrobial formulary interventions. the evidence for nosocomial spread and the high percentage of patients with esbetal-ek admitted from other sites suggest that greater emphasis must be placed on controlling the spread of such organisms within and between institutions.
characterization of clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae from 19 laboratories using the national committee for clinical laboratory standards extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection methods.
extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) are enzymes found in gram-negative bacilli that mediate resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and aztreonam. in 1999, the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) published methods for screening and confirming the presence of esbls in klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, and escherichia coli. to evaluate the confirmation protocol, we tested 139 isolates of k. pneumoniae that were sent to project icare (intensive care antimicrobial resistance epidemiology) from 19 hospitals in 11 u.s. states. each isolate met the nccls screening criteria for potential esbl producers (ceftazidime [caz] or cefotaxime [ctx] mics were > or =2 microg/ml for all isolates). initially, 117 (84%) isolates demonstrated a clavulanic acid (ca) effect by disk diffusion (i.e., an increase in caz or ctx zone diameters of > or =5 mm in the presence of ca), and 114 (82%) demonstrated a ca effect by broth microdilution (reduction of caz or ctx mics by > or =3 dilutions). for five isolates, a ca effect could not be determined initially by broth microdilution because of off-scale caz results. however, a ca effect was observed in two of these isolates by testing cefepime and cefepime plus ca. the cefoxitin mics for 23 isolates that failed to show a ca effect by broth microdilution were > or =32 microg/ml, suggesting either the presence of an ampc-type beta-lactamase or porin changes that could mask a ca effect. by isoelectric focusing (ief), 7 of the 23 isolates contained a beta-lactamase with a pi of > or =8.3 suggestive of an ampc-type beta-lactamase; 6 of the 7 isolates were shown by pcr to contain both ampc-type and bla(oxa) genes. the ief profiles of the remaining 16 isolates showed a variety of beta-lactamase bands, all of which had pis of < or =7.5. all 16 isolates were negative by pcr with multiple primer sets for ampc-type, bla(oxa), and bla(ctx-m) genes. in summary, 83.5% of the k. pneumoniae isolates that were identified initially as presumptive esbl producers were positive for a ca effect, while 5.0% contained beta-lactamases that likely masked the ca effect. the remaining 11.5% of the isolates studied contained beta-lactamases that did not demonstrate a ca effect. an algorithm based on phenotypic analyses is suggested for evaluation of such isolates.
antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolone photodegradation products determined by parallel-line bioassay and high performance liquid chromatography.
the fluoroquinolones produce multiple photodegradation products. little is known  about these products, particularly whether any possess antimicrobial activity. to investigate this, we used the parallel-line bioassay to investigate discrepancies in zone of inhibition size in conjunction with high performance liquid chromatography (hplc) analysis. a continuous flow photochemical reaction unit ('beam-boost') was used to partially photodegrade the fluoroquinolones ofloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin (0.02 mm) by between 15 and 89%, as confirmed by hplc. the concentration of residual parent fluoroquinolone in each irradiated sample was measured by hplc and a non-irradiated control solution was prepared at the same concentration. these were compared by parallel-line bioassays using escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca. with ofloxacin and levofloxacin, the zone size for the control solution was significantly less than that of the irradiated solutions, with >15% photodegradation in at least two of the indicator organisms, indicating that the photodegradation products possess antimicrobial activity. no difference was seen with ciprofloxacin at any level of photodegradation with any of the indicator organisms, nor with moxifloxacin at 30 and 54% photodegradation. a significant difference was observed with e. cloacae only, at 83% photodegradation.
in vitro and in vivo activities of lb10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
in vitro activity of lb10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. against gram-positive bacteria, lb10522 was most active among the compounds tested. it was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. lb10522 was highly effective against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested. ninety percent of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. these activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, lb10522 with a mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by staphylococcus aureus giorgio, streptococcus pneumoniae iii, pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e, escherichia coli 851e, proteus mirabilis 1315e, serratia marcescens 1826e, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus ac-54. lb10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as tem-3, tem-7, shv-1, fec-1, and p-99. lb10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in enterobacter cloacae 1194e, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. time-kill study showed that lb10522, at concentrations of two or four times the mic, had a rapid bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus 6538p, escherichia coli 851e, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e.
[antimicrobial activities of cefepime against clinically isolated strains].
in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefepime (cfpm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cfpm and other drugs were determined against clinical isolates that were obtained in 1994. 1. cfpm showed a wide antibacterial spectrum against staphylococcus spp. and glucose non-fermentative gram-negative rods ((g)nf-gnr). antimicrobial activities of cfpm against staphylococcus spp. were stronger than those of ceftazidime (caz) and somewhat stronger than those of cefotaxime (ctx), and antimicrobial activity of cfpm against pseudomonas aeruginosa was same as that of caz. 2. antimicrobial activities of cfpm against almost all of enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of caz and ctx. and cfpm showed strong antimicrobial activities against caz-resistant escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii and enterobacter spp. 3. antimicrobial activities of cfpm were weaker than those of caz against some of strains of klebsiella oxytoca, beta-lactamase high producing strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis and than those of ctx against beta-lactamase high producing strains of prevotella spp. 4. the feature of new cephems was demonstrated in that cfpm had wider antibacterial spectrum than cephems of previous genenations against staphylococcus spp. and (g)nf-gnr and cfpm showed strong antimicrobial activities against almost all of oxacephem-resistant enterobacteriaceae.
in vitro activity of cp-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
the in vitro activity of cp-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. cp-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin g and erythromycin (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against s. pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). the activity of cp-99,219 against enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, c. diversus, helicobacter pylori, and k. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with mic90 values to cp-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for cp-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. cp-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x mic against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broths. the spectrum and potency observed with cp-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.
in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of ljc 10,627.
the in vitro activity of ljc 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. ljc 10,627 inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, hafnia alvei, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, proteus rettgeri, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. ljc 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera klebsiella, enterobacter, citrobacter, and serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than ljc 10,627 against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. ljc 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis strains. ljc 10,627 inhibited streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. bacteroides fragilis and other bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of ljc 10,627 per ml. serum (50%) did not affect the mics. ljc 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of bush types 2b, 2b', tem-1, tem-2, tem-3, tem-5, tem-7, tem-9, and shv-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of bush type 1; p-99; a morganella enzyme; or a citrobacter freundii enzyme. the bush type 2c and 2d enzymes oxa-1, oxa-2, pse-1, pse-2, and pse-4 did not hydrolyze ljc 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of staphylococcus aureus, moraxella spp., bacteroides fragilis, and proteus vulgaris. the beta-lactamase of xanthomonas hydrolyzed ljc 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
review of the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
cefprozil is a newer oral cephalosporin with a spectrum of activity against organisms that include gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. a review of published data shows that cefprozil is active (susceptibility, less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml; moderate susceptibility, 16 micrograms/ml; resistance, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) against gram-positive species such as streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, and listeria monocytogenes; it may have marginal activity against some enterococci. among the gram-negative species, cefprozil has activity against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. for anaerobic species, cefprozil has activity against clostridial species, including clostridium difficile, peptostreptococci, and possibly bacteroides melaninogenicus and eubacterium. the activity of cefprozil is generally greater than that of cephalexin and generally similar to that of cefaclor. in these reports, cefprozil showed more in vitro activity than cephalexin and cefaclor against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci, beta-lactamase-positive methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and c. difficile, although the clinical significance of some of these differences has yet to be studied.
inhibition of acid secretion from parietal cells by non-human-infecting helicobacter species: a factor in colonization of gastric mucosa?
helicobacter pylori has been shown to produce a protein that inhibits acid secretion from parietal cells. we have examined other non-human-infecting helicobacter species for this property by measuring the uptake of [14c]aminopyrine into rabbit parietal cells as an indirect assessment of acid secretion. helicobacter felis and an isolate from a rhesus monkey were shown to inhibit acid secretion. isolates of helicobacter mustelae gave variable responses. whole bacteria and cell-free sonicates impaired the uptake of [14c]aminopyrine. we also tested other bacteria, including escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca, and campylobacter jejuni. as whole organisms, these control bacteria had little effect on acid secretion, but sonicates caused pronounced inhibition that was partially heat labile. pronase treatment of h. pylori destroyed its inhibitory effect. these results suggest that most helicobacter species, but not all isolates, are able to inhibit acid secretion from rabbit parietal cells. this property may be a factor in the establishment of long-term infection by these species.
effect of sub-minimal inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin and fleroxacin on the bacterial capsular antigen and opsonophagocytosis by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
we have studied the effect of sub-minimal inhibitory concentrations (sub-mic) of  ciprofloxacin and fleroxacin on capsulated (k+) and non-capsulated (k-) gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli o1:k1, o7:k1, o1:k-, o7:k-, and klebsiella oxytoca) as well as on staphylococcus aureus and we investigated the interaction of antibiotic pretreated bacteria with human serum and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn). following overnight growth in the presence of 1/2 mic of the antibiotics, bacteria were opsonized in human serum and incubated with pmn. opsonophagocytosis was quantified as the ratio of uptake by pmn of radioactively labeled bacteria. ciprofloxacin and fleroxacin enhanced the phagocytosis rate of e. coli k+ strains (control 5-10%; 1/2 mic of ciprofloxacin and fleroxacin 70-80%) of k. oxytoca (control o-2%; 1/2 mic of ciprofloxacin and fleroxacin 35-40%) as well as of staph. aureus (control 5-10%; 1/2 mic of the antibiotics 35-40%). opsonophagocytosis of k- strains was not altered. the enhancement of opsonophagocytosis was a complement dependent process. exposure of capsulated e. coli to ciprofloxacin as well as to fleroxacin resulted in decreased amounts of the capsular antigen.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
we investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. ipm had significantly high activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, providencia stuartii and pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. in a comparative study on activities of ipm against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, p. mirabilis or a. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among staphylococcus aureus, cns, s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa.
[enzymatic resistance to cefotaxime in 56 strains of klebsiella spp., escherichia coli and salmonella spp. at a tunisian hospital (1984-1988)].
the enzymatic and plasmid-encoded resistance towards oxyimino-beta-lactams has been recently reported as related to the production of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (e.g. shv-2, ctx-1 or tem-3), in particular in our hospital since 1984. the prevalence of that resistance has been examined from january 1984 to december 1988 in function of specimen, unit and type of enzyme among 8,421 isolates of klebsiella spp., e. coli, salmonella spp. each isolate showing a diameter of inhibition zone size inferior or equal to 25 mm for cefotaxime, the double disk synergy test was performed between a disk of amoxicillin and a clavulanic acid disk of cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and aztreonam. in case of synergy, sonicated extracts have been prepared and examined by isoelectrofocusing with the detection of beta-lactamase activity by ceftriaxone and nitrocefin. 56 isolates (k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. coli, s. wien, s. typhimurium scored positive including 27 in pediatrics, 18 in surgery, and 8 in medicine. 41% of isolates have been obtained from blood cultures and 26.8% from urines. a majority of isolates (49/56) produced the shv-2 type, but other types mediating the resistance phenotype ctx have been individualized initially by their isoelectric points e.g. 5.4 (tem-20 in k. pneumoniae in july 1986), 6.4 (tem-21 in e. coli, 1 k. pneumoniae in july 1988). the prevalence of resistance to cefotaxime from 1984 to 1988 has increased (from 0.3 to 1.4%), the highest rate being observed in pediatrics (5.6% in 1984 and 22.1% in 1988).
comparative in vitro susceptibilities of 504 bacteremic isolates to ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid and other antimicrobial agents.
a total of 504 clinical bacteremic isolates were tested for susceptibility to ticarcillin-clavulanic acid and 12 other antibiotics. ticarcillin-clavulanic acid showed superior antibacterial activity compared to penicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, ticarcillin, gentamicin, and amikacin against bacteremic isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. however, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid's activity was inferior to that of vancomycin against methicillin-resistant isolates of s. aureus and s. epidermidis. for escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, and lactose nonfermenting aerobic gram-negative bacilli, the activity of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid surpassed that of mezlocillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin. of the antimicrobial agents tested, ticarcillin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, and amikacin were the most active antibiotics against pseudomonas aeruginosa.
antimicrobial activity of dactimicin in vitro compared with that of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin.
antimicrobial activity of dactimicin, a pseudo-disaccharide aminoglycoside antibiotic, was compared with those of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin using clinical isolates of four gram-positive and sixteen gram-negative bacteria. dactimicin was more active than the reference amino-glycosides against serratia marcescens, especially gentamicin-resistant serratia sp., proteus vulgaris, p. rettgeri and klebsiella oxytoca, but less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and p. mirabilis. dactimicin was equally active as the references excepting netilmicin against gram-positive bacteria and some gram-negative bacteria including escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, morganella morganii, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogens, e. cloacae, acinetobacter calcoaceticus and campylobacter jejunii. dactimicin was active against resistant strains possessing various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes including aac(3)-1, by which dactimicin was acetylated.
cloning and characterization of an albicidin resistance gene from klebsiella oxytoca.
a dna fragment containing a gene for resistance to the antibiotic albicidin was isolated from klebsiella oxytoca and shown to be expressed in escherichia coli, where it also protected bacteriophage t7 replication from inhibition by albicidin. in vivo translation analysis demonstrated that the cloned 2.2kb dna fragment coded for a 36 kilodalton (kd) protein and a 25kd protein. the dna sequence was determined for a 654-base-pair open reading frame contained within a 1.2kb subcloned dna fragment encoding albicidin resistance. the predicted molecular weight of the polypeptide translated from the open reading frame was 25.8kd. a putative shine-dalgarno sequence precedes the open reading frame but a potential promoter sequence was not detected. a possible rho-independent transcription termination signal was found directly following the stop codon. the functional protein for albicidin resistance was isolated and purified. both the molecular weight and nh2-terminal amino acid sequence of this protein correspond with that predicted from the dna sequence of the open reading frame. the cloned albicidin resistance gene had no effect on the tsx (nupa) nucleoside uptake gene associated with spontaneous albicidin resistance in e. coli; also, it did not complement any of a range of e. coli dnats mutants at restrictive temperatures. the cloned resistance gene product remained intracellular in exponential cultures of k. oxytoca and e. coli. cell-free extracts from e. coli containing the resistance gene protected a sensitive strain of e. coli from inhibition by albicidin, as did the purified albicidin resistance protein. the mechanism of this albicidin resistance protein involved binding to albicidin to form a complex without antibiotic activity, but without catalysing further chemical modification of the antibiotic.
[activity of 9 beta-lactam antibiotics combined with clavulanic acid or sulbactam against the strains of broad-spectrum beta-lactamase (ctx-1) producing enterobacteriaceae isolated at the henri mondor hospital].
minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of seven cephalosporins: cefotaxime (ctx), ceftriaxone (cro), ceftazidime (caz), latamoxef (mox), cefoxitin (fox), cefotetan (ctt) and cm 40876 (cm), of aztreonam (atm) and imipenem (ipm) were evaluated by agar dilution with and without 5 mg/l of clavulanic acid (ac) or sulbactam (sb) for 28 strains isolated in 1986 (15 k. pneumoniae, 3. k. oxytoca, 4 e. coli, 4 e. cloacae, 1 e. aerogenes and 1 c. freundii). comparatively to mics of sensitive strains and to those of cured variants, mics of these strains were very increased for ctx, cro, atm (mode mic: 1 mg/l), and caz (2); weakly increased for mox and ctt (0.25), and identical for imp (0.12-0.25), cm (0.06) and fox (2-4), except for enterobacter and citrobacter (64). association with ac or sb did not modify mics of fox, cm and imp. for the other antibiotics, mics were reduced by addition of ac: klebsiella: 5 log2 for ctx and cro, 4 for caz and atm, 2 for mox and ctt; e. coli: 4 log2 for ctx and atm, 3 for cro and caz, 1 for mox and ctt; enterobacter and citrobacter 2 log2 for ctx, cro, caz and atm, 1 for mox and ctt. with sb, decrease of mics was two to for fold lesser than with ac. ac, and less efficiently sb, restored activity of ctx, cro, caz and atm on ctx-1 producing enterobacteriaceae, particularly klebsiella and e. coli. it was the same for mox and ctt, weakly affected by this resistance. ac and sb had not effect on fox, cm and ipm which remained active on these strains.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-807, a new oral cephalosporin.
cs-807 is a new oral prodrug of r-3746, a cephalosporin derivative, with potent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the susceptibility of about 1,200 clinical isolates to r-3746 was determined by the agar dilution method. ninety percent or more of pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, indole-positive and indole-negative proteus spp., providencia rettgeri, and haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations ranging less than or equal to 0.01 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. furthermore, at a concentration of 3.13 micrograms/ml, 50% or more of staphylococcus epidermidis, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens strains were also inhibited. pseudomonas aeruginosa and xanthomonas maltophilia were resistant to r-3746. the activity of r-3746 was scarcely influenced by several growth conditions. r-3746 was highly resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases derived from various species of bacteria. killing-curve studies demonstrated bactericidal activity of r-3746 at concentrations above the mic. r-3746 showed high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 1, 3, and 4 of staphylococcus aureus and 1a, 1bs, and 3 of escherichia coli. systemic infections in mice caused by various pathogens, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, responded well to therapy with oral doses of cs-807.
comparative in vitro activity of carumonam (ro 17-2301/ama-1080), a new monobactam, and ceftriaxone against aerobic or facultative gram-negative isolates.
carumonam (ro 17-2301/ama-1080) is a new monobactam antibiotic. a comparative in  vitro evaluation with ceftriaxone was undertaken against 153 gram-negative clinical aerobic or facultative bacteria, both producers and nonproducers of beta-lactamase. results indicated that carumonam had an enhancement of activity for pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae and parallelled that of ceftriaxone against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp. and serratia marcescens. it can be concluded that carumonam could be an alternative of interest for the treatment of patients with infections due to gram-negative strains presumably or proven to be multiresistant.
in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new difluoro oxacephem, 6315-s.
6315-s, a novel difluoromethyl thioacetamido oxacephem, had in vitro activity comparable to that of cefotaxime and moxalactam against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, salmonella spp., and shigella spp., inhibiting 90% at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. it inhibited piperacillin- and cefoperazone-resistant isolates in these species. 6315-s did not inhibit cefotaxime- or moxalactam-resistant citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, or enterobacter cloacae (mics for 90% of the strains tested were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml). proteus vulgaris resistant to cefotaxime was inhibited. pseudomonas species and acinetobacter species were resistant (mics greater than 64 micrograms/ml). mics for 90% of the staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis isolates were 4 micrograms/ml. 6315-s was highly active against anaerobic species of clostridium, fusobacterium, bacteroides, and peptostreptococci and was superior to other agents against these organisms. 6315-s was not hydrolyzed by the major plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it induced chromosomal beta-lactamases in enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of two oral cephalosporins, ceftetrame (ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (ro 15-8074).
ceftetrame (ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (ro 15-8074), two new orally administered aminothiazolyl imimomethoxy cephalosporins, inhibited hemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml but were less active against staphylococci than were cephalexin and cefaclor. they did not inhibit s. faecalis, s. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, corynebacterium jk species, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including ampicillin-resistant isolates, were inhibited at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml. both agents inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, salmonella species, shigella species, citrobacter diversus, and aeromonas hydrophila resistant to ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, although many isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime were not inhibited by these agents. a marked inoculum effect was noted for enterobacteriaceae carrying the richmond-sykes type 1a chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, but plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases did not hydrolyze the compounds. both drugs inhibited the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of e. cloacae, p99.
the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy 7 beta acyl ureido cephalosporin.
the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy ureido cephalosporin, was determined against 726 clinical isolates. ninety percent of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, salmonella, and shigella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin and piperacillin against these species. concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml of cefbuperazone were needed to inhibit serratia marcescens and providencia species, and 50% of enterobacter cloacae had mics greater than 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was less active by 8 to 32-fold than cefotaxime or moxalactam against most enterobacteriaceae. cefbuperazone did not inhibit acinetobacter or pseudomonas species. hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml and staphylococci by 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone had activity comparable to cefoxitin and moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis with mic90s of 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was not hydrolyzed by plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases and was an inhibitor of the p99 e. cloacae beta-lactamase with an i50 of 1 microgram/ml. it was a less effective inhibitor of the k. oxytoca k1 and e. coli tem-1 beta-lactamases than was clavulanic acid. cefbuperazone induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa and resistant e. cloacae. a permeability barrier in e. cloacae, c. freundii and p. aeruginosa is suggested by the potentiation of cefbuperazone's activity by edta.
behaviour of ceftazidime towards beta-lactamases.
from escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but the geometric mean of the inhibition constant ki used to measure this interaction was 120 and almost 700 times higher with ceftazidime than with cefotaxime and cefuroxime, respectively. two other beta-lactamases isolated from pr. vulgaris and klebsiella oxytoca also showed little or no interaction with ceftazidime. a complementary microbiological technique, the "double-disc" technique, indicated that ceftazidime was more stable than cefotaxime to all beta-lactamases tested. moxalactam, however, appeared to have slightly greater stability.
