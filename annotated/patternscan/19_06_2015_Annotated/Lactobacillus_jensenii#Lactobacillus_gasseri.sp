TI  == identification of culturable vaginal lactobacillus species among reproductive age women in mysore, india.
AB  == a healthy vaginal environment is predominated by certain lactobacillus species, which lead to the prevention of infections of the reproductive tract. this study  examined the characteristics of cultivable lactobacillus species between healthy  women and women with bacterial vaginosis (bv). between november 2011 and sept 2013, 139 women attending a women's clinic in mysore, india were diagnosed for bv in a cross-sectional study. bv was diagnosed using amsel's criteria: homogeneous  vaginal discharge, vaginal ph > 4.5, production of amines, and presence of 'clue' cells. those with three or more of the characteristics were considered to have bv. vaginal swabs were then cultured in rogosa agar, de man-rogosa-sharpe broth.  gram-positive lactobacilli generating 600- 800bp amplicon by16 srna were further  characterized by sequencing. cultivable vaginal samples were obtained from 132 (94.9%) women. according to amsel criteria, 83(62.1%) women were healthy and 49(37.1%) women had bv. eleven different lactobacillus species were isolated from 47 women. the common lactobacilli species found in this sample included l. crispatus (39.6%), l. gasseri (45.8%), and l. jensenii (14.6%). lactobacilli were isolated from 39 healthy and 8 women with bv. l. gasseri was cultured from 18.8%  of healthy and 6.1% of women with bv. the presence of l. reuteri was significantly associated with normal vaginal microbiota (p-value = 0.026). these  results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population. our findings showed lactobacilli species  present in healthy vagina of women in india do not differ from those reported from other countries.

TI  == comparison of detection methods for vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  == vaginal lactobacilli offer protection against microbiota imbalance and genitourinary tract infections. we compared vaginal lactobacilli in 50 estonian women of child-bearing age applying culture-based methods, quantitative pcr and next-generation sequencing (ngs). the culture-based methods found three different lactobacilli: lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii and lactobacillus gasseri. using ngs revealed the presence of l. crispatus in 76%, lactobacillus iners in 52%, l. jensenii in 47% and l. gasseri in 33% of the samples. according  to qpcr, l. iners was present in 67% and l. crispatus in 64% of the samples. the  proportions of l. crispatus revealed by qpcr and ngs were in good correlation (r=0.79, p<0.001), while that of l. iners correlated poorly (r=0.13, pnot greater-than0.05). good concordance for l. crispatus was also found between the results of the culture-based method and qpcr. finally, good overlap between the results of the culture-based method and ngs was revealed: in case of a positive ngs result for l. crispatus, the same species was isolated in 95% of samples. the corresponding percentages were 82% for l. jensenii and 86% for l. gasseri. our data indicate fairly general concordance of the three methods for detecting vaginal lactobacilli, except for l. iners. this points out the importance of standardisation of techniques, and the respective studies should involve cultures applying a medium suitable for the fastidious l. iners.

TI  == lactobacillus species as biomarkers and agents that can promote various aspects of vaginal health.
AB  == the human body is colonized by a vast number of microorganisms collectively referred to as the human microbiota. one of the main microbiota body sites is the female genital tract, commonly dominated by lactobacillus spp., in approximately  70% of women. each individual species can constitute approximately 99% of the ribotypes observed in any individual woman. the most frequently isolated species  are lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii and lactobacillus iners. residing at the port of entry of bacterial and viral pathogens, the vaginal lactobacillus species can create a barrier against pathogen invasion since mainly products of their metabolism secreted in the cervicovaginal fluid can play an important role in the inhibition of bacterial and viral infections. therefore, a lactobacillus-dominated microbiota appears to  be a good biomarker for a healthy vaginal ecosystem. this balance can be rapidly  altered during processes such as menstruation, sexual activity, pregnancy and various infections. an abnormal vaginal microbiota is characterized by an increased diversity of microbial species, leading to a condition known as bacterial vaginosis. information on the vaginal microbiota can be gathered from the analysis of cervicovaginal fluid, by using the nugent scoring or the amsel's  criteria, or at the molecular level by investigating the number and type of lactobacillus species. however, when translating this to the clinical setting, it should be noted that the absence of a lactobacillus-dominated microbiota does not appear to directly imply a diseased condition or dysbiosis. nevertheless, the widely documented beneficial role of vaginal lactobacillus species demonstrates the potential of data on the composition and activity of lactobacilli as biomarkers for vaginal health. the substantiation and further validation of such  biomarkers will allow the design of better targeted probiotic strategies.

TI  == the vaginal microbiome during pregnancy and the postpartum period in a european population.
AB  == the composition and structure of the pregnancy vaginal microbiome may influence susceptibility to adverse pregnancy outcomes. studies on the pregnant vaginal microbiome have largely been limited to northern american populations. using miseq sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons, we characterised the vaginal microbiota of a mixed british cohort of women (n = 42) who experienced uncomplicated term delivery and who were sampled longitudinally throughout pregnancy (8-12, 20-22, 28-30 and 34-36 weeks gestation) and 6 weeks postpartum.  we show that vaginal microbiome composition dramatically changes postpartum to become less lactobacillus spp. dominant with increased alpha-diversity irrespective of the community structure during pregnancy and independent of ethnicity. while the pregnancy vaginal microbiome was characteristically dominated by lactobacillus spp. and low alpha-diversity, unlike northern american populations, a significant number of pregnant women this british population had a l. jensenii-dominated microbiome characterised by low alpha-diversity. l. jensenii was predominantly observed in women of asian and caucasian ethnicity whereas l. gasseri was absent in samples from black women. this study reveals new insights into biogeographical and ethnic effects upon the pregnancy and postpartum vaginal microbiome and has important implications for future studies exploring relationships between the vaginal microbiome, host health and pregnancy outcomes.

TI  == establishment of a sensitive system for analysis of human vaginal microbiota on the basis of rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr.
AB  == ten specific primer sets, for lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus crispatus, atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, chlamydia trachomatis/muridarum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, and bifidobacterium angulatum, were developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: lactobacilli such as l. crispatus, l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. certain bacterial vaginosis (bv)-related bacteria, such as g. vaginalis, a. vaginae, m. curtisii, and prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. especially in one subject, both g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic bv patient. these results suggest that the rt-qpcr system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections.

TI  == rapid species-level identification of vaginal and oral lactobacilli using maldi-tof ms analysis and 16s rdna sequencing.
AB  == background: lactobacillus represents a large genus with different implications for the human host. specific lactobacilli are considered to maintain vaginal health and to protect from urogenital infection. the presence of lactobacillus species in carious lesions on the other hand is associated with progressive caries. despite their clinical significance, species-level identification of lactobacilli still poses difficulties and mostly involves a combination of different phenotypic and genotypic methods. this study evaluated rapid maldi-tof  ms analysis of vaginal and oral lactobacillus isolates in comparison to 16s rdna  analysis. results: both methods were used to analyze 77 vaginal and 21 oral lactobacillus isolates. the concordance of both methods was at 96% with five samples discordantly identified. fifteen different lactobacillus species were found in the vaginal samples, primarily l. iners, l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri. in the oral samples 11 different species were identified, mostly l. salivarius, l. gasseri, l. rhamnosus and l. paracasei. overall, the species found belonged to six different phylogenetic groups. for several samples, maldi-tof ms  analysis only yielded scores indicating genus-level identification. however, in most cases the species found agreed with the 16s rdna analysis result. conclusion: maldi-tof ms analysis proved to be a reliable and fast tool to identify lactobacilli to the species level. even though some results were ambiguous while 16s rdna sequencing yielded confident species identification, accuracy can be improved by extending reference databases. thus, mass spectra analysis provides a suitable method to facilitate monitoring clinically relevant  lactobacillus species.

TI  == lactobacilli inactivate chlamydia trachomatis through lactic acid but not h2o2.
AB  == lactobacillus species dominate the microbiome in the lower genital tract of most  reproductive-age women. producing lactic acid and h2o2, lactobacilli are believed to play an important role in prevention of colonization by and growth of pathogens. however, to date, there have been no reported studies characterizing how lactobacilli interact with chlamydia trachomatis, a leading sexually transmitted bacterium. in this report, we demonstrate inactivation of c. trachomatis infectivity by culture media conditioned by lactobacillus crispatus,  l. gasseri and l. jensenii, known to be dominating organisms in the human vaginal microbiome. lactobacillus still cultures produced lactic acid, leading to time- and concentration-dependent killing of c. trachomatis. neutralization of the acidic media completely reversed chlamydia killing. addition of lactic acid into  lactobacillus-unconditioned growth medium recapitulated the chlamydiacidal activity of conditioned media. the h2o2 concentrations in the still cultures were found to be comparable to those reported for the cervicovaginal fluid, but insufficient to inactivate chlamydiae. aeration of lactobacillus cultures by shaking markedly induced h2o2 production, but strongly inhibited lactobacillus growth and lactic acid production, and thus severely affected acidification, leading to significantly reduced chlamydiacidal efficiency. these observations indicate lactobacilli inactivate chlamydiae primarily through maintaining acidity in a relatively hypoxic environment in the vaginal lumen with limited h2o2, which is consistent with the notion that women with higher vaginal ph are more prone to sexually transmitted c. trachomatis infection. in addition to lactic acid, formic acid and acetic acid also exhibited potent chlamydiacidal activities. taken together, our findings imply that lowering the vaginal ph through engineering of  the vaginal microbiome and other means will make women less susceptible to c. trachomatis infection.

TI  == a simple identification method for vaginal secretions using relative quantification of lactobacillus dna.
AB  == in criminal investigations there are some cases in which identifying the presence of vaginal secretions provides crucial evidence in proving sexual assault. however, there are no methods for definitively identifying vaginal secretions. in the present study, we focused on lactobacillus levels in vaginal secretions and developed a novel identification method for vaginal secretions by relative quantification based on real time pcr. we designed a lactobacillus conserved region primer pair (lcp) by aligning 16s rrna gene sequences from major vaginal lactobacillus species (lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus iners and lactobacillus jensenii), and selected the human specific  primer pair (hsp) as an endogenous control for relative quantification. as a result, the deltact (deltact=ct[lcp]-ct[hsp]) values of vaginal secretions (11 out of 12 samples) were significantly lower than those of saliva, semen and skin  surface samples, and it was possible to discriminate between vaginal secretions and other body fluids. for the one remaining sample, it was confirmed that the predominant species in the microflora was not of the lactobacillus genus. the deltact values in this study were calculated when the total dna input used from the vaginal secretions was 10pg or more. additionally, the deltact values of samples up to 6-months-old, which were kept at room temperature, remained unchanged. thus, we concluded in this study that the simple deltact method by real time pcr is a useful tool for detecting the presence of vaginal secretions.

TI  == comparison of lower genital tract microbiota in hiv-infected and uninfected women from rwanda and the us.
AB  == introduction: previous studies have shown that alterations of the bacterial microbiota in the lower female genital tract influence susceptibility to hiv infection and shedding. we assessed geographic differences in types of genital microbiota between hiv-infected and uninfected women from rwanda and the united states. methods: genera of lower genital tract bacterial microbiota were identified by high-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna gene from 46 us women (36 hiv-infected, 10 hiv-uninfected) and 40 rwandan women (18 hiv-infected, 22 hiv-uninfected) with similar proportions of low (0-3) nugent scores. species of lactobacillus were identified by assembling sequences along with reference sequences into phylogenetic trees. prevalence of genera and lactobacillus species were compared using fisher's exact tests. results: overall the seven most prevalent genera were lactobacillus (74%), prevotella (56%), gardnerella (55%), atopobium (42%), sneathia (37%), megasphaera (30%), and parvimonas (26%), observed at similar prevalences comparing rwandan to us women, except for megasphaera (20% vs. 39%, p = 0.06). additionally, rwandan women had higher frequencies of mycoplasma (23% vs. 7%, p = 0.06) and eggerthella (13% vs. 0%, p = 0.02), and lower frequencies of lachnobacterium (8% vs. 35%, p<0.01) and allisonella (5% vs. 30%, p<0.01), compared with us women. the prevalence of mycoplasma was highest (p<0.05) in hiv-infected rwandan women (39%), compared to  hiv-infected us women (6%), hiv-uninfected rwandan (9%) and us (10%) women. the most prevalent lactobacillus species in both rwandan and us women was l. iners (58% vs. 76%, p = 0.11), followed by l. crispatus (28% vs. 30%, p = 0.82), l. jensenii (20% vs. 24%, p = 0.80), l. gasseri (20% vs. 11%, p = 0.37) and l. vaginalis (20% vs. 7%, p = 0.10). discussion: we found similar prevalence of most major bacterial genera and lactobacillus species in rwandan and us women. further work will be needed to establish whether observed differences differentially impact lower genital tract health or susceptibility to genital infections.

TI  == inhibitory effects of seaweed extracts on the growth of the vaginal bacterium gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == of 44 species of seaweed screened for potential anti-gardnerella vaginalis activity, 27 (61.4%) showed antimicrobial activity by the agar disk-diffusion method. among them, the strongest activities against the pathogen were exhibited  by chlorophyta, with ulva pertusa producing an 11.3-mm zone of inhibition at 5 mg disk(-)(1). the mic values of u. pertusa extracts against both g. vaginalis kctc  5096 and kctc 5097, the main cause of vaginosis, were 312 mug ml(-)(1), while the mic values against both candida albicans kctc 7270 and kctc 7965, the main cause  of candidiasis, were 2.5 mg ml(-)(1). against lactobacillus gasseri kctc 3173 and lactobacillus jensenii kctc 5194, members of the normal vaginal microflora, no inhibitory effect was seen even at 10 mg ml(-)(1). to identify the primary active compounds, a u. pertusa powder was successively fractionated according to polarity, and the main active agents against g. vaginalis kctc 5096 were determined to be nitrogenous compounds (156 mug ml(-)(1) of the mic value). according to these results, it was suggested that extracts of the seaweed u. pertusa are valuable for the development of natural therapeutic agents for treating women with bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == comparative functional genomics of lactobacillus spp. reveals possible mechanisms for specialization of vaginal lactobacilli to their environment.
AB  == lactobacilli are found in a wide variety of habitats. four species, lactobacillus crispatus, l. gasseri, l. iners, and l. jensenii, are common and abundant in the  human vagina and absent from other habitats. these may be adapted to the vagina and possess characteristics enabling them to thrive in that environment. furthermore, stable codominance of multiple lactobacillus species in a single community is infrequently observed. thus, it is possible that individual vaginal  lactobacillus species possess unique characteristics that confer to them host-specific competitive advantages. we performed comparative functional genomic analyses of representatives of 25 species of lactobacillus, searching for habitat-specific traits in the genomes of the vaginal lactobacilli. we found that the genomes of the vaginal species were significantly smaller and had significantly lower gc content than those of the nonvaginal species. no protein families were found to be specific to the vaginal species analyzed, but some were either over- or underrepresented relative to nonvaginal species. we also found that within the vaginal species, each genome coded for species-specific protein families. our results suggest that even though the vaginal species show no general signatures of adaptation to the vaginal environment, each species has specific and perhaps unique ways of interacting with its environment, be it the host or other microbes in the community. these findings will serve as a foundation for further exploring the role of lactobacilli in the ecological dynamics of vaginal microbial communities and their ultimate impact on host health.

TI  == the composition and stability of the vaginal microbiota of normal pregnant women  is different from that of non-pregnant women.
AB  == background: this study was undertaken to characterize the vaginal microbiota throughout normal human pregnancy using sequence-based techniques. we compared the vaginal microbial composition of non-pregnant patients with a group of pregnant women who delivered at term. results: a retrospective case-control longitudinal study was designed and included non-pregnant women (n = 32) and pregnant women who delivered at term (38 to 42 weeks) without complications (n =  22). serial samples of vaginal fluid were collected from both non-pregnant and pregnant patients. a 16s rrna gene sequence-based survey was conducted using pyrosequencing to characterize the structure and stability of the vaginal microbiota. linear mixed effects models and generalized estimating equations were used to identify the phylotypes whose relative abundance was different between the two study groups. the vaginal microbiota of normal pregnant women was different from that of non-pregnant women (higher abundance of lactobacillus vaginalis, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii and lower abundance of 22 other phylotypes in pregnant women). bacterial community state type (cst) iv-b or cst iv-a characterized by high relative abundance of species of genus atopobium as well as the presence of prevotella, sneathia, gardnerella, ruminococcaceae, parvimonas, mobiluncus and other taxa previously shown to be associated with bacterial vaginosis were less frequent in normal pregnancy. the stability of the  vaginal microbiota of pregnant women was higher than that of non-pregnant women;  however, during normal pregnancy, bacterial communities shift almost exclusively  from one cst dominated by lactobacillus spp. to another cst dominated by lactobacillus spp. conclusion: we report the first longitudinal study of the vaginal microbiota in normal pregnancy. differences in the composition and stability of the microbial community between pregnant and non-pregnant women were observed. lactobacillus spp. were the predominant members of the microbial community in normal pregnancy. these results can serve as the basis to study the  relationship between the vaginal microbiome and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

TI  == multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for the identification and quantitation of major vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  == lactobacilli play a key role in promoting vaginal health. depletion of these bacteria is associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv), the most common vaginal disorder. here we describe the development and laboratory validation of a novel single-tube multiplex taqman quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) assay  for the identification and quantitative assessment of the four major vaginal lactobacillus species: l. crispatus, l. jensenii, l. gasseri, and l. iners. the assay utility was evaluated by the analysis of lactobacilli in non-cultured clinical vaginal swab specimens collected from bv patients and healthy individuals. as confirmed by the assay, l. crispatus, l. jensenii, and to a lesser extent l. gasseri, are common in the vagina of healthy women, whereas l. iners dominance is associated with bv. the major assay limitation was preferential detection of dominant lactobacillus species in samples with mixed lactobacilli resulting in lower sensitivity for minor species. the multiplex qpcr assay described here is an advance in the detection and quantitation of the major vaginal lactobacilli, potentially facilitating the molecular diagnosis of bv and  post-therapy restoration of the vaginal microflora.

TI  == molecular detection of lactobacillus species in the neovagina of male-to-female transsexual women.
AB  == there is a general opinion that penile skin lined neovagina of transsexual women  is not able to support the growth of lactobacilli. this study was undertaken to prove if lactobacilli strains could survive in neovagina and to characterise the  most dominant lactobacillus species. sixty three male-to-female transsexual women without abnormal vaginal discharge, clinical signs of infection were recruited on an ongoing basis from among transsexual outpatients in an academic research institution and tertiary care centre. neovaginal smears were taken for molecular  lactobacillus spp. profiling by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). lactobacillus species were detected from 47/63 transsexual women (75%). the 279 lactobacillus signals detected by pcr-dgge technique belonged to 13 different species. lactobacilli of the l. delbrueckii group (l. gasseri, l. crispatus, l. johnsonii, l. iners, l. jensenii) were predominant. more than 90% of women harboured a combination of two or more neovaginal lactobacillus species. in this study we report the frequent occurrence of lactobacilli from neovagina of transsexual women. both, frequency and composition were similar to the normal lactic acid bacterial microflora in both women of reproductive age and postmenopausal women.

TI  == association between the vaginal microbiota, menopause status, and signs of vulvovaginal atrophy.
AB  == objective: the vaginal microbiota helps protect the female genital tract from disease. we sought to describe the composition of the vaginal microbiota in premenopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal women and to explore the association between the microbiota and vulvovaginal atrophy (vva). methods: eighty-seven women (aged 35-60 y) were classified as premenopausal (n = 30), perimenopausal (n = 29), or postmenopausal (n = 28) according to stages of reproductive aging workshop guidelines. midvaginal bacterial community composition was characterized by 16s ribosomal rna gene analysis. results: bacterial communities clustered into six community state types (csts), of which four were dominated by lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus iners, or lactobacillus jensenii, and two (cst iv-a and cst iv-b) had low relative abundance of lactobacillus. cst iv-a was characterized by streptococcus and prevotella, whereas cst iv-b was characterized by atopobium. there were significant associations between menopause stage and cst (p = 0.004) and between vva and cst (p = 0.002). perimenopausal women were more likely to be  classified as cst iv-a or l. gasseri cst, whereas postmenopausal women were often classified as cst iv-a. csts dominated by l. crispatus and l. iners were more prevalent in premenopausal women. nineteen participants had signs of mild or moderate vva. compared with women with no vva, the vaginal microbiota of women with mild or moderate atrophy had 25-fold greater odds of being classified as cst iv-a versus l. crispatus cst (adjusted odds ratio, 25.89; 95% credible interval,  2.98-406.79). conclusions: a distinct bacterial community state (cst iv-a) with a low relative abundance of lactobacillus is associated with vva. future studies recruiting a larger number of women are needed to replicate the findings. this study provides an impetus for future longitudinal studies designed to manage, modulate, and restore vaginal microbiota homeostasis, which would provide stronger evidence for a causal relationship with vva and ultimately improve the treatment and prevention of atrophic vaginitis in menopause.

TI  == differences in vaginal lactobacilli composition of iranian healthy and bacterial  vaginosis infected women: a comparative analysis of their cytotoxic effects with  commercial vaginal probiotics.
AB  == background: vaginal flora of healthy women is dominated by lactobacillus species  which can prevent bacterial vaginosis. objectives: the current study aimed to determine the differences in vaginal lactobacilli composition of iranian healthy  and bacterial vaginosis (bv) infected women and compared their cytotoxic effects  with commercial vaginal probiotics. patients and methods: one hundred and seventy eight vaginal specimens were collected from healthy and bv infected women. lactobacillus colonies were obtained by culturing on laked blood bhi and mrs medias and genetically defined by 16s rrna sequencing. differentiating the specimens to normal, intermediate and bv infected were carried out by ison and hey grading protocol. identification of lactobacillus strains in vaginal specimens were performed by multiplex pcr. the inhibitory effects of lactobacilli on hela (tumoral cervical cells) and hncf-pi52 (normal cervical cells) were conducted by mtt and trypan blue assays. results: l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. iners, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus and l. rhamnosus were the most frequently occurring species in vagina of healthy iranian women. l. crispatus and l. jensenni were significantly higher in the normal than in the bv infected groups.  also the cytotoxic effect of l. crispatus on tumoral cervical cells was higher than other lactobacilli including commercial probiotics. conclusions: as l. crispatus and l. jensenni were significantly higher in bv infected women and the  cytotoxic effect of l. crispatus on tumoral cervical cells was high, introduction of new probiotics seems necessary.

TI  == influence of vaginal bacteria and d- and l-lactic acid isomers on vaginal extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer: implications for protection against upper genital tract infections.
AB  == we evaluated levels of vaginal extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (emmprin) and matrix metalloproteinase (mmp-8) in vaginal secretions in relation  to the composition of vaginal bacterial communities and d- and l-lactic acid levels. the composition of vaginal bacterial communities in 46 women was determined by pyrosequencing the v1 to v3 region of 16s rrna genes. lactobacilli  were dominant in 71.3% of the women, followed by gardnerella (17.4%), streptococcus (8.7%), and enterococcus (2.2%). of the lactobacillus-dominated communities, 51.5% were dominated by lactobacillus crispatus, 36.4% by lactobacillus iners, and 6.1% each by lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus jensenii. concentrations of l-lactic acid were slightly higher in lactobacillus-dominated vaginal samples, but most differences were not statistically significant. d-lactic acid levels were higher in samples containing l. crispatus than in those with l. iners (p<0.0001) or gardnerella (p=0.0002). the relative proportion of d-lactic acid in vaginal communities dominated by species of lactobacilli was in concordance with the proportions found in axenic cultures of the various species grown in vitro. levels of l-lactic acid (p<0.0001) and the ratio of l-lactic acid to d-lactic acid (p=0.0060), but not concentrations of d-lactic acid, were also correlated with emmprin concentrations. moreover, vaginal concentrations of emmprin and mmp-8 levels were highly correlated (p<0.0001). taken together, the data suggest the relative proportion of l- to d-lactic acid isomers in the vagina may influence the extent  of local emmprin production and subsequent induction of mmp-8. the expression of  these proteins may help determine the ability of bacteria to transverse the cervix and initiate upper genital tract infections. importance: a large proportion of preterm births (>50%) result from infections caused by bacteria originating in the vagina, which requires that they traverse the cervix. factors  that influence susceptibility to these infections are not well understood; however, there is evidence that matrix metalloproteinase (mmp-8) is known to alter the integrity of the cervix. in this work, we show that concentrations of vaginal extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (emmprin) are influenced by members of the vaginal microbial community and concentrations of d- or l-lactic acid isomers in vaginal secretions. elevated levels of d-lactic acid and the ratio of d- to l-lactic acid influence emmprin concentrations as well as mmp-8 levels. thus, isomers of lactic acid may function as signaling molecules that alter host gene expression and influence risk of infection-related preterm birth.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  == background: lactobacillus jensenii, l. iners, l. crispatus and l. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. however, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. the present study was performed  to genetically determine the identity of lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (bv) intermediate mexican women. methods: in a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant mexican women. the samples were classified into groups according to  the nugent score criteria proposed for detection of bv: normal (n), intermediate  (i) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). we examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the v1-v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene.  enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. results: clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16s rrna gene: l. acidophilus (14/25), l. reuteri (6/25), l. casei (4/25) and l. buchneri (1/25). the remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as enterococcus species. within the l. acidophilus group, l. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by l. jensenii and l. crispatus. l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the l. reuteri, l. casei and l.  buchneri groups, respectively. eric profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the l. gasseri and l. fermentum species. conclusions: these findings agree with previous studies showing that l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant mexican (hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.

AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv), which is highly prevalent in the african population, is one of the most common vaginal syndromes affecting women in their  reproductive age placing them at increased risk for sexually transmitted diseases including infection by human immunodeficiency virus-1. the vaginal microbiota of  a healthy woman is often dominated by the species belonging to the genus lactobacillus namely l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. jensenii and l. iners, which have been extensively studied in european populations, albeit less so in south african women. in this study, we have therefore identified the vaginal lactobacillus species in a group of 40 african women from soweto, a township on the outskirts of johannesburg, south africa. methods: identification was done by  cultivating the lactobacilli on rogosa agar, de man-rogosa-sharpe (mrs) and blood agar plates with 5% horse blood followed by sequencing of the 16s ribosomal dna.  bv was diagnosed on the basis of nugent scores. since some of the previous studies have shown that the lack of vaginal hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) producing lactobacilli is associated with bacterial vaginosis, the lactobacillus isolates were also characterised for their production of h2o2. results: cultivable lactobacillus species were identified in 19 out of 21 women without bv, in three  out of five women with intermediate microbiota and in eight out of 14 women with  bv. we observed that l. crispatus, l. iners, l. jensenii, l. gasseri and l. vaginalis were the predominant species. the presence of l. crispatus was associated with normal vaginal microbiota (p = 0.024). high level of h2o2 producing lactobacilli were more often isolated from women with normal microbiota than from the women with bv, although not to a statistically significant degree (p = 0.064). conclusion: the vaginal lactobacillus species isolated from the cohort of south african women are similar to those identified in european populations. in accordance with the other published studies, l. crispatus is related to a normal vaginal microbiota. hydrogen peroxide production was not significantly associated to the bv status which could be attributed to the limited number of samples or to other antimicrobial factors that might be involved.

TI  == association between trichomonas vaginalis and vaginal bacterial community composition among reproductive-age women.
AB  == objectives: some vaginal bacterial communities are thought to prevent infection by sexually transmitted organisms. prior work demonstrated that the vaginal microbiota of reproductive-age women cluster into 5 types of bacterial communities; 4 dominated by lactobacillus species (l. iners, l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. jensenii) and 1 (termed community state type (cst) iv) lacking significant numbers of lactobacilli and characterized by higher proportions of atopobium, prevotella, parvimonas, sneathia, gardnerella, mobiluncus, and other taxa. we sought to evaluate the relationship between vaginal bacterial composition and trichomonas vaginalis. methods: self-collected vaginal swabs were obtained cross-sectionally from 394 women equally representing 4 ethnic/racial groups. t. vaginalis screening was performed using pcr targeting the 18s rrna and beta-tubulin genes. vaginal bacterial composition was characterized by pyrosequencing of barcoded 16s rrna genes. a panel of 11 microsatellite markers was used to genotype t. vaginalis. the association between vaginal microbiota and t. vaginalis was evaluated by exact logistic regression. results: t. vaginalis was detected in 2.8% of participants (11/394). of the 11 t. vaginalis-positive cases, 8 (72%) were categorized as cst-iv, 2 (18%) as communities dominated by l. iners, and 1 (9%) as l. crispatus-dominated (p = 0.05). cst-iv microbiota were associated with an 8-fold increased odds of detecting t. vaginalis compared with  women in the l. crispatus-dominated state (or: 8.26, 95% ci: 1.07-372.65). seven  of the 11 t. vaginalis isolates were assigned to 2 genotypes. conclusion: t. vaginalis was associated with vaginal microbiota consisting of low proportions of lactobacilli and high proportions of mycoplasma, parvimonas, sneathia, and other  anaerobes.

TI  == quantification of bacterial species of the vaginal microbiome in different groups of women, using nucleic acid amplification tests.
AB  == background: the vaginal microbiome plays an important role in urogenital health.  quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) assays for the most prevalent vaginal lactobacillus species and bacterial vaginosis species g. vaginalis and a. vaginae exist, but qpcr information regarding variation over time is still very limited. we set up qpcr assays for a selection of seven species and defined the temporal variation over three menstrual cycles in a healthy caucasian population with a normal nugent score. we also explored differences in qpcr data between these healthy women and an 'at risk' clinic population of caucasian, african and asian women with and without bacterial vaginosis (bv), as defined by the nugent score. results: temporal stability of the lactobacillus species counts was high with l. crispatus counts of 108 copies/ml and l. vaginalis counts of 106 copies/ml. we identified 2 types of 'normal flora' and one 'bv type flora' with latent class analysis on the combined data of all women. the first group was particularly common in women with a normal nugent score and was characterized by a high frequency of l. crispatus, l. iners, l. jensenii, and l. vaginalis and a correspondingly low frequency of l. gasseri and a. vaginae. the second group was characterized by the predominance of l. gasseri and l. vaginalis and was found most commonly in healthy caucasian women.  the third group was commonest in women with a high nugent score but was also seen in a subset of african and asian women with a low nugent score and was characterized by the absence of lactobacillus species (except for l. iners) but the presence of g. vaginalis and a. vaginae. conclusions: we have shown that the  quantification of specific bacteria by qpcr contributes to a better description of the non-bv vaginal microbiome, but we also demonstrated that differences in populations such as risk and ethnicity also have to be taken into account. we believe that our selection of indicator organisms represents a feasible strategy  for the assessment of the vaginal microbiome and could be useful for monitoring the microbiome in safety trials of vaginal products.

TI  == characteristics of lactobacillus and gardnerella vaginalis from women with or without bacterial vaginosis and their relationships in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == the objectives of the present study were to evaluate in vitro the production of antagonistic compounds against gardnerella vaginalis by lactobacillus strains isolated from women with or without bacterial vaginosis (bv), and to select one of the better lactobacillus producers of such a substance to be tested in vivo using a gnotobiotic animal model challenged with one of the more sensitive g. vaginalis isolates. a total of 24 isolates from women with and without bv were identified as g. vaginalis. a higher frequency (p<0.05) of this bacterium was observed in women with bv (56.7%) when compared to healthy women (17.6%). a total of 86 strains of lactobacillus were obtained from healthy women and women with bv. lactobacillus strains were more frequently present (p<0.05) in healthy women  (97.5%) than in women with bv (76.7%). lactobacillus crispatus was the predominating strain in both healthy women and women with bv. lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus vaginalis were isolated with an intermediate frequency in the two groups. in vitro antagonism assays were performed using as indicators 17 reference strains and the g. vaginalis strains isolated from women with bv and from healthy women.  lactobacillus isolated from healthy women showed the higher antagonistic activity against all the indicator strains when compared with isolates from women with bv. concerning the indicator strains, g. vaginalis found in women with bv was more resistant to the antagonism, particularly when lactobacillus isolates from women  with bv were used as producer strains. a high vaginal population level of g. vaginalis was obtained by intravaginal inoculation of germ-free mice, and this colonization was accompanied by vaginal histopathological lesions. a tenfold decrease in vaginal population level of g. vaginalis and a reduction of histological lesions were observed when the pathogenic challenge was performed in mice previously monoassociated with an l. johnsonii strain. concluding, results of the present study suggest that progression of g. vaginalis-associated bv depends in part on a simultaneous presence of lactobacillus populations with a low antagonistic capacity and of a g. vaginalis strain with a high resistance to  this antagonism. the results could also explain why g. vaginalis is frequently found in the vaginal ecosystem of healthy women.

TI  == detection of bacterial 16s ribosomal rna genes for forensic identification of vaginal fluid.
AB  == to preliminarily evaluate the applicability of bacterial dna as a marker for the  forensic identification of vaginal fluid, we developed and performed pcr-based detection of 16s ribosomal rna genes of lactobacillus spp. dominating the vagina  and of bacterial vaginosis-related bacteria from dna extracted from body fluids and stains. as a result, 16s ribosomal rna genes of lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii and atopobium vaginae were specifically detected in vaginal fluid and female urine samples. bacterial genes detected in female urine  might have originated from contaminated vaginal fluid. in addition, those of lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus gasseri and gardnerella vaginalis were also detected in non-vaginal body fluids such as semen. because bacterial genes were successfully amplified in dna samples extracted by using the general procedure for animal tissues without any optional treatments, dna samples prepared for the  identification of vaginal fluid can also be used for personal identification. in  conclusion, 16s ribosomal rna genes of l. crispatus, l. jensenii and a. vaginae could be effective markers for forensic identification of vaginal fluid.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == lactobacillus species shift in distal esophagus of high-fat-diet-fed rats.
AB  == aim: to analyze the microbiota shift in the distal esophagus of sprague-dawley rats fed a high-fat diet. methods: twenty sprague-dawley rats were divided into high-fat diet and normal control groups of 10 rats each. the composition of microbiota in the mucosa from the distal esophagus was analyzed based on selective culture. a variety of lactobacillus species were identified by molecular biological techniques. bacterial dna from lactobacillus colonies was extracted, and 16s rdna was amplified by pcr using bacterial universal primers. the amplified 16s rdna products were separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). every single band was purified from the gel and sent to be sequenced. results: based on mucosal bacterial culturing in the distal esophagus, staphylococcus aureus was absent, and total anaerobes and lactobacillus species were decreased significantly in the high-fat diet group compared with the normal control group (p < 0.01). detailed dgge analysis on the  composition of lactobacillus species in the distal esophagus revealed that lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri (l. gasseri) and lactobacillus reuteri (l. reuteri) comprised the lactobacillus species in the high-fat diet group, while the composition of lactobacillus species in the normal control group consisted of l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii and l. reuteri. conclusion: high-fat diet led to a mucosal microflora shift in the distal esophagus in rats,  especially the composition of lactobacillus species.

TI  == strong correspondence in bacterial loads between the vagina and rectum of pregnant women.
AB  == we sampled the vagina and rectum in 71 pregnant women and bacterial loads of lactobacillus crispatus, l. jensenii, l. gasseri, l. iners, gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae were determined by culture and quantitative pcr (qpcr). culture and qpcr results differed substantially with regard to the evaluation of  vaginal and rectal occurrence of the six species tested. the vaginal-rectal prevalence of l. crispatus, l. jensenii, l. gasseri, l. iners, g. vaginalis and a. vaginae as established by culture vs. pcr was 32.3 vs. 91.5%, 32.3 vs. 77.4%,  28.1 vs. 91.5%, 12.6 vs. 68.5%, 12.6 vs. 74.6% and 5.6 vs. 69.0%, respectively. using qpcr, a significant positive correlation was found between vaginal and rectal loads of l. crispatus (p < 0.0001), l. jensenii (p < 0.0001), l. gasseri (p = 0.005), l. iners (p = 0.003) and a. vaginae (p = 0.002). in summary, significant correlations between quantities of vaginal and rectal lactobacilli and of atopobium vaginae were established by means of qpcr, indicating strong correspondence of vaginal and rectal microflora, not only in the occurrence of certain species in both niches, but also of cell densities per bacterial species.

TI  == (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting of lactobacilli isolated from cervix of healthy women.
AB  == a group of lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of 31 healthy women was characterized by (gtg)(5)-polymerase chain reaction (pcr) fingerprinting in order to evaluate this method for identification of vaginal lactobacilli. obtained fingerprints were compared with profiles available in an in-house database of the ccm bacteria collection covering type and reference strains of multiple lactic acid bacteria including lactobacilli. selected strains representing individual clusters were further identified by phes gene sequencing. in total, six lactobacillus species were found among lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of healthy women. the (gtg)(5)-pcr method identified lactobacillus gasseri (11 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (one), and some of the lactobacillus jensenii strains (eight out of 11), but failed to identify the remaining strains, including the lactobacillus crispatus (18), lactobacillus mucosae (one), and lactobacillus vaginalis (one) species. l. jensenii strains were distributed over  two fingerprint clusters. the majority of samples was dominated by one (gtg)(5)-pcr type. the rep-pcr fingerprinting using the (gtg)(5) primer allowed straightforward identification of many, but not all, isolates. this method has been shown to be a useful tool for fast screening and grouping of vaginal lactobacilli, but its combination with another identification method is needed to obtain reliable identification results. in addition, lactobacillus acidophilus was not shown to be the most common inhabitant of the female genital tract as generally assumed.

TI  == the role of acidification in the inhibition of neisseria gonorrhoeae by vaginal lactobacilli during anaerobic growth.
AB  == background: vaginal lactobacilli protect the female genital tract by producing lactic acid, bacteriocins, hydrogen peroxide or a local immune response. in bacterial vaginosis, normal lactobacilli are replaced by an anaerobic flora and this may increase susceptibility to neisseria gonorrhoeae, a facultative anaerobe. bacterial interference between vaginal lactobacilli and n. gonorrhoeae  has not been studied in liquid medium under anaerobic conditions. by co-cultivating n. gonorrhoeae in the presence of lactobacilli we sought to identify the relative contributions of acidification and hydrogen peroxide production to any growth inhibition of n. gonorrhoeae. methods: three strains of  n. gonorrhoeae distinguishable by auxotyping were grown in the presence of high concentrations (107-108 cfu/ml) of three vaginal lactobacilli (l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii) in an anerobic liquid medium with and without 2-(n-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic (mes) buffer. fusobacterium nucleatum was used as an indicator of anaerobiosis. bacterial counts were performed at 15, 20 and 25 h; at 25 h ph and hydrogen peroxide concentrations were measured. results: growth of f. nucleatum to >108 cfu/ml at 25 h confirmed anaerobiosis. all bacteria grew in  the anaerobic liquid medium and the addition of mes buffer had negligible effect  on growth. l. crispatus and l. gasseri produced significant acidification and a corresponding reduction in growth of n. gonorrhoeae. this inhibition was abrogated by the addition of mes. l. jensenii produced less acidification and did not inhibit n. gonorrhoeae. hydrogen peroxide was not detected in any experiment. conclusions: during anaerobic growth, inhibition of n. gonorrhoeae by the vaginal lactobacilli tested was primarily due to acidification and abrogated by the presence of a buffer. there was no evidence of a specific mechanism of inhibition other than acid production under these conditions and, in particular, hydrogen peroxide was not produced. the acidification potential of vaginal lactobacilli under anaerobic conditions may be their most important characteristic conferring  protection against n. gonorrhoeae infection.

TI  == correlation between api 50 ch and multiplex polymerase chain reaction for the identification of vaginal lactobacilli in isolates.
AB  == identification of lactobacillus sp. strains by phenotypic methods may lead to doubtful results possibly interfering in the reliability of the epidemiological and probiotics studies. therefore this study aimed to determine the best methodology for the identification of the large diversity of lactobacilli species found in the vagina by comparing two techniques, one based on their biochemical profile and other employing molecular biology. a carbohydrate fermentation test (api 50 ch) was compared with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for the identification of species of vaginal lactobacilli from 135 healthy women. the kappa index was used to evaluate agreement between the methods. using the molecular technique, l. crispatus (32.6%), l. jensenii (25%) and l. gasseri (20.6%) were the most frequent species. however, using the biochemical technique, the most frequent species were: l. acidophilus (34.8%), l. crispatus (27.2%) and  l. fermentum (13%). although l. acidophilus was the most frequent specie found by biochemical tests, no strain of this microorganism was detected by pcr. agreement between the methods was low for identification of all the most common species. although rates of l. crispatus detected were similar using both methods (32.6% and 27.2%), agreement between them was relatively low (kappa = 0.52). conclusions: our results confirmed the limitation of the biochemical method and the applicability of a previously published molecular method (multiplex pcr) for  the identification of lactobacilli in the vaginal tract, focusing on further necessity of its improvement for also targeting l. vaginalis and l. iners.

TI  == identification of predominant culturable vaginal lactobacillus species and associated bacteriophages from women with and without vaginal discharge syndrome  in south africa.
AB  == lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus vaginalis were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing as the predominant culturable vaginal lactobacillus species in a  group of south african women, comprising 24, 22, 10, 10 and 9 %, respectively. a  significant effect of vaginal discharge syndrome (vds) and bacterial vaginosis (bv) on the distribution of predominant lactobacillus species was observed. whilst l. crispatus isolates were almost equally distributed between individuals  with and without vds and were not significantly reduced in women with bv versus normal microflora, l. jensenii isolates were significantly reduced in women with  vds (p=0.022) and reduced in women with bv versus normal microflora (p=0.053). unlike l. crispatus, l. jensenii isolates were also significantly reduced in women with bv-associated vds versus women without vds and with normal microflora  (p=0.051). in addition, lysogeny was commonly observed for l. crispatus, with 77  % of isolates yielding phage particles with contractile and non-contractile tails. only 29 % of l. jensenii isolates yielded phage particles, and these were  visible as tailless or podo-like particles.

TI  == vaginal microbiome of reproductive-age women.
AB  == the means by which vaginal microbiomes help prevent urogenital diseases in women  and maintain health are poorly understood. to gain insight into this, the vaginal bacterial communities of 396 asymptomatic north american women who represented four ethnic groups (white, black, hispanic, and asian) were sampled and the species composition characterized by pyrosequencing of barcoded 16s rrna genes. the communities clustered into five groups: four were dominated by lactobacillus  iners, l. crispatus, l. gasseri, or l. jensenii, whereas the fifth had lower proportions of lactic acid bacteria and higher proportions of strictly anaerobic  organisms, indicating that a potential key ecological function, the production of lactic acid, seems to be conserved in all communities. the proportions of each community group varied among the four ethnic groups, and these differences were statistically significant [chi(2)(10) = 36.8, p < 0.0001]. moreover, the vaginal  ph of women in different ethnic groups also differed and was higher in hispanic (ph 5.0 +/- 0.59) and black (ph 4.7 +/- 1.04) women as compared with asian (ph 4.4 +/- 0.59) and white (ph 4.2 +/- 0.3) women. phylotypes with correlated relative abundances were found in all communities, and these patterns were associated with either high or low nugent scores, which are used as a factor for  the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. the inherent differences within and between women in different ethnic groups strongly argues for a more refined definition of the kinds of bacterial communities normally found in healthy women and the need to appreciate differences between individuals so they can be taken into account in risk assessment and disease diagnosis.

TI  == vaginal lactobacilli as potential probiotics against candida spp.
AB  == urogenital infections affect millions of people every year worldwide. the treatment of these diseases usually requires the use of antimicrobial agents, and more recently, the use of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab) cultures for the management of vaginal infections has been extensively studied. in this work, 11 vaginal lactobacilli isolates, previously obtained from healthy patients, were studied to screen microorganisms with probiotic properties against candida spp. the lab were tested for their ability of auto-aggregation, co-aggregation with c. albicans, c. glabrata, c. krusei, and c. tropicalis, adhesion to caco-2 epithelial cells and production of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2). all  lactobacilli isolates tested were able to auto-aggregate (ranging from 25.3% to 75.4% assessed at 4 hours of incubation) and to co-aggregate with the four candida species into different degrees; among them l. crispatus showed the highest scores of co-aggregation. the highest amount of lactic acid was produced  by l. salivarius (13.9 g/l), followed by l. johnsonii (6.5 g/l), l. acidophilus (5.5 g/l), and l. jensenii (5.4 g/l). all isolates produced h2o2, but the highest levels (3 - 10 mg/l) were observed for l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. gasseri,  l. johnsonii, and l. vaginalis. only l. agilis, l. jensenii, l. johnsonii and l.  ruminus were able to adhere to epithelial caco-2 cells. among the isolates evaluated, l agilis, l. jensenii, l. johnsonii, and l. ruminus exhibited simultaneously several desirable properties as potential probiotic strains justifying future studies to evaluate their technological properties in different pharmaceutical preparations for human use.

TI  == comparison of main lactobacillus species between healthy women and women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: the normal microbial flora of the vagina plays an important role in preventing genital and urinary tract infections in women. thus an accurate understanding of the composition and ecology of the ecosystem is important to understanding the etiology of these diseases. this study aimed to compare the characteristics of main lactobacillus species between healthy women and women with bacterial vaginosis (bv) by quantitative culture and pcr methods. main lactobacillus species include l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. jensenii and l. iners. methods: a total of 150 women attending gynecology outpatient clinic of beijing friendship hospital, were diagnosed as having bv because three or more of the following criteria were met (standard of amsel's composite criteria): homogeneous discharge, elevated vaginal ph (ph > 4.5), production of amines, and presence of  "clue" cells. those with less than three of the criteria were considered as healthy. simultaneously, smears were made of vaginal fluid and gram stained, then were assessed qualitatively as normal (grade i), intermediate (grade ii), or consistent with bv (grade iii). gardnerella vaginalis were identified by using vitek 2 compact and pcr methods. lactobacillus species were identified by pcr methods. gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacilli colony counts were determined by  calculating the most number of colonies of each species in the appropriate plates (colonies between 10 and 300), corrected by the dilution of the sample in the plates, and multiplied by 10 (to account for plating 100 microl), in order to get colony forming units per milliliter of vaginal secretion. results: bv was diagnosed in 31% (46/150) patients using the composite criteria, the remainder being regarded as healthy. the majority of patients with bv had a smear assessed  as grade iii (91%, 42/46) and minority of them had a smear assessed as grade ii (9%, 4/46). the majority of healthy women had a smear assessed as grade i (64%, 67/104). smears assessed as grade ii were found (36%, 37/104) among patients diagnosed as healthy, with less than three of the composite criteria. l. crispatus was cultured from 94% of healthy women and 83% of women with bv, with the former colonies count average value of 10(6) and the latter of 10(3). l. gasseri, l. iners, and l. jensenii were cultured from 85%, 68% and 43% of healthy women; and 28%, 89% and 44% of bv women, respectively. conclusions: the quantities of four lactobacillus species except l. jensenii had a significant difference between healthy women and women with bv. our results provide support for the negative association between l. iners and l. gasseri. although l. crispatus were existent both in healthy and bv positive women's vagina, the numbers of l. crispatus were significantly different for the dominant number in healthy women. smears of vaginal fluid and gram stain play an important guiding role in bacteria culture.

TI  == biosynthesis and degradation of h2o2 by vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  == hydrogen peroxide production by vaginal lactobacilli represents one of the most important defense mechanisms against vaginal colonization by undesirable microorganisms. to quantify the ability of a collection of 45 vaginal lactobacillus strains to generate h(2)o(2), we first compared three published colorimetric methods. it was found that the use of da-64 as a substrate rendered  the highest sensitivity, while tetramethyl-benzidine (tmb) maintained its linearity from nanomolar to millimolar h(2)o(2) concentrations. generation of h(2)o(2) was found to be especially common and strong for l. jensenii strains, while it was variable among l. crispatus and l. gasseri strains. biosynthesis of  h(2)o(2) only occurred upon agitation of the cultures, but the h(2)o(2)-producing machinery was already present in them before aeration started. calcium, magnesium, manganese, and zinc ions did not affect h(2)o(2) production, while cu(2+) inhibited the growth of lactobacillus jensenii cect 4306, which was chosen as a model strain. cultures with fe(3+), hemin, and hemoglobin did not accumulate h(2)o(2). fe(3+) activated an extracellular peroxidase that destroyed the h(2)o(2) being produced by the cultures. this protected the lactobacilli against  its antimicrobial effect. the production of the enzyme appears to be constitutive, the fe(3+) ions being a necessary cofactor of the reaction.

TI  == the vaginal bacterial communities of japanese women resemble those of women in other racial groups.
AB  == to determine whether different racial groups shared common types of vaginal microbiota, we characterized the composition and structure of vaginal bacterial communities in asymptomatic and apparently healthy japanese women in tokyo, japan, and compared them with those of white and black women from north america.  the composition of vaginal communities was compared based on community profiles of terminal restriction fragments of 16s rrna genes and phylogenetic analysis of  cloned 16s rrna gene sequences of the numerically dominant bacterial populations. the types of vaginal communities found in japanese women were similar to those of black and white women. as with white and black women, most vaginal communities were dominated by lactobacilli, and only four species of lactobacillus (lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii, and lactobacillus gasseri) were commonly found. communities dominated by multiple species of lactobacilli were common in japanese and white women, but rare in black women. the incidence, in japanese women, of vaginal communities with several non-lactobacillus species at moderately high frequencies was intermediate between black women and white women. the limited number of community types found  among women in different ethnic groups suggests that host genetic factors, including the innate and adaptive immune systems, may be more important in determining the species composition of vaginal bacterial communities than are cultural and behavioral differences.

AB  == developmental changes in immunocompetent cells of the gut during the first week posthatch were determined in broiler chicks fed immunobiotic lactic acid bacteria in the form of lactobacillus jensenii tl2937-, lactobacillus gasseri jcm1131(t)-, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus niaib6-, or l. gasseri tl2919-supplemented diets. the relative weights of spleen and bursa of fabricius  in chicks fed the immunobiotic diets were slightly higher than the control valued at 1 and 3 d of age, with the exception of spleen weight in the l. gasseri jcm1131(t) at 3 d of age, the bursa of fabricius weight in the l. gasseri jcm1131(t) at 1 and 3 d of age, and bursa of fabricius weight in the l. gasseri tl2919 group at 1 d of age. there were no significant differences in body and liver weights among the treatments. when chicks were fed the l. jensenii tl2937-  or l. gasseri tl2919-supplemented diets, expression of t cell-related mrna [cluster of differentiation 3 (cd3), interleukin-2 (il-2), and interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma)] in the foregut was significantly higher than that of control chicks  at 3 or 7 d of age. expression levels of toll-like receptor (tlr) mrna tended to  increase in the foregut of chicks fed the immunobiotic diets, except for the l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus niaib6, compared with expression levels in control chicks. the bu-1 mrna expression levels in the bursa of fabricius were not affected by the supplementations with immunobiotic lactic acid bacteria. these results show that immunobiotics, particularly l. gasseri tl2919, might be useful  as immunomodulators to stimulate the gut-associated immune system in neonatal chicks, and thereby protect them from disease without decreasing growth performance as a possible substitution of antibiotics.

TI  == identification and genotyping of bacteria from paired vaginal and rectal samples  from pregnant women indicates similarity between vaginal and rectal microflora.
AB  == background: the vaginal microflora is important for maintaining vaginal health and preventing infections of the reproductive tract. the rectum has been suggested as the major source for the colonisation of the vaginal econiche. methods: to establish whether the rectum can serve as a possible bacterial reservoir for colonisation of the vaginal econiche, we cultured vaginal and rectal specimens from pregnant women at 35-37 weeks of gestation, identified the  isolates to the species level with trna intergenic length polymorphism analysis (tdna-pcr) and genotyped the isolates for those subjects from which the same species was isolated simultaneously vaginally and rectally, by rapd-analysis.one  vaginal and one rectal swab were collected from a total of each of 132 pregnant women at 35-37 weeks of gestation. swabs were cultured on columbia cna agar and mrs agar. for each subject 4 colonies were selected for each of both sites, i.e.  8 colonies in total. results: among the 844 isolates that could be identified by  tdna-pcr, a total of 63 bacterial species were present, 9 (14%) only vaginally, 26 (41%) only rectally, and 28 (44%) in both vagina and rectum. a total of 121 (91.6%) of 132 vaginal samples and 51 (38.6%) of 132 rectal samples were positive for lactobacilli. l. crispatus was the most frequently isolated lactobacillus species from the vagina (40% of the subjects were positive), followed by l. jensenii (32%), l. gasseri (30%) and l. iners (11%). l. gasseri was the most frequently isolated lactobacillus species from the rectum (15%), followed by l. jensenii (12%), l. crispatus (11%) and l. iners (2%).a total of 47 pregnant women carried the same species vaginally and rectally. this resulted in 50 vaginal/rectal pairs of the same species, for a total of eight different species. for 34 of the 50 species pairs (68%), isolates with the same genotype were present vaginally and rectally and a high level of genotypic diversity within species per subject was also established. conclusion: it can be concluded that there is a certain degree of correspondence between the vaginal and rectal microflora, not only with regard to species composition but also with regard to strain identity between vaginal and rectal isolates.these results support the hypothesis that the rectal microflora serves as a reservoir for colonisation of the vaginal econiche.

TI  == [prevalence and characterization of vaginal lactobacillus species in women at reproductive age without vulvovaginitis].
AB  == purpose: to identify species of lactobacillus isolated from the vaginal contents  of healthy and asymptomatic women, determining the most prevalent species and characterizing them phenotypically. methods: lactobacillus have been isolated in  selective milieu from samples of the vaginal contents of 135 women without complaints of vaginal secretion, and with negative laboratorial diagnosis of vaginal infection, followed up at an outpatient clinic. after being identified by multiplex pcr, the isolates have been submitted to rnar 16s gene sequencing, when necessary. they have also been evaluated concerning the production of lactic acid, h2o2, bacteriocins and the ability to adhere to epithelial cells. results:  eight-three lactobacillus strains were isolated and identified, l. crispatus (30.1%), l. jensenii (26.5%), l. gasseri (22.9%) e l. vaginalis (8.4%), being the prevalent species. only 20 of those isolates did not present h2o2 production, in  detectable amounts. from the 37 strains selected for the test of adhesion to the  epithelial cells, 12 presented 50 to 69% of adhesion, 10 presented 70% or more, and the remaining, little or no adhesion at all. none of the tested strains produced bacteriocins. conclusions: the lactobacillus species more prevalent in women without vulvovaginitis, isolated in selective culture milieu and identified by molecular methods were l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri. besides the fact of being more prevalent, these strains also presented better production of h2o2, and reached lower ph values in the culture milieu.

TI  == characterization of indigenous vaginal lactobacilli from healthy women as probiotic candidates.
AB  == the probiotic relevant characteristics of 45 strains of vaginal lactobacillus isolated from healthy women were analyzed. of these, 21 strains were classified as l. crispatus, 17 as l. jensenii, six as l. gasseri, and one as l. plantarum. the rate of acidification varied significantly between the strains as did their ability to form biofilms. none used glycogen as a fermentable carbohydrate. h2o2  generation was common, especially among l. jensenii isolates (88%). no bacteriocinogenic strains were detected. most strains harbored plasmids (from 1 to 7) of various sizes, those in excess of 50 kb being frequent. one of these plasmids was found to be promiscuous since it hybridized with extrachromosomal bands of 15 isolates. all strains were resistant to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, clindamycin, trimethoprim, and sulfametoxazole and susceptible to a series of beta-lactams, erythromycin, tetracycline, and benzalkonium chloride. almost half of the strains were highly resistant to nonoxinol 9, which is commonly used as a spermicide. based on these analyses, strains of all three common species are proposed as new probiotic candidates.

TI  == changes in the predominant human lactobacillus flora during in vitro fertilisation.
AB  == background: signature matching of nucleotide sequences in the v1 and v3 regions 16s rrna genes using pyrosequencing technology is a powerful tool for typing vaginal lactobacilli to the species level and has been used for investigating the vaginal microbial niche. methods: this study has characterized the normal cultivable vaginal lactobacillus flora at varying estradiol levels in plasma; the study comprised 17 patients undergoing ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization (ivf) treatment. the vaginal status of each participant was initially assessed as normal according to amsel and nugent criteria. results: l.  crispatus, l. gasseri and/or l. jensenii were present in 10 of the patients throughout the study period, and little variation among these three species was encountered in individual patients. the flora of three women was dominated by l.  delbrueckii, l. rhamnosus or l. vaginalis. one woman exhibited a dominance of l.  iners. the flora of the remaining three women were initially dominated by l. rhamnosus or l. reuteri, but as their estrogen levels rose, their flora composition altered, to become dominated by one of the three species most common  in a normal, healthy vagina. conclusion: signature matching of nucleotide sequences in the v1 and v3 regions of 16s rrna genes is a discriminative tool for the study of vaginal lactobacilli and can be used to track the lactobacillus flora under a variety of physiological conditions.

TI  == inhibition of neisseria gonorrhoeae epithelial cell interactions by vaginal lactobacillus species.
AB  == high levels of lactobacillus, the dominant genus of the healthy human vaginal microbiota, have been epidemiologically linked to a reduced risk of infection following exposure to the sexually transmitted pathogen neisseria gonorrhoeae. in this work, a cell culture model of gonococcal infection was adapted to examine the effects of lactobacilli on gonococcal interactions with endometrial epithelial cells in vitro. precolonization of epithelial cells with lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus gasseri atcc 33323, or l. gasseri atcc 9857 reduced gonococcal adherence by nearly 50%. lactobacilli also inhibited gonococcal invasion of epithelial cells by more than 60%, which was independent of the effect on adherence. furthermore, lactobacilli were able to displace adherent gonococci from epithelial cells, suggesting that these organisms have potential as a postexposure prophylactic. thus, vaginal lactobacilli have the ability to inhibit gonococci at two key steps of an infection, which might have a significant effect in determining whether the gonococcus will be able to successfully establish an infection following exposure in vivo.

TI  == [vaginal microbiota: composition, protective role, associated pathologies, and therapeutic perspectives].
AB  == vaginal microbiota, mainly comprised of lactobacillus crispatus, l. jensenii and  l. gasseri, protect the mucosa against the establishment of pathogenic microorganisms through three complementary mechanisms: a) specific adherence to the epithelium, which blocks colonization of pathogens, b) production of antimicrobial compounds, and c) co-aggregation with pathogens, which enhances their microbiocidal effect. despite these mechanisms, vaginal microbiota are sometimes displaced by undesirable microorganisms, which is associated with the development of bacterial vaginosis, vaginitis due to candida spp., trichomoniasis, and lower urinary tract infections. on rare occasions, lactobacilli cause disease, but exclusively in immunocompromised patients. the main conditions are bacteremia (about 50% of the cases) and endocarditis (30%). however, no genital pathology caused by lactobacilli has been reported. the mutualistic effect of lactobacilli suggests that instillation of these microorganisms might regenerate the vaginal ecosystem, thus eliminating the relapses associated with treatment of the infection.

TI  == quantitative determination by real-time pcr of four vaginal lactobacillus species, gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae indicates an inverse relationship between l. gasseri and l. iners.
AB  == background: most studies of the vaginal microflora have been based on culture or  on qualitative molecular techniques. here we applied existing real-time pcr formats for lactobacillus crispatus, l. gasseri and gardnerella vaginalis and developed new formats for atopobium vaginae, l. iners and l. jensenii to obtain a quantitative non culture-based determination of these species in 71 vaginal samples from 32 pregnant and 28 non-pregnant women aged between 18 and 45 years.  results: the 71 vaginal microflora samples of these women were categorized, using the ison and hay criteria, as refined by verhelst et al. (2005), as follows: grade ia: 8 samples, grade iab: 10, grade ib: 13, grade i-like: 10, grade ii: 11, grade iii: 12 and grade iv: 7.l. crispatus was found in all but 5 samples and was the most frequent lactobacillus species detected. a significantly lower concentration of l. crispatus was found in grades ii (p < 0.0001) and iii (p = 0.002) compared to grade i. l. jensenii was found in all grades but showed higher concentration in grade iab than in grade ia (p = 0.024). a. vaginae and g. vaginalis were present in high concentrations in grade iii, with log10 median concentrations (log10 mc), respectively of 9.0 and 9.2 cells/ml. twenty (38.5%) of the 52 g. vaginalis positive samples were also positive for a. vaginae. in grade ii we found almost no l. iners (log10 mc: 0/ml) but a high concentration of l. gasseri (log10 mc: 8.7/ml). by contrast, in grade iii we found a high concentration of l. iners (log10 mc: 8.3/ml) and a low concentration of l. gasseri (log10 mc: 0/ml). these results show a negative association between l. gasseri and l. iners (r = -0.397, p = 0.001) and between l. gasseri and a. vaginae (r = -0.408, p < 0.0001). conclusion: in our study we found a clear negative association between l. iners and l. gasseri and between a. vaginae and l. gasseri. our results do not provide support for the generally held proposition that grade ii is an intermediate stage between grades i and iii, because l. gasseri, abundant in grade ii is not predominant in grade iii, whereas l. iners,  abundant in grade iii is present only in low numbers in grade ii samples.

TI  == association between lactobacillus species and bacterial vaginosis-related bacteria, and bacterial vaginosis scores in pregnant japanese women.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv), the etiology of which is still uncertain, increases the risk of preterm birth. recent pcr-based studies suggested that bv is associated with complex vaginal bacterial communities, including many newly recognized bacterial species in non-pregnant women. methods: to examine whether these bacteria are also involved in bv in pregnant japanese women, vaginal fluid  samples were taken from 132 women, classified as normal (n = 98), intermediate (n = 21), or bv (n = 13) using the nugent gram stain criteria, and studied. dna extracted from these samples was analyzed for bacterial sequences of any lactobacillus, four lactobacillus species, and four bv-related bacteria by pcr with primers for 16s ribosomal dna including a universal lactobacillus primer, lactobacillus species-specific primers for l. crispatus, l. jensenii, l. gasseri, and l. iners, and bv-related bacterium-specific primers for bvab2, megasphaera, leptotrichia, and eggerthella-like bacterium. results: the prevalences of l. crispatus, l. jensenii, and l. gasseri were significantly higher, while those of  bvab2, megasphaera, leptotrichia, and eggerthella-like bacterium were significantly lower in the normal group than in the bv group. unlike other lactobacillus species, the prevalence of l. iners did not differ between the three groups and women with l. iners were significantly more likely to have bvab2, megasphaera, leptotrichia, and eggerthella-like bacterium. linear regression analysis revealed associations of bvab2 and megasphaera with nugent score, and multivariate regression analyses suggested a close relationship between eggerthella-like bacterium and bv. conclusion: the bv-related bacteria, including bvab2, megasphaera, leptotrichia, and eggerthella-like bacterium, are common in the vagina of pregnant japanese women with bv. the presence of l. iners may be correlated with vaginal colonization by these bv-related bacteria.

TI  == lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginal microbiota of healthy women inhibit prevotella bivia and gardnerella vaginalis in coculture and cell culture.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate how human vaginal isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus crispatus inhibit the vaginosis-associated pathogens gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia. results show that all the strains in coculture condition reduced the viability of g. vaginalis and p. bivia, but with differing  degrees of efficacy. the treatment of g. vaginalis- and p. bivia-infected cultured human cervix epithelial hela cells with l. gasseri strain ks120.1 culture or cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) results in the killing of the pathogens that are adhering to the cells. the mechanism of the killing activity is not attributable to low ph and the presence of lactic acid alone, but rather to the presence of hydrogen peroxide and proteolytic enzyme-resistant compound(s) present in the cfcss. in addition, coculture of g. vaginalis or p. bivia with l.  gasseri ks120.1 culture or ks120.1 bacteria results in inhibition of the adhesion of the pathogens onto hela cells.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of atopobium vaginae.
AB  == background: previous studies have indicated that a recently described anaerobic bacterium, atopobium vaginae is associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv). thus far the four isolates of this fastidious micro-organism were found to be highly resistant to metronidazole and susceptible for clindamycin, two antibiotics preferred for the treatment of bv. methods: nine strains of atopobium vaginae, four strains of gardnerella vaginalis, two strains of lactobacillus iners and one strain each of bifidobacterium breve, b. longum, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l.  jensenii were tested against 15 antimicrobial agents using the etest. results: all nine strains of a. vaginae were highly resistant to nalidixic acid and colistin while being inhibited by low concentrations of clindamycin (range: < 0.016 microg/ml), rifampicin (< 0.002 microg/ml), azithromycin (< 0.016-0.32 microg/ml), penicillin (0.008-0.25 microg/ml), ampicillin (< 0.016-0.94 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (0.023-0.25 microg/ml) and linezolid (0.016-0.125 microg/ml). we found a variable susceptibility for metronidazole, ranging from 2  to more than 256 microg/ml. the four g. vaginalis strains were also susceptible for clindamycin (< 0.016-0.047 microg/ml) and three strains were susceptible to less than 1 microg/ml of metronidazole. all lactobacilli were resistant to metronidazole (> 256 microg/ml) but susceptible to clindamycin (0.023-0.125 microg/ml). conclusion: clindamycin has higher activity against g. vaginalis and  a. vaginae than metronidazole, but not all a. vaginae isolates are metronidazole  resistant, as seemed to be a straightforward conclusion from previous studies on  a more limited number of strains.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from the vagina: identification, hydrogen peroxide production and nonoxynol-9 resistance.
AB  == background: lactic acid production is considered to be the major protection mechanism of lactobacilli against vaginal infections due to genital pathogens. some species of lactobacillus are also hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) producers. nonoxynol-9 (n-9) is a nonionic detergent and is the active component of many spermicidal preparations. it immobilizes sperm by disrupting the cell membrane and is believed to act similarly on a number of bacteria and viruses. it is known that n-9 inhibits lactobacilli in vitro at concentrations of 0.1% to 1%. purpose: the present study was conducted to identify the species of lactobacillus isolated from vaginal fluids of reproductive-age women and to characterize the h(2)o(2)-producing and n-9-resistant strains in an argentine population. results: we identified lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. gasseri, l. jensenii, l. casei subsp. casei, l. brevis and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii as the most frequent species. in this argentine, south american population, 62% of women had h(2)o(2)-producing vaginal lactobacilli. we found a high number of sensitive  strains. sixty-two h(2)o(2)-producer strains were detected, 50 (80.6%) strains were sensitive to n-9 and 12 (19.4%) strains were resistant to the inhibitory effect of n-9. discussion: the vaginal microecologic findings are comparable to those found in other populations and suggest that (1) vaginal microecologic conditions are likely to be similar among argentine women as in other countries,  and (2) n-9 may have deleterious effects as in other populations.

AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to use a novel method that was based on  the application of chaperonin-60 sequencing to describe the vaginal microflora of 16 healthy women. study design: asymptomatic women consented for vaginal swabs to be collected at the time of a clinical pelvic examination. total genomic dna was  isolated from the vaginal swabs. degenerate, universal polymerase chain reaction  primers were used to amplify an approximately 555 base pair region of the universal chaperonin-60 gene, which is found in all eubacteria and eukaryotes, from the total genomic dna and libraries of cloned polymerase chain reaction products were constructed. library clones were sequenced, and the resulting sequences were assigned to taxonomic groups on the basis of similarity to reference sequence data. presence of chlamydophila psittaci sequences in the samples was confirmed by species-specific polymerase chain reaction. results: sixteen of the 23 women who were enrolled had normal flora by nugent's score of <4 and had adequate polymerase chain reaction product for assessment. vaginal flora libraries were dominated by a variety of sequences with similarity to lactobacillus spp l. crispatus, l. iners, l. gasseri, l. jensenii, and l. buchneri. other sequences that were identified included representatives of gardnerella spp, sequences with similarity to porphyromonas spp and megasphaera spp and sequences identical to c psittaci. conclusion: culture-independent, chaperonin-60 sequence-based molecular methods can lead to the identification of  greater diversity within defined taxa compared with those that are identified by  standard culture-based methods and to the identification of novel organisms that  were not previously associated with vaginal flora.

AB  == lactobacilli colonizing the rectum may be a reservoir for vaginal lactobacilli. in a cross-sectional study of 531 females, vaginal and rectal colonization by lactobacilli were assessed by culture methods. a subset of isolates was identified to the species level by use of whole-chromosomal dna probes. lactobacillus crispatus (16%), l. jensenii (10%), and l. gasseri (10%) were the prevalent lactobacilli colonizing the rectums of 290 females. only 13 (9%) of 147 females colonized by l. crispatus or l. jensenii vaginally and/or rectally had bacterial vaginosis (bv), compared with 12 (44%) of 27 females colonized by other h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacilli (p < .001). cocolonization of the vagina and rectum by h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacilli was associated with the lowest prevalence of bv (5%), whereas females colonized only vaginally, only rectally, or at neither site had a successively increased risk of bv (p < .001). lactobacillus species in the rectum may contribute to the maintenance of vaginal  microflora.

TI  == identification and h(2)o(2) production of vaginal lactobacilli from pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth and relation with outcome.
AB  == lactobacilli, principally the strains that are hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) producing, may have a protective effect against vaginal colonization by pathogenic species such as those that cause bacterial vaginosis. previous reports have also suggested that h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacilli in the vagina may protect pregnant women against ascending infection of the chorioamniotic membranes and uterine cavity. we report the identification and h(2)o(2) production of lactobacilli isolated from vaginal swabs collected at 20 weeks' gestation from a population of pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth. we also report the correlation between identification and h(2)o(2) production in relation to the outcomes of chorioamnionitis and preterm birth. lactobacilli were identified by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. h(2)o(2) production by isolates was determined by a semiquantitative method. the most commonly isolated species were l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. vaginalis and l. jensenii. amounts of h(2)o(2)  produced by lactobacilli varied widely. the presence of lactobacilli producing high levels of h(2)o(2) in the vagina of this population of pregnant women was associated with a reduced risk of bacterial vaginosis at 20 weeks' gestation and  subsequent chorioamnionitis. l. jensenii and l. vaginalis produced the highest levels of h(2)o(2). we postulate that h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacilli are able to reduce the incidence of ascending infections of the uterus and the subsequent production of proinflammatory molecules which are important in the pathogenesis of chorioamnionitis and preterm birth.

AB  == lactobacillus crispatus is one of the predominant hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2))-producing species found in the vagina and is under development as a probiotic for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. in this study, we assessed whether dna fingerprinting by repetitive element sequence-based pcr (rep-pcr) can be used to distinguish the capsule strain of l. crispatus (ctv-05) from other endogenous strains as well as other species of vaginal lactobacilli. vaginal and  rectal lactobacilli were identified to the species level by using whole-chromosome probe dna hybridization. the dnas from l. crispatus, l. jensenii, l. gasseri, and an as-yet-unnamed h(2)o(2)-negative lactobacillus species designated 1086v were subjected to rep-pcr. the results of gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining of the dna fingerprints obtained were compared. l. crispatus ctv-05 had a unique dna fingerprint compared to all other lactobacilli. dna fingerprints for 27 production lots of l. crispatus sampled from 1994 through 2001 were identical to that of the original strain isolated in 1993, suggesting strain stability. in a pilot study of nine women, this dna fingerprinting method distinguished ctv-05 from other endogenous vaginal lactobacilli prior to and after vaginal capsule use. rep-pcr dna fingerprinting is useful for strain typing and for evaluating longitudinal loss or acquisition of vaginal lactobacilli used as probiotics.

TI  == identification of randomly selected colonies of lactobacilli from normal vaginal  fluid by pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna variable v1 and v3 regions.
AB  == the present study aimed to characterize lactobacilli in vaginal fluid from 23 adult healthy women by using high-throughput dna sequencing for identification of a large number of randomly selected colonies appearing on rogosa and blood agar.  the typing method was based on broad-range pcr of 16s rrna gene variable regions  v1 and v3, pyrosequencing, and classification of the fragments by alignment with  ncbi-catalogued sequences and type strain sequences. four major groups of sequences were found among the 402 isolates clearly corresponding to lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus iners and lactobacillus jensenii when compared to the sequences obtained for type strains.  our results indicate that pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene fragments as used here  is a fast and reliable method well suited for identification to the species level, even within the lactobacillus acidophilus complex.

TI  == vaginal lactobacillus flora of healthy swedish women.
AB  == species of the lactobacillus acidophilus complex are generally considered to constitute most of the vaginal lactobacillus flora, but the flora varies between  studies. however, this may be due to difficulties in identifying the closely related species within the l. acidophilus complex by using traditional methods and to variations in the vaginal status of the participants. two hundred two isolates from the vaginal fluids of 23 swedish women without bacterial vaginosis, as defined by the criteria of nugent et al. (r. p. nugent, m. a. krohn, and s. l. hillier, j. clin. microbiol. 29:297-301, 1991), were typed by randomly amplified  polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis and identified to the species level by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis, multiplex pcr, and 16s ribosomal dna sequencing. the vaginal flora of most participants was dominated by a single rapd type, but five of them harbored two rapd types representing two different species or strains. the most frequently occurring species were lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus jensenii. l. iners  has not previously been reported as one of the predominant lactobacillus species  in the vagina.

TI  == genetic diversity of vaginal lactobacilli from women in different countries based on 16s rrna gene sequences.
AB  == aims: lactobacilli are widely distributed in food and the environment, and some colonize the human body as commensal bacteria. the aim of this study was to determine the species of lactobacilli that colonize the vagina and compare them with those found in food and the environment. methods and results: thirty-five lactobacillus strains from women from seven countries were isolated, and sequences from 16s rrna genes were determined and compared with existing data in  genbank. a phylogenetic tree was achieved using the neighbour-joining method based on the analysis of 1465 nucleotides. the results showed that most vaginal isolates were l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri. some were l. vaginalis, l. fermentum, l. mucosae, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus. two isolates from a native american woman displayed distinct branches, indicating novel phylotypes. few vaginal isolates matched food or environmental lactobacillus species. conclusions: most women worldwide were colonized by three common lactobacillus species: l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri. significance and impact of the study: knowledge of vaginal lactobacillus species richness and distribution in women worldwide may lead to the design of better probiotic products as bacterial  replacement therapy.

TI  == lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  == samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. yeasts (20.1%), streptococcus spp. (8.7%), staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. the lactobacillus isolates were l. brevis (24.6%) l. fermentum (18.5%) l. casei (16.9%), l. delbrueckii (15.4%), l. plantarum (9.23%), l. acidophilus (7.69%), l. jensenii (4.62%), l. salivarius (1.54%) and l. gasseri (1.54%). the most common species was l. brevis (24.6%). the strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. all the lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, s. sonnei, klebsiella spp. and campylobacter sp. all the lactobacilli except l. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. the involvement of lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. the ability of lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.

TI  == comparative study of vaginal lactobacillus phages isolated from women in the united states and turkey: prevalence, morphology, host range, and dna homology.
AB  == lactobacilli play an important role in maintaining vaginal health. however, during bacterial vaginosis lactobacilli decrease for unknown reasons. our preliminary study showed that phages could infect vaginal lactobacilli. therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the distribution, virulence, and  types of vaginal lactobacillus phages isolated from women of two countries: the united states and turkey. a total of 209 vaginal lactobacilli were isolated from  reproductive-aged women in the united states (n = 107) and turkey (n = 102). by analysis of 16s rrna gene sequence and by comparison of protein profiles, most lactobacilli were identified as l. crispatus, l. gasseri, and l. jensenii. after  mitomycin c induction, 28% of american lactobacilli and 36% of turkish lactobacilli released phages. a total of 67 phages were isolated and further characterized by their host range, electron microscopy, and dna homology. all 67  phages were infective against lactobacilli from both collections. the host ranges of most phages were broad, including multiple lactobacillus species. even though  the phages were all temperate, they were able to cause lytic infection in various strains. the electron micrographs of these phages showed a hexagon-shaped head and a long tail with or without a contractile tail sheath. based on their morphology, these phages belonged to bradley's phage groups a and b, and could be further classified into four morphotypes. all four types were found among american phages, but only three were found among turkish isolates. dna hybridization with labeled probes of the four types of phages revealed that additional genetic types existed within each morphotype among these phages. the phage genomic sizes ranged between 34 and 55 kb. many of the lysogenic lactobacillus strains released phages spontaneously at a high frequency of 10(-3) to 10(-4) pfu/cell. in conclusion, lysogeny in vaginal lactobacilli is widely spread. some lysogenic lactobacilli spontaneously release phages with a broad host range, which can be lytic against other vaginal lactobacilli regardless of their geographic origin.

TI  == rapid identification of 11 human intestinal lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr assays using group- and species-specific primers derived from the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna.
AB  == rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex pcr was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex pcr assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna  gene of members of the genus lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). the established two-step multiplex pcr assays were applied  to the identification of 84 lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the pcr results were consistent with the results from the dna-dna hybridization assay. these results suggest that the multiplex pcr system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.

TI  == lactobacillus fornicalis sp. nov., isolated from the posterior fornix of the human vagina.
AB  == twelve strains isolated from the posterior fornix fluid of the human vagina were  identified as lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gallinarum and lactobacillus crispatus based on numerical analyses of total soluble cell protein profiles and randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr banding patterns. five strains grouped with the type strains of lactobacillus gasseri (dsm 20077t) and lactobacillus jensenii (dsm 20557t) at r > or = 0.83 in  one protein profile cluster, well separated from the other species included in this study. however, numerical analysis of the rapd-pcr banding patterns of representative strains selected from the l. gasseri-l. jensenii protein cluster clearly indicated that they belong to two different species. four strains (tv 1010, tg 1013, tv 1018t and tv 1045) grouped into another well separated protein  profile cluster at r > or = 0.87. strains selected from this cluster displayed very similar rapd-pcr banding patterns and clustered at r2 > or = 0.78, separate  from the other strains examined. sequencing of the 16s rrna of two representative strains, tv 1018t and tg 1013, of this group indicated that it represents a new member of rrna group i lactobacillus, which includes lactobacillus delbrueckii, the type of the genus, and close relatives lactobacillus acetotolerans, lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, lactobacillus iners, l. jensenii, l. crispatus, l. acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus hamsteri, l. johnsonii, l. gasseri and lactobacillus amylolyticus. the name lactobacillus fornicalis sp. nov. is proposed for strains tv 1010 (dsm 13172), tg 1013, tv 1018t and tv 1045, with strain tv 1018t (= dsm 13171t = atcc 700934t) as the type.

TI  == the identification of vaginal lactobacillus species and the demographic and microbiologic characteristics of women colonized by these species.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus has been reported to be the predominant vaginal species. vaginal lactobacilli isolated from 215 sexually active women were identified using whole-chromosomal dna probes to 20 american type culture collection lactobacillus strains. most women were colonized by l. crispatus (32%), followed by l. jensenii (23%), a previously undescribed species designated l. 1086v (15%), l. gasseri (5%), l. fermentum (0.3%), l. oris (0.3%), l. reuteri  (0.3%), l. ruminis (0.3%), and l. vaginalis (0.3%). h2o2 was produced by 95% of l. crispatus and 94% of l. jensenii isolates, compared with only 9% of l. 1086v.  colonization by l. crispatus or l. jensenii was positively associated with being  white (p<.001), age >/=20 years (p=.05), barrier contraceptive usage (p=.008), and lower frequency of bacterial vaginosis (p<.001) and gonorrhea (p=.03). l. crispatus and l. jensenii, not l. acidophilus, are the most common species of vaginal lactobacilli.

TI  == acid production by vaginal flora in vitro is consistent with the rate and extent  of vaginal acidification.
AB  == perinatally, and between menarche and menopause, increased levels of estrogen cause large amounts of glycogen to be deposited in the vaginal epithelium. during these times, the anaerobic metabolism of the glycogen, by the epithelial cells themselves and/or by vaginal flora, causes the vagina to become acidic (ph approximately 4). this study was designed to test whether the characteristics of  acid production by vaginal flora in vitro can account for vaginal acidity. eight  vaginal lactobacillus isolates from four species-l. gasseri, l. vaginalis, l. crispatus, and l. jensenii-acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic ph (3.2 to 4.8) that matches the range seen in the lactobacillus-dominated human vagina (ph 3.6 to 4.5 in most women) (b. andersch, l. forssman, k. lincoln, and p. torstensson, gynecol. obstet. investig. 21:19-25, 1986; l. cohen, br. j. vener. dis. 45:241-246, 1969; j. paavonen, scand. j. infect. dis. suppl. 40:31-35, 1983; c. tevi-benissan, l. belec, m. levy, v. schneider-fauveau, a. si mohamed, m.-c. hallouin, m. matta, and g. gresenguet, clin. diagn. lab. immunol. 4:367-374, 1997). during exponential growth, all of these lactobacillus species acidified their growth medium at rates on the order of 10(6) protons/bacterium/s. such rates, combined with an estimate of the total number of lactobacilli in the vagina, suggest that vaginal lactobacilli could reacidify the vagina at the rate  observed postcoitally following neutralization by the male ejaculate (w. h. masters and v. e. johnson, human sexual response, p. 93, 1966). during bacterial  vaginosis (bv), there is a loss of vaginal acidity, and the vaginal ph rises to >4.5. this correlates with a loss of lactobacilli and an overgrowth of diverse bacteria. three bv-associated bacteria, gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia,  and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic ph (4.7 to 6.0) consistent with the characteristic elevated vaginal ph associated with bv. together, these observations are consistent with vaginal flora, rather than epithelial cells, playing a primary role in creating the acidity of the vagina.

TI  == adherence of human vaginal lactobacilli to vaginal epithelial cells and interaction with uropathogens.
AB  == three strains of lactobacillus, identified as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus jensenii, were selected from among 70 isolates from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women for properties relevant  to mucosal colonization or antagonism. all three self-aggregated and adhered to epithelial vaginal cells, displacing well-known vaginal pathogens, such as g. vaginalis, and inhibiting the growth in vitro of escherichia coli and streptococcus agalactiae. the surface components involved in self-aggregation appeared to be proteins for l. gasseri and lipoproteins for l. acidophilus and l. jensenii, as judged by susceptibility to treatment with appropriate degrading enzymes. the factors responsible for adherence to epithelial vaginal cells seemed to be glycoproteins (l. acidophilus and l. gasseri) and carbohydrate (l. jensenii). the receptors of the vaginal cells were glycolipids, which presumably  were the targets of the competition observed between the lactobacilli and the pathogenic microbes.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of lactobacillus spp. associated with healthy and diseased mucosa of the human intestines.
AB  == two-hundred and fifty lactobacillus strains isolated from healthy and diseased mucosa of human intestines of 75 individuals and 49 reference strains were phenotypically classified using 49 unit characters. data were processed by the jaccard (sj) and simple matching (ssm) coefficients, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. seventeen major clusters were defined at the  76% sj-similarity level which approximately correspond to the ssm-level of 91%. seven clusters could be identified: lactobacillus plantarum (isolates recovered from 5% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus (17% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (5% of the patients), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (3% of the patients), lact. buchneri (4% of patients), lact. reuteri (4% of the patients) and lact. salivarius subsp. salivarius (9% of the patients). unassigned clusters 1 and 3 both contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains. cluster 1 included the type strains of lact. crispatus, lact. acidophilus, lact. jensenii and lact. gasseri, and cluster 3, the type strains of lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lact. agilis and lact. casei subsp. tolerans. clusters 1 and 3 were found in 15% and 25% of the patients, respectively. unassigned clusters 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. clusters 11, 12, 15 and 17 were made up of heterofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. phenotypical characteristics of the clusters are given. no obvious trends in species (cluster) composition between different intestinal locations could be noted. most clusters contained isolates from both diseased and healthy mucosa. exceptions were cluster 15 and cluster 17 which only included isolates from healthy mucosa, and cluster 11 which only included isolates from diseased mucosa. cluster 15 was isolated in 12% of the patients, and cluster 11 in 8%.

TI  == systematics of the lactobacillus population on rat intestinal mucosa with special reference to lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == the systematics of the lactobacillus population of the intestines of 88 different rats was studied; 80 rats had been fed on fermented oat-meal soup (molin et al. 1992). one-hundred-twenty-two lactobacillus strains from the intestinal mucosa were phenotypically classified together with twenty-eight reference strains of lactobacillus and leuconostoc, using 49 unit characters. data were examined using jaccard coefficient, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. two major and eleven minor clusters were defined at the 76% sj-similarity level: cluster 1 included thirty isolates which could not be identified further, but had resemblance to the type strains of l. jensenii, l. gasseri, l. crispatus, and to some extent to l. acidophilus. cluster 12 including fifty-four intestinal isolates was identified as l. reuteri; and so was cluster 13 (five isolates). isolates of the major clusters were found in all parts of the intestines. the genomic homogeneity of the l. reuteri isolates was scrutinized by endonuclease restriction analysis of the chromosomal dna, and the isolates could  be divided into six genomic strains.
