TI  == [management of nasal orbital cellulitis in children].
AB  == objective: to analyze the clinical characteristics, diagnostic and treatment principle of orbital cellulitis in children, and to improve the experience of antibiotic treatment in orbital cellulites. methods: twenty children were admitted to shenzhen children's hospital with the diagnosis of nasal orbital cellulitis between january 2009 and december 2013. the children were severe enough to warrant hospital admission. there were 13(65%) males and 7 (35%) females. the median age was 3.5 years (2 months to 7.2 years). the relationship between the serum c-reactive protein (crp), white blood cell count and the hospitalization days were analyzed. the children were divided into 2 groups: cefoperazone sodium and sulbactam sodium for injection group and other antibiotic treatment group, the difference was compared. statistical calculation was performed using spss 13.0 software. results: the serum crp [(29.8 +/- 22.0) mg/l] at the time of admission had a positive correlation with the time of hospitalization[ (6.3 +/- 4.1) d, r = 0.46, p < 0.05]. the time of crp decreased  to normal range after admission [(3.4 +/- 1.8) d] were apparently related to the  hospitalization time (r = 0.81, p < 0.01). the hospital days whose crp could be decreased to normal within 3 days [n = 12, (4.3 +/- 1.7) d] were significantly shorter than that in the others [n = 8, (9.1 +/- 5.0) d, t = 2.61, p < 0.05]. the hospitalization of 12 cases with cefoperazone sodium and sulbactam sodium for injection [(4.3 +/- 1.9) d] was shorter than that in other 8 cases with other drugs [(9.3 +/- 4.7) d, t = 2.83, p < 0.05]. bacterial pathogens were only identified in 4 children, including 3 cases of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 1 case of streptococcus anginosus. only 1 case in 20 cases with positive blood culture for staphylococcus aureus, consistented with the pus culture. conclusions: if early treatment at the first three days is valid, the course of nasal orbital cellulitis will be shorter and the orbital abscess can be prevented. cefoperazone sulbactam and sulbactam sodium for injection is effective in treating pediatric orbital cellulitis.

TI  == quantification of pseudomonas aeruginosa in multispecies biofilms using pma-qpcr.
AB  == multispecies biofilms are an important healthcare problem and may lead to persistent infections. these infections are difficult to treat, as cells in a biofilm are highly resistant to antimicrobial agents. while increasingly being recognized as important, the properties of multispecies biofilms remain poorly studied. in order to do so, the quantification of the individual species is needed. the current cultivation-based approaches can lead to an underestimation of the actual cell number and are time-consuming. in the present study we set up  a culture-independent approach based on propidium monoazide qpcr (pma-qpcr) to quantify pseudomonas aeruginosa in a multispecies biofilm. as a proof of concept, we explored the influence of the combined presence of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus and burkholderia cenocepacia on the antimicrobial susceptibility of p. aeruginosa using this pma-qpcr approach.

TI  == surrogate analysis of vancomycin to predict susceptible categorization of dalbavancin.
AB  == dalbavancin (dal) represents a recently approved addition for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssis). newly released antimicrobial agents are rarely found on commercial susceptibility testing devices, and surrogate testing may be an option for clinical microbiology laboratories. a total of 33,688 staphylococcus aureus, 2800 viridans group streptococci (vgs), and 5722 beta-hemolytic streptococci (bhs) were included in this cross-susceptibility (dal versus vancomycin [van]) analysis as well as 4576  coagulase-negative staphylococci and 6515 enterococci (nonindicated species groups). isolates were collected as part of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program for the united states (usa) and europe (2011-2013). susceptibility testing followed clsi (m07-a9 and m100-s24) methods. usa food and drug administration (dal) and clsi (van) breakpoint criteria were used for correlations between dal and van susceptibility results. a categorical agreement  (ca; susceptible) rate of 99.9% was observed between dal and van when testing s.  aureus. only 48 (0.14%) very major (false-susceptible) errors were noted against  van-susceptible isolates that displayed a dal-nonsusceptible (mic, 0.25 or 0.5mug/ml) phenotype. when susceptible mic correlations were analyzed against indicated bhs species (streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pyogenes), an overall ca rate of 97.7-100.0% was obtained. complete (100.0%) ca was documented  for s. pyogenes, as well as against all vgs isolates, including the indicated streptococcus anginosus group (758 strains). in conclusion, high susceptible ca rates between dal and van were observed when testing a contemporary collection of indicated clinical isolates found in absssi. van-susceptible isolates can be inferred to be inhibited by dal (97.7-100.0%) at the regulatory agency-approved susceptible interpretive breakpoint of </=0.12mug/ml.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2010  and march 2011].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2010 to march 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. such as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus avium was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. such as streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus spp. such as staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. such as e. faecalis  and e. faecium was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. such as s. aureus from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli and r aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of parvimonas micra, eggerthella lenta, streptococcus constellatus, gemella morbillorum, and collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed.

TI  == oral bacterial dna findings in pericardial fluid.
AB  == background: we recently reported that large amounts of oral bacterial dna can be  found in thrombus aspirates of myocardial infarction patients. some case reports  describe bacterial findings in pericardial fluid, mostly done with conventional culturing and a few with pcr; in purulent pericarditis, nevertheless, bacterial pcr has not been used as a diagnostic method before. objective: to find out whether bacterial dna can be measured in the pericardial fluid and if it correlates with pathologic-anatomic findings linked to cardiovascular diseases. methods: twenty-two pericardial aspirates were collected aseptically prior to forensic autopsy at tampere university hospital during 2009-2010. of the autopsies, 10 (45.5%) were free of coronary artery disease (cad), 7 (31.8%) had mild and 5 (22.7%) had severe cad. bacterial dna amounts were determined using real-time quantitative pcr with specific primers and probes for all bacterial strains associated with endodontic disease (streptococcus mitis group, streptococcus anginosus group, staphylococcus aureus/staphylococcus epidermidis,  prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra) and periodontal disease (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatus, and dialister pneumosintes). results: of 22 cases, 14 (63.6%) were positive for endodontic and 8 (36.4%) for periodontal-disease-associated bacteria. only one case was positive for bacterial culturing. there was a statistically significant association between the relative amount of bacterial dna in the pericardial fluid and the severity of cad (p=0.035). conclusions: oral bacterial dna was detectable in pericardial fluid and an association between the severity of cad and the total amount of bacterial  dna in pericardial fluid was found, suggesting that this kind of measurement might be useful for clinical purposes.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of preparation bioaron c.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of sirupus bioaron c, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of aloe arborescens, was tested against  different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. the experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus candida and on 18 reference strains (atcc). the antimicrobial activity  of bioaron c (mbc and mfc) was determined at undiluted concentration. bioaron c proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. at the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (mbc, mfc) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, parvimonas micra, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus anginosus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, already after 15 min. the mic of bioaron c against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. the great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. bioaron c  may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.

TI  == activity of oritavancin against gram-positive clinical isolates responsible for documented skin and soft-tissue infections in european and us hospitals (2010-13).
AB  == objectives: to assess oritavancin activity in vitro against clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens causing skin and soft-tissue infections (sstis) in european and us hospitals. methods: 13 262 consecutive and unique isolates deemed to be responsible for sstis were included. isolates originated from 36 and 27 institutions in europe (israel included) and the usa, respectively, between 2010  and 2013. results: oritavancin (98.8% susceptible) showed modal mic, mic50 and mic90 results of 0.03, 0.03 and 0.06 mg/l, respectively, for staphylococcus aureus. cons from the usa (mic50, 0.015 mg/l) demonstrated an mic50 value of oritavancin slightly lower than those from europe (mic50, 0.03 mg/l). overall, vancomycin-resistant (vana-phenotype) enterococcus faecalis had oritavancin mics  (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/l) that were 16-fold higher than those obtained for vancomycin-susceptible isolates (mic50/90, 0.015/0.03 mg/l; 99.2%-99.8% susceptible); nevertheless, oritavancin inhibited all vana e. faecalis at </=0.5  mg/l. equivalent oritavancin mics (mic50/90, 0.004/0.008 mg/l) were noted for all vanb and vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium, while higher mics (mic50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/l) were obtained for vana strains. oritavancin had low mics against the overall populations of streptococcus pyogenes (mic50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/l; 98.4%-98.6% susceptible), streptococcus agalactiae (mic50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 97.9%-98.0% susceptible) and the streptococcus anginosus group (mic50/90, 0.008/0.015 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible), with slightly higher mics for streptococcus dysgalactiae (mic50/90, 0.06/0.25 mg/l; >/=98.3% susceptible). conclusions: oritavancin had potent activity in vitro against this contemporary collection of european and us isolates causing sstis. these results describe oritavancin activity against gram-positive pathogens collected shortly prior to its regulatory approval in the usa.

TI  == chromosomal islands of streptococcus pyogenes and related streptococci: molecular switches for survival and virulence.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes is a significant pathogen of humans, annually causing over 700,000,000 infections and 500,000 deaths. virulence in s. pyogenes is closely linked to mobile genetic elements like phages and chromosomal islands (ci). s. pyogenes phage-like chromosomal islands (spyci) confer a complex mutator phenotype on their host. spyci integrate into the 5' end of dna mismatch repair (mmr) gene mutl, which also disrupts downstream operon genes lmrp, ruva, and tag. during early logarithmic growth, spyci excise from the bacterial chromosome and replicate as episomes, relieving the mutator phenotype. as growth slows and the cells enter stationary phase, spyci reintegrate into the chromosome, again silencing the mmr operon. this system creates a unique growth-dependent and reversible mutator phenotype. additional ci using the identical attachment site in mutl have been identified in related species, including streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus parauberis, and streptococcus canis. these ci have small genomes, which range from 13 to 20 kb, conserved integrase and dna replication genes, and no identifiable genes encoding capsid proteins. spyci may  employ a helper phage for packaging and dissemination in a fashion similar to the staphylococcus aureus pathogenicity islands (sapi). outside of the core replication and integration genes, spyci and related ci show considerable diversity with the presence of many indels that may contribute to the host cell phenotype or fitness. spyci are a subset of a larger family of streptococcal ci who potentially regulate the expression of other host genes. the biological and phylogenetic analysis of streptococcal chromosomal islands provides important clues as to how these chromosomal islands help s. pyogenes and other streptococcal species persist in human populations in spite of antibiotic therapy and immune challenges.

TI  == radiography-based score indicative for the pathogenicity of bacteria in odontogenic infections.
AB  == objective: to develop a new radiography-based score to assess the potential of bacteria to cause odontogenic infections derived from the occurrence of bacteria  at small or large radiographical lesions. materials and methods: the patients analyzed were a sub-population from a large randomized clinical trial comparing moxifloxacin and clindamycin in the treatment of inflammatory infiltrates and odontogenic abscesses. routine radiographs were used to analyze the area of the periapical radiolucent lesions. lesions were stratified by their radiographically measured area as large (>9 mm(2)) or small (</=9 mm(2)). a risk ratio was calculated for each species from the frequency of their occurrence in large vs in small lesions. results: fifty-one patients, 19 with abscesses and 32 with infiltrates, were evaluated. overall, the radiographical lesion areas ranged from 0.4-46.2 mm(2) (median = 9 mm(2)). an increased risk (risk ratio >1) to occur at  large abscess lesions was observed for prevotella (p.) oralis, p. buccae, p. oris, p. intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus (strep.) anginosus group. an increased risk to occur at large infiltrate lesions was found for strep. salivarius, strep. parasanguis, strep. anginosus group, capnocytophaga spp., neisseria (n.) sicca, neisseria spp., staphylococcus (staph.) aureus, p. intermedia, p. buccae, prevotella spp. and p. melaninogenica. conclusions: the radiography-based score suggests that certain prevotella spp., f. nucleatum and strep. anginosus groups play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of odontogenic abscesses, and that various streptococci, neisseria spp., capnocytophaga spp., staph. aureus and prevotella spp. are involved in the pathogenesis of odontogenic infiltrates.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == rapid detection of gram-positive organisms by use of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the bact/alert pediatric fan system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == periocular necrotizing fasciitis causing blindness.
AB  == importance: periocular necrotizing fasciitis is a rare but potentially devastating disease, accompanied by high rates of morbidity and mortality. observations: we report 5 cases of periocular necrotizing fasciitis resulting in  severe vision loss, 3 of which required exenteration to contain the disease and only 1 of which recovered vision. three cases were caused by group a streptococcus; 1, by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus; and 1, by streptococcus anginosus constellatus. conclusions and relevance: providers should maintain a high clinical suspicion for necrotizing fasciitis and distinguish it from more common forms of cellulitis. as seen in these 5 cases, periocular necrotizing fasciitis may cause severe visual loss more often than previously recognized. to our knowledge, this is also the first report of streptococcus anginosus constellatus causing necrotizing fasciitis.

TI  == high-level fluorescence labeling of gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. we constructed a novel vector based on the e. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pat28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. the plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the camp-factor gene (cfb) promoter of streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pbsu101. upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by facs-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. to assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. we successfully labeled streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the egfp reporter plasmid pbsu101. in all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level egfp expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.

TI  == congenital alterations of nemo glutamic acid 223 result in hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia and immunodeficiency with normal serum igg levels.
AB  == background: hypomorphic mutations in the nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab) essential modulator (nemo) gene result in a variable syndrome of somatic and immunologic abnormalities. clinically relevant genotype-phenotype associations are essential to understanding this complex disease. objective: to study 2 unrelated boys with novel nemo mutations altering codon 223 for similarity in phenotype in consideration of potential genotype-phenotype associations. methods: clinical and laboratory features, including cell counts, immunoglobulin quantity  and quality, natural killer cell cytotoxicity, and toll-like and tumor necrosis factor receptor signaling, were evaluated. because both mutations affected nemo codon 223 and were novel, consideration was given to new potential genotype-phenotype associations. results: both patients were diagnosed as having  hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia and had severe or recurrent infections. one had recurrent sinopulmonary infections and the other necrotizing soft tissue methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection and streptococcus anginosus subdural empyema with bacteremia. nemo gene sequence demonstrated a 3-nucleotide  deletion (c.667_669delgag) in one patient and a substitution (667g>a) in the other. these findings predict either the deletion of nemo glutamic acid 223 or it being replaced with lysine, respectively. both patients had normal serum igg levels but poor specific antibodies. natural killer cell cytotoxicity and toll-like and tumor necrosis factor receptor signaling were also impaired. serious bacterial infection did not occur in both patients after immunoglobulin replacement therapy. conclusions: two different novel mutations affecting nemo glutamic acid 223 resulted in clinically relevant similar phenotypes, providing further evidence to support genotype-phenotype correlations in this disease. they suggest nemo residue 223 is required for ectodermal development and immunity and  is apparently dispensable for quantitative igg production but may be required for specific antibody production.

TI  == the role of bacteria in oral cancer.
AB  == despite the widening interest in the possible association between bacteria and different stages of cancer development, our knowledge in its relation to oral cancers remains inadequate. the aim of this review article is to derive a better  understanding on the role of various micro-organisms in the etiogenesis of oral cancers through all the available data on the pubmed. different bacteria have been proposed to induce carcinogenesis either through induction of chronic inflammation or by interference, either directly or indirectly, with eukaryotic cell cycle and signaling pathways, or by metabolism of potentially carcinogenic substances like acetaldehyde causing mutagenesis. studies have shown diversity of isolated bacterial taxa between the oral cancer tissue specimens and the control, with exiguobacterium oxidotolerans, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus and veillonella parvula being specific for tumorogenic tissues. most isolates are saccharolytic and acid tolerant. streptococcus anginosus, commonly linked with esophageal and pharyngeal cancers, is not of significance in oral cancers. similarly, significant salivary specificity is noted for three bacteria, namely, capnocytophaga gingivalis, p. melaninogenica, and streptococcus mitis in  oral cancer patients, making these species salivary markers for the early detection of oral cancers and thus improving the survival rate significantly. also, such high degree of bacterial specificity in oral cancers has also provoked the designing of new treatment options for cancer prevention by way of vaccine delivery. however, for the success of these steps, a deeper exploration into this subject with a greater understanding is warranted.

TI  == neurosurgical management of extraaxial central nervous system infections in children.
AB  == object: extraaxial infections of the cns, including subdural empyema and epidural abscess, are rare but potentially life-threatening conditions. symptoms are usually progressive, and early diagnosis is therefore important. early intervention with appropriate treatment offers the best opportunity for eradicating the infection and promoting maximal neurological recovery. methods: the medical records of children with extraaxial cns infection over the last 24 years at the hospital for sick children were analyzed. only those patients with radiological and/or operative confirmation of the diagnosis of subdural empyema or epidural abscess were included in the study. demographic and clinical data were collected to determine the outcomes after such infections and factors that predict for such outcomes. results: the authors identified 70 children who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. sinusitis was the most common etiology and was  seen in 38 patients. all of these patients were older than 7 years of age at diagnosis. subdural empyemas were diagnosed in 13 patients following bacterial meningitis, and they were found primarily in infants within the 1st year of life. other etiological factors included otogenic infection (4 cases), postneurosurgical infection (7 cases), and hematogenous spread of infection (7 cases including 6 cases of spinal epidural abscess). streptococcus anginosus and  staphylococcus aureus were the most common pathogens identified. sixty-four patients (91.4%) underwent at least 1 neurosurgical procedure. seizures and cerebral edema from cortical vein thrombosis were the most common complications.  conclusions: due to variable etiology, identification of the responsible microorganism through neurosurgical drainage followed by long-term intravenous antibiotics remains the mainstay in treating extraaxial cns infections. optimal outcome is achieved with early diagnosis and therapy.

AB  == objectives: orbital infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus may be increasing. because staphylococcus aureus infections have important treatment implications, our objective was to review the microbiology and antibiotic management of children hospitalized with orbital cellulitis and abscesses. patients and methods: this study was a retrospective chart review of all patients admitted to a tertiary care children's hospital between 2004 and 2009 with orbital infections confirmed by a computed tomography scan. patients with preceding surgery or trauma, anatomic eye abnormalities, malignancy, immunodeficiency, or preseptal infections were excluded. results: there were 94 children with orbital infections. a true pathogen was recovered in 31% of patients. the most commonly identified bacteria was the streptococcus anginosus group (14 of 94 patients [15%]). staphylococcus aureus (1 patient with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) was identified in 9% of patients. combination antimicrobial agents were frequently used (62%), and vancomycin use increased from 14% to 57% during the study period. patients treated with a single antibiotic during hospitalization (n = 32), in contrast to combination therapy (n = 58), were more likely to be discharged on a single antibiotic (p < .001). twenty-five (27%) patients were discharged on combination antibiotics. thirteen (14%) patients were discharged on intravenous therapy. conclusions: the streptococcus anginosus group is an emerging pathogen in pediatric orbital infections. although methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was uncommon, patients frequently received vancomycin and combination antibiotics. a simplified antibiotic regimen may help limit the development of resistant organisms and facilitate transition to an oral agent.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == [gram-positive cocci isolated from urocultures of ambulatory and hospitalized patients with surgical risk].
AB  == objectives: we propose a comparative study of sensitivity to antibiotics of gram-positive germs isolated in urocultures from patients in ambulatory and two wards with surgical risk (urology and obstetrics-gynaecology), and also to establish the resistance phenotypes of these strains. material and method: 124 strains of gram-positive cocci were studied: 28 s. aureus strains, 24 strains of  coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cns), 23 streptococcus aglactiae strains, 1 streptococcus anginosus strain and 48 enterococcus spp. strains. the isolated strains came from 4398 urocultures (1889--ambulatory, 1871--urology, 629--obstetrics-gynaecology). testing of antibiotic sensitivity was performed through kirby-bauer disk-diffusion method, with automatic phenotyping (osiris evolution system). results: in ambulatory, the wild phenotype was predominant in  all isolated strains (33.33% s. aureus, 50% cns, 100% streptococcus aglactiae, 60% enterococcus spp.). in the urology ward, the following multiresistant strains were isolated: 9 mrsa strains (47.36%), 1 mrse strain (100%), 1 vre strain (4.34%). in the obstetrics-gynaecology ward, 7 strains showed multiple antibiotic resistance: 4 mrsa strains (66.66%), 2 mrse strains (50%), 1 vre strain (6.66%).  conclusions: multiresistant strains were isolated in hospital environment, which  can be explained by the improper use of antibiotics, the instrumental approach of the urinary tract, and the existence of risk factors in the patients admitted in  the above-mentioned wards. enforcement of efficient nosocomial infection control  measures is advisable, as well as a policy for rational antibiotic use.

TI  == [periodontitis and cardiovascular disease].
AB  == the prevalence of periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (cvd) is high. a mixed infectious biofilm etiology of periodontitis is known but not fully established in cvd. cofactors; smoking habits, stress, ethnicity, genetics, socioeconomics and age contribute to both diseases. the objectives of this report are to summarize factors in regards to cvd and periodontitis that are clinically relevant. the hypothesis behind a relationship between the two conditions can be  founded in (i) shared infections etiology, (ii) shared inflammatory response, (iii) epidemiological and case-control studies, and (iv) periodontal studies demonstrating improvements of cvd markers. streptococcus species in the s. mitis  group, and s. anginosus group have been identified in periodontitis and are known as pathogens in endocarditis possibly transported from the oral cavity to the heart through bacteremia during dental therapies, and tooth brushing. other periodontal bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra are beta-lactamase producing and may contribute to antibiotic resistance (extended spectrum beta-lactamases). other bacteria in cvd  and periodontitis include staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. chlamydia pneumoniae and p. gingivalis lipopolyysaccharide capsels share homology and induce heat-shock protein activity and a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines. associations between periodontitis and cvd have been presented in many studies when controlling for confounders. other studies have demonstrated that periodontal therapies increase brachial artery flow rate and reduce serum inflammatory cytokine levels. thus, physicians caring for subjects at cvd risk should consult with dentists/periodontists. dentists must improve their medical knowledge and also learn to consult with physicians when treating patients at cvd risk.

TI  == the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of abrus precatorius (l) fabaceae extract on  some clinical pathogens.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. method: in this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, three clinical s. aureus isolates from different sources, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus anginosus (s.milleri), bacillus subtilis, corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), escherichia coli atcc 25922, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. to measure the mic values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. result: at the  different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an mic of 8 ug/ml for  the leaf extract. extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of  the gram-positive bacteria and candida albicans but not against s anginosus, e. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. the ph of the extracts ranged between ph5 and ph8. this study demonstrates that abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. conclusion: the results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of abrus precatorius for the treatment of  various bacteria-related diseases. topical application of abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == prevalence of bacteraemia following third molar surgery.
AB  == objective: to investigate the prevalence and aetiology of bacteraemia following third molar extractions (b-tme), analysing the factors affecting its development. methods: the study group was formed of 100 patients undergoing third molar extractions under general anaesthesia. peripheral venous blood samples were collected at baseline, 30 s after a mandibular third molar extraction and 15 min  after completing the final extraction. samples were inoculated into bactec aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles and were processed in the bact/alert. subculture and further identification of the bacteria isolated was performed using conventional microbiological techniques. results: the prevalence of bacteraemia following third molar surgery was 62% at 30 s after the first dental  extraction and 67% at 15 min after finishing the final extraction. the bacteria most frequently identified in the positive blood cultures were streptococcus viridans (87.9%). conclusion: in our series, the prevalence of b-tme at 30 s after a single third molar extraction was high, principally being of streptococcal aetiology, and was independent of the oral health status and the magnitude of the surgical procedure. positive blood cultures persisted for at least 15 min after three to four dental extractions in a higher number of patients, questioning the supposedly transient nature of bacteraemia following dental extractions.

TI  == bacterial examination of endodontic infections by clonal analysis in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to examine the diversity of bacterial  species in the infected root canals of teeth associated with endodontic abscesses by cloning and sequencing techniques in concert with denaturing high-performance  liquid chromatography. methods: samples collected from five infected root canals  were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with universal 16s ribosomal dna primers. products of these pcrs were cloned and sequenced. denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) was used as a screening method to  reduce the number of clones necessary for dna sequencing. results: all samples were positive for the presence of bacteria and a range of 7-13 different bacteria were found per root canal sample. in total, 48 different oral clones were detected among the five root canal samples. olsenella profusa was the only species present in all samples. porphyromonas gingivalis, dialister pneumosintes, dialister invisus, lachnospiraceae oral clone, staphylococcus aureus, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, peptostreptococcus micros and enterococcus faecalis were found in two of the five samples. the majority of the taxa were present in only one sample, for example tannerella forsythia, shuttleworthia satelles and filifactor alocis. some facultative anaerobes that are frequently isolated from endodontic infections such as e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus  and lactobacillus spp. were also found in this study. conclusion: clonal analysis of the microflora associated with endodontic infections revealed a wide diversity of oral species.

TI  == subdural empyema.
AB  == subdural empyema represents loculated infection between the outermost layer of the meninges, the dura, and the arachnoid. the empyema may develop intracranially or in the spinal canal. intracranial subdural empyema is most frequently a complication of sinusitis or, less frequently, otitis or neurosurgical procedures. spinal subdural empyema is rare and may result from hematogenous infection or spread of infection from osteomyelitis. the most common organisms in intracranial subdural empyema are anaerobic and microaerophilic streptococci, in  particular those of the streptococcus milleri group (s. milleri and streptococcus anginosus). staphylococcus aureus is present in a minority of cases, and multiple additional organisms, including gram-negative organisms, such as escherichia coli, and anaerobic organisms, such as bacteroides, may be present. pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus epidermidis may be present in cases related to neurosurgical procedures, and salmonella species have been detected in patients with advanced aids; multiple organisms may be present simultaneously. spinal subdural empyemas are almost invariably caused by streptococci or by s. aureus. subdural empyema--whether it occurs in the skull or the spinal canal--may cause rapid compression of the brain or spinal cord, and represents an extreme medical  and neurosurgical emergency. the diagnostic procedure of choice for intracranial  and spinal subdural empyema is mri with gadolinium enhancement. computed tomography scan may miss intracranial subdural empyemas detectable by mri. conversely, occasion spinal subdural empyemas may be detected by ct myelography where mri is negative. treatment in virtually all cases of intracranial or spinal subdural empyema requires prompt surgical drainage and antibiotic therapy. pus from the empyema should always be sent for anaerobic, as well as aerobic, culture. because intracranial subdural empyemas may contain multiple organisms, provisional antibiotic therapy of intracranial subdural empyema, where the organism is unknown, should be directed against s. aureus, microaerophilic and anaerobic streptococci, and gram-negative organisms. antibiotics should include 1) nafcillin, oxacillin, or vancomycin; plus 2) a third generation cephalosporin; plus 3) metronidazole. provisional antibiotic therapy of spinal subdural empyemas should be directed against s. aureus and streptococci, and should include nafcillin, oxacillin, or vancomycin. morbidity and mortality in intracranial and  spinal subdural empyema relate directly to the delay in institution of therapy. both conditions should, thus, be treated with great urgency.

TI  == interaction between human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and streptococcus milleri  group bacteria.
AB  == because streptococcus milleri group (smg) bacteria--streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus anginosus--exhibit a striking propensity to cause abscesses, the interaction of these organisms with human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnl) was examined. after incubation in pooled normal human serum, smg stimulated less chemotaxis than did staphylococcus aureus, in contrast to viridans streptococci, which caused greater chemotaxis than did s. aureus. pmnl ingested greater numbers of smg and viridans streptococci than s. aureus but killed these organisms more slowly and less completely. relative resistance to killing by pmnl is expected in organisms that  cause abscesses, and inhibition of chemotaxis may contribute to pathogenicity, because delayed arrival of pmnl gives a head start to proliferating bacteria. this study helps explain the capacity of smg to cause abscesses. it is unclear, however, why viridans streptococci, bacteria that rarely produce abscesses, share some of these same properties.

TI  == [clinical significance of the streptococcus milleri group in peritonsillar abscesses].
AB  == few researchers have microbiologically studied peritonsillar abscesses in detail, and their results have been conflicting. although streptococcus pyogenes (group a beta-streptococcus) is commonly considered an important pathogen in this infection, recent studies have demonstrated the recovery of many other streptococci mainly consisting of alpha-streptococci. few studies have identified these streptococci at the species level, however. we studied details of bacteriology in 31 cases of peritonsillar abscess treated between 1991 and 2000.  the streptococcus milleri group was most frequently isolated (25.8%), followed by eikenella corrodens (9.7%), staphylococcus aureus (6.5%), and s. pyogenes (3.2%). the s. milleri group, consisting of 3 species of streptococcus constellatus, s. intermedius, and s. anginosus, forms part of the normal flora most commonly found in the mouth, throat, gastrointestinal tract, and genital tract. these species have become known as an important pathogen in abscess disease but little attention has been paid to their role in peritonsillar abscesses. to adequately culture the s. milleri group, incubation in air containing carbon dioxide or in an anaerobic condition is required, and then the differentiation of the 3 species requires the biochemical reactivity tests. since hemolytic patterns of the s. milleri group vary, we studied the population of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-hemolytic strains among 36 strains of this group. we found 32 (88.8%) to be alpha-hemolytic. although not all alpha-hemolytic strains belong to the s. milleri group, a considerable number of this group could be missed among alpha-streptococci isolated from the peritonsillar abscess. as antibiotics began  being used widely, normal flora such as the s. milleri group may have become an important pathogen in peritonsillar abscesses due to an imbalance between organisms and host defense.

TI  == infectious crystalline keratopathy in an immunosuppressed patient.
AB  == purpose: to report a case of infectious crystalline keratopathy (ick) in a patient with systemic malignancy on immunosuppressive chemotherapy. the patient wore frequent replacement contact lenses on an extended wear basis. methods: a 51-year-old female with carcinoma of the breast and systemic metastases was referred for a corneal ulcer. she received intravenous docetaxel, trastuzumab, and systemic dexamethasone. she wore frequent replacement acuvue lenses on an extended wear basis. her visual acuity was 20/200 in the right eye and 20/400 in  the left eye. the right eye examination revealed diffuse superficial punctate keratopathy. in the left eye, there was a 3.8 x 4.5 mm corneal infiltrate with projecting crystalline processes. corneal scrapings were performed for smears and cultures. treatment with topical fortified cefazolin and fortified tobramycin every hour around the clock was initiated. results: culture of the corneal scrapings grew streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus aureus. there was a good response to medical therapy. when last seen after 4 weeks of treatment, the  infiltrate measured about 1 mm and the visual acuity was 20/40 with pinhole. conclusions: systemic immunosuppression may be a predisposing factor for the development of ick. this case suggests that debilitated patients may be at risk for unusual infections and should be discouraged from overnight wear of contact lenses.

TI  == spondylodiscitis caused by viridans streptococci: three cases and a review of the literature.
AB  == three cases of spondylodiscitis caused by viridans streptococci were observed within the course of 1 month. although streptococci have been reported as the third most frequent cause of spondylodiscitis after staphylococci and gram-negative bacteria, alpha-haemolytic streptococci are rarely seen. the three  patients presented with symptoms of low back pain; they felt well and did not have a fever or chills. laboratory examinations revealed inflammation. further examinations such as scintigraphy, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging were done. bacteriological diagnosis was established by blood cultures in two cases and by needle biopsy of the disco-vertebral space in one. in one patient endocarditis was also documented. because the prevalence of endocarditis  was found to be higher in our cases of spondylodiscitis due to streptococcus viridans than for other bacteria, the exclusion of this diagnosis must be pursued aggressively. these observations lead us to question if the spectrum of bacteria  causing spondylodiscitis is undergoing a change. an aetiological agent could be isolated in 1168 patients (85.4%): in 48% a staphylococcus, in 28% a gram-negative bacterium and in only 10% a streptococcus. there were two cases of  viridans streptococci (0.2%). these two cases together with other single case reports [14-22] account for 15 cases of spondylodiscitis due to alpha-haemolytic  streptococci. differentiation of the organisms to the species level was accomplished in six cases: s. mitis (3), s. sanguis (2) and s. anginosus (1). although a multitude of organisms, bacterial as well as fungal, causing spondylodiscitis has been reported in recent years, almost all were single cases  [23-42]. the unusual observation of three cases of spondylodiscitis due to alpha-haemolytic streptococci within 1 month prompted us to review the clinical and laboratory findings and to compare these cases with those caused by staphylococcus aureus.

AB  == in a randomized crossover trial, six volunteers received 200- and 400-mg doses of loracarbef (ly 163892), a new oral cephalosporin. mean +/- standard error of the  mean concentrations in serum obtained after 1.5 and 3 h were 13.2 +/- 2.8 and 4.3 +/- 0.7 mg/liter, respectively, after the 400-mg dose and 6.9 +/- 1.0 and 1.7 +/- 0.2 mg/liter, respectively, after the 200-mg dose. bactericidal reciprocal titers measured against respiratory pathogens in serum suggested that loracarbef would be highly effective against streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes (median titers, 8 to 128 at 1.5 h and less than 2 to 32 at 3 h) and beta-lactamase-negative haemophilus influenzae (median titers, 4 at 1.5 h and 2 to 4 at 3 h). other species (branhamella catarrhalis, streptococcus anginosus, staphylococcus aureus) were associated with lower bactericidal titers. killing curves performed against 12 strains demonstrated that the bioactivity of loracarbef (measured by the reduction in the area under the control growth curve) was significantly correlated with the concentration/mic ratio, whereas the initial rate of killing was not, once the concentration was greater than the mic. our results suggest that administration of 400 mg of loracarbef every 8 h might be associated with more favorable pharmacodynamic parameters against target bacteria.

AB  == eleven cases of infectious arthritis occurring in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are reported. staphylococcus aureus was the causative organism in eight patients. streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus agalactiae in one patient each, and mycobacterium tuberculosis in two patients. the mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 16 days in patients with pyogenic arthritis. the diagnosis of joint infection caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis was especially  delayed (57 days). four patients died; they were found to have a longer time to diagnosis and two of them had multiple joint infection. although staphylococcus aureus is the microorganism most often affecting patients with rheumatoid arthritis, infection caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis must also be considered in such patients.

TI  == cefmenoxime: clinical evaluation.
AB  == cefmenoxime was evaluated in an open trial consisting of 41 patients. forty infections in 36 patients could be evaluated. thirteen patients had pyelonephritis due to escherichia coli (two bacteremic), pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae, or streptococcus faecalis; all improved and 12 of 13 were  clinically cured, but one relapse (s. faecalis) occurred at two weeks. six patients with cystitis due to e. coli, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, p. aeruginosa, or s. faecalis all improved, but relapse or reinfection, or both,  occurred in five due to p. aeruginosa, s. faecalis, c. fruendii, or e. coli. neurogenic bladder or other complications were present in five of 13 patients with pyelonephritis and five of six with cystitis. ten patients with pneumonia and one with tracheobronchitis due to hemophilus influenzae, s. pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, or neisseria meningitidis all improved and seven had resolution without relapse, but p. aeruginosa emerged in two patients, one of whom died. eight soft tissue infections due to staphylococcus aureus, peptococcus prevotti,  streptococcus species, or infections of mixed origin resolved in six. sterility of blood cultures was obtained in one patient with endocarditis due to s. anginosus, but other therapy was substituted. clinical resolution of the toxic shock syndrome and subsequent negative endocervical cultures for s. aureus occurred in one. granulocytopenia of unverified cause in four (with less than 1,500 mm3) and two (with less than 2,000 mm3) was reversible. headache during treatment occurred in six patients and a possible disulfiram-like effect in three. elevations of serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase and alkaline phosphatase occurred in five, coombs' positivity in two, and diarrhea in three. clinical efficacy of cefmenoxime was significant. possible side effects require further study.

TI  == [clinical evaluation of ceftizoxime in the pediatric infections (author's transl)].
AB  == ceftizoxime (fk 749, czx) was evaluated in 24 children with a suspicion of bacterial infection. of the 17 confirmed bacterial infections, 16 were shown to be effective (effective rate, 94.1%). the diagnosis included acute pharyngitis (2), pneumonia (6), staphylococcal empyema (1), cervical purulent lymphadenitis (2), acute enterocolitis (2), acute pyelonephritis (1), ssss (1) and suspected septicemia (2). the etiological pathogens recovered were streptococcus anginosus  (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (1), staphylococcus aureus (2), haemophilus influenzae (3), enteropathogenic escherichia coli (1) etc. a case of suspected pseudomonas aeruginosa septicemia was not effectively treated with czx. the serum half-life of czx was 1.36 hours after intravenous bolus infection. a cerebrospinal fluid level of czx was 6.2 mcg/ml 1 hour after intravenous bolus injection of 1 g (23.8 mg/kg) in a child with inflamed meninges. no severe adverse reaction was encountered with the czx therapy. the data suggest that czx  is an excellent candidate for the first choice parenteral antibiotic in the pediatric infections.
