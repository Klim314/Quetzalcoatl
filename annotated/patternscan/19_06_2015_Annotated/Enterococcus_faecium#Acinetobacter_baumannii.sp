TI  == bactericidal efficacy of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (apntp) against  the eskape pathogens.
AB  == the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens within the clinical environment is presenting a mounting problem in hospitals worldwide. the 'eskape' pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp.) have been  highlighted as a group of causative organisms in a majority of nosocomial infections, presenting a serious health risk due to widespread antimicrobial resistance. the stagnating pipeline of new antibiotics requires alternative approaches to the control and treatment of nosocomial infections. atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (apntp) is attracting growing interest as an alternative infection control approach within the clinical setting. this study presents a comprehensive bactericidal assessment of an in-house-designed apntp jet both against biofilms and planktonic bacteria of the eskape pathogens. standard plate counts and the xtt metabolic assay were used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of apntp, with both methods demonstrating comparable eradication times. apntp exhibited rapid antimicrobial activity against all of the eskape pathogens in the planktonic mode of growth and provided efficient and  complete eradication of eskape pathogens in the biofilm mode of growth within 360s, with the exception of a. baumannii where a >4log reduction in biofilm viability was observed. this demonstrates its effectiveness as a bactericidal treatment against these pathogens and further highlights its potential application in the clinical environment for the control of highly antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

TI  == repurposing non-antimicrobial drugs and clinical molecules to treat bacterial infections.
AB  == there is a pressing need to develop novel antimicrobials to circumvent the scourge of antimicrobial resistance. the objective of this study is to identify non-antibiotic drugs with potent antimicrobial activity, within an applicable clinical range. a library, containing 727 fda approved drugs and small molecules, was screened against eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobactercloacae). drugs that showed antimicrobial activity in an applicable clinical range were further tested in vitro and in vivo in an infected mouse model. the initial screening identified 24 non-antibiotic drugs and clinical molecules active against gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) isolates. two non-antibiotic drugs showed activity against gram-negative pathogens. among the active non-antibiotic drugs, only ebselen (eb) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (fdurd), showed bactericidal activity, in an applicable  clinical range, against multi-drug-resistant staphylococcus isolates including mrsa, vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa), and vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa).the minimum inhibitory concentration at which 90% of clinical isolates of s. aureus were inhibited (mic90) was found to be 0.25 and 0.0039mg/l  for eb and fdurd, respectively. treatment with eb orally significantly increased  mice survival in a lethal model of septicemic mrsa-infection by (60%) compared to that of control. fdurd oral and intraperitoneal treatment significantly enhanced  mouse survival by 60% and 100%, respectively. these data encourage screening and  repurposing of non-antibiotic drugs and clinical molecules to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.

TI  == the risk factors for mortality and septic shock in liver transplant recipients with eskape bacteremia.
AB  == background/aims: although bacteremias due to the six eskape pathogens have recently been identified as a serious emerging problems in solid organ transplant (sot), no information in liver transplant recipients is available. we sought to investigate the risk factors for mortality and septic shock in liver transplant recipients with eskape bacteremia. methodology: a retrospective analysis of bacteremia after liver transplantation was reviewed. risk factors for mortality and septic shock caused by eskape bacteremia were identified. results: forty-nine episodes ofbacteremia in 37 liver transplant recipients were due to eskape strains. the only factor for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with eskape was septic shock (odds ratio [or] = 67.500, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 8.464-538.300, p < .001). the factors for septic shock independently associated with eskape were white blood cells count > 15,000/mm3 (or = 15.205, 95% ci = 2.271-101.799, p = .005) and temperature of 39 degrees c or greater (or = 10.959, 95% ci = 1.592-75.450, p = .015). conclusions: to improve the results of liver transplantation, more effectively therapeutic treatments are of paramount importance when liver transplant recipients with eskape bacteremia present with septic shock, elevated white blood cells count and high body temperature.

TI  == repurposing salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs to combat drug resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that has become the leading cause of hospital acquired infections in the us. repurposing food and drug administration (fda) approved drugs for antimicrobial therapy involves lower risks and costs compared to de novo development of novel antimicrobial agents. in this study, we examined the antimicrobial properties of two commercially available anthelmintic drugs. the fda approved drug niclosamide and the veterinary drug oxyclozanide displayed strong in vivo and in vitro activity against methicillin resistant s. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic):  0.125 and 0.5 mug/ml respectively; minimum effective concentration: </= 0.78 mug/ml for both drugs). the two drugs were also effective against another gram-positive bacteria enterococcus faecium (mic 0.25 and 2 mug/ml respectively), but not against the gram-negative species klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter aerogenes. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of niclosamide and oxyclozanide were determined against methicillin, vancomycin, linezolid or daptomycin resistant s. aureus clinical isolates, with mics at 0.0625-0.5 and 0.125-2 mug/ml for niclosamide and oxyclozanide respectively. a time-kill study demonstrated that niclosamide is bacteriostatic, whereas oxyclozanide is bactericidal. interestingly, oxyclozanide permeabilized the bacterial membrane but neither of the anthelmintic drugs exhibited demonstrable toxicity to sheep erythrocytes. oxyclozanide was non-toxic to hepg2 human liver carcinoma cells within the range of its in vitro mics but niclosamide displayed toxicity even at low concentrations. these data show that the salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs niclosamide and oxyclozanide are suitable candidates for mechanism of action studies and further clinical evaluation for treatment of staphylococcal infections.

TI  == evaluation of regional antibiograms to monitor antimicrobial resistance in hampton roads, virginia.
AB  == we studied recent antibiograms (2010 to 2011) from 12 hospitals in the hampton roads area, virginia, that refer patients to a tertiary-care facility affiliated  with eastern virginia medical school. the data was compiled into a regional antibiogram, and sensitivity rates of common isolates from the tertiary-care facility (central) were compared to those of referring hospitals grouped by locale. staphylococcus aureus was the most common gram- positive and e. coli the  most common gram- negative organism grown from clinical samples in the area. overall 53% of s.aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. there was a broad scatter of mic (minimum inhibitory concentration) for vancomycin within the susceptibility range, and mic of 4 mug/ml was reported in 2012. penicillin resistance was seen in 50% and erythromycin resistance in 45% of streptococcus pneumoniae. vancomycin resistance was seen in 75% of enterococcus faecium and 2%  of enterococcus faecalis respectively. acinetobacter baumannii was the most resistant gram negative organism in the data compiled. among the escherichia coli, 26%, 44% and 52%were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ( sxt) ampicillin- sulbactam and ampicillin respectively. we found significant differences in methodology, interpretation and antibiotic panels used by area laboratories. based on these findings, we are now prospectively following resistance patterns in the tertiary-care facility, sharing data, and creating a consistent approach to antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the region.

TI  == spectral and biological evaluation of a synthetic antimicrobial peptide derived from 1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid.
AB  == ac-gf(a6c)g(a6c)k(a6c)g(a6c)f(a6c)g(a6c)gk(a6c)kkkk-amide (a6c=1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid) is a synthetic antimicrobial peptide (amp) that exhibits in vitro inhibitory activity against drug resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterococcus faecium at concentrations ranging from 10.9 to 43mum. spectroscopic investigations were conducted to determine how this  amp interacts with simple membrane model systems in order to provide insight into possible mechanisms of action. cd and 2d-(1)h nmr experiments indicated this amp  on binding to sds and dpc micelles adopts conformations with varying percentages  of helical and random coil conformers. cd investigations in the presence of three phospholipid suvs consisting of popc, 4:1 popc/popg, and 60% pope/21%popg/19%popc revealed: (1) the interactions occurring with popc suvs have minimal effect on the conformational diversity of the amp yielding conformations similar to those observed in buffer. (2) the interactions with 4:1 popc/popg, and 60% pope/21%popg/19%popc suvs exhibited a greater influence on the percentage of different conformers contributing to the cd spectra. (3) the presence of a high of percentage of helical conformers was not observed in the presence of suvs as was the case with micelles. this data indicates that the diversity of surface bound conformations adopted by this amp are very different from the diversity of  conformations adopted by this amp on insertion into the lipid bilayer. cd spectra of this amp in the presence of suvs consisting of lps isolated from p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and escherichia coli exhibited characteristics associated with various helical conformations.

TI  == evaluation of the efficacy of akacid plus(r) fogging in eradicating causative microorganism in nosocomial infections.
AB  == objective: the novel polymeric guanidine akacid plus(r) is a member of the cationic family of disinfectants. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the activity of akacid plus(r) against bacteria which cause nosocomial infections and remain viable after contaminating the environment and determine the effects of organic materials to the activity. methods: closed room and control room were  created for experimental disinfection. bacterial suspensions of 0.5 mcfarland were prepared from methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), acinetobacter baumannii and vancomycine-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) strains. a 0.1 ml of each suspension was applied on the chipboard (25 cm(2)) and  tile (25 cm(2)) test surfaces without albumin and with 2% albumin to simulate organic dirt, and the test surfaces were placed in the test and control rooms after drying. before testing, cotton swab premoistened with serum physiologic was used to obtain samples from various surfaces in the environment and the samples were transferred onto 5% sheep blood agar for incubation at 37 degrees c. akacid  plus(r) solution at a concentration of 0.5% was nebulized with an aerosol applicator (prowi-06, germany) for 45 minutes. after a 2-hour waiting period, 1 ml neutralizing broth (dey-engley neutralizing broth, fluka) was transferred on the test surfaces, and samples were collected with a swab from the test surfaces  and various surfaces in the testing room and inoculated on 5% sheep blood agar for incubation at 37oc for 24 hours. at the end of the incubation period, number  of colonies were evaluated on the control and test plates. results: although coagulase-negative staphylococci, bacillus spp., and fungi were grown in cultured samples obtained from the environment of experimental laboratory, no growth was observed in the test plates after room disinfection with akacid plus(r). after room disinfection, mrsa and a. baumannii were not detectable in the cultured media prepared from the test surfaces with or without albumin. the bacterial count for vancomyine-resistant e. faecium was reduced from 10(7) to 5x10(2) on surfaces without albumin and from 10(7) to 2.5x10(3) on surfaces with albumin. all test plates prepared from the surfaces in the control room showed abundant growth of the microorganism. conclusion: the nebulization of akacid plus(r) solution at a concentration of 0.5% proved to be an efficient means of disinfection for the removal of pathogenic microorganisms that cause hospital outbreaks and use of isolation measures.

TI  == application of whole-genome sequencing for bacterial strain typing in molecular epidemiology.
AB  == nosocomial infections pose a significant threat to patient health; however, the gold standard laboratory method for determining bacterial relatedness (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [pfge]) remains essentially unchanged 20 years  after its introduction. here, we explored bacterial whole-genome sequencing (wgs) as an alternative approach for molecular strain typing. we compared wgs to pfge for investigating presumptive outbreaks involving three important pathogens: vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (n=19), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (n=17), and acinetobacter baumannii (n=15). wgs was highly  reproducible (average</=0.39 differences between technical replicates), which enabled a functional, quantitative definition for determining clonality. strain relatedness data determined by pfge and wgs roughly correlated, but the resolution of wgs was superior (p=5.6x10(-8) to 0.016). several discordant results were noted between the methods. a total of 28.9% of isolates which were indistinguishable by pfge were nonclonal by wgs. for a. baumannii, a species known to undergo rapid horizontal gene transfer, 16.2% of isolate pairs considered nonidentical by pfge were clonal by wgs. sequencing whole bacterial genomes with single-nucleotide resolution demonstrates that pfge is prone to false-positive and false-negative results and suggests the need for a new gold standard approach for molecular epidemiological strain typing.

TI  == end group modification: efficient tool for improving activity of antimicrobial peptide analogues towards gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == increased incidence of infections with multidrug-resistant bacterial strains warrants an intensive search for novel potential antimicrobial agents. here, an antimicrobial peptide analogue with a cationic/hydrophobic alternating design displaying only moderate activity against gram-positive pathogens was optimized.  generally, introduction of hydrophobic moieties at the n-terminus resulted in analogues with remarkably increased activity against multidrug-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. interestingly, the potency against escherichia coli strains was unaffected, whereas modification with hydrophobic moieties led to increased activity towards the gram-negative acinetobacter baumannii. despite increased cytotoxicity against murine fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, the optimized peptide analogues exhibited significantly improved cell selectivity. overall, the most favorable hydrophobic activity-inducing moieties were found to be cyclohexylacetyl and pentafluorophenylacetyl groups, while the presence of a short peg-like chain had no significant effect on activity. introduction of cationic moieties conferred no effect or merely a moderate activity-promoting effect to the analogues.

TI  == which multidrug-resitant bacteria are emerging in patients with hematological malignancies?: one-year report.
AB  == the aim of this retrospective, observational study was to evaluate the outcomes of bacteremia attacks during neutropenic episodes caused by chemotherapy in patients with hematological cancers by assessing mortality, involved pathogens, antimicrobial therapy and treatment responses. patients who were older than 14 years of age and developed at least one neutropenic episode after chemotherapy to treat hematological cancer between november 2011 and november 2012 were included  in the study. we retrospectively collected demographic, treatment, and survival data for 68 patients with 129 neutropenic episodes. the mean age was 59.36 +/- 15.22 years (range 17-80 years), and 41 cases were male. the mean multinational association of supportive care in cancer score was 19.56 +/- 9.04. a total of 37  (28 %) bacteremia attacks were recorded in 20 cases (29 %). fatality rates were 50 % in the six cases with bacteremia caused by carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria; death occurred in two patients with carbapenem-resistant  acinetobacter baumannii and in one patient with carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas  aeruginosa. clinical and microbiological responses were achieved using pip-taz or cep-sul treatment in 80 % (16/20) of the cases with bacteremia caused by carbapenem-sensitive gram-negative bacteria (cs-gnb). during 547 colonization-days in 21 (30 %) vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre)-colonized cases among 68 patients, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium bacteremia developed in two patients. non-carbapenem-based therapy can cure most bacteremia  attacks caused by cs-gnb in patients with hematological cancer. however, bacteremia and other infections caused by drug-resistant pathogens, such as a. baumannii, p. aeruginosa, and vre, are a growing concern in hematological patients.

TI  == blood infections in patients treated at transplantation wards of a clinical hospital in warsaw.
AB  == establishment of the etiology in blood infection is always advisable. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the proportion of different bacterial species, including aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in blood cultures of patients hospitalized in transplantation wards of a large clinical hospital between 2010 and 2012. a total of 1994 blood samples from patients who were treated at one of  two transplantation wards of a large hospital in warsaw were analyzed using an automated blood culture system, bact/alert (biomerieux, france). the 306 bacterial strains were obtained from the examined samples. the highest proportion were bacteria from the family enterobacteriaceae (112 strains; 36.6%) with escherichia coli (61 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (30 strains), and enterobacter cloacae (10 strains) most commonly isolated. the non-fermenting bacilli constituted 21.6% (66 strains), with most common stenotrophomonas maltophilia (31 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 strains), achromobacter spp. (12 strains), and acinetobacter baumannii (3 strains). most frequent gram-positive bacteria were staphylococci (25.2%). of 77 staphylococcal strains,  56 were coagulase-negative staphylococci and 21 staphylococcus aureus. other gram-positive bacteria included enterococci (14 strains) and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 strain). obligatory anaerobic bacteria were represented by 19 strains (6.2% of total isolates). among all enterobacteriaceae, 49 isolates (43.7%) produced extended-spectrum ss-lactamases (esbls). resistance to methicillin was detected in 62% of s aureus isolates and in 46% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. of 14 enterococci cultured from blood samples,  2 strains (14.3%) were resistant to vancomycin. both were enterococcus faecium. resistant strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria are significant problems for patients in the transplantation ward.

TI  == [prevalence and features of pathogenic bacteria in the department of hematology without bone marrow transplantation in peking union medical college hospital from 2010 to 2012].
AB  == objective: to investigate the incidence, pathogens, and clinical features of infection in consecutive cases from 2010 to 2012 in peking union medical college  hospital. method: the incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. results: there were 449  positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. samples separated from patients with  community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. most community-aquired infections were caused by gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples.  respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were gram-negative (66.9%). the most common gram-negative bacteria included escherichia coli (13.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common gram-positive  bacteria. gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). the detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumonia/klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. the resistance to acinetobacter baumannii was serious. multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant a. baumannii acountted for 74% of all a. baumannii infections. stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. also, 22 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. all patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. fourteen  of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. there were 61  samples proved to be bacteria colonization. nonfermenters such as acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. conclusions: the pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly gram-negative bacteria. the incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished.

TI  == frequency and clinical outcomes of eskape bacteremia in solid organ transplantation and the risk factors for mortality.
AB  == background: although bacteremias caused by the 6 eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) have recently been highlighted  as a serious complication in solid organ transplant (sot), more information is urgently needed. we sought to investigate the frequency and clinical outcomes of  eskape bacteremia in sot and determine the risk factors for mortality. methods: a retrospective analysis of bacteremia after sot was reviewed. risk factors for mortality caused by eskape bacteremia were identified. results: eighty-four episodes of bacteremia were caused by eskape strains. of these strains, 41 were caused by resistant eskape (reskape) organisms. the only factor for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with eskape was septic shock (odds ratio [or] = 21.017, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 5.038-87.682, p < 0.001). the factors for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with reskape bacteremia were septic shock (or = 16.558, 95% ci = 6.620-104.668, p = 0.003) and age >/=40 years (or = 7.521, 95% ci = 1.196-47.292, p = 0.031). conclusions: to improve the outcomes of transplantation, more effective therapeutic treatments are of paramount importance when older sot recipients with bacteremia due to eskape/reskape organisms present with septic shock.

TI  == a broad-spectrum antibiofilm peptide enhances antibiotic action against bacterial biofilms.
AB  == biofilm-related infections account for at least 65% of all human infections, but  there are no available antimicrobials that specifically target biofilms. their elimination by available treatments is inefficient since biofilm cells are between 10- and 1,000-fold more resistant to conventional antibiotics than planktonic cells. here we describe the synergistic interactions, with different classes of antibiotics, of a recently characterized antibiofilm peptide, 1018, to potently prevent and eradicate bacterial biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant eskape (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) pathogens. combinations of peptide 1018 and the antibiotic ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, or tobramycin were synergistic in 50% of assessments and decreased by 2- to 64-fold the concentration of antibiotic required to treat biofilms formed by pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, and methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus. furthermore, in flow cell biofilm studies, combinations of low, subinhibitory levels of the peptide (0.8 mug/ml) and ciprofloxacin (40 ng/ml) decreased dispersal and triggered cell death in mature p. aeruginosa biofilms. in addition, short-term treatments with the peptide in combination with ciprofloxacin prevented biofilm formation and reduced p. aeruginosa pa14 preexisting biofilms. pcr studies indicated that the peptide suppressed the expression of various antibiotic targets in biofilm cells. thus, treatment with the peptide represents a novel strategy to potentiate antibiotic activity against biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant pathogens.

TI  == polyhexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride shows bactericidal advantages over chlorhexidine digluconate against eskape bacteria.
AB  == more information regarding the bactericidal properties of polyhexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride (phmg) against clinically important antibiotic-resistant  eskape (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) pathogens needs to be provided for its uses in infection control. the bactericidal properties of phmg and chlorhexidine digluconate (chg) were compared based on their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), minimum bactericidal concentrations, and time-course-killing curves against clinically important antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant eskape pathogens. results showed  that phmg exhibited significantly higher bactericidal activities against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, and ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter spp. than chg. a slight bactericidal advantage over chg was obtained against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, ciprofloxacin- and levofloxacin-resistant acinetobacter spp., and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa. in previous reports, phmg had higher antimicrobial activity against almost all tested gram-negative bacteria and several gram-positive bacteria than chg using mic test. these studies support the further development of covalently bound phmg in sterile-surface materials and the incorporation of phmg in novel disinfectant formulas.

TI  == development of an immunochromatographic test with anti-lipl32-coupled gold nanoparticles for leptospira detection.
AB  == detection of antibody specific to leptospira by various immunological techniques  has been used for leptospirosis diagnosis. however, the sensitivity of antibody detection during the first few days after infection is low. molecular techniques  are suggested to provide earlier diagnosis than antibody detection, but a rapid and easy to perform assay for leptospira antigen detection would provide an additional useful tool for disease diagnosis. in this study, we coupled gold nanoparticles with antibody to lipl32, a protein commonly found in pathogenic leptospira. this coupled gold reagent was used in the immunochromatographic strip for leptospira detection. we demonstrated that the sensitivity of leptospira detection by this strip was 10(3) ml(-1). there was no positive result detected when strips were tested with non-pathogenic leptospira, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus group b, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis or enterococcus faecium. these data suggest that gold nanoparticles coupled with antibody to lipl32 could  be used for leptospira detection by a rapid test based on an immunochromatographic technique.

TI  == eliciting antibiotics active against the eskape pathogens in a collection of actinomycetes isolated from mountain soils.
AB  == the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacterial pathogens poses a major threat for human health. in recent years, genome sequencing has unveiled many poorly expressed antibiotic clusters in actinomycetes. here, we report a well-defined ecological collection of >800 actinomycetes obtained from sites in the himalaya and qinling mountains, and we used these in a concept study to see how efficiently antibiotics can be elicited against mdr pathogens isolated recently from the clinic. using 40 different growth conditions, 96 actinomycetes  were identified - predominantly streptomyces - that produced antibiotics with efficacy against the mdr clinical isolates referred to as eskape pathogens: enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or enterobacter cloacae. antimicrobial activities that fluctuated strongly with growth conditions were correlated with specific compounds, including borrelidin, resistomycin, carbomethoxy-phenazine, and 6,7,8- and 5,6,8-trimethoxy-3-methylisocoumarin, of which the latter was not  described previously. our work provided insights into the potential of actinomycetes as producers of drugs with efficacy against clinical isolates that  have emerged recently and also underlined the importance of targeting a specific  pathogen.

TI  == could chloramphenicol be used against eskape pathogens? a review of in vitro data in the literature from the 21st century.
AB  == the widespread use of antibiotics has been associated with the emergence of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria. 'eskape' (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acintobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp.) pathogens play a major role in the rapidly changing scenario of antimicrobial resistance in the 21st century. chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic that was abandoned in developed countries due to its association with fatal aplastic anemia. however, it is still widely used in the developing world. in light of the emerging problem of multi-drug resistant pathogens, its role should be reassessed. our paper reviews  in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against eskape pathogens. susceptibility patterns for gram-positives were good, although less favorable for gram-negatives. however, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was found  to have synergistic activity. the risk-benefit related to chloramphenicol toxicity has not been analyzed. therefore, extra precautions should be taken when prescribing this agent.

TI  == validation of a novel murine wound model of acinetobacter baumannii infection.
AB  == patients recovering from traumatic injuries or surgery often require weeks to months of hospitalization, increasing the risk for wound and surgical site infections caused by eskape pathogens, which include a. baumannii (the eskape pathogens are enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species). as new therapies are being developed to counter a. baumannii infections, animal models are also needed to evaluate potential treatments. here, we present an excisional, murine wound model in which a diminutive inoculum of a clinically relevant, multidrug-resistant a. baumannii isolate can proliferate, form biofilms, and be effectively treated with antibiotics. the model requires a temporary, cyclophosphamide-induced neutropenia to establish an infection that can persist. a 6-mm-diameter, full-thickness wound was created in the skin overlying the thoracic spine, and after the wound bed was inoculated, it was covered with a dressing for 7 days. uninoculated control wounds healed within 13  days, whereas infected, placebo-treated wounds remained unclosed beyond 21 days.  treated and untreated wounds were assessed with multiple quantitative and qualitative techniques that included gross pathology, weight loss and recovery, wound closure, bacterial burden, 16s rrna community profiling, histopathology, peptide nucleic acid-fluorescence in situ hybridization, and scanning electron microscopy assessment of biofilms. the range of differences that we are able to identify with these measures in antibiotic- versus placebo-treated animals provides a clear window within which novel antimicrobial therapies can be assessed. the model can be used to evaluate antimicrobials for their ability to reduce specific pathogen loads in wounded tissues and clear biofilms. ultimately, the mouse model approach allows for highly powered studies and serves as an initial multifaceted in vivo assessment prior to testing in larger animals.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of novel nanostructured cu-sio2 coatings prepared by chemical vapour deposition against hospital related pathogens.
AB  == there is increasing recognition that the healthcare environment acts as an important reservoir for transmission of healthcare acquired infections (hcai). one method of reducing environmental contamination would be use of antimicrobial  materials. the antimicrobial activity of thin silica-copper films prepared by chemical vapour deposition was evaluated against standard strains of bacteria used for disinfectant testing and bacteria of current interest in hcai. the structure of the coatings was determined using scanning electron microscopy and their hardness and adhesion to the substrate determined. antimicrobial activity was tested using a method based on bs iso 22196:2007. the coatings had a pale green-brown colour and had a similar hardness to steel. sem showed nano-structured aggregates of cu within a silica matrix. a log10 reduction in viability of >5 could be obtained within 4 h for the disinfectant test strains and within 6 h for producing acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. activity against the other hospital isolates was slower but still gave log10 reduction factors of >5 for extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli and >3 for vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa within 24 h. the results demonstrate the importance of testing antimicrobial materials destined for healthcare use against isolates of current interest in hospitals as well as standard test strains. the coatings used here can also be applied to substrates such as metals and ceramics and have potential  applications where reduction of microbial environmental contamination is desirable.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria collected from countries in eastern europe: results from the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (t.e.s.t.) 2004-2010.
AB  == the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (t.e.s.t.) commenced in 2004 to longitudinally monitor global changes in bacterial susceptibility to a suite of antimicrobial agents. the current study examined the activity of tigecycline and  comparators against isolates collected across eastern europe between 2004 and 2010. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution methodologies. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using clsi interpretive criteria, and tigecycline susceptibility was established using european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) breakpoints. this study included 10 295 gram-negative and 4611 gram-positive isolates from 42 centres. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were reported among 15.3% of escherichia coli and 39.3% of klebsiella pneumoniae isolates; the highest rates were observed in turkey (30.9%) and bulgaria (53.8%), respectively. imipenem-non-susceptible k. pneumoniae were identified only in turkey. esbl-positive e. coli were highly susceptible to imipenem (95.1%), meropenem (98.0%) and tigecycline (98.5%). most antimicrobials showed poor activity against acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. vancomycin resistance was noted among 0.9% of enterococcus faecalis and 11.7% of enterococcus faecium isolates. high rates of susceptibility were reported for linezolid (99.7%) and tigecycline (100%) against e. faecium. one-quarter of staphylococcus aureus isolates were meticillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), with the highest rate in romania (51.5%); all mrsa were susceptible to linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin. antimicrobial resistance is high in much of eastern europe, with considerable variation seen among countries. tigecycline and the carbapenems retain excellent activity against many pathogens from eastern europe; linezolid and vancomycin are active against most gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == one-year surveillance of eskape pathogens in an intensive care unit of monterrey, mexico.
AB  == background: bacterial species from the eskape group (i.e. enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter species) are frequently resistant to antibiotics. the purpose of this study was to monitor the incidence of eskape pathogens at the intensive care unit (icu) of a tertiary care hospital in monterrey, mexico. methods: all clinically relevant organisms isolated from june  2011 to june 2012 were included. identification and susceptibility testing was performed using panels from sensititre. resistance to oxacillin, for s. aureus, and the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), for k. pneumonia, were determined as defined by the clinical laboratory standards institute. also, the presence of vana and vanb genes was determined in e. faecium vancomycin (van)-resistant isolates. results: the majority of pathogens (64.5%) isolated in the icu unit were from the eskape group. the organisms most frequently isolated were a. baumannii (15.8%) and p. aeruginosa (14.3%). a high resistance to carbapenems was detected for a. baumannii (75.3%) while 62% of s. aureus isolates were confirmed to be methicillin resistant. of the k. pneumoniae  isolates, 36.9% were esbl producers. we detected three e. faecium van-resistant isolates, all of which contained the vana gene. conclusion: the presence of the eskape group of pathogens is a major problem in the icu setting. the results of this study support the implementation of special antimicrobial strategies to specifically target these microorganisms.

TI  == recent trends in resistance to cell envelope-active antibacterial agents among key bacterial pathogens.
AB  == cell envelope-active agents, particularly beta-lactams, play a pivotal role in the treatment of bacterial infections and the extent to which their activity is affected by the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms is of concern. we analyzed the surveillance network (tsn) database to evaluate resistant trends for key cell envelope-active drugs among eskape pathogens. analysis demonstrated that the activity of these drugs has been notably influenced by the emergence of multidrug resistance; this was especially evident for the beta-lactam drugs. for  example, acinetobacter baumannii resistance to imipenem increased from 23.9% to 34.3%, and resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam increased from 37.0% to 49.7% between 2007 and 2011. during the same time period klebsiella pneumoniae resistance to imipenem increased from 0.8% to 3.8%. as beta-lactams are a cornerstone of anti-infective therapy, it is important to closely monitor the activity of the agents being used today and to aggressively pursue new strategies that can augment current drugs and thwart ever-emerging beta-lactam resistance mechanisms that are continuously encountered.

TI  == additional risk factors for infection by multidrug-resistant pathogens in healthcare-associated infection: a large cohort study.
AB  == background: there is a lack of consensus regarding the definition of risk factors for healthcare-associated infection (hcai). the purpose of this study was to identify additional risk factors for hcai, which are not included in the current  definition of hcai, associated with infection by multidrug-resistant (mdr) pathogens, in all hospitalized infected patients from the community. methods: this 1-year prospective cohort study included all patients with infection admitted to a large, tertiary care, university hospital. risk factors not included in the hcai definition, and independently associated with mdr pathogen infection, namely mdr gram-negative (mdr-gn) and eskape microorganisms (vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus  aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella species, carbapenem-hydrolyzing klebsiella pneumonia and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter species), were identified by logistic regression among patients admitted from the community (either with community-acquired or hcai). results: there were 1035 patients with  infection, 718 from the community. of these, 439 (61%) had microbiologic documentation; 123 were mdr (28%). among mdr: 104 (85%) had mdr-gn and 41 (33%) had an eskape infection. independent risk factors associated with mdr and mdr-gn  infection were: age (adjusted odds ratio (or) = 1.7 and 1.5, p = 0.001 and p = 0.009, respectively), and hospitalization in the previous year (between 4 and 12  months previously) (adjusted or = 2.0 and 1,7, p = 0.008 and p = 0.048, respectively). infection by pathogens from the eskape group was independently associated with previous antibiotic therapy (adjusted or = 7.2, p < 0.001) and a  karnofsky index <70 (adjusted or = 3.7, p = 0.003). patients with infection by mdr, mdr-gn and pathogens from the eskape group had significantly higher rates of inadequate antibiotic therapy than those without (46% vs 7%, 44% vs 10%, 61% vs 15%, respectively, p < 0.001). conclusions: this study suggests that the inclusion of additional risk factors in the current definition of hcai for mdr pathogen infection, namely age >60 years, karnofsky index <70, hospitalization in the previous year, and previous antibiotic therapy, may be clinically beneficial  for early diagnosis, which may decrease the rate of inadequate antibiotic therapy among these patients.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides containing unnatural amino acid exhibit potent bactericidal activity against eskape pathogens.
AB  == a series of 36 synthetic antimicrobial peptides containing unnatural amino acids  were screened to determine their effectiveness to treat enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pnemoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species (eskape) pathogens, which are known to commonly infect chronic wounds. the primary amino acid sequences of these peptides incorporate either three or six dipeptide units consisting of the unnatural amino acids tetrahydroisoquinolinecarboxylic acid (tic) and octahydroindolecarboxylic acid (oic). the tic-oic dipeptide units are separated by spacer amino acids with specific physicochemical properties that control how these peptides interact with bacterial cell membranes of different chemical compositions. these peptides exhibited minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) against these pathogens in the range from >100 to 6.25 mug/ml. the observed diversity of mic values for these peptides against the various bacterial strains  are consistent with our hypothesis that the complementarity of the physicochemical properties of the peptide and the lipid of the bacteria's cell membrane determines the resulting antibacterial activity of the peptide.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  == postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (lvfx) has been conducted continuously since 1992. the present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in japan to 30 selected antibacterial  agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (fqs). the common respiratory pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to fqs. in contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among s pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. regarding h. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to fqs, however, prevalence of lvfx-resistant escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of lvfx-resistant e. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence  of lvfx 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. another enterobacteriaceae member, klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to fqs, in contrast with e.  coli. in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the percentage of fq-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other fqs. however, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) isolates were highly susceptible to fqs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. the prevalence of fqs-resistant  isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of fq-resistance in mrsa. the prevalence of fqs-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (utis) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in p. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (rtis). while this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were  noted in the prevalence of fq-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates derived from utis. the prevalence of multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from utis and 0.3% among isolates from rtis, a decrease from the results  of 2007. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a  prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance  of 81.3-82.5%, to fqs. ceftriaxone (ctrx) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to ctrx in some clinical isolates. the result of the present survey indicated that although  methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, p. aeruginosa from utis, n. gonorrhoeae, and e. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the fqs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. while fq resistance has been prevailing in e. coli, e. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to fqs. the other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against fqs.

TI  == biocidal activity of metalloacid-coated surfaces against multidrug-resistant microorganisms.
AB  == background: the antimicrobial effects of a coating of molybdenum trioxide (moo3)  has been recently described. the metalloacid material produces oxonium ions (h3o+), which creates an acidic ph that is an effective, non specific antimicrobial. we determined the in vitro antimicrobial activity of molybdenum trioxide metalloacid-coated surfaces. methods: metalloacid-coated and non-coated  (control) surfaces were contaminated by exposing them for 15 minutes to microbial suspensions containing 105 cfu/ml. eleven microorganisms responsible for nosocomial infections were tested: two staphylococcus aureus strains (the hetero-vancomycin intermediate mrsa mu50 strain and a st80-pvl-producing mrsa strain); a vancomycin-resistant vana enterococcus faecium strain; three extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae strains; a mbl-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa strain; a multidrug-resistant acinetobacter  baumannii strain; a toxin-producing clostridium difficile strain; and two fungi (candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus). the assay tested the ability of the coated surfaces to kill microorganisms. results: against all non-sporulating microorganisms tested, metalloacid-coated surfaces exhibited significant antimicrobial activity relative to that of the control surfaces within two to six hours after contact with the microorganisms (p < 0.001). microorganism survival on the coated surfaces was greatly impaired, whereas microorganism survival on control surfaces remained substantial. conclusions: we suggest that, facing the continuing shedding of microorganisms in the vicinity of colonized or infected patients, the continuous biocidal effect of hydroxonium oxides against multidrug-resistant microorganisms may help limit environmental contamination between consecutive cleaning procedures.

TI  == adenylate kinase release as a high-throughput-screening-compatible reporter of bacterial lysis for identification of antibacterial agents.
AB  == adenylate kinase (ak) is a ubiquitous intracellular enzyme that is released into  the extracellular space upon cell lysis. we have shown that ak release serves as  a useful reporter of bactericidal agent activity and can be exploited for antimicrobial screening purposes. the ak assay exhibits improved sensitivity over that of growth-based assays and can detect agents that are active against bacteria in clinically relevant growth states that are difficult to screen using  conventional approaches, such as small colony variants (scv) and bacteria within  established biofilms. the usefulness of the ak assay was validated by screening a library of off-patent drugs for agents that exhibit antimicrobial properties toward a variety of bacterial species, including escherichia coli and all members of the "eskape" pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species). the assay detected antibiotics within the library that were expected to be active against the organism screened. moreover, 38 drugs with no previously reported antibacterial activity elicited ak release. four of these  were acquired, and all were verified to exhibit antimicrobial activity by standard susceptibility testing. two of these molecules were further characterized. the antihistamine, terfenadine, was active against s. aureus planktonic, scv population, and biofilm-associated cells. tamoxifen, an estrogen  receptor antagonist, was active toward e. faecium in vitro and also reduced e. faecium pathogenesis in a galleria mellonella infection model. our data demonstrate that the ak assay provides an attractive screening approach for identifying new antimicrobial agents. further, terfenadine and tamoxifen may represent novel antimicrobial drug development scaffolds.

TI  == national institute of allergy and infectious disease (niaid) funding for studies  of hospital-associated bacterial pathogens: are funds proportionate to burden of  disease?
AB  == background: hospital-associated infections (hais) are associated with a considerable burden of disease and direct costs greater than $17 billion. the pathogens that cause the majority of serious hais are enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium difficile, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species, referred as esckape. we aimed to determine the amount of funding the national institute of health (nih) national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) allocates to research on antimicrobial resistant pathogens, particularly  esckape pathogens. methods: the nih research portfolio online reporting tools (report) database was used to identify niaid antimicrobial resistance research grants funded in 2007-2009 using the terms "antibiotic resistance," "antimicrobial resistance," and "hospital-associated infection." results: funding for antimicrobial resistance grants has increased from 2007-2009. antimicrobial resistance funding for bacterial pathogens has seen a smaller increase than non-bacterial pathogens. the total funding for all eskcape pathogens was $ 22,005,943 in 2007, $ 30,810,153 in 2008 and $ 49,801,227 in 2009. s. aureus grants received $ 29,193,264 in fy2009, the highest funding amount of all the esckape pathogens. based on 2009 funding data, approximately $1,565 of research money was spent per s. aureus related death and $750 of was spent per c. difficile related death. conclusions: although the funding for esckape pathogens  has increased from 2007 to 2009, funding levels for antimicrobial resistant bacteria-related grants is still lower than funding for antimicrobial resistant non-bacterial pathogens. efforts may be needed to improve research funding for resistant-bacterial pathogens, particularly as their clinical burden increases.

TI  == rapid identification of eskape bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  == this article describes bacteria id chips ('bacchips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. bacchips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (pdms). each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. pressing the layer of pdms into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). after assembly, bacchips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. to use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased pdms draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. after the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air  is drawn into the bacchip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. a ph indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. importantly, bacchips operate  without external equipment or instruments. by visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that bacchips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the eskape panel of pathogens, including strains of: enterococcus faecalis, enteroccocus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. this article describes a bacchip for point-of-care detection of eskape pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.

TI  == costs of healthcare- and community-associated infections with antimicrobial-resistant versus antimicrobial-susceptible organisms.
AB  == objective: we compared differences in the hospital charges, length of hospital stay, and mortality between patients with healthcare- and community-associated bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia due to antimicrobial-resistant versus -susceptible bacterial strains. methods: a retrospective analysis of an electronic database compiled from laboratory, pharmacy, surgery, financial, and patient location and device utilization sources was undertaken on 5699 inpatients who developed healthcare- or community-associated infections between 2006 and 2008 from 4 hospitals (1 community, 1 pediatric, 2 tertiary/quaternary care) in manhattan. the main outcome measures were hospital charges, length of stay, and mortality among patients with antimicrobial-resistant and -susceptible infections caused by staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii. results: controlling for multiple confounders using linear regression and nearest neighbor matching based on propensity score estimates, resistant healthcare- and community-associated infections, when compared with susceptible strains of the same organism, were associated with significantly higher charges ($15,626; confidence interval [ci], $4339-$26,913 and $25,573; ci, $9331-$41,816, respectively) and longer hospital stays for community-associated infections (3.3; ci, 1.5-5.4). patients with resistant healthcare-associated infections also had a significantly higher death rate (0.04; ci, 0.01-0.08). conclusions: with careful  matching of patients infected with the same organism, antimicrobial resistance was associated with higher charges, length of stay, and death rates. the difference in estimates after accounting for censoring for death highlight divergent social and hospital incentives in reducing patient risk for antimicrobial resistant infections.

TI  == persistence of nosocomial pathogens on various fabrics.
AB  == objective: fabrics can become contaminated with high numbers of microorganisms that may be pathogenic to patients in a hospital setting and can play an important role in the chain of infection. the aim of this study was to investigate the survival of several clinical bacterial and fungal isolates on several fabrics commonly used in hospitals. materials and methods: bacterial and  fungal survival was tested on the following materials, each of which are commonly used in our hospital: 100% smooth cotton, 60% cotton-40% polyester, 100% wool and 100% silk. one isolate each of candida albicans, candida tropicalis, candida krusei, candida glabrata, candida parapsilosis, geotrichum candidum, aspergillus  fumigatus, cryptococcus neoformans, vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium (vre, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) positive escherichia coli, inducible beta-lactamase (ibl) positive pseudomonas aeruginosa, ibl-positive acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia were used to contaminate fabrics. the survival of these microorganisms was studied by testing the fabric swatches for microbial growth. results: the median survival times for all the tested bacteria and fungi  were as follows: 26 days on cotton, 26.5 days on cotton-polyester, 28 days on silk, and 30 days on wool. among the bacterial species tested, e. faecium had the longest survival time on cotton-polyester fabrics. for the fungal isolates, it was observed that c. tropicalis and c. krusei survived for the shortest amount of time on cotton fabrics in the present study. conclusion: this survival data indicate that pathogenic microorganisms can survive from days to months on commonly used hospital fabrics. these findings indicate that current recommendations for the proper disinfection or sterilization of fabrics used in hospitals should be followed to minimize cross-contamination and prevent nosocomial infections.

TI  == ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by eskape organisms: cause, clinical features, and management.
AB  == purpose of review: despite important geographical variations, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter species (eskape) pathogens constitute more than 80% of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) episodes. their clinical importance relies on their virulence and ability in developing mechanisms to decrease susceptibility to antimicrobials, increasing inappropriate therapy and affecting negatively on icu patients' outcome. this review updates information on vap due to eskape pathogens. recent findings: although methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus vap may be clinically similar to that caused by susceptible strains, it is associated with poorer outcomes despite adequate treatment. local  colonization determines treatment options. the contribution of tracheobronchitis  is an important issue. minimum inhibitory concentration should be considered for  nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria vap to prescribe extended infusion beta-lactam treatment due to an increase of resistant strains. strategies promoting antimicrobial diversity may protect against emergence and spread of resistance by eskape pathogens. summary: vap due to eskape pathogens represents a global challenge that can be prevented using stewardship programmes promoting diversity.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  == the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for  the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher,  at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed  a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to  silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance  of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.

TI  == identification of new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase gene (ndm-1) from a clinical isolate of acinetobacter junii in china.
AB  == new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1) is a novel type of metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) responsible for bacterial resistance to beta-lactam  antibiotics. acinetobacter junii was previously shown to possess a mbl phenotype; however, the genes responsible for this phenotype were not identified. in this study, we reported the identification of ndm-1 gene in a clinical isolate of a. junii from a child patient in china, which was resistant to all beta-lactams except aztreonam but sensitive to aminoglycosides and quinolones. the cloned ndm-1 gene contained an open reading frame of 813 bp and had a nucleotide sequence 99.9% identical (812/813) to reported ndm-1 genes carried by acinetobacter baumannii , enterococcus faecium , escherichia coli , and klebsiella pneumoniae . recombinant ndm-1 protein was successfully expressed in e. coli bl21, and antibiotic sensitivities of the ndm-1-producing e. coli were largely similar to the a. junii 1454 isolate. the findings of this study raise attention to the emergence and spread of ndm-1-carrying bacteria in china.

TI  == agreement assessment of tigecycline susceptibilities determined by the disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods among commonly encountered resistant bacterial isolates: results from the tigecycline in vitro surveillance in taiwan  (tist) study, 2008 to 2010.
AB  == the tigecycline in vitro surveillance in taiwan (tist) study, initiated in 2006,  is a nationwide surveillance program designed to longitudinally monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline against commonly encountered drug-resistant bacteria. this study compared the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 3,014  isolates of clinically important drug-resistant bacteria using the standard broth microdilution and disk diffusion methods. species studied included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; n = 759), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre; n = 191), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli (n = 602), esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 736), and acinetobacter baumannii (n = 726) that had been collected from patients treated between 2008 and 2010 at 20 hospitals in taiwan. mics and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted according to the currently recommended u.s. food and drug administration (fda) criteria and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria. the mic(90) values of tigecycline against mrsa, vre, esbl-producing e. coli, esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, and a. baumannii were 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 2, and 8 mug/ml, respectively. the total error rates between the two methods using the fda criteria were high: 38.4% for esbl-producing k. pneumoniae and 33.8% for a. baumannii. using the eucast criteria, the total error rate was also high (54.6%) for a. baumannii isolates. the total error rates between these two methods were <5% for mrsa, vre, and esbl-producing e. coli. for routine susceptibility testing of esbl-producing  k. pneumoniae and a. baumannii against tigecycline, the broth microdilution method should be used because of the poor correlation of results between these two methods.

TI  == controlled performance evaluation of the diversilab repetitive-sequence-based genotyping system for typing multidrug-resistant health care-associated bacterial pathogens.
AB  == fast, reliable, and versatile typing tools are essential to differentiate among related bacterial strains for epidemiological investigation and surveillance of health care-associated infection with multidrug-resistant (mdr) pathogens. the diversilab (dl) system is a semiautomated repetitive-sequence-based pcr system designed for rapid genotyping. the dl system performance was assessed by comparing its reproducibility, typeability, discriminatory power, and concordance with those of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and multilocus sequence typing (mlst) and by assessing its epidemiological concordance on well-characterized mdr bacterial strains (n = 165). these included vana enterococcus faecium, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii, and esbl- or metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. the dl system showed very good performance for e. faecium and k. pneumoniae and good performance for other species, except for a discrimination index of <95% for a. baumannii and e. coli (93.9% and 93.5%, respectively) and incomplete concordance with mlst for p. aeruginosa (78.6%) and e. coli (97.0%). occasional violations of mlst assignment by dl types were noted for e. coli. complete epidemiological concordance was observed for all pathogens, as all outbreak-associated strains clustered in identical dl types that were distinct from those of unrelated strains. in conclusion, the dl system showed good to excellent performance, making it a reliable typing tool for investigation of outbreaks caused by study pathogens, even though it was generally less discriminating than pfge analysis. for e. coli and p. aeruginosa, mlst cannot be  reliably inferred from dl type due to phylogenetic group violation or discordance.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
AB  == we studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. species studied included 3 common species of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. mics and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) criteria for urinary tract isolates of escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria for enterobacteriaceae. tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by clsi or eucast. escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. a. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in p. aeruginosa and s. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of mic breakpoint. new tentative zone diameter criteria for k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, s. aureus, and e. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by clsi and eucast.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing against a broad spectrum of clinically relevant wound isolates.
AB  == wound dressings impregnated with silver have a role to play in aiding to reduce both the dressing and wound microbial bioburden. it is therefore imperative that  antimicrobial wound dressings have efficacy on a broad range of clinical significant microorganisms. accordingly, this study aimed to determine the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing against 115 wound isolates that had been isolated routinely from patients at west virginia university hospital. standardised corrected zones of inhibition (czois) were performed on all clinical isolates. it was found that the silver alginate dressing was able to inhibit the growth of all microorganisms tested. in particular, the silver alginate dressing inhibited the growth of candida albicans and yeasts with czoi of 3-11.5 mm. all meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains were  found to be sensitive to the silver alginate dressing with a czoi range calculated at 3-7.8 mm. sensitivity to the silver alginate dressing was also evident for s. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. czois of 4.25 mm were calculated for enterococcus faecium and 9.8 mm for viridans streptococcus. the bacteria which demonstrated the highest tolerance to ionic silver included enterobacter cloacae and acinetobacter baumannii. contrary to this the most responsive microorganisms to ionic silver included strains of staphylococci, viridans streptococcus and candida albicans. no antibiotic-resistant isolates, as identified by kirby bauer clinical laboratory standards institute classification  system, were found to be resistant to ionic silver. when a selected number of microorganisms were grown in the biofilm phenotypic state enhanced tolerance to silver was observed, compared to their non biofilm counterparts. overall, this study has demonstrated the broad antimicrobial activity of a silver alginate dressing on wound isolates grown in the non biofilm and biofilm state. this finding is clinically relevant as both the non biofilm and biofilm phenotypic states of microorganisms are evident in wounds and therefore significant to delayed healing. consequently, it is imperative that antimicrobial wound dressings demonstrate antimicrobial activity against microorganisms in both phenotypic states.

TI  == progress and challenges in implementing the research on eskape pathogens.
AB  == the eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) are responsible for a substantial percentage of nosocomial infections in the modern hospital and represent the vast majority of isolates whose resistance  to antimicrobial agents presents serious therapeutic dilemmas for physicians. over the years, improved molecular biology techniques have led to detailed information about individual resistance mechanisms in all these pathogens. however, there remains a lack of compelling data on the interplay between resistance mechanisms and between the bacteria themselves. in addition, data on the impact of clinical interventions to decrease the prevalence of resistance are also lacking. the difficulty in identifying novel antimicrobial agents with reliable activity against these pathogens argues for an augmentation of research  in the basic and population science of resistance, as well as careful studies to  identify optimal strategies for infection control and antimicrobial use.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  == human beta-defensin 2 (hbd-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. we determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hbd-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to  eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. the native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hbd-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hbd-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. characteristically, a. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (mdr) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hbd-2 (vld(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-mdr (wild-type) a. baumannii  strains (vld(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). bactericidal activity of hbd-2 was less pronounced against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis  strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. these observations give  indications that the natural hbd-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting mdr phenotypes.

AB  == introduction: the objective of the present study was to analyse secular trends in antibiotic consumption and resistance data from a network of 53 intensive care units (icus). methods: the study involved prospective unit and laboratory-based surveillance in 53 german icus from 2001 through 2008. data were calculated on the basis of proportions of nonduplicate resistant isolates, resistance densities (that is, the number of resistant isolates of a species per 1,000 patient-days) and an antimicrobial usage density (ad) expressed as daily defined doses (ddd) and normalised per 1,000 patient-days. results: total mean antibiotic use remained stable over time and amounted to 1,172 ddd/1,000 patient-days (range 531 to 2,471). carbapenem use almost doubled to an ad of 151 in 2008. significant increases were also calculated for quinolone (ad of 163 in 2008) and third-generation and fourth-generation cephalosporin use (ad of 117 in 2008). aminoglycoside consumption decreased substantially (ad of 86 in 2001 and 24 in 2008). resistance proportions were as follows in 2001 and 2008, respectively: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) 26% and 20% (p = 0.006; trend  test showed a significant decrease), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) faecium 2.3% and 8.2% (p = 0.008), third-generation cephalosporin (3gc)-resistant escherichia. coli 1.2% and 19.7% (p < 0.001), 3gc-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae 3.8% and 25.5% (p < 0.001), imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii 1.1% and 4.5% (p = 0.002), and imipenem-resistant k. pneumoniae 0.4% and 1.1%. the resistance densities did not change for mrsa but increased significantly for vre  faecium and 3gc-resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae. in 2008, the resistance density for mrsa was 3.73, 0.48 for vre, 1.39 for 3gc-resistant e. coli and 0.82  for k. pneumoniae. conclusions: although total antibiotic use did not change over time in german icus, carbapenem use doubled. this is probably due to the rise in  3gc-resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae. increased carbapenem consumption was associated with carbapenem-resistant k. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing bacteria and imipenem-resistant a. baumannii.

TI  == clinical and microbiological spectrum of necrotizing fasciitis in surgical patients at a philippine university medical centre.
AB  == objective: the study describes the clinical characteristics, bacteriology and risk factors for mortality of patients with necrotizing fasciitis (nf), seen in a university medical centre. methods: the medical charts of nf patients admitted to the institution from january 2004 to july 2007 were retrieved and reviewed retrospectively. results: the majority of the 67 patients included in the study presented with localized nonspecific inflammatory manifestations: tenderness (94%), warmth (86%), oedema (76%), skin necrosis (75%), and ulceration (68%). diabetes mellitus (22%) was the most common predisposing medical condition. the most frequent isolates were escherichia coli (44%), acinetobacter baumannii (19%), staphylococcus aureus (15%) and enterococcus faecium (15%). overall mortality rate was 36%. risk factors significantly associated with mortality were truncal involvement (p = 0.034), leukocytosis (p = 0.038), acidosis (p = 0.001),  hypoalbuminaemia (p = 0.004), hypocalcaemia (p = 0.000) and hyponatraemia (p = 0.023). logistic regression analysis revealed acidosis [p < 0.05, odds ratio (or) = 9] and hypoalbuminaemia (p < 0.05, or = 14) as significant independent risk factors for mortality. conclusion: the identified risk factors can inform clinicians of increased mortality risks for certain patients with nf. they should serve as a trigger for more aggressive surgical and critical care, and antimicrobial therapy for these patients.

TI  == synergistic effects between conventional antibiotics and 2-aminoimidazole-derived antibiofilm agents.
AB  == 2-aminoimidazoles are an emerging class of small molecules that possess the ability to inhibit and disperse biofilms across bacterial order, class, and phylum. herein, we report the synergistic effect between a 2-aminoimidazole/triazole conjugate and antibiotics toward dispersing preestablished biofilms, culminating with a 3-orders-of-magnitude increase of biofilm dispersion toward staphylococcus aureus biofilms. furthermore, we document that the 2-aminoimidazole/triazole conjugate will also resensitize multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria to the effects of conventional antibiotics, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii.

TI  == [investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  == sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. the aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. a total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. the antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in mueller-hinton broth according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guideline. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for  10 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 enterobacter aerogenes strains. the mic values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 32 microg/ml for k. pneumoniae atcc 700603, 32 microg/ml for e. coli atcc 25922 and  > 128 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. sertralin has showed antibacterial  activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that mic values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == [recent trend and research issues related to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria].
AB  == the discovery of penicillin in 1928 was followed by the discovery and synthesis of various kinds of antimicrobial agents such as quinolone, aminogycoside, macrolide, tetracyclone, and oxazolidinone. these discoveries dramatically decreased the mortality rate due to infectious diseases. however, bacteria have also acquired antimicrobial-resistance genes or changed their own genes to oppose these antimicrobial agents, and now drug-resistant bacteria are becoming a serious clinical concern. today, contagious diseases must be treated with the limited number of effective antimicrobial agents available. infection control measures are required to prevent the spread of resistant bacteria in the clinical environment, and we must also increase our understanding of the drug-resistant mechanisms of bacteria. in this issue we wish to introduce the recent worldwide trend in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, especially multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, along with recently-discovered antimicrobial-resistant systems.

TI  == new antibiotics: optimal use in current clinical practice.
AB  == the optimal choice of antibacterial therapy among the few available options for infections caused by pathogens with advanced antimicrobial drug resistance is fundamental to maximize clinical effectiveness and minimize the likelihood for further resistance development. we herein review the available data on the effectiveness of antibiotics introduced in clinical practice during the past 10 years for specific clinical indications. quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline have increased the available therapeutic options against specific types of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infections. the newer fluoroquinolones, moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin, along with the ketolide telithromycin and the oral third-generation cephalosporin cefditoren are particularly valuable for the treatment of specific types of multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae infections. tigecycline appears as a promising therapeutic option for infections  caused by enterobacteriaceae producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), or multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. ertapenem and doripenem may be particularly useful against infections caused by esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively.

TI  == [update on antimicrobial chemotherapy].
AB  == there is a constant need for new antibacterial agents because of the unavoidable  development of bacterial resistance that follows the introduction of antibiotics  in clinical practice. as observed in many fields, innovation generally comes by series. for instance, a wide variety of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents became available between the 1970s and the 1990s, such as cephalosporins, penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones. over the last 2 decades, the arrival of new antibacterial drugs on the market has dramatically slowed, leaving a frequent gap between isolation of resistant pathogens and effective treatment options. in fact, many pharmaceutical companies focused on the development of narrow-spectrum antibiotics targeted at multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria (e.g. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, penicillin resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium). therefore, multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (e.g. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii) recently emerged and rapidly spread worldwide. even if some molecules were developed, new molecules for infections caused by these multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria remain remarkably scarce compared to those for gram-positive infections. this review summarises the major microbiological, pharmacological, and clinical properties of systemic antibiotics recently marketed in france (i.e. linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, ertapenem, and doripenem) as well as those of antibacterial drugs currently in development (i.e. ceftobiprole, ceftaroline, dalbavancin, telavancin, oritavancin, iclaprim, and ramoplanin) or available in other countries (i.e. garenoxacin, sitafloxacin, and temocillin).

TI  == in vitro effect of physiological concentrations of human albumin on the antibacterial activity of tigecycline.
AB  == objectives: to determine c(max) tigecycline activity in the presence/absence of physiological concentrations of human albumin with free fraction concentrations as controls. methods: killing curves (final inoculum: 1.0-5.0 x 10(7) cfu/ml) were performed with 0.88 mg/l final concentrations (serum c(max) after a 100 mg 1 h infusion) in mueller-hinton broth supplemented with ca(2+) and mg(2+) (mh) and  in mh with 4 g/dl human albumin. controls were curves in mh with concentrations similar to the free fraction (fc(max) = 0.17 mg/l) calculated using protein binding. activity was measured as log(10) initial inoculum reduction (log(10) initial inoculum-log(10) at 12 h/24 h). target strains (tigecycline mic/mbc; mg/l) were: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus heteroresistant to vancomycin (0.12/0.25); enterococcus faecium (0.12/0.25); escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (0.12/0.25); and acinetobacter baumannii (0.25/1). results: at 24 h the fc(max) produced mean decreases of < or  =0.1 cfu/ml for all strains, in contrast to the bactericidal activity (mean >3 log(10) reduction) provided by c(max) concentrations in the presence or absence of albumin for e. coli and e. faecium, and an activity nearly bactericidal for s. aureus (mean approximately 2.8 log(10) reduction). in the case of the a. baumannii isolate the c(max) in the presence or absence of albumin produced a mean reduction of 2.56 log(10) cfu/ml at 12 h (time of one dosing interval), with a bacteriostatic profile when considering 24 h colony counts (similar counts at 0 and 24 h). conclusions: correcting the total concentration for the reported literature binding values is unreliable since tigecycline antibacterial activity  was greater than that suggested by the free fraction of the drug.

TI  == is there an association between nosocomial infection rates and bacterial cross transmissions?
AB  == objective: surveillance data of nosocomial infection rates are increasingly used  for public reporting and interhospital comparisons. approximately 15% of nosocomial infections on intensive care units are the result of patient-to-patient transmissions of the causative organisms. these exogenous infections could be prevented by adherence to basic infection control measures. the association between bacterial cross transmissions and nosocomial infection rates was analyzed. design: prospective cohort study during 24 months. setting: eleven intensive care units from two university hospitals. patients: all inpatients. interventions: none. measurements and main results: primary isolates  of six indicator organisms (acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus) cultured from clinical samples or methicillin-resistant s. aureus surveillance testing of all inpatients were genotyped. indistinguishable isolates in > or =2 patients defined potential episodes of transmissions. surveillance of nosocomial  infection rates was performed according to the german nosocomial infection surveillance system, krankenhaus infektions surveillance system. transmission events and nosocomial infection rates were pooled by intensive care unit to calculate spearman's rank-correlation test. during 100,781 patient days, 100,829  microbiological specimens from 24,362 patients were sampled (average investigation density: 1.0 sample per patient and day) and 3419 primary indicator organisms were cultured. altogether, 462 transmissions (incidence density of 4.6  transmissions per 1000 patient days; range, 1.4-8.4 days) and 1216 nosocomial infections (incidence density of 12.1 per 1000 patient days; range, 6.2-16.6 days) were discerned. correlation analysis was unable to reveal any association between the incidence of cross transmissions and nosocomial infections, duration  of hospitalization, or device use. conclusions: differences in nosocomial infection rates between study intensive care units are not explained solely by cross transmissions. other factors, like the severity of the patient's underlying diseases, the patient's endogenous flora, or invasive procedures, likely have a dominant effect on the magnitude of nosocomial infection rates.

TI  == tigecycline in combination with other antimicrobials: a review of in vitro, animal and case report studies.
AB  == tigecycline has been investigated in combination with other antibacterials against a wide range of susceptible and multiresistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. combinations have been analysed in vitro, in animal models and in human case reports. in vitro, tigecycline combined with other antimicrobials produces primarily an indifferent response (neither synergy nor antagonism). nevertheless, synergy occurred when tigecycline was combined with rifampicin against 64-100% of enterococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter spp. and brucella melitensis isolates. combinations of tigecycline with amikacin also showed synergy for 40-100% of enterobacter spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp. and stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates. moreover, bactericidal synergisms occurred with tigecycline plus amikacin against problematic acinetobacter baumannii and proteus vulgaris, and with colistin against k. pneumoniae. data from animal experiments and case reports, although limited, displayed consistent beneficial activity of tigecycline in combination with other antibacterials against multiresistant organisms, including vancomycin  against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae in experimental meningitis, gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa in experimental pneumonia, daptomycin against enterococcus faecium endocarditis, and colistin against k. pneumoniae bacteraemia and p. aeruginosa osteomyelitis. antagonism was extremely rare in vitro and was not reported in vivo. thus, tigecycline may be combined with a second antimicrobial as part of a combination regimen.

TI  == surveillance of surgical site infections at a tertiary care hospital in greece: incidence, risk factors, microbiology, and impact.
AB  == background: in this first attempt to implement a standardized surveillance system of surgical site infections (ssi) in a greek hospital, our objective was to identify areas for improvement by comparing main epidemiologic and microbiologic  features of ssi with international data. methods: the national nosocomial infections surveillance (nnis) system protocols were employed to prospectively collect data for patients in 8 surgical wards who underwent surgery during a 9-month period. ssi rates were benchmarked with international data using standardized infection ratios. risk factors were evaluated by multivariate logistic regression. results: a total of 129 ssi was identified in 2420 operations (5.3%), of which 47.3% developed after discharge. ssi rates were higher for 2 of 20 operation categories compared with spanish and italian data and for 12 of 20 categories compared with nnis data. gram-positive microorganisms accounted for 52.1% of ssi isolates, and enterococci were predominant. alarming resistance patterns for enterococcus faecium and acinetobacter baumannii were recorded. potentially modifiable risk factors for ssi included multiple procedures, extended duration of operation, and antibiotic prophylaxis. ssi was associated with prolongation of postoperative stay but not with mortality. conclusion: comparisons of surveillance data in our hospital with international benchmarks provided useful information for infection control interventions to reduce the incidence of ssi.

TI  == differential correlation between rates of antimicrobial drug consumption and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in a tertiary care hospital in greece.
AB  == objective: to investigate whether there is a correlation between the rates of antimicrobial drug consumption in hospital departments and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among clinically important bacteria recovered in the hospital. design: retrospective study. setting: tertiary care hospital in greece. methods: data on antimicrobial consumption (from january 2001 through december 2004) were expressed as defined daily doses per 100 bed-days. the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and enterococcus faecium recovered during the same time period were calculated by the microbiology department. we then performed the following analyses: (1) a comparison of the consumption rates for different antimicrobial groups in individual hospital departments, (2) a comparison of the prevalence of resistance to different antimicrobials, and (3) a correlation analysis of antimicrobial consumption rates and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance. results: the rates of antimicrobial consumption and the prevalence of resistance varied substantially among the hospital's departments. the annual rate of consumption for carbapenems  correlated with the rate of consumption for glycopeptides and third-generation cephalosporins (p < .05). among p. aeruginosa isolates, the prevalence of imipenem resistance correlated with the prevalence of resistance to amikacin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime (p < .05). the rate of carbapenem consumption correlated with the prevalence of imipenem resistance among p. aeruginosa and a.  baumannii isolates (p < .05). the rate of aminoglycoside consumption correlated with the prevalence of amikacin resistance among p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. coli isolates (p < .05). however, the rate of consumption for fluoroquinolones and glycopeptides had no correlation with the prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance among gram-negative bacteria or vancomycin resistance among e. faecium isolates. conclusions: these data are suggestive of a differential relationship between antimicrobial consumption and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among various species and for various antimicrobial agents. these findings may help to optimize antimicrobial prescription policies in the hospital, especially in departments that have both high rates of antimicrobial consumption and a high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == a class iia peptide from enterococcus mundtii inhibits bacteria associated with otitis media.
AB  == peptide st4sa, produced by enterococcus mundtii st4sa, inhibits the growth of acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients diagnosed with middle ear infections. the peptide adsorbed at a level of 94% to s. pneumoniae 40, pseudomonas aeruginosa 25 and e. faecium hklhs. low concentrations of peptide st4sa (51200 arbitrary units (au)/ml) caused dna and enzyme leakage from target cells, whilst 1638400au/ml caused cell lysis.  no decrease in antimicrobial activity was observed when tested on solid medium with human blood as base. peptide st4sa revealed a similar level of activity compared with tetracycline (30 microg), but much higher activity compared with nasal sprays, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, lincosamides, macrolides, nitroimidazole, penicillin, quinolones, sulphonamides, chloramphenicol, furazolidone, fusidic acid, rifampicin, trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin when tested in vitro. peptide st4sa  dissipates the proton-motive force and may be used in the treatment of multidrug-resistant strains where antibiotics are excluded from cells by efflux pumps dependent on the membrane proton gradient.

TI  == [microorganisms isolated from blood cultures and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns at a university hospital during 1994-2003].
AB  == background: blood culture is important for the determination of the etiologic agent of bacteremia. analysis of blood culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility trend can provide clinicians with relevant information for the empirical treatment of patients. methods: the species and antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates from blood cultures at the severance hospital during 1994-2003 were analysed. blood specimens were cultured for 7 days using tryptic soy broth and thioglycollate medium. identification of organism was based on conventional methods or commercial kit systems. antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by a disk diffusion method. results: of 536,916 blood specimens cultured, 24,877 (4.6%) from 13,102 patients were positive. among the isolates, 93.1% were aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria, 3.3% anaerobes, and 3.6% fungi. escherichia coli was isolated most frequently, followed by staphylococcus  aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, enterococcus spp., and klebsiella pneumoniae. the proportion of patients with enterococcus faecium and k. pneumoniae gradually increased during this study. enterococcus, s. aureus and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus were frequently isolated from the age group of less than 2 yr. e. coli, enterococcus spp., k. pneumoniae and s. aureus from the age group of over 50 yr. oxacillin-resistant s. aureus decreased, whereas vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and imipenemresistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and  acinetobacter baumannii increased. conclusions: e. coli was the most common cause of bacteremia and s. aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, and k. pneumoniae were frequently isolated pathogens. the bacteremia due to enterococcus, k. pneumoniae, fungi, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii gradually increased during this period.

TI  == comparative analysis of the bactericidal activities of amphibian peptide analogues against multidrug-resistant nosocomial bacterial strains.
AB  == due to the widespread resistance of bacteria to the available drugs, the discovery of new classes of antibiotics is urgently needed, and naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides (amps) are considered promising candidates for future therapeutic use. amphibian skin is one of the richest sources of such amps. in the present study we compared the in vitro bactericidal activities of five amps from three different species of anurans against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates belonging to species often involved in nosocomial infections (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and acinetobacter baumannii). the peptides tested were temporins a, b, and g from rana temporaria; the fragment from positions 1 to 18 of esculentin 1b [esc(1-18)] from rana esculenta; and bombinin h2 from bombina variegata. when they were tested in buffer, all the peptides were bactericidal against all bacterial species tested (three strains of each species) at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 48 microm, with only a few exceptions. the temporins were found to be more active against gram-positive bacteria, especially when they were assayed in human serum; esc(1-18) showed fast and strong bactericidal activity, within 2 to 20 min, especially against the gram-negative species, which were killed by esc(1-18) at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 1 microm; bombinin h2 displayed similar bactericidal activity toward all isolates.  interestingly, while the activities of the temporins and bombinin h2 were almost  completely inhibited in the presence of 20% human serum, the activity of esc(1-18) against the gram-negative species was partially preserved in the presence of 40% serum. this property renders this peptide an attractive molecule  for use in the development of new compounds for the treatment of infectious diseases.

TI  == preoperative sterilization and disinfection of drill guide templates.
AB  == the aim of the in vitro study was to evaluate the decontamination potential of common antiseptic solutions for heat-sensitive implantological drill guide templates. one hundred implantologists were evaluated on the basis of a questionnaire for their measures of disinfection. on the basis of these results,  80% alcohol, octenidine 0.1%, and chlorhexidine 0.12% were tested in an in vitro  model for their decontamination efficacy for heat-sensitive plastic material infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and candida albicans. the microorganisms were selected on the basis of results of environmental testing of dental laboratories. the results of  the questionnaire revealed that chlorhexidine was used by 30%, 80% alcohol by 23%, and octenidine by 7% of the dentists. using the in vitro model, with the exception of s. aureus, chlorhexidine was not able to completely eliminate the microorganisms after 15 min of application. in contrast, the treatment with octenidine revealed no further growth of the tested microorganisms after that time. the 80% alcohol was more efficient. no growth of microorganisms could be detected in any of the tests after 5 min of incubation. on the basis of our results and due to the fact that suitable installations for sterilization were hardly used by the dental practitioners, the disinfection of templates should be  preferentially performed with 80% alcohol or octenidine using an incubation time  of 15 min with ultrasonication.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == predominance of gram-negative bacilli and increasing antimicrobial resistance in  nosocomial bloodstream infections at a university hospital in southern taiwan, 1996-2003.
AB  == background and purpose: while nosocomial infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality, the availability of timely and accurate epidemiological information on nosocomial pathogens is essential to the appropriate selection of  empirical therapy. this study analyzed nosocomial bloodstream infections (nbsis)  surveillance data to determine trends in the distribution of pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibilities of these pathogens. methods: during the period from 1996 to 2003 at national cheng kung university hospital, patients with nbsis were enrolled in the study, and the ranking of pathogens and status of antimicrobial resistance were determined. results: from 1996 to 2003, there were  4,038 episodes of nbsis. the overall incidence was 1.79 episodes per 1,000 inpatient-days. aerobic gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci, fungi, and anaerobes were responsible for 51%, 37%, 10%, and 1.6% of nbsis, respectively. the 5 leading pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (16% of nbsis), staphylococcus aureus (13%), candida spp. (10%), acinetobacter baumannii (8%), and escherichia coli (8%). oxacillin resistance was found in 90% of coagulase-negative staphylococci and 75% of s. aureus isolates. in contrast to enterococcus faecalis, in which only 1% of isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 78% of enterococcus faecium isolates were resistant to ampicillin. the emerging antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative pathogens included multidrug-resistant a. baumannii, cephalosporin- or fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae and e. coli. despite the annual increase in the use of fluconazole, candida albicans (54%) remained the most common causative pathogen of nosocomial candidemia. conclusions: in summary, gram-negative bacilli predominated among pathogens causing nbsis and an upsurge in the threat of antimicrobial resistance in our hospital occurred during the 8-year period. surveillance of the characteristics of nbsis and antimicrobial resistance patterns, together with appropriate antibiotic and infection control measures, should be reinforced.

TI  == bacteriophage therapy: a revitalized therapy against bacterial infectious diseases.
AB  == bacteriophage (phage) therapy involves using phages or their products as bioagents for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infectious diseases. much evidence in support of the effectiveness of phage therapy against bacterial infectious diseases has accumulated since 1980 from animal model studies conducted in western countries. reports indicate that appropriate administration  of living phages can be used to treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, vibrio vulnificus, and salmonella spp., and gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus. the phage display system and genetically modified nonreplicating phages are also effective for treatment of helicobacter pylori and p. aeruginosa, respectively. in addition to phage particles per se, purified phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase (lysin) is also reported to be effective for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria such  as streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, bacillus anthracis, and group b streptococci. all phage lysins that have been studied to date exhibit immediate and strong bacteriolytic activity when applied exogenously. furthermore, phage-coded inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis (protein antibiotics), search methods for novel antibacterial agents using phage genome informatics, and vaccines utilizing phages or their products are being developed. phage therapy will compensate for unavoidable complications of chemotherapy such as the appearance of multidrug resistance or substituted microbism.

TI  == in vitro activities of tigecycline against clinical isolates from shanghai, china.
AB  == to evaluate the in vitro activity of tigecycline, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of tigecycline against 1,201 strains of recent clinical isolates from 10 hospitals in shanghai, china were determined and compared with selected comparators. results showed that tigecycline had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. it was highly active against gram-positive cocci, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp., penicillin-intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. tigecycline also  had good activity against most strains of enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and moraxella catarrhalis. however, it was poorly active against acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. tigecycline was highly active against anaerobic gram-positive cocci such as peptococcus spp. the in vitro activity of tigecycline was significantly better than that of minocycline and tetracycline. it was as active as or slightly more active than vancomycin and teicoplanin in the activity against resistant aerobic  gram-positive cocci. tigecycline was bactericidal against all gram-positive cocci tested except enterococcus spp. inoculum size but not ph of medium or concentration of human serum in broth had significant effect on the in vitro activity of tigecycline. aged media (48-72 hours after preparation) used in the test and specific resistance problem in china may have some effects on mic values of tigecycline.

TI  == heart transplantation in the patient under ventricular assist complicated with device-related infection.
AB  == ventricular assist devices (vad) have benefited patients with end-stage heart failure as a bridge to heart transplantation (htx). we present our experience of  htx in the presence of device-related infection (dri) including driveline exit site with pocket infections. from may 1996 to april 2003, mechanical circulatory  support with the heartmate vad was performed in eight patients, and with the thoratec vad in seven patients. although 151 patients underwent htx during that period, only 8 of the 15 patients had suitable donors and underwent orthotopic htx. six of the eight patients developed dri. their ages ranged from 18 to 59 years (mean = 36 +/- 14 years). the duration of vad support ranged from 8 to 287  days (mean = 125 +/- 117 days). the general condition and cardiac function improved gradually under vad support. at the time of htx, all six male patients were suffering from dri. the causative microorganisms were acinetobacter baumannii (n = 3) methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), and enterococcus faecium (n = 1). all patients underwent successful htx, and were discharged in good condition. it is concluded that under the coverage of appropriate antibiotics, htx can be successfully performed for the patients for vad support with dri. it is important to prevent the spread of infection during htx. adequate debridement and drainage of the infected materials prevents postoperative wound infections.

TI  == multicenter surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens in intensive care units in 2000 in taiwan.
AB  == a susceptibility surveillance study of 1,274 bacterial isolates recovered from various clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (icus) of five major teaching hospitals was carried out from march, 2000, to june, 2000, in taiwan. this study demonstrated a high rate (66%) of oxacillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus (orsa), a high rate of nonsusceptibility to penicillin (intermediate, 50% and highly resistant, 8%), and high rates of cefotaxime nonsusceptibility for s. pneumoniae (intermediate, 29% and resistant, 4%), enterobacter cloacae (57%), serratia marcescens (34%), and citrobacter freundii (60%). high rate of ceftazidime nonsusceptibility for pseudomonas aeruginosa (22%), and high rates of imipenem nonsusceptibility for p. aeruginosa (15%) and acinetobacter baumannii (22%) were also found. the percentage (11.9%) of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli was greater than that (11.3%) for klebsiella pneumoniae. rates of quinupristin-dalfopristin nonsusceptibility for s. pneumoniae (42%), enterococcus faecium (71%), and orsa (39%) were high, but no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found in this study. the resistance rates of some pathogen varied by institution or type of icus. surveillance for antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens in hospitals, particularly in icu settings with a preexisting higher resistance burden, is mandatory in establishing and/or modifying guidelines for empirical treatment of severe infections in icu patients caused by these antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

TI  == present situation of antimicrobial resistance in korea.
AB  == resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is a worldwide concern. in korea,  resistant bacteria are more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci, beta-lactamase-producing gonococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, class c beta-lactamase-producing e. coli, fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, and aminoglycoside-resistant acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa are examples of resistant bacteria prevalent in korea, and their presence suggests a high level of antimicrobial selective pressure and the nosocomial spread of resistant bacteria. recently observed rapid increases in the incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and carbapenem-resistant p. aeruginosa present new threats in korea.

TI  == comparison of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and amplified fragment-length polymorphism for epidemiological investigations of common nosocomial pathogens.
AB  == objective: to compare molecular typing by amplified fragment-length polymorphism  (aflp) analysis with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) with respect to the  ability to differentiate between epidemiologically related and unrelated isolates of common nosocomial pathogens recovered during a period of endemicity. design: retrospective laboratory analysis. setting: tertiary-care institution. methods: 17 isolates of acinetobacter baumannii, 22 isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 22 vancomycin-resistant enterococcusfaecium (vre) were typed by both methods. results: aflp generated comparable results to pfge for a baumannii and p aeruginosa isolates; both methods identified epidemiologically related and unrelated isolates. however, strain typing of vre isolates produced discordant results between the two methods. pfge identified 10 different strain types and differentiated between all epidemiologically related and unrelated isolates. in contrast, aflp generated only five different strain types, three of which contained both epidemiologically related and unrelated isolates. conclusion: molecular typing by aflp is comparable to pfge for a baumannii and p aeruginosa isolates. for vre isolates, however, pfge remains the method of choice.

TI  == transmission of opportunistic pathogens in a veterinary teaching hospital.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and staphylococcus intermedius isolates from infected surgical wounds and other types of infections in a veterinary teaching hospital were typed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. a first cluster of infections with a multiresistant a. baumannii strain was observed in dogs and cats in 1998-1999. this strain disappeared after  cleaning and disinfection of the companion animals intensive care unit. it was followed in 2000 by a second multiresistant strain, which caused another cluster  of infections and was also transmitted to a patient in the nearby horse clinic. transmission of a multiresistant e. faecium strain between two cats with surgical wound infections was also observed during the same period. no multiresistant s. intermedius strain was observed during this time and transmission of this organism between patients did not seem to occur. the present study demonstrates the potential for hospital nosocomial resistance problems in veterinary medicine  similar to those encountered in human medicine. the results suggest that the epidemiology of nosocomial infections with a. baumannii and e. faecium may differ from that of s. intermedius infections and that preventive measures may have to be adapted to the problem organism.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance surveillance of bacteria in 1999 in korea with a special reference to resistance of enterococci to vancomycin and gram-negative bacilli to third generation cephalosporin, imipenem, and fluoroquinolone.
AB  == the trend of antimicrobial resistance of bacteria isolated from patients in 30 korean hospitals in 1999 was analyzed with a particular attention to cefotaxime-  or fluoroquinolone-resistant gram-negative bacilli, imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. adequacy of susceptibility testing, and any change in the frequencies of isolated species were also analyzed. the results showed that only 20% and 30% of hospitals tested  the piperacillin-tazobactam and cefoxitin susceptibility of enterobacteriaceae, respectively, only 24% of hospitals the piperacillin-tazobactam susceptibility of p. aeruginosa, and 17% of hospitals the fusidic acid susceptibility of staphylococci. among the isolates 26.3% were glucose-nonfermenting gram-negative  bacilli, and 34.7% of enterococcus were enterococcus faecium. slight decline of cefotaxime-resistance rate to 20% was noted in klebsiella pneumoniae, while fluoroquinolone-resistance rate was 68% in acinetobacter baumannii. the ceftazidime- and imipenem-resistance rates were 17% and 18%, respectively in p. aeruginosa. the vancomycin-resistance rate of e. faecium rose significantly to 15.1%, but the rates varied significantly depending on hospitals suggesting presence of different degree of selective pressure or nosocomial spread. in conclusion, the prevalence of imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa and the increase of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium were the particularly worrisome phenomena observed in this study.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == survival of acinetobacter baumannii on dry surfaces.
AB  == acinetobacter spp. have frequently been reported to be the causative agents of hospital outbreaks. the circumstances of some outbreaks demonstrated the long survival of acinetobacter in a dry, inanimate environment. in laboratory experiments, we compared the abilities of five acinetobacter baumannii strains, three acinetobacter sp. strains from the american type culture collection (atcc), one escherichia coli atcc strain, and one enterococcus faecium atcc strain to survive under dry conditions. bacterial solutions of the 10 strains were inoculated onto four different material samples (ceramic, polyvinyl chloride, rubber, and stainless steel) and stored under defined conditions. we investigated the bacterial counts of the material samples immediately after inoculation, after drying, and after 4 h, 1 day, and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks of storage. a statistical model was used to distribute the 40 resulting curves among four types of survival curves. the type of survival curve was significantly associated with  the bacterial strain but not with the material. the ability of the a. baumannii strains to survive under dry conditions varied greatly and correlated well with the source of the strain. strains isolated from dry sources survived better than  those isolated from wet sources. an outbreak strain that had caused hospital-acquired respiratory tract infections survived better than the strains from wet sources, but not as well as strains from dry sources. resistance to dry  conditions may promote the transmissibility of a strain, but it is not sufficient to make a strain an epidemic one. however, in the case of an outbreak, sources of acinetobacter must be expected in the dry environment.
