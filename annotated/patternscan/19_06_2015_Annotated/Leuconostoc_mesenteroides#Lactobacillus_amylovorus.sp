TI  == gentio-oligosaccharides from leuconostoc mesenteroides nrrl b-1426 dextransucrase as prebiotics and as a supplement for functional foods with anti-cancer properties.
AB  == gentio-oligosaccharides (gnos) were synthesized by the acceptor reaction of dextransucrase from leuconostoc mesenteroides nrrl b-1426 with gentiobiose and sucrose. gnos were purified by gel permeation chromatography using a bio-gel p-2  column and identified by mass spectrometry. the purified gnos (degree of polymerization >/=3) were investigated for their in vitro prebiotic and cytotoxic activity. gnos exhibited a significantly lower degree of digestibility of 18.1% by simulated human gastric juice (ph 1.0) and 7.1% by human alpha-amylase (ph 7.0) after 6 h, whereas inulin, a standard prebiotic, showed 39.7% and 12.8% of digestibility, respectively. the prebiotic score showed that gnos significantly supported the growth of probiotics such as bifidobacterium infantis and lactobacillus acidophilus and was comparable to that of inulin. the selective inhibitory effect of gnos on human colon carcinoma (ht-29) cells revealed its potential as an anti-cancer agent that can serve as a functional food additive for the benefit of human health.

TI  == fermented fruits and vegetables of asia: a potential source of probiotics.
AB  == as world population increases, lactic acid fermentation is expected to become an  important role in preserving fresh vegetables, fruits, and other food items for feeding humanity in developing countries. however, several fermented fruits and vegetables products (sauerkraut, kimchi, gundruk, khalpi, sinki, etc.) have a long history in human nutrition from ancient ages and are associated with the several social aspects of different communities. among the food items, fruits and vegetables are easily perishable commodities due to their high water activity and nutritive values. these conditions are more critical in tropical and subtropical  countries which favour the growth of spoilage causing microorganisms. lactic acid fermentation increases shelf life of fruits and vegetables and also enhances several beneficial properties, including nutritive value and flavours, and reduces toxicity. fermented fruits and vegetables can be used as a potential source of probiotics as they harbour several lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus plantarum, l. pentosus, l. brevis, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, leuconostoc fallax, and l. mesenteroides. as a whole, the traditionally fermented fruits and vegetables not only serve as food supplements but also attribute towards health benefits. this review aims to describe some important asian fermented fruits and vegetables and their significance as a potential source of probiotics.

TI  == effects of bile salt deconjugation by probiotic strains on the survival of antibiotic-resistant foodborne pathogens under simulated gastric conditions.
AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the effects of bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains on the antibiotic susceptibility of antibiotic-sensitive and multiple antibiotic-resistant salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus. eight probiotic strains, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus acidophilus adh, lactobacillus brevis kacc 10553, lactobacillus casei kacc 12413, lactobacillus paracasei atcc 25598, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, leuconostoc mesenteroides kacc 12312, and pediococcus acidilactici kacc 12307, were used to examine bile acid tolerance. the ability to deconjugate bile acids was evaluated  using both thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography.  the antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out to determine the synergistic inhibitory activity of deconjugated bile acids. l. acidophilus, l. brevis, and p. acidilactici showed the most tolerance to the conjugated bile acids. p. acidilactici deconjugated glycocholic acid and glycodeoxycholate from 3.18 and 3.09 mm to the detection limits, respectively. the antibiotic susceptibility of selected foodborne pathogens was increased by increasing the concentration of deconjugated bile acids. the study results are useful for understanding the relationship between bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains and antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of deconjugated bile acids, and they may be useful for designing new probiotic-antibiotic combination therapy based on bile acid deconjugation.

TI  == determination of lactic microflora of kefir grains and kefir beverage by using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == in this study, we investigated the bacterial compositions of kefir grains and kefir beverages collected from different regions of turkey by using culture-independent and culture-dependent methods. in the culture-independent detection, 10 different species of bacteria were detected in total by using the polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) analysis of the 16s rrna gene v3 region. among these species, lactobacillus kefiranofaciens was the most dominant one in the kefir grains, while lactococcus  lactis was found to be significantly prevalent in the kefir beverages. in the culture-dependent detection, the primary differentiation and grouping of the isolates from kefir beverages and kefir grains were performed using repetitive sequence-based pcr (rep-pcr) fingerprinting, and the results were validated by 16s rdna full-length sequencing. according to the results of culture-dependent methods, the most frequently isolated species were l. lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and lactobacillus kefiri, respectively. only 3 species, which are  l. lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus, were detected with both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. this study  showed that the combination of both methods is necessary for a detailed and reliable investigation of microbial communities in kefir grains and kefir beverages. practical application: due to their artisan- and region-dependent microflora, kefir products can be a source of interesting lactic acid bacteria, either new taxa or strains with specific functional properties, which might be used for the development of new starter cultures and innovative food products. therefore, an increasing demand exists for new strains that show desirable effects on the product characteristics artisan dairy products are a candidate source of such microorganisms. for this reason, in this study, the bacterial compositions of kefir grains and kefir beverages obtained from different regions  of turkey were studied using culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular  methods.

TI  == predominant genera of fecal microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis are not altered by intake of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bi-07.
AB  == the effect of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium lactis bi-07 on the composition of the lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium and the total bacterial population in feces from young children with atopic dermatitis was investigated. the study included 50 children randomized to intake of one of the probiotic strain or placebo. microbial composition was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, quantitative pcr and, in a subset of subjects, by pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna  gene. the core population of the lactobacillus group was identified as lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, leuconostoc mesenteroides, while the bifidobacterial community included bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium catenulatum. the fecal numbers of l. acidophilus and b. lactis increased significantly after intervention, indicating survival of the ingested bacteria. the levels of bifidobacterium correlated positively (p=0.03), while the levels of the lactobacillus group negatively (p=0.01) with improvement of atopic eczema evaluated by the severity scoring of atopic dermatitis index. this correlation was observed across the whole study cohort and not attributed to the probiotic intake. the main conclusion of the study is that administration of l. acidophilus ncfm and b. lactis bi-07 does not affect the composition and diversity of the main bacterial populations in feces.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria fermentation of human milk oligosaccharide components, human milk oligosaccharides and galactooligosaccharides.
AB  == human milk contains about 7% lactose and 1% human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) consisting of lactose with linked fucose, n-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. in infant formula, galactooligosaccharides (goss) are added to replace hmos. this study investigated the ability of six strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab), lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus reuteri, streptococcus thermophilus and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris, to digest hmo components, defined hmos, and goss. all strains grew on lactose and glucose. n-acetylglucosamine utilization varied between strains and was maximal in l. plantarum; fucose utilization was low or absent in  all strains. both hetero- and homofermentative lab utilized n-acetylglucosamine via the embden-meyerhof pathway. lactobacillus acidophilus and l. plantarum were  the most versatile in hydrolysing pnp analogues and the only strains releasing mono- and disaccharides from defined hmos. whole cells of all six lab hydrolysed  onp-galactoside and pnp-galactoside indicating beta-galactosidase activity. high  beta-galactosidase activity of l. reuteri, l. fermentum, s. thermophilus and l. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris whole cells correlated to lactose and gos hydrolysis. hydrolysis of lactose and goss by heterologously expressed beta-galactosidases confirmed that lab beta-galactosidases are involved in gos digestion. in summary, the strains of lab used were not capable of utilizing complex hmos but metabolized hmo components and goss.

TI  == heterologous expression of glycoside hydrolase family 2 and 42 beta-galactosidases of lactic acid bacteria in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == this study characterized a glycoside hydrolase family 42 (gh42) beta-galactosidase of lactobacillus acidophilus (laca) and compared lactose hydrolysis, hydrolysis of onpg, pnpg and pnpg-analogues and galactooligosaccharides (goss) formation to gh2 beta-galactosidases of streptococcus thermophilus (lacz type), lactobacillus plantarum and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris (both laclm type). beta-galactosidases were heterologously expressed in lactococcus lactis using a p170 derived promoter; experiments were performed with l. lactis crude cell extract (cce). the novel gh42 beta-galactosidase of lb. acidophilus had lower activity on lactose, onpg and pnpg but higher relative activity on pnp analogues compared to gh2 beta-galactosidases, and did not transgalactosylate at high lactose concentrations. temperature and ph optima for lactose hydrolysis varied between gh2 beta-galactosidases. onpg and pnpg were the preferred substrates for hydrolysis; in comparison, activity on pnpg-analogues was less than 1.5%. gh2 beta-galactosidases formed structurally similar gos with varying preferences. the diversity of lactic acid bacteria beta-galactosidase activity in l. lactis cce can be exploited in future nutritional or therapeutic applications.

TI  == biodiversity of the microbial community in a spanish farmhouse cheese as revealed by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == the microbial diversity within alberquilla cheese, made from a spontaneously fermented mixture of raw goats' and sheep's milk in the alpujarra mountains (granada, south-east spain), has been studied by the classical culturing method and also by molecular analysis of community dna. a collection of 206 isolates was obtained from the cheese on different selective/differential media, which were then re-grouped to 52 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analyses. isolates on man-rogosa and sharpe-agar (mrs), m17-glucose agar and kenner fecal (kf)-agar medium were identified by specific pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing and belonged mainly to the lactic-acid bacteria group. the predominant genus was lactobacillus, which accounted for more than 50% of the isolates, the most abundant species being lactobacillus paracasei, followed by considerably less quantities of lb. plantarum and lb. brevis. other lactic-acid bacteria identified were pediococcus urinaequi, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuc. mesenteroides, lactococcus lactis and even the enterococci enterococcus faecium and e. devriesei. cluster analyses of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among the lactobacilli. the gram-negative bacterial strains belonged mainly to hafnia alvei species. the microbes occurring in alberquilla cheese were also studied by pcr temporal temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge) of the 16s rrna v3 region and partial 16s rrna sequencing of the ttge bands. the results showed a major presence of lactic-acid bacteria closely related to lc. lactis, lb. paracasei, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. acidophilus and enterococcus sp. the non-lactic-acid bacterium detected was identified as escherichia coli. all the enterococcus strains showed great susceptibility to the most clinically relevant antibiotics, harbouring only the virulence gene efaafm.  on the basis of their antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes we chose two strains of ln. mesenteroides that produced mesenterocin b105 and mesenterocin y105, as revealed by pcr techniques.

TI  == functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
AB  == this paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. the organisms previously identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. fermentum, lb. acidophilus, pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc dextranicum and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as  mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees c) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). the ph fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with lb. plantarum; 4.37 in l. dextranicum+s.  cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. significant differences (p <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels  (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among ph and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic a. flavus. the findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.

TI  == analysis of bacterial community during the fermentation of pulque, a traditional  mexican alcoholic beverage, using a polyphasic approach.
AB  == in this study, the characterization of the bacterial community present during the fermentation of pulque, a traditional mexican alcoholic beverage from maguey (agave), was determined for the first time by a polyphasic approach in which both culture and non-culture dependent methods were utilized. the work included the isolation of lactic acid bacteria (lab), aerobic mesophiles, and 16s rdna clone libraries from total dna extracted from the maguey sap (aguamiel) used as substrate, after inoculation with a sample of previously produced pulque and followed by 6-h fermentation. microbiological diversity results were correlated with fermentation process parameters such as sucrose, glucose, fructose and fermentation product concentrations. in addition, medium rheological behavior analysis and scanning electron microscopy in aguamiel and during pulque fermentation were also performed. our results showed that both culture and non-culture dependent approaches allowed the detection of several new and previously reported species within the alpha-, gamma-proteobacteria and firmicutes. bacteria diversity in aguamiel was composed by the heterofermentative leuconostoc citreum, l. mesenteroides, l. kimchi, the gamma-proteobacteria erwinia rhapontici, enterobacter spp. and acinetobacter radioresistens. inoculation with previously fermented pulque incorporated to the system microbiota, homofermentative lactobacilli related to lactobacillus acidophilus, several alpha-proteobacteria such as zymomonas mobilis and acetobacter malorum, other gamma-proteobacteria and an important amount of yeasts, creating a starting metabolic diversity composed by homofermentative and heterofermentative lab, acetic and ethanol producing microorganisms. at the end of the fermentation process, the bacterial diversity was mainly composed by the homofermentative lactobacillus acidophilus, the heterofermentative l. mesenteroides, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and the alpha-proteobacteria a. malorum. after a 6-h fermentation, 83.27% of total sugars detected after inoculation were consumed (228.4 mm hexose equivalents) and a carbon (c) recovery of 66.18% in fermentation products was estimated. they were produced 284.4 mm c as ethanol, 71.5 mm c as acetic acid and 19 mm c as lactic acid, demonstrating the presence of homo- and heterofermentative, acetic and alcoholic metabolisms in the final product. it was also found, after hydrolysis, that the exopolysaccharide produced during the fermentation was mainly composed by fructose residues, probably inulin or levan.

TI  == development of antioxidant activity in milk whey during fermentation with lactic  acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: to investigate the production of antioxidant activity during fermentation with commonly used dairy starter cultures. moreover, to study the development of  antioxidant activity during fermentation, and the connection to proteolysis and bacterial growth. methods and results: antioxidant activity was measured by analysing the radical scavenging activity using a spectrophotometric decolorization assay and lipid peroxidation inhibition was assayed using liposomal model system with a fluorescence method. milk was fermented with 25 lactic acid bacterial (lab) strains, and from these six strains, exhibiting the highest radical scavenging activity was selected for further investigation. leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris strains, lactobacillus jensenii (atcc 25258) and lactobacillus acidophilus (atcc 4356) showed the highest activity with both the methods used. however, the radical scavenging activity was stronger than lipid peroxidation inhibition activity. the development of radical scavenging activity was connected to proteolysis with four strains. molecular distribution profiles showed that fermentates with high scavenging activity also possessed a higher proportion of peptides in the molecular mass range of 4-20 kda, while others had mostly large polypeptides and compounds below 4 kda. in addition, the  amount of hydrophobic amino acids was higher in these fermentates. conclusions: the development of antioxidant activity was strain-specific characteristic. the development of radical scavengers was more connected to the simultaneous development of proteolysis whereas, lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity was related to bacterial growth. however, high radical scavenging activity was not directly connected to the high degree of proteolysis. significance and impact of  the study: to the best of our knowledge, this seems to be the first report, which screens possible antioxidant activity among most common dairy lab strains. use of such strains improve nutritional value of fermented dairy products.

AB  == non-enterococcal gram-positive bacteria that are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant have been infrequently isolated in association with serious  infections. however, well-documented infections have lately been reported with increasing frequency. because these organisms may be pathogens, we tested the mics of 19 antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method for predicting susceptibility. the activity of these antimicrobial agents was assessed against 28 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 6; lactobacillus acidophilus, 1; lactobacillus casei, 1; lactobacillus fermentum, 2; lactobacillus brevis, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1; weissella confusa, 2; leuconostoc mesenteroides, 7; leuconostoc lactis, 4; pediococcus acidilactici, 2; pediococcus pentosaceus, 1),  isolated from clinical specimens in an argentinian university hospital from 1997  to 2003. the mics of penicillin for 67% of the lactobacillus strains and 100% of  the leuconostoc spp. and pediococcus spp. strains tested were in the 0.25-2 microg/ml range. erythromycin was the most active antimicrobial overall. multiresistance was observed in 2 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1).

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == a dynamic model that simulates the human upper gastrointestinal tract for the study of probiotics.
AB  == a dynamic model of the human upper gastrointestinal (gi) tract was designed to better simulate conditions of ingestion and digestion, by including a food matrix as part of the model design. the dynamic model consisted of two reactors maintained at 37 degrees c, one simulating stomach conditions and the other simulating duodenum conditions. the model was tested by comparing survival of bacteria isolated from humans (bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus acidophilus) animals (bifidobacterium  animalis, 2 strains), and fermented dairy products (bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus kefir, lactobacillus kefirgranum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides) with their survival as determined by conventional methods. five strains were not  able to survive (>3 log reduction) 15 min in a medium acidified at ph 2.0 using the conventional testing method, but survival was improved significantly for some strains in the dynamic model. two strains (bifidobacterium animalis atcc 25527 and lactobacillus johnsonii la-1 ncc 533) showed good survival with both methods. the dynamic model was shown to better represent the events during upper gi tract  transit than the conventional methods, by incorporation of a food matrix to buffer the gastric acidity and therefore expose bacteria to ph levels found in vivo before, during, and after a meal.

TI  == detection of leuconostoc strains at a meat processing plant using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == to simplify the labor-intensive conventional routine testing of samples to detect leuconostoc at a meat processing plant, we developed polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primers specific for leuconostoc from 16s rrna gene sequences. these primers did not detect other common lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus plantarum, lact. sake, lact. fermentum, lact. acidophilus and weissella viridescens. pcr with this primer detected all leuconostoc species tested (leu. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, leu. pseudomesenteroides, leu. carnosum, leu. lactic, leu. citreum, leu. amelibiosum, leu. gelidum), except for leu. fallax, and no other lactic acid bacteria on agarose gel electrophoresis. the method could identify areas contaminated with leuconostoc in a large-scale industrial meat processing plant. of 69 samples analyzed, 34 were positive for leuconostoc according to the conventional culture method (isolation of lab producing dextran) and pcr, whereas 29 were negative according to both. six samples were culture-negative but positive by pcr. no false negative results were generated by pcr. the method is rapid and simple, is useful for routinely monitoring areas contaminated with leuconostoc in meat processing plants, and could help to prevent the spoilage of meat products.

AB  == the ability of lactic acid bacteria (lab) to produce phenyllactic (pla) and 4-hydroxy-phenyllactic (oh-pla) acids, metabolites involved in food quality and preservation, has been evaluated by hplc analysis in 29 lab strains belonging to  12 species widely used in the production of fermented foods. metabolite production was demonstrated for all strains of the species lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus alimentarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, lactobacillus hilgardii, leuconostoc citreum, and for some strains of lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus acidophilus and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides. strains were distinguished by analysis of variance in three groups including 15 strains that produced both metabolites (0.16-0.46 mm pla and 0.07-0.29 mm oh-pla), five strains accumulating in culture  only pla (0.17-0.57 mm) and nine non-producer strains (< or = 0.10 mm pla and < or = 0.02 mm oh-pla). improvement of phenyllactic acid production was obtained in a selected l. plantarum strain by increasing the concentration of phenylalanine in culture and using low amounts of tyrosine.

TI  == esterolytic and lipolytic activities of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ewe's  milk and cheese.
AB  == in the present work, we report on the esterase and lipase activities of lactic acid bacteria representing the genera lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, and enterococcus isolated from ewe's milk and cheeses. esterase activity was studied using alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 12 carbon atoms and postelectrophoretic detection. the lactic acid bacteria evaluated had intracellular esterase activities, which preferentially degraded the alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 6 carbon atoms. by studying postelectrophoretic patterns, it was found that some strains presented more than one esterase. lactobacillus plantarum o236 showed four enzymes that hydrolyze carboxyl ester linkages with different specificity. lipase activity was studied in intracellular and extracellular fractions using tributyrin, tricaprylin, triolein, and milk fat as substrates. the intracellular and extracellular fractions of leuconostoc mesenteroides o257, lactobacillus plantarum o236, and lactobacillus acidophilus o177 were able to hydrolyze tributyrin. l. plantarum o186, l. acidophilus o252, enterococcus faecium o174 and o426, and enterococcus faecalis ov409 showed lipase activity associated with the intracellular fraction on tributyrin. lactococcus lactis o233, l. plantarum o155, and lactobacillus casei o190 did not hydrolyze triglycerides. not all strains that showed esterase activity exhibited high activity on triglycerides. esterase and lipase activities were species- and strain-specific. wide variations in activity between strains highlight the need for selecting appropriate starters to produce enzyme-modified cheese as well as accelerated ripened cheese.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of lactobacillus spp. associated with healthy and diseased mucosa of the human intestines.
AB  == two-hundred and fifty lactobacillus strains isolated from healthy and diseased mucosa of human intestines of 75 individuals and 49 reference strains were phenotypically classified using 49 unit characters. data were processed by the jaccard (sj) and simple matching (ssm) coefficients, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. seventeen major clusters were defined at the  76% sj-similarity level which approximately correspond to the ssm-level of 91%. seven clusters could be identified: lactobacillus plantarum (isolates recovered from 5% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus (17% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (5% of the patients), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (3% of the patients), lact. buchneri (4% of patients), lact. reuteri (4% of the patients) and lact. salivarius subsp. salivarius (9% of the patients). unassigned clusters 1 and 3 both contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains. cluster 1 included the type strains of lact. crispatus, lact. acidophilus, lact. jensenii and lact. gasseri, and cluster 3, the type strains of lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lact. agilis and lact. casei subsp. tolerans. clusters 1 and 3 were found in 15% and 25% of the patients, respectively. unassigned clusters 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. clusters 11, 12, 15 and 17 were made up of heterofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. phenotypical characteristics of the clusters are given. no obvious trends in species (cluster) composition between different intestinal locations could be noted. most clusters contained isolates from both diseased and healthy mucosa. exceptions were cluster 15 and cluster 17 which only included isolates from healthy mucosa, and cluster 11 which only included isolates from diseased mucosa. cluster 15 was isolated in 12% of the patients, and cluster 11 in 8%.

TI  == a phylogenetic analysis of lactobacilli, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc  mesenteroides.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. brevis, l. plantarum, l.  ruminis, l. casei, l. bifermentans, l. viridescens, l. fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16 s ribosomal rnas. all lactobacillus species investigated together with p. pentosaceus and l. mesenteroides form a phylogenetically coherent and ancient group. l. acidophilus and l. helveticus is  the only closely related pair of species; all other species are only remotely related among each other, indicating that they are well-defined species. lactobacillus, together with streptococcus and bacillus, constitute a super-cluster within the 'clostridium' sub-branch of gram-positive eubacteria showing a low guanine plus cytosine content of their deoxyribonucleic acid.
