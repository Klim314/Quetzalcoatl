a targetron system for gene targeting in thermophiles and its application in clostridium thermocellum.
background: targetrons are gene targeting vectors derived from mobile group ii introns. they consist of an autocatalytic intron rna (a "ribozyme") and an intron-encoded reverse transcriptase, which use their combined activities to achieve highly efficient site-specific dna integration with readily programmable dna target specificity. methodology/principal findings: here, we used a mobile group ii intron from the thermophilic cyanobacterium thermosynechococcus elongatus to construct a thermotargetron for gene targeting in thermophiles. after determining its dna targeting rules by intron mobility assays in escherichia coli at elevated temperatures, we used this thermotargetron in clostridium thermocellum, a thermophile employed in biofuels production, to disrupt six different chromosomal genes (cipa, hfat, hyd, ldh, pta, and pyrf). high integration efficiencies (67-100% without selection) were achieved, enabling detection of disruptants by colony pcr screening of a small number of transformants. because the thermotargetron functions at high temperatures that promote dna melting, it can recognize dna target sequences almost entirely by base pairing of the intron rna with less contribution from the intron-encoded protein than for mesophilic targetrons. this feature increases the number of potential targetron-insertion sites, while only moderately decreasing dna target specificity. phenotypic analysis showed that thermotargetron disruption of the genes encoding lactate dehydrogenase (ldh; clo1313_1160) and phosphotransacetylase (pta; clo1313_1185) increased ethanol production in c. thermocellum by decreasing carbon flux toward lactate and acetate. conclusions/significance: thermotargetron provides a new, rapid method for gene targeting and genetic engineering of c. thermocellum, an industrially important microbe, and should be readily adaptable for gene targeting in other thermophiles.
influence of a mannan binding family 32 carbohydrate binding module on the activity of the appended mannanase.
in general, cellulases and hemicellulases are modular enzymes in which the catalytic domain is appended to one or more noncatalytic carbohydrate binding modules (cbms). cbms, by concentrating the parental enzyme at their target polysaccharide, increase the capacity of the catalytic module to bind the substrate, leading to a potentiation in catalysis. clostridium thermocellum hypothetical protein cthe_0821, defined here as c. thermocellum man5a, is a modular protein comprising an n-terminal signal peptide, a family 5 glycoside hydrolase (gh5) catalytic module, a family 32 cbm (cbm32), and a c-terminal type i dockerin module. recent proteomic studies revealed that cthe_0821 is one of the major cellulosomal enzymes when c. thermocellum is cultured on cellulose. here we show that the gh5 catalytic module of cthe_0821 displays endomannanase activity. c. thermocellum man5a hydrolyzes soluble konjac glucomannan, soluble carob galactomannan, and insoluble ivory nut mannan but does not attack the highly galactosylated mannan from guar gum, suggesting that the enzyme prefers unsubstituted beta-1,4-mannoside linkages. the cbm32 of c. thermocellum man5a displays a preference for the nonreducing ends of mannooligosaccharides, although the protein module exhibits measurable affinity for the termini of beta-1,4-linked glucooligosaccharides such as cellobiose. cbm32 potentiates the activity of c. thermocellum man5a against insoluble mannans but has no significant effect on the capacity of the enzyme to hydrolyze soluble galactomannans and glucomannans. the product profile of c. thermocellum man5a is affected by the presence of cbm32.
dcm methylation is detrimental to plasmid transformation in clostridium thermocellum.
background: industrial production of biofuels and other products by cellulolytic  microorganisms is of interest but hindered by the nascent state of genetic tools. although a genetic system for clostridium thermocellum dsm1313 has recently been developed, available methods achieve relatively low efficiency and similar plasmids can transform c. thermocellum at dramatically different efficiencies. results: we report an increase in transformation efficiency of c. thermocellum for a variety of plasmids by using dna that has been methylated by escherichia coli dam but not dcm methylases. when isolated from a dam+dcm+e. coli strain, pamg206 transforms c. thermocellum 100-fold better than the similar plasmid pamg205, which contains an additional dcm methylation site in the pyrf gene. upon removal of dcm methylation, transformation with pamg206 showed a four- to seven-fold increase in efficiency; however, transformation efficiency of pamg205 increased 500-fold. removal of the dcm methylation site from the pamg205 pyrf gene via silent mutation resulted in increased transformation efficiencies equivalent to that of pamg206. upon proper methylation, transformation efficiency of plasmids bearing the pmk3 and pb6a origins of replication increased ca. three orders of magnitude. conclusions: e. coli dcm methylation decreases transformation efficiency in c. thermocellum dsm1313. the use of properly methylated plasmid dna should facilitate genetic manipulation of this industrially relevant bacterium.
escherichia coli expression and purification of four antimicrobial peptides fused to a family 3 carbohydrate-binding module (cbm) from clostridium thermocellum.
antimicrobial peptides (amps) are molecules that act in a wide range of physiological defensive mechanisms developed to counteract bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses. several hundreds of amps have been identified and characterized. these molecules are presently gaining increasing importance, as a consequence of their remarkable resistance to microorganism adaptation. carbohydrate-binding modules (cbms) are non-catalytic domains that anchor glycoside hydrolases into complex carbohydrates. clostridium thermocellum produces a multi-enzyme complex of cellulases and hemicellulases, termed the cellulosome, which is organized by the scaffoldin protein cipa. binding of the cellulosome to the plant cell wall results from the action of cipa family 3 cbm (cbm3), which presents a high affinity for crystalline cellulose. here cipa family 3 cbm was fused to four different amps using recombinant dna technology and the fusion recombinant proteins were expressed at high levels in escherichia coli cells. cbm3 does not present antibacterial activity and does not bind to the bacterial surface. however, the four recombinant proteins retained the ability to bind cellulose, suggesting that cbm3 is a good candidate polypeptide to direct the binding of amps into cellulosic supports. a comprehensive characterization of the antimicrobial activity of the recombinant fusion proteins is currently under evaluation.
improving solubility of shewanella oneidensis mr-1 and clostridium thermocellum jw-20 proteins expressed into esherichia coli.
low solubility of proteins overexpressed in e. coli is a frequent problem in high-throughput structural genomics. to improve solubility of proteins from mesophilic shewanella oneidensis mr-1 and thermophilic clostridium thermocellum jw20, an approach was attempted that included a fusion of the target protein to a maltose-binding protein (mbp) and a decrease of induction temperature. the mbp was selected as the most efficient solubilizing carrier when compared to a glutathione s-transferase and a nus a protein. a tobacco etch virus (tev) protease recognition site was introduced between fused proteins using a double polymerase-chain reaction and four primers. in this way, 79 s. oneidensis proteins have been expressed in one case with an n-terminal 30-residue tag and in another case as a fusion protein with mbp. a foreign tag might significantly affect the properties of the target polypeptide. at 37 degrees c and 18 degrees c induction temperatures, only 5 and 17 tagged proteins were soluble, respectively. in fusion with mbp 4, 34, and 38 proteins were soluble upon induction at 37 degrees, 28 degrees, and 18 degrees c, respectively. the mbp is assumed to increase stability and solubility of a target protein by changing both the mechanism and the cooperativity of folding/unfolding. the 66 c. thermocellum proteins were expressed as fusion proteins with mbp. induction at 37 degrees, 28 degrees, and 18 degrees c produced 34, 57, and 60 soluble proteins, respectively. the higher solubility of c. thermocellum proteins in comparison with the s. oneidensis proteins under similar conditions of induction correlates with the thermophilicity of the host. the two-factor wilkinson-harrison statistical model was used to identify soluble and insoluble proteins. theoretical and experimental data showed good agreement for s. oneidensis proteins; however, the model failed to identify soluble/insoluble clostridium proteins. a suggestion has been made that the wilkinson-harrison model is not applicable to c. thermocellum proteins because it did not account for the peculiarities of protein sequences from thermophiles.
cloning and expression of the clostridium thermocellum l-lactate dehydrogenase gene in escherichia coli and enzyme characterization.
the structural gene for l-lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) (ec.1.1.1.27) from clostridium thermocellum 27405 was cloned in escherichia coli by screening the lambda zap ii phage library of c. thermocellum genomic dna. in one positive clone, an open reading frame of 948 base pairs corresponded to c. thermocellum ldh gene encoding for the predicted 315-residue protein. the ldh gene was successfully expressed in e. coli fmj39 (ldh mutant) under the lac promoter. the recombinant enzyme was partially purified from e. coli cell extracts and its kinetic properties were determined. clostridium thermocellum ldh was shown to catalyze a highly reversible reaction and to be an allosteric enzyme that is activated by fructose-1,6-diphosphate (fdp). for pyruvate, partially purified ldh had km and vmax values of 7.3 mmol/l and 87 micromol/min, respectively, and in the presence of fdp, a 24-fold decrease in km and a 5.7-fold increase in vmax were recorded. the enzyme exhibited no marked catalytic activity for lactate in the absence of fdp, whereas km and vmax values were 59.5 mmol/l and 52 micromol/min, respectively, in its presence. the enzyme did not lose activity when incubated at 65 degrees c for 5 min.
synergistic interaction of the cellulosome integrating protein (cipa) from clostridium thermocellum with a cellulosomal endoglucanase.
activity of a cellulosomal endoglucanase (endoglucanase e; ege) from clostridium  thermocellum against two crystalline forms of cellulose was enhanced by combination with the cellulosome integrating protein (cipa), but cipa did not enhance ege activity against amorphous cellulose, even though it was able to bind to it. similarly, cipa added in trans to genetically truncated ege that was unable to combine with it nevertheless enhanced ege activity against crystalline cellulose. these results indicate that the cipa cellulose binding domain does not mediate an increase in activity solely by bringing the catalytic subunits of the cellulosome complex into intimate contact with the substrate.
cloning and expression of a clostridium thermocellum dna fragment that encodes a  protein related to cellulosome component sl.
antibodies raised against the sl subunit of the clostridium thermocellum cellulosome were used to screen a library of c. thermocellum chromosomal dna fragments constructed in the vector lambda gt11. a dna fragment that encoded a polypeptide that crossreacted with the anti-sl antibodies was isolated and its restriction map elucidated. no similarity with other previously cloned dna fragments has been found. the anti-sl crossreacting polypeptide was isolated from recombinant escherichia coli and found to have a mol mass of 37,000 da and to possess low levels of cmcase and avicelase activity. using cmc as the substrate, a temperature optimum of 55 degrees c and a ph optimum of 6.6 were observed. these properties were compared to those of c. thermocellum sl isolated by electroelution from an sds gel, which was also found to possess low levels of cmcase and avicelase activities. in addition, the sl proteins produced in c. thermocellum and e. coli were able to interact positively against avicel with an endoglucanase (ss) purified from the c. thermocellum crude cellulase preparation, and with a recombinant protein that crossreacted with anti-ss antibodies.
properties of a thermoactive beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase (lichenase) from clostridium  thermocellum expressed in escherichia coli.
a clostridium thermocellum gene (licb) encoding a thermoactive 1,3-1,4-beta-glucanase (lichenase) with a molecular weight of about 35,000 was localized on a 1.5-kb dna fragment by cloning and expression in e. coli. the enzyme acts on beta-glucans with alternating beta-1,3- and beta-1,4-linkages such as barley beta-glucan and lichenan, but not on beta-glucans containing only 1,3- or 1,4-glucosidic bonds. it is active over a broad ph range (ph 5-12) and has a temperature optimum around 80 degrees c. the c. thermocellum lichenase is unusually resistant against inactivation by heat, ethanol or ionic detergents. these properties make the enzyme highly suitable for industrial application in the mashing process of beer brewing.
nucleotide sequence of celc307 encoding endoglucanase c307 of clostridium sp. strain f1.
the celc gene, encoding endoglucanase c, of clostridium thermocellum was recently sequenced while a promoter region was not identified. in this study, the nucleotide sequence of celc307 of clostridium sp. strain f1 was identified and compared with that of the c. thermocellum gene. the open reading frame was composed of 1029 nucleotides and the deduced amino acid sequence corresponded to a protein of a molecular weight of 40,905. we identified promoter sequences (tggaca and tataat) at a position about 150 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon. six substitutions were found in the coding region, 3 leading to amino acid replacements. five substitutions and 1 deletion of a nucleotide were found in the region upstream of the initiation codon, 1 present at the promoter sequence. overproduction of endoglucanase c307 (egc307) in escherichia coli strongly inhibited the cell growth of the host strain. around 50% of egc307 produced in e. coli was detected in the periplasmic fraction. the n-terminal amino acid sequence suggested that this protein was exported into the periplasm without processing of a signal peptide.
