TI  == ethanoligenens harbinense gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from molasses wastewater.
AB  == two strictly anaerobic bacterial strains (yuan-3t and x-29) were isolated from anaerobic activated sludge of molasses wastewater in a continuous stirred-tank reactor. the strains were gram-positive, non-spore-forming, mesophilic and motile. cells were regular rods (0.4-0.8 x 1.5-8.0 microm) and occurred singly, in pairs and sometimes in chains of up to eight. autoaggregative and autofluorescent growth of strain yuan-3t and non-aggregative growth of strain x-29 were observed at 20-44 degrees c and ph 3.5-9.0. both strains hydrolysed gelatin and aesculin and fermented several kinds of mono-, di- and oligosaccharides. fermentation end products formed from glucose were acetate, ethanol, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. the predominant cellular fatty acids were the branched-chain fatty acids iso-c(16 : 0) (44.18 %) and iso-c(12 : 0) (26.67 %). the dna g+c contents of strains yuan-3t and x-29 were 47.8 and 49.0 mol%, respectively. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequences revealed that the isolates represent a novel phyletic sublineage within the clostridium cellulosi rrna cluster, with <92 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity to currently known species. on the basis of polyphasic evidence from this study, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium should be classified in a new genus as a novel species, ethanoligenens harbinense gen. nov., sp. nov. the type strain of ethanoligenens harbinense is yuan-3t (=jcm 12961t = cgmcc 1.5033t).
