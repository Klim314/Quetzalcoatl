the effect of hydro alcoholic extract of seven plants on cariogenic bacteria--an  in vitro evaluation.
aim: to compare the antibacterial effect of hydro alcoholic extract of salvia officinalis, pimpinella anisum, satureja hortensis, rhus coriaria, carum copticum, mentha longifolia, achillea millefolium against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus rhamnosus and actinomyces viscosus through two in vitro methods. methods: in this experimental study, hydro-alcoholic extracts have been prepared from the shoot of salvia officinalis, satureja hortensis, mentha longifolia and achillea millefolium, the seed of pimpinella anisum and carum copticum and the fruit of rhus coriaria with maceration method. their antibacterial activity against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus rhamnosus and actinomyces viscosus have been evaluated with broth macrodilution and agar diffusion methods. results: in broth macrodilution method mic (minimum inhibitory concentration) of pimpinella anisum, salvia officinalis, mentha longifolia, achillea millefolium, satureja hortensis, carum copticum and rhus coriaria for streptococcus mutans were respectively 12.5, 6.25, 12.5, 50, 50, 12.5 and 50 mug/ml, for lactobacillus rhamnosus 12.5, 1.56, 3.12, 12.5, 6.25, 6.25 and 6.25 mug/ml and for actinomyces viscosus 50, 12.5, 100, 50, 100, 25 and 25 mug/ml. in agar diffusion method pimpinella anisum, salvia officinalis and rhus coriaria against streptococcus mutans, pimpinella anisum, carum copticum and rhus coriaria against lactobacillus rhamnosus and mentha longifolia, rhus coriaria and carum copticum against actinomyces viscosus had antibacterial effects. conclusion: all seven extracts had growth inhibitory effects on all three bacteria. salvia officinalis had the greatest inhibitory effect on growth of all three bacteria. all of the extracts except carum copticum had bactericidal effect in the range of concentration. by agar diffusion method rhus coriaria had antibacterial effect against all three cariogenic bacteria.
a comparative study of the effect of probiotics on cariogenic biofilm model for preventing dental caries.
dental caries is induced by oral biofilm containing streptococcus mutans. probiotic bacteria were mainly studied for effect on the gastrointestinal tract and have been known to promote human health. however, the information of probiotics for oral health has been lack yet. in this study, we investigated influence of various probiotics on oral bacteria or cariogenic biofilm and evaluated candidate probiotics for dental caries among them. the antimicrobial activity of the spent culture medium of probiotics for oral streptococci was performed. probiotics were added during the biofilm formation with salivary bacteria including s. mutans. the oral biofilms were stained with a fluorescent dye and observed using the confocal laser scanning microscope. to count bacteria in the biofilm, the bacteria were plated on msb and bhi agar plates after disrupting the biofilm and cultivated. glucosyltransferases (gtfs) expression of s. mutans and integration of lactobacilli into the biofilm were evaluated by real-time rt-pcr. among probiotics, lactobacillus species strongly inhibited growth of oral streptococci. moreover, lactobacillus species strongly inhibited formation of cariogenic biofilm model. the expression of gtfs was significantly reduced by lactobacillus rhamnosus. the integration of l. rhamnosus into the biofilm model did not exhibit. however, l. acidophilus and l casei integrated into the biofilm model. these results suggest that l. rhamnosus may inhibit oral biofilm formation by decreasing glucan production of s. mutans and antibacterial activity and did not integrate into oral biofilm, which can be a candidate for caries prevention strategy.
the effect of five probiotic lactobacilli strains on the growth and biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans.
objective: to compare the effects of five probiotic lactobacilli strains on the growth and biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans (ms). materials and methods: five probiotic lactobacilli bacteria (lb), lactobacillus casei shirota, lactobacillus casei lc01, lactobacillus plantarum st-iii, lactobacillus paracasei lpc-37, and lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001, were used as test strains effecting on the streptococci strain s. mutans ua159 in this study. the effect of lb strains and their supernatants on the viability of the ms was evaluated. then, the effect of lb strains on the growth of ms biofilm formation was observed by fluorescence microscope. results: all of the lb strains inhibited the growth of ms at concentrations of 1 x 10(8) and 3 x 10(8) cfu ml(-1) (p < 0.05). untreated (without ph adjustment and ultrafiltration) lb supernatants from all of the lb strains inhibited the growth of ms (p < 0.05) as well. after ph adjustment and ultrafiltration (treated), only supernatants from l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus hn001 inhibited the growth of ms (p < 0.05). ms biofilm formation was also inhibited by all untreated supernatants and by the treated supernatants of l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus hn001 (p < 0.05). conclusion: all five probiotic lactobacilli strains inhibited the growth and biofilm formation of ms, likely through the production of an acid environment, bacteriocin-like poly peptides, or both, and the effects on ms were dependent on the lb strains used.
effects of compounds found in nidus vespae on the growth and cariogenic virulence factors of streptococcus mutans.
nidus vespae (honeycomb) is a kind of traditional chinese medicine that has been  demonstrated to inhibit the growth and acid-production of oral cariogenic bacteria. subsequent studies showed that the chloroform/methanol (chl/meoh) chemical extraction of nidus vespae was the most effective inhibitor of growth and acidogenicity of streptococcus mutans. in this study, we isolated the chemical compounds of the nidus vespae chl/meoh extraction, tested their antimicrobial activity against six cariogenic bacteria and further evaluated the acid inhibition properties, anti-f-atpase activity and anti-ldh activity against s. mutans. the isolated flavonoids, quercetin and kaempferol, inhibited the growth of bacteria (s. mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii and lactobacillus rhamnosus) with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) ranging from 1 to 4 mg/ml and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) from 4 to 16 mg/ml. in addition, quercetin and kaempferol at sub-mic levels significantly inhibited acidogenicity and acidurity of s. mutans cells. treated with the test agents, the f-atpase activity was reduced by 47.37% with 1mg/ml quercetin and by 49.66% with 0.5mg/ml kaempferol. the results showed that quercetin and kaempferol contained in chl/meoh extraction presented remarkably biological activity, suggesting that nidus vespae might be useful as a potential preventive and therapeutic agent in dental caries.
probiotic lactobacilli interfere with streptococcus mutans biofilm formation in vitro.
in clinical studies, probiotic bacteria have decreased the counts of salivary mutans streptococci (ms). we compared the effects of probiotic lactobacillus strains on the biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans. the bacterial strains used included four s. mutans strains (reference strains nctc 10449 and ingbritt and clinical isolates 2366 and 195) and probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum 299v, and l. reuteri strains pta 5289 and sd2112. the ability of ms to adhere and grow on a glass surface, reflecting biofilm formation, was studied in the presence of the lactobacilli (lb). the effect of lb culture supernatants on the viability of the ms was studied as well. all of the lb inhibited the biofilm formation of the clinical isolates of ms (p < 0.001). the biofilm formation of the reference strains of ms was also inhibited by the lb, but l. plantarum and l. reuteri pta 5289 showed a weaker inhibition when compared to l. reuteri sd2112 and l. rhamnosus gg. viable s. mutans cells could be detected in the biofilms and culture media only when the experiments were performed with the l. reuteri strains. the l. reuteri strains were less efficient in killing the ms also in the tests performed with the culture supernatants. the phs of the supernatants of l. reuteri were higher compared to those of l. rhamnosus gg and l. plantarum; p < 0.001. in conclusion, our results demonstrated that four commonly used probiotics interfered with s. mutans biofilm formation in vitro, and that the antimicrobial activity against s. mutans was ph-dependent.
characterization of oral lactobacilli as potential probiotics for oral health.
introduction: intestinal lactobacilli have been successfully used as probiotics to treat gastrointestinal disorders, but only limited data are available for the probiotic properties of oral lactobacilli to combat oral diseases. we aimed to characterize oral lactobacilli for their potential probiotic properties according to the international guidelines for the evaluation of probiotics, and to select potential probiotic strains for oral health. methods: the study included 67 salivary and subgingival lactobacilli of 10 species, isolated from healthy humans. all strains were identified using amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis, tested for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens, tolerance of low ph and bile content. thereafter, the lysozyme tolerance and antibiotic susceptibility of 22 potential probiotic strains were assessed. results: the majority of strains suppressed the growth of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and streptococcus mutans, but none inhibited candida albicans. the lowest ph tolerated by lactobacilli following 4 h of incubation was ph 2.5, but none of the strains grew at this ph. all strains tolerated a high concentration of lysozyme (10 mg/ml) and half of the strains tolerated a high concentration of human bile [5% volume/volume (v/v)]. four lactobacillus plantarum and two lactobacillus oris strains expressed resistance to tetracycline and/or doxycycline. conclusions: strains of l. plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus rhamnosus expressed both high antimicrobial activity and high tolerance of environmental stress. the absence of transferable antibiotic-resistance genes in l. plantarum strains remains to be confirmed. these results suggest a potential for oral lactobacilli to be used as probiotics for oral health.
susceptibility of oral bacteria to melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil in vitro.
the in vitro activity of melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil against 161 isolates of oral bacteria from 15 genera was determined. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) ranged from 0.003 to 2.0% (v/v). mic90 values were 1.0% (v/v) for actinomyces spp., lactobacillus spp., streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis, and 0.1% (v/v) for prevotella spp. isolates of porphyromonas, prevotella and veillonella had the lowest mics and mbcs, and isolates of streptococcus, fusobacterium and lactobacillus had the highest. time kill studies with streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus rhamnosus showed that treatment with > or = 0.5% tea tree oil caused decreases in viability of >3 log colony forming units/ml after only 30 s, and viable organisms were not detected after 5 min. these studies indicate that a range of oral bacteria are susceptible to tea tree oil, suggesting that tea tree oil may be of use in oral healthcare products and in the maintenance of oral hygiene.
