TI  == anaerostipes rhamnosivorans sp. nov., a human intestinal, butyrate-forming bacterium.
AB  == a novel butyrate-producing bacterium, strain 1y-2(t), was isolated from a stool sample of a 1-year-old, healthy dutch infant. the isolate was obtained by using lactate and acetate as sources of carbon and energy. the strain was gram-variable, strictly anaerobic and spore-forming and formed curly rod-shaped cells that fermented glucose into butyrate, lactate, formate and acetate as main  products. the dna g+c content of the strain was 44.5 mol% and its major cellular  fatty acids were c12:0, iso-c19:1 i and c16:0. strain 1y-2(t) was related to anaerostipes caccae dsm 14662(t) based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, with 3% divergence, but hybridization studies of their genomic dna revealed only 33% relatedness. moreover, strain 1y-2(t) showed marked physiological and biochemical differences from known species of the genus anaerostipes. based on phylogenetic,  chemotypic and phenotypic criteria, we propose that strain 1y-2(t) should be classified in the genus anaerostipes within a novel species, anaerostipes rhamnosivorans sp. nov. the type strain is 1y-2(t) ( = dsm 26241(t) = kctc 15316(t)).

TI  == anaerostipes hadrus comb. nov., a dominant species within the human colonic microbiota; reclassification of eubacterium hadrum moore et al. 1976.
AB  == recent molecular analyses suggest that bacteria related to strains ss2/1 and ssc/2, previously reported to be distantly related to anaerostipes caccae ncimb 13811(t), represent one of the ten most abundant phylotypes detected in adult human faecal samples. these two strains were isolated as d-lactate-utilizing bacteria from faecal samples of a healthy individual. we show here that they share >99.9% similarity in 16s rrna gene sequence with a new butyrate-producing isolate recovered from a colonic biopsy of a crohn's disease patient, and also with the sequence reported recently for eubacterium hadrum atcc 29173(t). biochemical profiling using api rapid id 32a and api zym test systems confirmed a close phenotypic similarity to e. hadrum atcc 29173(t), but also indicated that the description of this species should be expanded to include the ability to produce butyrate from d-lactate and acetate. phylogenetic analysis confirmed an affinity between e. hadrum and members of the genus anaerostipes (92.3-94.2% sequence similarity) belonging to the family lachnospiraceae (formerly clostridium cluster xiva). based on phylogenetic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic evidence it is proposed that e. hadrum be transferred to the genus anaerostipes with the name anaerostipes hadrus comb. nov. the type strain of a. hadrus comb. nov. is =atcc 29173(t) (=dsm 3319(t) = vp 82-52(t)).

TI  == lactate has the potential to promote hydrogen sulphide formation in the human colon.
AB  == high concentrations of sulphide are toxic for the gut epithelium and may contribute to bowel disease. lactate is a favoured cosubstrate for the sulphate-reducing colonic bacterium desulfovibrio piger, as shown here by the stimulation of sulphide formation by d. piger dsm749 by lactate in the presence of sulphate. sulphide formation by d. piger was also stimulated in cocultures with the lactate-producing bacterium bifidobacterium adolescentis l2-32. other lactate-utilizing bacteria such as the butyrate-producing species eubacterium hallii and anaerostipes caccae are, however, expected to be in competition with the sulphate-reducing bacteria (srb) for the lactate formed in the human colon. strains of e. hallii and a. caccae produced 65% and 96% less butyrate from lactate, respectively, in a coculture with d. piger dsm749 than in a pure culture. in triculture experiments involving b. adolescentis l2-32, up to 50% inhibition of butyrate formation by e. hallii and a. caccae was observed in the presence of d. piger dsm749. on the other hand, sulphide formation by d. piger was unaffected by e. hallii or a. caccae in these cocultures and tricultures. these experiments strongly suggest that lactate can stimulate sulphide formation  by srb present in the colon, with possible consequences for conditions such as colitis.

TI  == anaerostipes butyraticus sp. nov., an anaerobic, butyrate-producing bacterium from clostridium cluster xiva isolated from broiler chicken caecal content, and emended description of the genus anaerostipes.
AB  == four butyrate-producing isolates were obtained from the caecal content of a 4-week-old broiler chicken. the 16s rrna gene sequences were determined and confirmed the close relatedness of the four isolates, which suggested that they were derived from a single bacterial clone. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequences showed that its closest relatives were members of cluster xiva of the clostridium subphylum of gram-positive bacteria and that the closest  related type strain was anaerostipes caccae l1-92(t) (94.5 % similarity). similarity levels of 96-98 % with sequences from uncultured bacteria from human stool samples were observed. on the basis of morphological, biochemical and phylogenetic characteristics, this strain is assigned to a novel species in the genus anaerostipes, for which the name anaerostipes butyraticus sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is 35-7(t) (=lmg 24724(t) =dsm 22094(t)). an emended description of the genus anaerostipes is also provided.

TI  == in vitro kinetics of prebiotic inulin-type fructan fermentation by butyrate-producing colon bacteria: implementation of online gas chromatography for quantitative analysis of carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas production.
AB  == kinetic analyses of bacterial growth, carbohydrate consumption, and metabolite production of five butyrate-producing clostridial cluster xiva colon bacteria grown on acetate plus fructose, oligofructose, inulin, or lactate were performed. a gas chromatography method was set up to assess h2 and co2 production online and to ensure complete coverage of all metabolites produced. method accuracy was confirmed through the calculation of electron and carbon recoveries. fermentations with anaerostipes caccae dsm 14662(t), roseburia faecis dsm 16840(t), roseburia hominis dsm 16839(t), and roseburia intestinalis dsm 14610(t) revealed similar patterns of metabolite production with butyrate, co2, and h2 as  the main metabolites. r. faecis dsm 16840(t) and r. intestinalis dsm 14610(t) were able to degrade oligofructose, displaying a nonpreferential breakdown mechanism. lactate consumption was only observed with a. caccae dsm 14662(t). roseburia inulinivorans dsm 16841(t) was the only strain included in the present  study that was able to grow on fructose, oligofructose, and inulin. the metabolites produced were lactate, butyrate, and co2, without h2 production, indicating an energy metabolism distinct from that of other roseburia species. oligofructose degradation was nonpreferential. in a coculture of r. inulinivorans dsm 16841(t) with the highly competitive strain bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum lmg 11047 on inulin, hardly any production of butyrate and co2 was detected, indicating a lack of competitiveness of the butyrate producer. complete recovery of metabolites during fermentations of clostridial cluster xiva butyrate-producing colon bacteria allowed stoichiometric balancing of the metabolic pathway for butyrate production, including h2 formation.

TI  == isolation of lactate-utilizing butyrate-producing bacteria from human feces and in vivo administration of anaerostipes caccae strain l2 and galacto-oligosaccharides in a rat model.
AB  == lactate-utilizing butyrate-producers were isolated from human feces and identified based on the sequences of 16s rrna gene. anaerostipes caccae strain l2, one of the seven human fecal isolates, was administered to rats with galacto-oligosaccharides (gos) as bifidogenic carbohydrates for stimulating lactate formation in the hindgut. ingestion of gos alone increased concentrations of cecal lactate and butyrate compared with control rats (p<0.05). additional administration of strain l2 on gos tended to enhance the promoting effect of gos  on cecal butyrate formation (p=0.06) and lowered the mean value of cecal lactate  concentration (p=0.32). consequently, cecal and fecal butyrate concentrations in  rats administered with both strain l2 and gos were significantly higher than those in the control rats (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively). significant changes  were observed in the other fermentation acids, such as succinate, acetate, and propionate, depending on the ingestion of strain l2. administered strain l2 was retrieved from the cecal content of a rat based on randomly amplified polymorphic dna analysis. the results suggest that synbiotic ingestion of lactate-utilizing butyrate-producers and gos alters the microbial fermentation and promotes the formation of beneficial fermentation acids, including butyrate, in the gut.

TI  == cross-feeding between bifidobacterium longum bb536 and acetate-converting, butyrate-producing colon bacteria during growth on oligofructose.
AB  == in vitro coculture fermentations of bifidobacterium longum bb536 and two acetate-converting, butyrate-producing colon bacteria, anaerostipes caccae dsm 14662 and roseburia intestinalis dsm 14610, with oligofructose as the sole energy source, were performed to study interspecies interactions. two clearly distinct types of cross-feeding were identified. a. caccae dsm 14662 was not able to degrade oligofructose but could grow on the fructose released by b. longum bb536  during oligofructose breakdown. r. intestinalis dsm 14610 could degrade oligofructose, but only after acetate was added to the medium. detailed kinetic analyses of oligofructose breakdown by the last strain revealed simultaneous degradation of the different chain length fractions, in contrast with the preferential degradation of shorter fractions by b. longum bb536. in a coculture  of both strains, initial oligofructose degradation and acetate production by b. longum bb536 took place, which in turn also allowed oligofructose breakdown by r. intestinalis dsm 14610. these and similar cross-feeding mechanisms could play a role in the colon ecosystem and contribute to the combined bifidogenic/butyrogenic effect observed after addition of inulin-type fructans to the diet.

TI  == two routes of metabolic cross-feeding between bifidobacterium adolescentis and butyrate-producing anaerobes from the human gut.
AB  == dietary carbohydrates have the potential to influence diverse functional groups of bacteria within the human large intestine. of 12 bifidobacterium strains of human gut origin from seven species tested, four grew in pure culture on starch and nine on fructo-oligosaccharides. the potential for metabolic cross-feeding between bifidobacterium adolescentis and lactate-utilizing, butyrate-producing firmicute bacteria related to eubacterium hallii and anaerostipes caccae was investigated in vitro. e. hallii l2-7 and a. caccae l1-92 failed to grow on starch in pure culture, but in coculture with b. adolescentis l2-32 butyrate was  formed, indicating cross-feeding of metabolites to the lactate utilizers. studies with [(13)c]lactate confirmed carbon flow from lactate, via acetyl coenzyme a, to butyrate both in pure cultures of e. hallii and in cocultures with b. adolescentis. similar results were obtained in cocultures involving b. adolescentis dsm 20083 with fructo-oligosaccharides as the substrate. butyrate formation was also stimulated, however, in cocultures of b. adolescentis l2-32 grown on starch or fructo-oligosaccharides with roseburia sp. strain a2-183, which produces butyrate but does not utilize lactate. this is probably a consequence of the release by b. adolescentis of oligosaccharides that are available to roseburia sp. strain a2-183. we conclude that two distinct mechanisms of metabolic cross-feeding between b. adolescentis and butyrate-forming bacteria may operate in gut ecosystems, one due to consumption of fermentation end products (lactate and acetate) and the other due to cross-feeding of partial breakdown products from complex substrates.

TI  == lactate-utilizing bacteria, isolated from human feces, that produce butyrate as a major fermentation product.
AB  == the microbial community of the human colon contains many bacteria that produce lactic acid, but lactate is normally detected only at low concentrations (<5 mm)  in feces from healthy individuals. it is not clear, however, which bacteria are mainly responsible for lactate utilization in the human colon. here, bacteria able to utilize lactate and produce butyrate were identified among isolates obtained from 10(-8) dilutions of fecal samples from five different subjects. out of nine such strains identified, four were found to be related to eubacterium hallii and two to anaerostipes caccae, while the remaining three represent a new  species within clostridial cluster xiva based on their 16s rrna sequences. significant ability to utilize lactate was not detected in the butyrate-producing species roseburia intestinalis, eubacterium rectale, or faecalibacterium prausnitzii. whereas e. hallii and a. caccae strains used both d- and l-lactate,  the remaining strains used only the d form. addition of glucose to batch cultures prevented lactate utilization until the glucose became exhausted. however, when two e. hallii strains and one a. caccae strain were grown in separate cocultures  with a starch-utilizing bifidobacterium adolescentis isolate, with starch as the  carbohydrate energy source, the l-lactate produced by b. adolescentis became undetectable and butyrate was formed. such cross-feeding may help to explain the  reported butyrogenic effect of certain dietary substrates, including resistant starch. the abundance of e. hallii in particular in the colonic ecosystem suggests that these bacteria play important roles in preventing lactate accumulation.

TI  == anaerostipes caccae gen. nov., sp. nov., a new saccharolytic, acetate-utilising,  butyrate-producing bacterium from human faeces.
AB  == two strains of a previously undescribed eubacterium-like bacterium were isolated  from human faeces. the strains are gram-variable, obligately anaerobic, catalase  negative, asporogenous rod-shaped cells which produced acetate, butyrate and lactate as the end products of glucose metabolism. the two isolates displayed 99.9% 16s rrna gene sequence similarity to each other and treeing analysis demonstrated the faecal isolates are far removed from eubacterium sensu stricto and that they represent a new subline within the clostridium coccoides group of organisms. based on phenotypic and phylogenetic criteria, it is proposed that the two strains from faeces be classified as a new genus and species, anaerostipes caccae. the type strain of anaerostipes caccae is ncimb 13811t (= dsm 14662t).
