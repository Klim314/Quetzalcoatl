TI  == vang element insertions within a conserved chromosomal site conferring vancomycin resistance to streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus anginosus.
AB  == three vancomycin-resistant streptococcal strains carrying vang elements (two invasive streptococcus agalactiae isolates [gbs-ny and gbs-nm, both serotype ii and multilocus sequence type 22] and one streptococcus anginosus [sa]) were examined. the 45,585-bp elements found within sa and gbs-ny were nearly identical (together designated vang-1) and shared near-identity over an ~15-kb overlap with a previously described vang element from enterococcus faecalis. unexpectedly, vang-1 shared much less homology with the 49,321-bp vang-2 element from gbs-nm, with widely different levels (50% to 99%) of sequence identity shared among 44 related open reading frames. immediately adjacent to both vang-1 and vang-2 were  44,670-bp and 44,680-bp integrative conjugative element (ice)-like sequences, designated ice-r, that were nearly identical in the two group b streptococcal (gbs) strains. the dual vang and ice-r elements from both gbs strains were inserted at the same position, between bases 1328 and 1329, within the identical  rna methyltransferase (ruma) genes. a genbank search revealed that although most  gbs strains contained insertions within this specific site, only sequence type 22 (st22) gbs strains contained highly related ice-r derivatives. the vang-1 element in sa was also inserted within this position corresponding to its ruma homolog adjacent to an ice-r derivative. vang-1 insertions were previously reported within the same relative position in the e. faecalis ruma homolog. an ice-r sequence perfectly conserved with respect to its counterpart in gbs-ny was apparent within the same site of the ruma homolog of a streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis strain. additionally, homologous vang-like elements within the conserved ruma target site were evident in roseburia intestinalis. importance: these three streptococcal strains represent the first known vancomycin-resistant  strains of their species. the collective observations made from these strains reveal a specific hot spot for insertional elements that is conserved between streptococci and different gram-positive species. the two gbs strains potentially represent a gbs lineage that is predisposed to insertion of vang elements.
