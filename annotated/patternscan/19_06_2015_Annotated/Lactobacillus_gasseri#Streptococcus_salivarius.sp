TI  == comparison of the gut microbiota profile in breast-fed and formula-fed korean infants using pyrosequencing.
AB  == background/objectives: feeding in infancy is the most significant determinant of  the intestinal microbiota in early life. the aim of this study was to determine the gut microbiota of korean infants and compare the microbiota obtained between  breast-fed and formula-fed korean infants. subjects/methods: we analyzed the microbial communities in fecal samples collected from twenty 4-week old korean (ten samples in each breast-fed or formula-fed) infants using pyrosequencing. results: the fecal microbiota of the 4-week-old korean infants consisted of the three phyla actinobacteria, firmicutes, and proteobacteria. in addition, five species, including bifidocbacterium longum, streptococcus salivarius, strepotococcus lactarius, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and lactobacillus gasseri were common commensal intestinal microbiota in all infants. the predominant intestinal microbiota in the breast-fed infants (bfi) included the phylum actinobacteria (average 70.55%), family bifidobacteriacea (70.12%), genus  bifidobacterium (70.03%) and species bifidobacterium longum (69.96%). in the microbiota from the formula-fed infants (ffi), the proportion of the phylum actinobacteria (40.68%) was less, whereas the proportions of firmicutes (45.38%)  and proteobacteria (13.85%) as well as the diversity of each taxonomic level were greater, compared to those of the bfi. the probiotic species found in the 4-week-old korean infants were bifidobacterium longum, streptococcus salivarius,  and lactobacillus gasseri. these probiotic species accounted for 93.81% of the microbiota from the bfi, while only 63.80% of the microbiota from the ffi. in particular, b. longum was more abundant in bfi (69.96%) than in ffi (34.17%). conclusions: breast milk supports the growth of b. longum and inhibits others. to the best of our knowledge, this study was the first attempt to analyze the gut microbiota of healthy korean infants according to the feeding type using pyrosequencing. our data can be used as a basis for further studies to investigate the development of intestinal microbiota with aging and disease status.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo effects of beneficial vaginal lactobacilli on pathogens responsible for urogenital tract infections.
AB  == the aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of beneficial human vaginal lactobacilli (lb) on urogenital pathogens through in vitro and in vivo experiments. co-aggregative and antimicrobial properties between five vaginal lb  strains and urogenital pathogens or potential pathogens (streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans strains) were assayed. also, associative cultures of lb strains and s. agalactiae were performed and bacterial growth, ph, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) were determined at different times. based on the results obtained, the in vivo studies were assayed  in mice with lactobacillus gasseri crl 1509 or lactobacillus salivarius crl 1328  inoculated intravaginally (i.v.) and then challenged i.v. with s. agalactiae. results were analysed by anova (repeated measures and general linear models). most of the lb strains increased the percentage of aggregation of s. agalactiae strains. only one strain (lactobacillus reuteri crl 1324) positively affected the aggregation of s. aureus and none increased the aggregation of c. albicans. the inhibition of the growth of s. agalactiae strains by production of organic acids  by lactobacilli was evidenced. the lb-s. agalactiae co-cultures showed a significant inhibition of the pathogen after 4 h and 8 h of incubation. parallel  increases in lactic acid and h2o2 levels were observed. however, in the experimental murine model, no significant differences were obtained in the number of streptococci recovered from the vaginal tract of control mice and those inoculated with lb. in conclusion, vaginal lb exhibited in vitro co-aggregative and antimicrobial effects on s. agalactiae strains, suggesting that they could be promising candidates for protection against s. agalactiae challenge. however, as  these effects were not evidenced in the murine model used, further animal studies under different experimental conditions should be conducted to evaluate the preventive effect of lb against challenge with s. agalactiae.

TI  == body fluid identification by integrated analysis of dna methylation and body fluid-specific microbial dna.
AB  == identification of body fluids found at crime scenes provides important information that can support a link between sample donors and actual criminal acts. previous studies have reported that dna methylation analysis at several tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (tdmrs) enables successful identification of semen, and the detection of certain bacterial dna can allow for identification of saliva and vaginal fluid. in the present study, a method for detecting bacterial dna was integrated into a previously reported multiplex methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme-polymerase chain reaction. the developed multiplex pcr was modified by the addition of a new semen-specific marker and by  including amplicons for the 16s ribosomal rna gene of saliva- and vaginal fluid-specific bacteria to improve the efficacy to detect a specific type of body fluid. using the developed multiplex system, semen was distinguishable by unmethylation at the usp49, dact1, and pfn3 tdmrs and by hypermethylation at l81528, and saliva could be identified by detection of saliva-specific bacteria,  veillonella atypica and/or streptococcus salivarius. additionally, vaginal fluid  and menstrual blood were differentiated from other body fluids by hypomethylation at the pfn3 tdmr and the presence of vaginal fluid-specific bacteria, lactobacillus crispatus and/or lactobacillus gasseri. because the developed multiplex system uses the same biological source of dna for individual identification profiling and simultaneously analyses various types of body fluid  in one pcr reaction, this method will facilitate more efficient body fluid identification in forensic casework.

TI  == bacteriocin production, antibiotic susceptibility and prevalence of haemolytic and gelatinase activity in faecal lactic acid bacteria isolated from healthy ethiopian infants.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterise lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from faecal samples of healthy ethiopian infants, with emphasis on bacteriocin production and antibiotic susceptibility. one hundred fifty lab were  obtained from 28 healthy ethiopian infants. the isolates belonged to lactobacillus (81/150), enterococcus (54/150) and streptococcus (15/150) genera.  lactobacillus species were more abundant in the breast-fed infants while enterococcus dominated the mixed-fed population. bacteriocin-producing lab species were isolated from eight of the infants. many different bacteriocins were identified, including one new bacteriocin from streptococcus salivarius, avicin a (class iia) from enterococcus avium, one class iia bacteriocin from enterococcus  faecalis strains, one unknown bacteriocin from e. faecalis and two unknown bacteriocins from lactobacillus fermentum strains and the two-peptide gassericin  t from lactobacillus gasseri isolate. susceptibility tests performed for nine antibiotics suggest that some lactobacilli might have acquired resistance to erythromycin (3 %) and tetracycline (4 %) only. the streptococci were generally antibiotic sensitive except for penicillin, to which they showed intermediate resistance. all enterococci were susceptible to ampicillin while 13 % showed penicillin resistance. only one e. faecalis isolate was vancomycin-resistant. tetracycline (51 %) and erythromycin (26 %) resistance was prevalent among the enterococci, but multidrug resistance was confined to e. faecalis (47 %) and enterococcus faecium (33 %). screening of enterococcal virulence traits revealed  that 2 % were beta-haemolytic. the structural genes of cytolysin were detected in 28 % of the isolates in five enterococcal species, the majority being e. faecalis and enterococcus raffinosus. this study shows that bacteriocin production and antibiotic resistance is a common trait of faecal lab of ethiopian infants while  virulence factors occur at low levels.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects,  using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus),  gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to  growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.

TI  == inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against oral pathogens.
AB  == aims: to determine the inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against putative oral pathogens. methods and results: total 357 strains comprising 10 species of oral lactobacillus, lactobacillus fermentum (195), lactobacillus salivarius (53), lactobacillus casei (20), lactobacillus gasseri (18), lactobacillus rhamnosus (14), lactobacillus paracasei (12), lactobacillus mucosae (12), lactobacillus oris (12), lactobacillus plantarum (11) and lactobacillus vaginalis (10) were used as producer strains. inhibitory effect against a panel of indicators, periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens, was assessed. most oral lactobacillus was able to inhibit the growth of both periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens. the strongest inhibitory activity was associated with lact. paracasei, lact. plantarum, lact. rhamnosus, lact. casei and lact. salivarius. lactobacillus sd1-sd6, representing the six species with the strong inhibitory effect, inhibited growth of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 in the biofilm model. also, it was demonstrated that growth of strep. mutans was inhibited in a mixture with lact. paracasei sd1. the inhibition was enhanced in acidic condition and 5% glucose. conclusions: the results have shown that oral lactobacillus sd1-sd6 showed a strong inhibitory effect against strep. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, as well as, gram-negative periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. significance  and impact of the study: the results indicated that lactobacillus may be of benefit as probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies  levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus  pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  == samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. yeasts (20.1%), streptococcus spp. (8.7%), staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. the lactobacillus isolates were l. brevis (24.6%) l. fermentum (18.5%) l. casei (16.9%), l. delbrueckii (15.4%), l. plantarum (9.23%), l. acidophilus (7.69%), l. jensenii (4.62%), l. salivarius (1.54%) and l. gasseri (1.54%). the most common species was l. brevis (24.6%). the strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. all the lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, s. sonnei, klebsiella spp. and campylobacter sp. all the lactobacilli except l. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. the involvement of lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. the ability of lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.
