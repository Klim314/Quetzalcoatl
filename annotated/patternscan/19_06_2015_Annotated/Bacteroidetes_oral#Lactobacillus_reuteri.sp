TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == clinical and microbiological effects of lactobacillus reuteri probiotics in the treatment of chronic periodontitis: a randomized placebo-controlled study.
AB  == aim: the aim of this randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the effects of lactobacillus reuteri-containing probiotic lozenges as an adjunct  to scaling and root planing (srp). material and methods: thirty chronic periodontitis patients were recruited and monitored clinically and microbiologically at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks after therapy. all patients received one-stage full-mouth disinfection and randomly assigned over a test (srp + probiotic, n = 15) or control (srp + placebo, n = 15) group. the lozenges were  used two times a day for 12 weeks. results: at week 12, all clinical parameters were significantly reduced in both groups, while there was significantly more pocket depth reduction (p < 0.05) and attachment gain (p < 0.05) in moderate and  deep pockets; more porphyromonas gingivalis reduction was observed in the srp + probiotic group. conclusions: the results indicate that oral administration of l. reuteri lozenges could be a useful adjunct to srp in chronic periodontitis.

TI  == faecal d/l lactate ratio is a metabolic signature of microbiota imbalance in patients with short bowel syndrome.
AB  == our objective was to understand the functional link between the composition of faecal microbiota and the clinical characteristics of adults with short bowel syndrome (sbs). sixteen patients suffering from type ii sbs were included in the  study. they displayed a total oral intake of 2661+/-1005 kcal/day with superior sugar absorption (83+/-12%) than protein (42+/-13%) or fat (39+/-26%). these patients displayed a marked dysbiosis in faecal microbiota, with a predominance of lactobacillus/leuconostoc group, while clostridium and bacteroides were under-represented. each patient exhibited a diverse lactic acid bacteria composition (l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. mucosae), displaying specific d and l-lactate production profiles in vitro. of 16 patients, 9/16 (56%) accumulated lactates in  their faecal samples, from 2 to 110 mm of d-lactate and from 2 to 80 mm of l-lactate. the presence of lactates in faeces (56% patients) was used to define the lactate-accumulator group (la), while absence of faecal lactates (44% patients) defines the non lactate-accumulator group (nla). the la group had a lower plasma hco3(-) concentration (17.1+/-2.8 mm) than the nla group (22.8+/-4.6 mm), indicating that la and nla groups are clinically relevant sub-types. two patients, belonging to the la group and who particularly accumulated faecal d-lactate, were at risk of d-encephalopathic reactions. furthermore, all patients of the nla group and those accumulating preferentially l isoform in the la group  had never developed d-acidosis. the d/l faecal lactate ratio seems to be the most relevant index for a higher d-encephalopathy risk, rather than d- and l-lactate faecal concentrations per se. testing criteria that take into account hco3(-) value, total faecal lactate and the faecal d/l lactate ratio may become useful tools for identifying sbs patients at risk for d-encephalopathy.

TI  == probiotic effects of orally administered lactobacillus reuteri-containing tablets on the subgingival and salivary microbiota in patients with gingivitis. a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objective: to investigate the effects of an orally administered probiotic on the  oral microbiota. methods: a placebo-controlled, parallel study was conducted in 40 gingivitis subjects during 8 weeks. treatment consisted on the administration  of a daily tablet, either containing lactobacillus reuteri or placebo. unstimulated saliva and subgingival samples were collected and analysed by culture and pcr. clinical and microbiological outcome variables were compared between and within groups. results: there were no significant changes between and within the groups in the clinical variables. in saliva, total anaerobic counts after 4 weeks (p = 0.021) and counts of prevotella intermedia after 8 weeks (p =  0.030), showed reductions in the test group. in subgingival samples, significant  reductions in the changes baseline to 4 weeks were observed for p. gingivalis counts (p = 0.008). with pcr, l. reuteri atcc-pta-5289 was more frequently detected than l. reuteri dsm-17938. conclusions: the effect of l. reuteri administered in tablets resulted in a reduction in the number of selected periodontal pathogens in the subgingival microbiota, without an associated clinical impact.

TI  == inhibitory effect of lactobacillus reuteri on periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == the interaction between lactobacillus reuteri, a probiotic bacterium, and oral pathogenic bacteria have not been studied adequately. this study examined the effects of l. reuteri on the proliferation of periodontopathic bacteria including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia, and on the formation of streptococcus mutans biofilms. human-derived l. reuteri strains (kctc 3594 and kctc 3678) and rat-derived l. reuteri kctc 3679 were used. all strains exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the growth of periodontopathic bacteria and the formation of s. mutans biofilms. these antibacterial activities of l. reuteri were attributed to the production of organic acids, hydrogen peroxide, and a bacteriocin-like compound. reuterin, an antimicrobial factor, was produced only by l. reuteri kctc 3594. in addition, l. reuteri inhibited the production of methyl mercaptan by f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. overall, these results suggest that l. reuteri may be useful as a probiotic agent for improving oral health.

TI  == an imbalance in mucosal cytokine profile causes transient intestinal inflammation following an animal's first exposure to faecal bacteria and antigens.
AB  == intestinal microflora play a critical role in the initiation and perpetuation of  chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. in genetically susceptible hosts, bacterial  colonization results in rapid-onset chronic intestinal inflammation. nevertheless, the intestinal and systemic immune response to faecal bacteria and  antigen exposure into a sterile intestinal lumen of a post-weaned animal with a mature immune system are not understood clearly. this study examined the effects  of faecal bacteria and antigen exposure on the intestinal mucosal and systemic immune system in healthy axenic mice. axenic wild-type mice were inoculated orally with a crude faecal slurry solution derived from conventionally raised mice and were analysed prior to and then at days 3, 7, 14 and 28 post-treatment.  ingestion of faecal slurry resulted in a transient, early onset of proinflammatory interferon (ifn)-gamma, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha and interleukin (il)-17 response that was maximal at day 3. in contrast, the transient release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines il-10 and il-4 occurred later and was maximal at day 7. both responses subsided by day 14. this early cytokine imbalance was associated with a brief rise in colonic and caecal histopathological injury score at day 7. the bacterial antigen-specific systemic  response was found to follow the intestinal immune response with a maximal release of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines at day 7. thus, first exposure of healthy axenic wild-type mice to normal faecal flora and antigens results in an early proinflammatory cytokine response and transient colonic inflammation that then resolves in conjunction with a subsequent anti-inflammatory cytokine profile.
