TI  == characterizing a model human gut microbiota composed of members of its two dominant bacterial phyla.
AB  == the adult human distal gut microbial community is typically dominated by 2 bacterial phyla (divisions), the firmicutes and the bacteroidetes. little is known about the factors that govern the interactions between their members. here, we examine the niches of representatives of both phyla in vivo. finished genome sequences were generated from eubacterium rectale and e. eligens, which belong to clostridium cluster xiva, one of the most common gut firmicute clades. comparison of these and 25 other gut firmicutes and bacteroidetes indicated that the firmicutes possess smaller genomes and a disproportionately smaller number of glycan-degrading enzymes. germ-free mice were then colonized with e. rectale and/or a prominent human gut bacteroidetes, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, followed by whole-genome transcriptional profiling, high-resolution proteomic analysis, and biochemical assays of microbial-microbial and microbial-host interactions. b. thetaiotaomicron adapts to e. rectale by up-regulating expression of a variety of polysaccharide utilization loci encoding numerous glycoside hydrolases, and by signaling the host to produce mucosal glycans that it, but not e. rectale, can access. e. rectale adapts to b. thetaiotaomicron by decreasing production of its glycan-degrading enzymes, increasing expression of selected amino acid and sugar transporters, and facilitating glycolysis by reducing levels of nadh, in part via generation of butyrate from acetate, which in turn is used by the gut epithelium. this simplified model of the human gut microbiota illustrates niche specialization and functional redundancy within members of its major bacterial phyla, and the importance of host glycans as a nutrient foundation that ensures ecosystem stability.

TI  == rapid detection of human fecal eubacterium species and related genera by nested pcr method.
AB  == pcr procedures based on 16s rdna gene sequence specific for seven eubacterium spp. and eggerthella lenta that predominate in the human intestinal tract were developed, and used for direct detection of these species in seven human feces samples. three species of eggerthella lenta, eubacterium rectale, and eubacterium eligens were detected from seven fecal samples. eubacterium biforme was detected  from six samples. it was reported that e. rectale, e. eligens, and e. biforme were difficult to detect by traditional culture method, but the nested pcr method is available for the detection of these species. this result shows that the nested pcr method utilizing a universal primer pair, followed by amplification with species-specific primers, would allow rapid detection of eubacterium species in human feces.
