TI  == purification and properties of nadp-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase from ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1.
AB  == glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) (l-glutamate:nadp+ oxidoreductase, deaminating, ec  1.4.1.4) from the cellulolytic ruminal bacterium ruminococcus flavefaciens has been purified and characterized. the native enzyme and subunit are 280 and 48 kda, respectively, suggesting that the native enzyme is a hexamer. the enzyme requires 0.5 m kcl for optimal activity and has a ph optimum of 6.9 to 7.0. the kms for ammonia, alpha-ketoglutarate, and glutamate are 19, 0.41, and 62 mm, respectively. the sigmoidal nadph saturation curve revealed positive cooperativity for the binding of this coenzyme. the first residue in the n-terminal amino acid sequence from r. flavefaciens gdh was alanine, suggesting that the protein may be modified posttranslationally. comparison of the n-terminal sequence with those of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and clostridium symbiosum revealed only 39% amino acid homologies. the gdh from r. flavefaciens was unique in that its specific activity was highest during ammonia-limited growth but was not affected by ammonia shock treatment (20 mm).
