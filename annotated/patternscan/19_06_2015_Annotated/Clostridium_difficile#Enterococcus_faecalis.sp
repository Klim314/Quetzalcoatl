TI  == mutations associated with reduced surotomycin susceptibility in clostridium difficile and enterococcus species.
AB  == clostridium difficile infection (cdi) is an urgent public health concern causing  considerable clinical and economic burdens. cdi can be treated with antibiotics,  but recurrence of the disease following successful treatment of the initial episode often occurs. surotomycin is a rapidly bactericidal cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic that is in clinical trials for cdi treatment and that has demonstrated superiority over vancomycin in preventing cdi relapse. surotomycin is a structural analogue of the membrane-active antibiotic daptomycin. previously, we  utilized in vitro serial passage experiments to derive c. difficile strains with  reduced surotomycin susceptibilities. the parent strains used included atcc 700057 and clinical isolates from the restriction endonuclease analysis (rea) groups bi and k. serial passage experiments were also performed with vancomycin-resistant and vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis. the goal of this study is to identify mutations associated with reduced surotomycin susceptibility in c. difficile and enterococci. illumina sequence data generated for the parent strains and serial passage isolates were compared. we identified nonsynonymous mutations in genes coding for cardiolipin synthase in c. difficile atcc 700057, enoyl-(acyl carrier protein) reductase ii (fabk) and cell division protein ftsh2 in c. difficile rea type bi, and a padr family transcriptional regulator in c. difficile rea type k. among the 4 enterococcal strain pairs, 20 mutations were identified, and those mutations overlap those associated with daptomycin resistance. these data give insight into the mechanism of action of surotomycin against c. difficile, possible mechanisms  for resistance emergence during clinical use, and the potential impacts of surotomycin therapy on intestinal enterococci.

TI  == an alkaline phosphatase reporter for use in clostridium difficile.
AB  == clostridium difficile is an anaerobic, gram-positive pathogen that causes severe  gastrointestinal disease in humans and other mammals. c. difficile is notoriously difficult to work with and, until recently, few tools were available for genetic  manipulation and molecular analyses. despite the recent advances in the field, there is no simple or cost-effective technique for measuring gene transcription in c. difficile other than direct transcriptional analyses (e.g., quantitative real-time pcr and rna-seq), which are time-consuming, expensive and difficult to  scale-up. we describe the development of an in vivo reporter assay that can provide qualitative and quantitative measurements of c. difficile gene expression. using the enterococcus faecalis alkaline phosphatase gene, phoz, we measured expression of c. difficile genes using a colorimetric alkaline phosphatase assay. we show that inducible alkaline phosphatase activity correlates directly with native gene expression. the ability to analyze gene expression using a standard reporter is an important and critically needed tool to study gene regulation and design genetic screens for c. difficile and other anaerobic clostridia.

TI  == new role for human alpha-defensin 5 in the fight against hypervirulent clostridium difficile strains.
AB  == clostridium difficile infection (cdi), one of the most common hospital-acquired infections, is increasing in incidence and severity with the emergence and diffusion of hypervirulent strains. cdi is precipitated by antibiotic treatment that destroys the equilibrium of the gut microbiota. human alpha-defensin 5 (hd5), the most abundant enteric antimicrobial peptide, is a key regulator of gut microbiota homeostasis, yet it is still unknown if c. difficile, which successfully evades killing by other host microbicidal peptides, is susceptible to hd5. we evaluated, by means of viability assay, fluorescence-activated cell sorter (facs) analysis, and electron microscopy, the antimicrobial activities of  alpha-defensins 1 and 5 against a panel of c. difficile strains encompassing the  most prevalent epidemic and hypervirulent pcr ribotypes in europe (012, 014/020,  106, 018, 027, and 078). here we show that (i) concentrations of hd5 within the intestinal physiological range produced massive c. difficile cell killing; (ii) hd5 bactericidal activity was mediated by membrane depolarization and bacterial fragmentation with a pattern of damage peculiar to c. difficile bacilli, compared to commensals like escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis; and (iii) unexpectedly, hypervirulent ribotypes were among the most susceptible to both defensins. these results support the notion that hd5, naturally present at very high concentrations in the mucosa of the small intestine, could indeed control the very early steps of cdi by killing c. difficile bacilli at their germination  site. as a consequence, hd5 can be regarded as a good candidate for the containment of hypervirulent c. difficile strains, and it could be exploited in the therapy of cdi and relapsing c. difficile-associated disease.

TI  == inter- and intraspecies transfer of a clostridium difficile conjugative transposon conferring resistance to mlsb.
AB  == resistance to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b group of antibiotics in clostridium difficile is generally due to erm(b) genes. tn6194, a conjugative transposon initially detected in pcr-ribotype 027 isolates, is an erm(b)-containing element also detected in other relevant c. difficile pcr-ribotypes. in this study, the genome of a c. difficile pcr-ribotype 001 strain was sequenced, and an element with two nucleotidic changes compared to tn6194 was detected. this element was transferred by filter mating assays to recipient strains of c. difficile belonging to pcr-ribotype 009 and 027 and to a  recipient strain of enterococcus faecalis. transconjugants were characterized by  southern blotting and genome sequencing, and integration sites in all transconjugants were identified. the element integrated the genome of c. difficile at different sites and the genome of e. faecalis at a unique site. this study is the first molecular characterization of an erm(b)-containing conjugative transposon in c. difficile and provides additional evidence of the antibiotic resistance transmission risk among pathogenic bacteria occupying the same human intestinal niche.

TI  == surotomycin demonstrates low in vitro frequency of resistance and rapid bactericidal activity in clostridium difficile, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium.
AB  == surotomycin (cb-183,315) is an orally administered, minimally absorbed, selective bactericidal cyclic lipopeptide in phase 3 development for the treatment of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. the aim of this study was to evaluate  the emergence of resistance in c. difficile (atcc 700057 and three recent clinical isolates from the restriction endonuclease analysis groups bi, bk, and k), vancomycin-susceptible (vs) enterococcus faecalis (atcc 49452), vancomycin-resistant (vr) e. faecalis (atcc 700802), vs enterococcus faecium (atcc 6569), and vr e. faecium (atcc 51559) under anaerobic conditions. the rate  of spontaneous resistance was below the limit of detection (<10(-8) to <10(-9)) for surotomycin at 16 and 32x the mic for all isolates tested. under selective pressure by serial passage, c. difficile grew in a maximum of 4 mug/ml surotomycin (final mics of 2 to 8 mug/ml [4- to 16-fold higher than those of the  naive control]) at day 15, with the exception of the c. difficile bk strain, which grew in 16 to 32 mug/ml (final mics of 8 to 32 mug/ml [16- to 64-fold higher than those of the naive control]). enterococci remained relatively unchanged over 15 days, growing in a maximum of 8 mug/ml surotomycin (final mics  of 2 to 16 mug/ml [8- to 64-fold higher than those of the naive control]). of the isolates tested, no cross-resistance to vancomycin, rifampin, ampicillin, metronidazole, or moxifloxacin was observed. surotomycin at 20x mic demonstrated  equally rapid bactericidal activity (>/= 3-log-unit reduction in cfu/ml in </= 8  h) against naive and reduced-susceptibility isolates of c. difficile, vs enterococcus (vse), and vr enterococcus (vre), except for c. difficile bk (2.6-log-unit reductions for both). these results suggest that emergence of resistance to surotomycin against c. difficile, e. faecalis, and e. faecium is likely to be rare.

TI  == essential oil composition and antimicrobial activity of angelica archangelica l.  (apiaceae) roots.
AB  == in this paper, the chemical composition and the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of angelica archangelica l. (apiaceae) roots from central italy were analyzed. the major constituents of the oil were alpha-pinene (21.3%), delta-3-carene (16.5%), limonene (16.4%) and alpha-phellandrene (8.7%). the oil shows a good antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, eubacterium limosum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and candida albicans with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of 0.25, 0.25, 0.13, 0.25, 2.25, and 0.50% v/v, respectively. a weaker antimicrobial activity against bifidobacteria and lactobacilli-very useful in the intestinal microflora-has also been shown with mic values >4.0% v/v.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == one-day point prevalence of emerging bacterial pathogens in a nationwide sample of 62 german hospitals in 2012 and comparison with the results of the one-day point prevalence of 2010.
AB  == background: antibiotic resistance of bacterial pathogens is an emerging problem worldwide. to combat multidrug resistant organisms (mrdos) networks of care providers have been established in all states in germany. the hicare-network, a project to combat mrdos, founded by the federal ministry of education and research, has published data from 2010 of a voluntary, german-wide, multicenter point-prevalence survey in 2011 conducted in collaboration with the german society of hospital hygiene. the aim of the present survey was the re-evaluation  of the situation in 2012. method: the survey was conducted as a voluntary, anonymous, point-prevalence in may 2012 using routine data of microbiological diagnostics of the hospitals. as in the former survey of 2010 it was differentiated between primary, secondary and tertiary care hospitals and only data from intensive care units, surgical and medical wards were collected. based  on the survey form used in 2010, an updated version was used including more pathogens and corrected issues observed in the former survey. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (total as well as separated in hospital-acquired (ha), community-acquired (ca) and lifestock-associated (la) mrsa), vancomycin resistant staphylococcus aureus (vrsa/grsa), vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecalis resp. enterococcus faecium (vr-e. faecalis resp.  vr-e. faecium), extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-building (esbl) e. coli (esbl-ec) and klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl-kp), multiresistant acinetobacter spp.  (mab), multiresistant pseudomonas spp. (mrp), carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cre) as well as clostridium difficile (cd) infections and severe infections requiring icu-treatment were included in the survey along with  additional data on screening strategy, the equipment with infection control staff and possible confounders. results: out of 1,550 hospitals asked to participate, 62 returned data (4%). data from 56 hospitals including primary (26), secondary (20) and tertiary (10) care hospitals were analyzable (3.6%). the most frequently reported organisms were mrsa 1.53% [ci95: 1.32-1.75], followed by cdad 1.30% [ci95: 1.11-1.50], esbl-ec 0.97% [ci95: 0.80-1.14], and esbl-kp 0.27% [ci95: 0.18-0.36], regardless of the level of care. prevalence of mrdos depended on the  level of care and on the type of ward, as expected. overall prevalence was highest on intensive care wards, and prevalences were remarkably high on medical  wards compared to surgical wards. all tertiary care providers employed their own  infection control nurse, while only ~70% of the secondary and primary care hospitals did. surprisingly, in two of the ten participating tertiary care providers neither an internal nor an external infection control doctor was available. discussion: with more than 13,000 patients in 56 hospitals distributed all over germany, the survey included more than three times as many patients as the first survey and therefore not only adds valuable information about the epidemiology of emerging nosocomial pathogens, but also helps to raise awareness  of the problem of antibacterial resistance in germany. the prevalences reported seem to be comparable to the results of the former survey and of other surveys published. some hospitals reported to have no infection control personnel available at all. this statement is in line with another survey published in this issue.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == the functional vangcd cluster of clostridium difficile does not confer vancomycin resistance.
AB  == vangcd, a cryptic gene cluster highly homologous to the vang gene cluster of enterococcus faecalis is largely spread in clostridium difficile. since emergence of vancomycin resistance would have dramatic clinical consequences, we have evaluated the capacity of the vangcd cluster to confer resistance. we showed that expression of vangcd is inducible by vancomycin and that vangcd , vanxycd and vantcd are functional, exhibiting d-ala : d-ser ligase, d,d-dipeptidase and d-ser racemase activities respectively. in other bacteria, these enzymes are sufficient to promote vancomycin resistance. trans-complementation of c. difficile with the  vanc resistance operon of enterococcus gallinarum faintly impacted the mic of vancomycin, but did not promote vancomycin resistance in c. difficile. sublethal  concentration of vancomycin led to production of udp-murnac-pentapeptide[d-ser],  suggesting that the vangcd gene cluster is able to modify the peptidoglycan precursors. our results indicated amidation of udp-murnac-tetrapeptide, udp-murnac-pentapeptide[d-ala] and udp-murnac-pentapeptide[d-ser]. this modification is passed on the mature peptidoglycan where a muropeptide tetra-tetra is amidated on the meso-diaminopimelic acid. taken together, our results suggest that the vangcd gene cluster is functional and is prevented from  promoting vancomycin resistance in c. difficile.

TI  == the agr locus regulates virulence and colonization genes in clostridium difficile 027.
AB  == the transcriptional regulator agra, a member of the lyttr family of proteins, plays a key role in controlling gene expression in some gram-positive pathogens,  including staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. agra is encoded by the agracdb global regulatory locus, and orthologues are found within the genome of most clostridium difficile isolates, including the epidemic lineage 027/bi/nap1.  comparative rna sequencing of the wild type and otherwise isogenic agra null mutant derivatives of c. difficile r20291 revealed a network of approximately 75  differentially regulated transcripts at late exponential growth phase, including  many genes associated with flagellar assembly and function, such as the major structural subunit, flic. other differentially regulated genes include several involved in bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric gmp (c-di-gmp) synthesis and toxin a expression. c. difficile 027 r20291 agra mutant derivatives were poorly flagellated and exhibited reduced levels of colonization and relapses in the murine infection model. thus, the agr locus likely plays a contributory role in the fitness and virulence potential of c. difficile strains in the 027/bi/nap1 lineage.

AB  == the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils obtained from the flowering aerial parts and ripe fruits of echinophora spinosa l. (apiaceae) from central italy were analyzed by gc/ms. the major constituents of the oil from the aerial parts were beta-phellandrene (34.7%), myristicin (16.5%), delta3-carene (12.6%), alpha-pinene (6.7%) and alpha-phellandrene (6.2%), and of the oil from the ripe fruits p-cymene (50.2%), myristicin (15.3%), alpha-pinene (15.1%) and alpha-phellandrene (8.1%). the two oils showed good antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, eubacterium limosum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and candida albicans with mic values respectively of 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 2.25, and 0.50%, v/v, and 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 2.25, 0.50%, v/v, for aerial parts and ripe fruits respectively. a less significant antimicrobial activity against bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, very important in the intestinal microflora, was also detected, with mic values higher than 4.0%, v/v.

TI  == interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing practices for hospital inpatients.
AB  == background: the first publication of this review in issue 3, 2005 included studies up to november 2003. this update adds studies to december 2006 and focuses on application of a new method for meta-analysis of interrupted time series studies and application of new cochrane effective practice and organisation of care (epoc) risk of bias criteria to all studies in the review, including those studies in the previously published version. the aim of the review is to evaluate the impact of interventions from the perspective of antibiotic stewardship. the two objectives of antibiotic stewardship are first to ensure effective treatment for patients with bacterial infection and second support professionals and patients to reduce unnecessary use and minimize collateral damage. objectives: to estimate the effectiveness of professional interventions that, alone or in combination, are effective in antibiotic stewardship for hospital inpatients, to evaluate the impact of these interventions on reducing the incidence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens or clostridium difficile infection and their impact on clinical outcome. search methods: we searched the cochrane central register of controlled trials (central), medline, embase from 1980 to december 2006 and the epoc specialized register in july 2007 and february 2009 and bibliographies of retrieved articles. the main comparison is between interventions that had a restrictive element and those that were purely persuasive. restrictive interventions were implemented through restriction of the freedom of prescribers to select some antibiotics. persuasive interventions used one or more of the following methods for changing professional behaviour: dissemination of educational resources, reminders, audit  and feedback, or educational outreach. restrictive interventions could contain persuasive elements. selection criteria: we included randomized clinical trials (rcts), controlled clinical trials (cct), controlled before-after (cba) and interrupted time series studies (its). interventions included any professional or structural interventions as defined by epoc. the intervention had to include a component that aimed to improve antibiotic prescribing to hospital inpatients, either by increasing effective treatment or by reducing unnecessary treatment. the results had to include interpretable data about the effect of the intervention on antibiotic prescribing or microbial outcomes or relevant clinical outcomes. data collection and analysis: two authors extracted data and assessed quality. we performed meta-regression of its studies to compare the results of persuasive and restrictive interventions. persuasive interventions advised physicians about how to prescribe or gave them feedback about how they prescribed. restrictive interventions put a limit on how they prescribed; for example, physicians had to have approval from an infection specialist in order to prescribe an antibiotic. we standardized the results of some its studies so that  they are on the same scale (percent change in outcome), thereby facilitating comparisons of different interventions. to do this, we used the change in level and change in slope to estimate the effect size with increasing time after the intervention (one month, six months, one year, etc) as the percent change in level at each time point. we did not extrapolate beyond the end of data collection after the intervention. the meta-regression was performed using standard weighted linear regression with the standard errors of the coefficients  adjusted where necessary. main results: for this update we included 89 studies that reported 95 interventions. of the 89 studies, 56 were itss (of which 4 were  controlled itss), 25 were rct (of which 5 were cluster-rcts), 5 were cbas and 3 were ccts (of which 1 was a cluster-cct).most (80/95, 84%) of the interventions targeted the antibiotic prescribed (choice of antibiotic, timing of first dose and route of administration). the remaining 15 interventions aimed to change exposure of patients to antibiotics by targeting the decision to treat or the duration of treatment. reliable data about impact on antibiotic prescribing data  were available for 76 interventions (44 persuasive, 24 restrictive and 8 structural). for the persuasive interventions, the median change in antibiotic prescribing was 42.3% for the itss, 31.6% for the controlled itss, 17.7% for the  cbas, 3.5% for the cluster-rcts and 24.7% for the rcts. the restrictive interventions had a median effect size of 34.7% for the itss, 17.1% for the cbas  and 40.5% for the rcts. the structural interventions had a median effect of 13.3% for the rcts and 23.6% for the cluster-rcts. data about impact on microbial outcomes were available for 21 interventions but only 6 of these also had reliable data about impact on antibiotic prescribing.meta-analysis of 52 its studies was used to compare restrictive versus purely persuasive interventions. restrictive interventions had significantly greater impact on prescribing outcomes at one month (32%, 95% confidence interval (ci) 2% to 61%, p = 0.03) and on microbial outcomes at 6 months (53%, 95% ci 31% to 75%, p = 0.001) but there were no significant differences at 12 or 24 months. interventions intended to decrease excessive prescribing were associated with reduction in clostridium difficile infections and colonization or infection with aminoglycoside- or cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. meta-analysis of clinical outcomes showed that four interventions intended to increase effective prescribing for pneumonia were associated with significant reduction in mortality (risk ratio 0.89, 95% ci 0.82 to 0.97), whereas nine interventions intended to decrease excessive prescribing were not associated with significant increase in mortality (risk ratio 0.92, 95% ci 0.81 to 1.06). authors' conclusions: the results show that interventions to reduce excessive antibiotic prescribing to hospital inpatients can reduce antimicrobial resistance or hospital-acquired infections, and interventions to increase effective prescribing can improve clinical outcome. this update provides more evidence about unintended clinical consequences of interventions and about the effect of interventions to reduce exposure of patients to antibiotics. the meta-analysis supports the use of restrictive interventions when the need is urgent, but suggests that persuasive and restrictive interventions are equally effective after six months.

TI  == in vitro biological effects of two anti-diabetic medicinal plants used in benin as folk medicine.
AB  == background: extracts from polygonum senegalensis (polygonaceae) and pseudocedrela kotschyi (meliaceae) are two important traditionally used medicinal plants in rural benin to treat many diseases and notably type 2 diabetes. the aim of the study was to investigate the alpha-glucosidase inhibition, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of those plants extract: polygonum senegalensis leaves,  and pseudocedrela kotschyi root. methods: hydro-alcoholic (50%) extracts were analyzed for their phytochemical content and tested for their inhibition potency  on alpha-glucosidase from saccharomyces cerevisiae. antioxidant activities were assessed using the dpph, orac, frap and dcfh-da (cell based) assay. finally, the  antibacterial activity was evaluated using mic determination on four gram-positive cocci (bacillus subtilis, clostridium difficile, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus), three gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae), and the yeast candida albicans. results: each extract presented significant alpha-glucosidase inhibition and antioxidant activities. polygonum senegalensis leaf extracts were the most active in each in vitro assay with an ic50 = 1.5 mug/ml for alpha-glucosidase inhibition and an ic50 = 6.8 mug/ml for dpph scavenging, - 4.5 mumol fe ii/g of dry matter - 9366 mumol trolox / g dw - for frap and orac values, respectively. ic50 = 2.3 mug ga / ml for dcfh-da assay. concerning its antibacterial activity, a growth inhibitory effect was observed only against three gram negative bacilli: b. subtilis, e. faecalis, s. aureus and the yeast c. albicans at high concentration. conclusion: the results showed that the semi alcoholic extract of the two studied plants possess alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity, antioxidant potency, and low antibacterial effect.

TI  == american journal of gastroenterology lecture: intestinal microbiota and the role  of fecal microbiota transplant (fmt) in treatment of c. difficile infection.
AB  == the vital roles that intestinal flora, now called microbiota, have in maintaining our health are being increasingly appreciated. starting with birth, exposure to the outside world begins the life-long intimate association our microbiota will have with our diet and environment, and initiates determination of the post-natal structural and functional maturation of the gut. moreover, vital interactions of  the microbiota with our metabolic activities, as well as with the immunological apparatus that constitutes our major defense system against foreign antigens continues throughout life. a perturbed intestinal microbiome has been associated  with an increasing number of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal diseases including clostridium difficile infection (cdi). it has become recognized that fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) can correct the dysbiosis that characterizes chronic cdi, and effect a seemingly safe, relatively inexpensive, and rapidly effective cure in the vast majority of patients so treated. in addition, fmt has been used to treat an array of other gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disorders, although experience in these other non-cdi diseases is in its infancy. more work needs to be done with fmt to ensure its safety and optimal route of administration. there is a conceptual sea change that is developing in our view of bacteria from their role only as pathogens to that of being critical to health maintenance in a changing world. future studies are certain to narrow the spectrum of organisms that need to be given to patients to  cure disease. fmt is but the first step in this journey.

TI  == using rapid diagnostic tests to optimize antimicrobial selection in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
AB  == new advances in rapid diagnostic tests provide several collaborative opportunities for stewardship teams, particularly in processes where delay in the initiation of appropriate therapy has significant consequences for patient outcomes. rapid molecular tests enhance one of the key functions of microbiology  laboratories, which is to produce accurate organism identification and timely antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. these data are used to guide the choice of antimicrobial agents for treating infections in individual patients, and the aggregate data (i.e., hospital's antibiogram) are used to guide empiric therapy for infections before the availability of the patient's culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. in addition, accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing data are critical for the overall success of a health care institution's antimicrobial stewardship program. tests that provide accurate organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility not only benefit the individual patient but also increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs. this review focuses on the use of molecular diagnostic methods to rapidly identify staphylococcus species, enterococcus faecalis,enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli,klebsiella pneumoniae,pseudomonas aeruginosa,clostridium difficile, and candida species from clinical samples and summarizes studies that describe the application of rapid diagnostic tests in antimicrobial stewardship programs.

AB  == ninety four infants were observed as inpatients. thirty nine of them were mature  neonates and 55 were premature infants with a very low body weight. the majority  of the patients were treated with antibiotics. the mature infants were treated with penicillins, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins and the premature neonates were treated in addition with carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides. the mature infants were randomized into 2 groups: the control group (n=18) received the standard therapy and the main group (n=21) in addition received 1 ml of liquid probiotic enterococcus faecium l3 (with a titer of 5x10(8) cfu/ml) 2 times a day  for 10 days. the premature newborn infants were also randomized into 2 groups. the control group (n=26) received the standard therapy. the main group (n=29) additionally received 1 ml of liquid probiotic e.faecium l3 2 times a day for 10  days. the effectiveness of the therapy in the mature neonates was evaluated by the frequency of dyspeptic disorders and in the premature infants by the frequency of infectious complications and the episodes of food intolerance. the intestinal microbiota of the infants was investigated by the real-time pcr and bacteriological analyses of the feces: in the mature infants on admission to the  hospital and 10 days after the treatment (periods 1-2), in the premature infants  on admission to the hospital and then twice with an interval of 14 days (periods  1-2-3). it was shown that the use of the probiotic strain e.faecium l3 during the antibiotic therapy in the premature infants promoted significant reduction in the frequency of infectious complications. in the mature neonates the probiotic therapy reduced the risk of dyspeptic disorder. the studies showed reduction in persistence of clostridium difficile in the intestinal microbiota of the newborn  infants receiving the antibiotic therapy in combination with probiotic e.faecium  l3, that was accompanied by preserving and growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli and reduction of the number of opportunistic microorganisms.

TI  == pang, a new ketopantoate reductase involved in pantothenate synthesis.
AB  == pantothenate, commonly referred to as vitamin b(5), is an essential molecule in the metabolism of living organisms and forms the core of coenzyme a. unlike humans, some bacteria and plants are capable of de novo biosynthesis of pantothenate, making this pathway a potential target for drug development. francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis schu s4 is a zoonotic bacterial pathogen that is able to synthesize pantothenate but is lacking the known ketopantoate reductase (kpr) genes, pane and ilvc, found in the canonical escherichia coli pathway. described herein is a gene encoding a novel kpr, for which we propose the name pang (ftt1388), which is conserved in all sequenced francisella species  and is the sole kpr in schu s4. homologs of this kpr are present in other pathogenic bacteria such as enterococcus faecalis, coxiella burnetii, and clostridium difficile. both the homologous gene from e. faecalis v583 (ef1861) and e. coli pane functionally complemented francisella novicida lacking any kpr.  furthermore, pang from f. novicida can complement an e. coli kpr double mutant. a schu s4 deltapang strain is a pantothenate auxotroph and was genetically and chemically complemented with pang in trans or with the addition of pantolactone.  there was no virulence defect in the schu s4 deltapang strain compared to the wild type in a mouse model of pneumonic tularemia. in summary, we characterized the pantothenate pathway in francisella novicida and f. tularensis and identified an unknown and previously uncharacterized kpr that can convert 2-dehydropantoate  to pantoate, pang.

TI  == structural insight into the clostridium difficile ethanolamine utilisation microcompartment.
AB  == bacterial microcompartments form a protective proteinaceous barrier around metabolic enzymes that process unstable or toxic chemical intermediates. the genome of the virulent, multidrug-resistant clostridium difficile 630 strain contains an operon, eut, encoding a bacterial microcompartment with genes for the breakdown of ethanolamine and its utilisation as a source of reduced nitrogen and carbon. the c. difficile eut operon displays regulatory genetic elements and protein encoding regions in common with homologous loci found in the genomes of other bacteria, including the enteric pathogens salmonella enterica and enterococcus faecalis. the crystal structures of two microcompartment shell proteins, cd1908 and cd1918, and an uncharacterised protein with potential enzymatic activity, cd1925, were determined by x-ray crystallography. cd1908 and  cd1918 display the same protein fold, though the order of secondary structure elements is permuted in cd1908 and this protein displays an n-terminal beta-strand extension. these proteins form hexamers with molecules related by crystallographic and non-crystallographic symmetry. the structure of cd1925 has a cupin beta-barrel fold and a putative active site that is distinct from the metal-ion dependent catalytic cupins. thin-section transmission electron microscopy of escherichia coli over-expressing eut proteins indicates that cd1918 is capable of self-association into arrays, suggesting an organisational role for cd1918 in the formation of this microcompartment. the work presented provides the basis for further study of the architecture and function of the c. difficile eut  microcompartment, its role in metabolism and the wider consequences of intestinal colonisation and virulence in this pathogen.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a range of probiotics against pathogens: evidence for the effects of organic acids.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial properties of fifteen  selected strains belonging to the lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, lactococcus, streptococcus and bacillus genera against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. in vitro antibacterial activity was initially investigated by an agar spot method. results from the agar spot test showed that most of the selected strains were able to produce active compounds on solid media with antagonistic properties against salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and clostridium difficile. these results were also confirmed when cell-free culture supernatants (cfcs) from the putative probiotics were used in an agar well diffusion assay. neutralization of  the culture supernatants with alkali reduced the antagonistic effects. these experiments are able to confirm the capacity of potential probiotics to inhibit selected pathogens. one of the main inhibitory mechanisms may result from the production of organic acids from glucose fermentation and consequent lowering of  culture ph. this observation was confirmed when the profile of organic acids was  analysed demonstrating that lactic and acetic acid were the principal end products of probiotic metabolism. furthermore, the assessment of the haemolytic activity and the susceptibility of the strains to the most commonly used antimicrobials, considered as basic safety aspects, were also studied. the observed antimicrobial activity was mainly genus-specific, additionally significant differences could be observed among species.

TI  == distribution of the vang-like gene cluster in clostridium difficile clinical isolates.
AB  == treatment of clostridium difficile infections generally requires cessation of their causative antibiotic and subsequent administration of metronidazole or vancomycin. intriguingly, the genome of c. difficile 630 contains a cryptic gene  cluster homologous to the vang-type operon of enterococcus faecalis bm4518. we detected this cluster by pcr in 35 out of 41 clinical isolates, confirming its large prevalence in this species. the cluster was found to be located in a unique locus. comparison of this locus with that of strains devoid of the vang-like cluster indicated that acquisition of the gene cluster occurred in a perfect 19-bp inverted repeat, in the absence of a detectable mobile structure.

TI  == tn916-like genetic elements: a diverse group of modular mobile elements conferring antibiotic resistance.
AB  == antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria are responsible for morbidity and mortality in healthcare environments. enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae can all exhibit clinically relevant multidrug resistance phenotypes due to acquired resistance genes on mobile genetic elements. it is possible that clinically relevant multidrug-resistant clostridium difficile strains will appear in the future, as the organism is adept at acquiring mobile genetic elements (plasmids and transposons). conjugative transposons of the tn916/tn1545 family, which carry major antibiotic resistance determinants, are transmissible between these different bacteria by a conjugative mechanism during which the elements are excised by a staggered cut from donor cells, converted to a circular form, transferred by cell-cell contact and inserted into recipient cells by a site-specific recombinase. the ability of these conjugative transposons to acquire additional, clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes importantly contributes to the emergence of multidrug resistance.

TI  == antimicrobial photodynamic therapy in the colon: delivering a light punch to the  guts?
AB  == a paper in this issue of photochemistry and photobiology by cassidy et al. describes the use of a sophisticated drug delivery vehicle prepared by the hot melt extrusion process to deliver photosensitizers to the colon. the smart vehicle protects its cargo through the acidic environment of the stomach but releases the active photosensitizers in the higher ph and anaerobic environment of the colon. the goal is to use photodynamic therapy (pdt) to destroy pathogenic microorganisms that can cause disease when they grow out of control in the colon. since the colon is an environment with a low oxygen concentration the investigators also used tetrachlorodecaoxide, an oxygen donor to boost the available oxygen concentration. the paper reports results with enterococcus faecalis and bacteroides fragilis but the real medical problem demanding to be solved is clostridium difficile that can cause intractable drug-resistant infections after antibiotic use. there still remain barriers to implementing this strategy in vivo, including light delivery to the upper colon, oxygen availability and optimizing the selectivity of photosensitizers for bacteria over colon epithelial cells. nevertheless, this highly innovative paper lays the ground for the study of an entirely new and significant application for antimicrobial pdt.

TI  == intestinal microbiota was assessed in cirrhotic patients with hepatitis b virus infection. intestinal microbiota of hbv cirrhotic patients.
AB  == to unravel the profile of intestinal microecological parameters in chinese patients with asymptomatic carriage of hepatitis b virus (hbv), chronic hepatitis b, decompensated hbv cirrhosis, and health controls and to establish their correlation with liver disease progression, we performed quantitative pcr and immunological techniques to investigate fecal parameters, including population of fecal predominant bacteria and the abundance of some virulence genes derived from escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and clostridium perfringens in fecal crude dna and some immunological parameters in extracts of all fecal samples. data analysis indicated that 16s rrna gene copy numbers for faecalibacterium prausnitzii, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacteria, and lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella) showed marked variation in the intestine of hbv cirrhotic patients. the bifidobacteria/enterobacteriaceae (b/e) ratio, which may  indicate microbial colonization resistance of the bowel, was decreased significantly in turn from 1.15 +/- 0.11 in healthy controls, 0.99 +/- 0.09 in asymptomatic carriers, and 0.76 +/- 0.08 in patients with chronic hepatitis b to  0.64 +/- 0.09 in patients with decompensated hbv cirrhosis (for all, p < 0.01). this suggests that b/e ratio is useful for following the level of intestinal microecological disorder in the course of liver disease progression. the data for virulence gene abundance suggested increased diversity of virulence factors during liver disease progression. fecal secretory iga and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in decompensated hbv cirrhotic patients were present at higher levels than in other groups, which indicates that a complicated autoregulatory system tries to achieve a new intestinal microecological balance.

TI  == comparative genome-wide analysis of small rnas of major gram-positive pathogens:  from identification to application.
AB  == in the recent years, the number of drug- and multi-drug-resistant microbial strains has increased rapidly. therefore, the need to identify innovative approaches for development of novel anti-infectives and new therapeutic targets is of high priority in global health care. the detection of small rnas (srnas) in bacteria has attracted considerable attention as an emerging class of new gene expression regulators. several experimental technologies to predict srna have been established for the gram-negative model organism escherichia coli. in many respects, srna screens in this model system have set a blueprint for the global and functional identification of srnas for gram-positive microbes, but the functional role of srnas in colonization and pathogenicity for listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile is almost completely unknown. here, we report  the current knowledge about the srnas of these socioeconomically relevant gram-positive pathogens, overview the state-of-the-art high-throughput srna screening methods and summarize bioinformatics approaches for genome-wide srna identification and target prediction. finally, we discuss the use of modified peptide nucleic acids (pnas) as a novel tool to inactivate potential srna and their applications in rapid and specific detection of pathogenic bacteria.

AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to characterize the antimicrobial profile of rep3123, a novel inhibitor of methionyl-trna synthetase (metrs) in development for the treatment of clostridium difficile infection. methods: the spectrum of activity of rep3123 was determined by susceptibility testing of c. difficile and  non-target organisms. the mode of action was studied by enzyme inhibition assays, macromolecular synthesis assays, target overexpression and selection of spontaneous resistant mutants. results: rep3123 was active against a collection of 108 clinical isolates of c. difficile and against epidemic, moxifloxacin-resistant bi/nap1/027 strains (mic range=0.5-1 mg/l and mic(90) = 1  mg/l). the spectrum of activity included clinically important aerobic gram-positive cocci such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium (mic(90)s < 1 mg/l), but rep3123 was not active against most gram-negative bacteria. rep3123 targeted c. difficile metrs with a calculated inhibition constant (k(i)) of 0.020 nm, and selectivity was >1000-fold over human mitochondrial and cytoplasmic metrs. the specific mode  of action within bacterial cells was demonstrated by macromolecular synthesis assays that showed inhibition of protein synthesis by rep3123, and by mets overexpression, which resulted in a 16-fold increase in mic for rep3123. spontaneous rep3123-resistant mutants of c. difficile (mics, 4-128 mg/l) arose with frequencies of 10(-8)-10(-9) and harboured distinct point mutations within the mets gene, resulting in 13 different amino acid substitutions. most of the metrs substitutions caused reduced catalytic efficiency and a growth fitness burden. conclusions: rep3123 demonstrated a favourable microbiological profile and was found to target c. difficile with high specificity and selectivity.

TI  == reduction in infection risk through treatment of microbially contaminated surfaces with a novel, portable, saturated steam vapor disinfection system.
AB  == background: surface-mediated infectious disease transmission is a major concern in various settings, including schools, hospitals, and food-processing facilities. chemical disinfectants are frequently used to reduce contamination, but many pose significant risks to humans, surfaces, and the environment, and all must be properly applied in strict accordance with label instructions to be effective. this study set out to determine the capability of a novel chemical-free, saturated steam vapor disinfection system to kill microorganisms,  reduce surface-mediated infection risks, and serve as an alternative to chemical  disinfectants. methods: high concentrations of escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), salmonella enterica, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, ms2 coliphage (used as a surrogate for nonenveloped viruses including norovirus), candida albicans, aspergillus niger, and the endospores of clostridium difficile were dried individually onto porous clay test surfaces. surfaces were treated with the saturated steam vapor disinfection system for brief periods and then numbers of surviving microorganisms were determined. infection risks were calculated from the kill-time data using microbial dose-response relationships published in the scientific literature, accounting for surface-to-hand and hand-to-mouth transfer efficiencies. results:  a diverse assortment of pathogenic microorganisms was rapidly killed by the steam disinfection system; all of the pathogens tested were completely inactivated within 5 seconds. risks of infection from the contaminated surfaces decreased rapidly with increasing periods of treatment by the saturated steam vapor disinfection system. conclusions: the saturated steam vapor disinfection system tested for this study is chemical-free, broadly active, rapidly efficacious, and  therefore represents a novel alternative to liquid chemical disinfectants.

AB  == introduction: to assess the efficacy of screening stools sent for clostridium difficile cytotoxin assay (cdta) for surveillance of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). materials and methods: from april to may 2005, all stools submitted for cdta were also cultured for vre using vancomycin containing culture media. isolates were identified to species level and vancomycin resistance confirmed, followed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for detection of vancomycin resistance genes and dna fingerprinting. over 2 consecutive days during that period, stool specimens or rectal swabs were also obtained from all patients in high-risk units (haematology, oncology, renal and intensive care). fifty-one patients in each group were compared in terms of vre risk factors previously identified. results and discussion: the prevalence of vre in both groups was similar [3/204 (1.5%) in the cdta arm and 1/97 (1.0%) in the high-risk arm; p = 1.0, fisher's exact test]. prevalence of risk factors for vre colonisation, including age, duration of hospitalisation, exposure to antibiotics, exposure to surgical procedures, presence of malignancy and diabetes mellitus was similar in both groups (p > 0.05). only renal failure (p < 0.05) was more common in the high-risk group. all 4 isolates of vre identified were genetically distinct by variable number tandem repeat (vntr) typing; 3 were enterococcus faecium (2 with the vanb gene, 1 with vana) and one e. faecalis. conclusion: less than 2% of our high-risk patients are vre carriers. in-hospital  vre screening using stools sent for cdta is a simple, reasonable surrogate for screening individual high-risk patients as the patient risk profile is similar and the yield comparable in a low-prevalence setting.

TI  == identification of tn5397-like and tn916-like transposons and diversity of the tetracycline resistance gene tet(m) in enterococci from humans, pigs and poultry.
AB  == objectives: to analyse the sequence diversity of the tetracycline resistance gene tet(m) and its location on mobile elements in enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis from humans, pigs and poultry in denmark. methods: a total  of 76 isolates were screened for tn916/tn1545-like and tn5397-like transposons using pcr. tet(m) was sequenced in 15 of the isolates and compared with tet(m) sequences submitted to genbank (phylogenetic analysis and signs of recombination). plasmids were extracted, filter-mating experiments were performed and tn5397-like transposons were further characterized in selected isolates. results: in 8 of 13 isolates of e. faecium from broilers, tet(m) was present on tn5397-like transposons, whereas tet(m) was predominantly associated with tn916/tn1545-like transposons in e. faecium from pigs and humans, as well as in e. faecalis from humans, pigs and broilers (50 of 63 isolates). the tet(m) genes  were divided into three major subgroups according to the phylogenetic analysis. subgroup i consisted of tet(m) from clostridium difficile and e. faecium associated with tn5397-like elements, subgroup ii consisted of tet(m) located on  tn916/tn1545 family transposons and subgroup iii consisted of tet(m) associated with composite elements containing several resistance genes. we found evidence of recombination both within and between these groups. moreover, we identified an e. faecium isolate with both tn916/tn1545-like and tn5397-like elements. conclusions: this study showed that enterococci contain diverse tet(m) genes present on different mobile elements, which may suggest that enterococci play an  important role in the evolution and horizontal spread of mobile elements carrying tet(m). this is the first report of tn5397-like elements in enterococci.

TI  == new variants of the tet(m) gene in clostridium difficile clinical isolates harbouring tn916-like elements.
AB  == objectives: to detect tn916-like elements in clostridium difficile clinical isolates from different time periods and to analyse the genetic structure of these elements, in particular the tet(m) region. methods: ninety c. difficile clinical isolates were examined by pcr assays for tet(m) and int, which are markers for the tn916 family of elements. positive isolates were typed by pcr-ribotyping, and tetracycline mic values were evaluated by etest. the genetic  organization of the tn916 elements was investigated by pcr mapping and hybridization assays. the tet(m) region of eight selected c. difficile isolates was sequenced. results: nineteen isolates were tet(m)/int positive and the majority (12/19) belonged to pcr-ribotype r, previously found to be predominant in clinical strains of more recent isolation. eleven isolates were tetracycline resistant, three inducibly resistant and five susceptible. fifty-eight per cent of the c. difficile isolates harboured one tn916 element and 42% harboured two. most isolates showed elements with a genetic organization very similar to that of enterococcus faecalis ds16 tn916. sequence analysis highlighted variations in the leader peptide and six tet(m) variants were identified, five of which have never  been described before. conclusions: c. difficile isolates harbouring tn916-like elements have mainly been isolated since 1997, suggesting a recent circulation of these elements among c. difficile strains in italian hospitals. molecular analysis of these tn916-like elements showed that they may have different genetic structures and carry new tet(m) alleles.

TI  == an active surveillance study of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus in queen elizabeth hospital, hong kong.
AB  == objective: to assess the rate of faecal vancomycin-resistant enterococcus colonisation in high-risk patients in a regional hospital. design: prospective observational surveillance study. setting: queen elizabeth hospital, hong kong. patients: from september 2001 to december 2002, stool samples from patients in the intensive care unit and patients in whom clostridium difficile testing was requested were used for study using a broth enrichment method. main outcome measures: number of faecal vancomycin-resistant enterococcus colonisation. results: a total of 2414 cultures from 1792 patients were tested for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus using a broth enrichment method. only one (0.06%) patient was found to harbour a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis in the gastro-intestinal tract. surveillance cultures from contacts of the case revealed another six with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis was also later reported from a clinical specimen (catheterized urine) of another patient. they were all epidemiologically linked to the index case. mean inhibitory concentrations of vancomycin and teicoplanin were determined to be higher than 256 and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively by e-test for all the vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolates. polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed the presence  of vanb genes and the result was in line with the phenotype. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis confirmed a monoclonal vancomycin-resistant enterococcus outbreak. strict infection control measures recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention were followed and the outbreak was successfully controlled. conclusion: vancomycin-resistant enterococcus colonisation is rare, but present among high-risk patients in our hospital. a routine surveillance programme should be implemented that will enable early case detection and prompt  initiation of infection control measures to prevent the emergence of an endemic situation.

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

AB  == objective: to explore the relationship of bacteria identified in cholesterol gallstones and gallstone formation. methods: observe the bacteria activity in model bile and the influence of bacteria on the cholesterol nucleation time (nt). results: (1) model bile were suitable for the growth of e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium difficile and clostridium. propionibacterium acne grew weakly and the growth of bacteroides fragilis was restrained in model bile. (2) only pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis could ly shorten the cholesterol nucleation time. (3) with  pseudomonas aeruginosa or enterococcus faecalis added in model bile, the formation of cholesterol crystals presented a progressive course of evolution. conclusions: pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, not propionibacterium acne, have pro-nucleating ability in model bile.

TI  == [bacteremia due to clostridium difficile].
AB  == we describe a case of bacteremia due to clostridium difficile, which was successfully treated by intravenous vancomycin. a 69-year-old woman was admitted  to our hospital because of third degree burn injuries. she was treated with cefazolin for two weeks followed with flomoxef for one week before the operation  (debridement and grafting of skin). on the third postoperative day high fever (temperature 40 degrees c), abdominal pain and severe watery diarrhea developed.  antibiotic-associated colitis with bacteremia was diagnosed presumptively, flomoxef was stopped, and oral and intravenous therapy with vancomycin was started. a blood culture taken before the administration of vancomycin yielded c. difficile accompanied with enterococcus faecalis and enetrococcus casseliflavus.  a stool culture taken on the next day yielded c. difficile, and a stool latex agglutination test was also positive. the patient improved slowly. parenteral vancomycin was discontinued after two weeks. one week later, the patient developed pneumonia, and imipenem/cilastatin was added. soon after addition of the agent, she developed recurrent diarrhea despite continual oral vancomycin therapy. the fecal samples obtained at this time were positive for c. difficile by culture and positive for toxins a & b. she was satisfactorily treated with oral vancomycin for a total of four weeks. after the following two weeks, however, recurrence of diarrhea developed again, which rapidly decreased with oral vancomycin for seven days. the patient did well thereafter and was discharged. all three c. difficile isolates from blood and fecal specimens were positive for toxins a & b, and identified the same pcr ribotyping pattern.

TI  == the cme gene of clostridium difficile confers multidrug resistance in enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == antibiotic resistance in c. difficile by efflux has been previously suggested. the genome of c. difficile 630 was screened for sequences encoding putative proteins homologous to nora from staphylococcus aureus. four orfs homologous to efflux genes were cloned into the pat79 shuttle vector under the control of transcription and translation signals of gram-positive bacteria and expressed in  enterococcus faecalis jh2-2 and s. aureus rn4220. one of these sequences, designated cme conferred resistance to ethidium bromide, safranin o, and erythromycin in e. faecalis. the three other orfs did not confer detectable resistance in both bacteria.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

TI  == the icest1 element of streptococcus thermophilus belongs to a large family of integrative and conjugative elements that exchange modules and change their specificity of integration.
AB  == the 34,734-bp element icest1 from streptococcus thermophilus cnrz368 is site-specifically integrated into the 3(') end of the gene fda. icest1 encodes integrative functions and putative transfer functions. six proteins of the putative conjugative system of icest1 are related to those encoded by the conjugative transposon tn916 from enterococcus faecalis. a comparison of these proteins with those encoded by the complete or partial genome sequences of various low g+c bacteria including bacillus subtilis, clostridium difficile, e. faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus mutans revealed the presence of numerous putative site-specific integrative conjugative  elements and/or conjugative transposons within these genomes. sequence comparisons revealed that these elements possess a modular structure and that exchanges of unrelated or distantly related modules and genes have occurred between these elements, and also plasmids and prophages. these exchanges have probably led to modifications in the site specificity of integration of these elements. therefore, a distinction between low specificity integrative conjugative elements (i.e., conjugative transposons) and site-specific integrative conjugative elements does not appear to be relevant. we propose to call all the conjugative elements that excise by site-specific recombination and  integrate by recombination between a specific site of a circular intermediate and another site, "integrative and conjugative elements" (ices), irrespective of the  integration specificity.

TI  == in vitro activities of ertapenem (mk-0826) against recent clinical bacteria collected in europe and australia.
AB  == ertapenem (mk-0826, l-749,345) is a 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long serum half-life. its in vitro activity was determined by broth microdilution against 3,478 bacteria from 12 centers in europe and australia, with imipenem, cefepime,  ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam used as comparators. ertapenem was the most active agent tested against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)s) of < or =1 microg/ml for all species. ertapenem also was more active than imipenem against fastidious gram-negative bacteria and moraxella spp.; on the other hand, ertapenem was slightly less active than imipenem against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci, and anaerobes, but its mic(90)s for these groups remained < or =0.5 microg/ml. acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also much less susceptible to ertapenem than imipenem, and most enterococcus faecalis strains were resistant. ertapenem resistance, based on a provisional nccls mic breakpoint of > or =16 microg/ml, was seen in only 3 of 1,611 strains of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, all of them enterobacter aerogenes. resistance was also seen in 2 of 135 anaerobes, comprising 1 bacteroides fragilis strain and 1 clostridium difficile strain. ertapenem breakpoints for streptococci have not been established, but an unofficial susceptibility breakpoint of < or =2 microg/ml was adopted for clinical trials to generate corresponding clinical response data for isolates for which mics were as high as 2 microg/ml. of 234 streptococcus pneumoniae strains tested, 2 required ertapenem mics of 2 microg/ml and one required an mic of 4 microg/ml, among 67 non-streptococcus pyogenes, non-streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci, single isolates required ertapenem mics of 2 and 16 microg/ml. these streptococci also had diminished susceptibilities to other beta-lactams, including imipenem as well as ertapenem.  the etest and disk diffusion gave susceptibility test results in good agreement with those of the broth microdilution method for ertapenem.

TI  == linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. it has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus (gisa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, peptostreptococcus spp. and bacteroidesfragilis. in controlled phase iii studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. further phase iii studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (sstis). in these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments,  including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated sstis. oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated sstis  or community-acquired pneumonia. linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. the most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. conclusions: linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of s. aureus (including gisa), enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis (including vre). in controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as  effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. as the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among s. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.

TI  == comparison of tn5397 from clostridium difficile, tn916 from enterococcus faecalis and the cw459tet(m) element from clostridium perfringens shows that they have similar conjugation regions but different insertion and excision modules.
AB  == comparative analysis of the conjugative transposons tn5397 from clostridium difficile and tn916 from enterococcus faecalis, and the cw459tet(m) element from  clostridium perfringens, has revealed that these tetracycline-resistance elements are closely related. all three elements contain the tet(m) resistance gene and have sequence similarity throughout their central region. however, they have very different integration/excision modules. instead of the int and xis genes that are found in tn916, tn5397 has a large resolvase gene, tndx. the c. perfringens element encodes the putative int459 protein, which is a member of the integrase family of site-specific recombinases but is not closely related to int from tn916. based on these studies it is concluded that the clostridial elements have  a modular genetic organization and were derived independently from distinct mobile genetic elements.

AB  == the interest of probiotics as remedies for a broad number of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases has gained wide interest over the last few years, but little is known about their underlying mechanism of action. in this study, the probiotic activities of a human isolate of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus strain (lcr35) were investigated. using intestinal caco-2 cell line in an in vitro model, we demonstrated that this strain exhibited adhesive properties. the  inhibitory effects of lcr35 organisms on the adherence of three pathogens, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) and klebsiella pneumoniae, were determined. a decrease in the number of adhering pathogens was observed, using either preincubation, postincubation or coincubation of the pathogens with lcr35. moreover, the antibacterial activities  of cell-free lcr35 supernatant was examined against nine human pathogenic bacteria, etec, epec, k. pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile. the growth of all strains was inhibited, as measured by determining the number of viable bacteria over time, but no bactericidal activity was detected in this in vitro assay. together, these findings suggest that this probiotic strain could be used to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by a large variety of pathogens.

TI  == surveillance for antimicrobial resistance in enterococci.
AB  == aim: to describe antimicrobial resistance patterns of enterococcus species in auckland. background: antimicrobial resistant enterococci have emerged as major nosocomial pathogens in overseas hospitals. it is recommended that hospitals perform periodic surveys to determine local enterococcal resistance patterns. methods: enterococcal isolates from four patient groups were tested: group i were recovered from routine clinical specimens; group ii were stool isolates from patients at risk of having vancomycin resistant enterococci, eg, intensive care unit patients, patients receiving vancomycin, and immunocompromised patients receiving antibiotics; group iii were enterococci from stool specimens sent for clostridium difficile toxin testing; group iv were isolates from stool specimens  submitted to a community laboratory for enteric pathogen testing. all enterococci isolated were tested for the presence of beta-lactamase, susceptibility to amoxycillin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, and for high level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance. results: there were 121 group i enterococcal isolates. 628 stool specimens were cultured. enterococci were isolated from: 76/148 (51%) group ii specimens; 166/279 (60%) group iii specimens; and 70/201 (35%) of group  iv specimens. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on 433 isolates; 74% were e faecalis, 12% e faecium, 6% e gallinarum/casseliflavus group and 8% other enterococcal species. no isolate produced beta-lactamase. all e faecalis were susceptible to amoxycillin. two e faecium and one enterococcus species were  resistant to amoxycillin (mics all 16 mg/l). all isolates were susceptible to teicoplanin. fourteen e gallinarum/casseliflavus group isolates had intermediate  susceptibility to vancomycin (mics of 8 mg/l). one e faecium had intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin (mic 8 mg/l). high level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance occurred in 64 (15%) and 50 (12%) isolates respectively. conclusion: vancomycin resistance is rare and is essentially restricted to species that are rarely clinical pathogens, i.e., e casseliflavus and e gallinarum. our results have established the local susceptibility profile for enterococcal isolates. this allows comparison with other locations and the detection of emerging trends of resistance.

TI  == periodontal microflora of hiv infected patients with periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the microbial profile of periodontal lesions in hiv seropositive patients and to compare it with rapidly progressing periodontal lesions in systemically healthy patients. the subgingival microflora  of 20 cdc ii, 20 cdc iii, 20 cdc iv/v and 20 systemically healthy patients with rapidly progressing periodontitis was examined. four sites with greatest probing  depth in each patient were selected for microbiological sampling. the samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the microflora of periodontitis lesions within the three stages of the hiv infection was similar to that of progressing periodontitis in systemically healthy adults including campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, selenomonas spp. and peptostreptococcus micros. however, hiv seropositive periodontitis lesions harboured a range of exogenous pathogens rarely associated with common types of periodontitis including staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloaca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium, clostridium difficile, aspergillus fumigatus, klebsiella pneumoniae and mycoplasma incognitum. the lack of immune effector and regulatory cells in hiv infected patients could in fact explain the increase of some opportunistic pathogens and the characteristic and rapidly progressing nature of the periodontal disease in these patients.

AB  == background: vancomycin-resistant enterococci have been recovered with increasing  frequency from hospitalized patients. risk factors, mode of nosocomial transmission, extent of colonization in hospitalized patients, and treatment options for these organisms have not been completely delineated. methods: we studied 53 patients (group a) with vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolated from various clinical specimens and also surveyed for vancomycin-resistant enterococci in stool specimens submitted for clostridium difficile toxin assays (group b). stool specimens submitted for identification of bacterial pathogens and stool specimens from hospital employees were also analyzed for vancomycin-resistant enterococci. results: seventy-six isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were recovered in group a. five of these patients harbored vancomycin-resistant enterococci on admission. fifty-three of 289 group b stool specimens submitted for c. difficile toxin assays yielded vancomycin-resistant enterococci. cephalosporins and vancomycin were the most common antimicrobial agents received  by both groups of patients. enterococcus faecium isolates were more resistant than enterococcus faecalis isolates to antimicrobial agents. all isolates exhibited high-level aminoglycoside resistance and were not beta-lactamase producers. there were at least 15 different molecular clones of e. faecium and three of e. faecalis. vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia was associated with a 100% in-hospital mortality rate. conclusions: multidrug-resistant and vancomycin-resistant enterococci have become important nosocomial pathogens that  are difficult to treat. vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia was associated with a poor prognosis. we found a high rate of colonization in patients with suspected c. difficile toxin colitis. judicious use of vancomycin and broad-spectrum antibiotics is recommended, and strict infection control measures must be implemented to prevent nosocomial transmission of these organisms.

TI  == bacteremia due to clostridium difficile: case report and review of extraintestinal c. difficile infections.
AB  == we report the case of an 85-year-old woman who developed diarrhea and bacteremia  caused by clostridium difficile after a prolonged hospitalization. c. difficile is a major cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea but only rarely has been reported to cause extraintestinal infection. isolation of c. difficile from a wide range of specimens outside the intestinal tract has been reported and is not always associated with diarrhea or intestinal pathology.

TI  == everninomicin, a new oligosaccharide antibiotic: its antimicrobial activity, post-antibiotic effect and synergistic bactericidal activity.
AB  == antimicrobial activity of everninomicin (sch) 27899) in comparison with two glycopeptides (vancomycin, teicoplanin) and six beta-lactam agents was evaluated  against recent clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria. everninomicin showed  the highest activity against the species tested and mics90% of everninomicin against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis,  enterococcus faecium and clostridium difficile were 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.39, 0.1 microgram/ml, respectively. mics90% of everninomicin against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) were 0.78 microgram/ml. laboratory induced resistance to everninomicin in  strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis occurred in a stepwise manner and at a very  slow rate. post-antibiotic effect against strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis were 1.8 and 2.6 h, respectively, and a little longer than that of vancomycin. adherence to glass surface of an mrsa strain was strongly repressed by the addition of sub mic of everninomicin in combination with fosfomycin.

TI  == [effect of biapenem (l-627) on fecal flora in gnotobiotic mice and children].
AB  == biapenem (l-627), a novel injectable carbapenem antibiotic, was studied with regard to its effect on mice inoculated with four types of bacteria and on the intestinal flora of pediatric patients. l-627 was given i.m., 40 mg/kg once daily for 5 consecutive days, to mice inoculated enterically with four types of bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, and bifidobacterium breve). except for a mild decrease in e. coli, there were no major fluctuations in viable bacterial counts in the feces during the treatment.  five children with bacterial infections (3 boys and 2 girls; ages: 1 month to 7 years and 7 months; body weights 4.62-21.8 kg) were given l-627 at 6.0 to 11.7 mg/kg 3 times daily for 7 to 11 days. among aerobes, although enterobacteriaceae  such as e. coli tended to decrease remarkably in all patients, there was no major change in enterococcus. consequently, total aerobe counts did not change significantly in any patient. among anaerobes, bifidobacterium, bacteroides, and  eubacterium, which are the predominant organisms in infants, decreased remarkably in some patients. one of the patients showed a marked decrease in total anaerobe  count associated with a change in fecal characteristics (diarrhea). glucose nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli or fungi did not become predominant organisms in any patient. recovery from these changes in the intestinal flora was noted promptly after terminating l-627 treatment. l-627 was detected in the feces of 4  patients during treatment. the fecal concentration ranged from 0.24 to 2.22 micrograms/g. clostridium difficile was not detected in any patient. although c.  difficile d-1 antigen was observed in 2 patients, it bore no relationship to fecal properties. the results indicated that l-627 had relatively few effects on  the intestinal flora compared to other new beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == cefepime: a new fourth-generation cephalosporin.
AB  == the chemistry, pharmacology, antimicrobial spectrum, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and dosage of cefepime are reviewed. fourth-generation cephalosporins, such as cefepime, have a quaternary nitrogen that is positively charged at the 3-position, providing the properties of a zwitterion. a 2-aminothiazolyl-acetamido group in the side chain at the 7-position with an alpha-oxyimino substitution may enhance stability against beta-lactamases by preventing the enzymes' approach to the main nucleus. cefepime may exert its antimicrobial effect by attaching to specific penicillin-binding proteins, disrupting cell-wall synthesis. cefepime has good activity against gram-positive  organisms, such as staphylococcus aureus, and gram-negative organisms, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefepime is not active in vitro against enterococcus faecalis, clostridium difficile, and methicillin- and cefazolin-resistant staph.  aureus. cefepime's activity against gram-negative organisms is similar to that of most third-generation cephalosporins. the agent has poor activity against bacteroides species. the most common mechanism of resistance to cefepime is the excess production of beta-lactamases. maximum peak plasma concentrations are two  to three times higher after i.v. administration than after intramuscular administration. in healthy adults, the volume of distribution is 13-22 l and the  elimination half-life is 2-2.3 hours. clinical studies show that cefepime is as effective as cefotaxime or ceftazidime in patients with infections of the lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structures, urinary tract, or female reproductive system. cefepime reduces fever as effectively as ceftazidime or piperacillin plus gentamicin in neutropenic patients. the most common adverse effects of cefepime are headache (2.4%), nausea (1.8%), rash (1.8%), and diarrhea (1.7%). depending on creatinine clearance, the dosage of cefepime is 1000-2000 mg i.v. every 8-24 hours for life-threatening infections and 500-2000 mg i.v. every  12-24 hours for severe infections. cefepime's clinical efficacy is comparable to  that of ceftazidime and cefotaxime.

TI  == [the influence of cefdinir on the intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  == the influence of cefdinir (cfdn), a new oral cephalosporin, on the intestinal bacterial flora was studied in tetra-contaminated mice and in pediatric patients. cfdn in fine granules was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice contaminated with 4 different species of organism: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve. no remarkable changes were observed in the fecal viable cell counts except that decreases in e. coli counts were observed on the day 3 to 5 after starting administration. the subjects in pediatric study were 7 children with infections,  3 boys and 4 girls, with their ages from 6 months to 12 years 7 months. their body weights ranged from 5.5 to 29.2 kg. cfdn fine granules was administered at each dose of 3.0 mg/kg to 3.7 mg/kg, 3 times a day for 4 to 14 days. during the administration of cfdn, some variations were observed in the pattern of changes in the fecal bacterial flora between subjects. although enterobacteriaceae and total counts of anaerobes were markedly decreased in 2 cases, total counts of aerobes were unchanged in the 2 cases, whereas main aerobes and anaerobes except  enterococci hardly varied in the other cases. there was no case in which glucose  non-fermenting gram-negative rods and fungi became predominant species continually. although clostridium difficile and c. difficile d-1 antigens were detected in 1 and 4 cases, respectively, no relationship was found between the number of c. difficile and the characteristics of the feces. with regard to the drug sensitivities of bacteria isolated from feces before and after administration of cfdn, higher levels of resistance were found in some bacteria such as enterococcus and bacteroides during or after administration than before administration. cfdn was detected in fecal samples from 2 cases during administration with concentrations ranging between 0.99-254 micrograms/g. high value of cfdn was found in a case with low beta-lactamase activity in feces, in which marked decrease of enterobacteriaceae and total counts of anaerobes was observed. the above results suggest that cfdn is considered to be a drug with relatively small influence on the intestinal bacterial flora. but as high concentrations of drugs were detected in feces under some circumstances, our attention will be required. particular care is also required for the occurrence of diarrhea and microbial replacement during continuous, long-term administration of the drug.

TI  == [the influence of cefpirome on intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  == cefpirome (cpr, hr810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its effect on the intestinal bacterial flora in pediatric patients. the subjects were children admitted for infections (6 males and 3 females, 1 month to 5 years 1 month old, weighted 3.94 to 21.0 kg). cpr was intravenously administered at a dose between 19.0 to 40.0 mg/kg, 3 to 4 doses daily over 6 to 12 days. the feces from these children were collected before, during, and after administration, and bacteria were identified and counted. cpr concentration, beta-lactamase activity, and clostridium difficile d-1 antigen were also assayed. bacterial flora changes in feces during cpr administration showed some variance,  but generally 5 cases out of the 9 showed a significant decrease in enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus faecalis among aerobic bacteria. the other 4  cases showed some transient decrease, but no significant change was observed. no  significant changes were recognized for enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecium, and the total aerobic bacterial count decreased in a transient manner in only one patient. regarding anaerobic bacteria, bifidobacterium and eubactrium revealed a significant decrease, a transient decrease or no change from case to case. bacteroides showed little change in count. consequently, the total anaerobic bacteria count did not reveal a large change aside from 1 case in which bacteroides was not detected before administration and a significant decrease of  other bacteria was noted. in no case, glucose nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli or fungi were found dominant. although c. difficile and c. difficile d-1  antigen were detected in 3 and 4 cases, respectively, there was no exact relationship between the number of c. difficile and the characteristics of the feces. cpr was detected in fecal samples from 6 cases during administration with  concentrations ranging between 1.20 to 22.4 micrograms/g. high values of cpr tended to be found in specimens with low beta-lactamase activity in the feces. when drug sensitivities of the bacteria isolated from feces before and after administration were compared, higher levels of resistance were found in some bacteria such as enterococci and bacteroides during or after administration than  before administration. the above results suggest that cpr is a drug with a relatively small influence on the intestinal bacterial flora in children, but a particular attention is required for diarrhea and microbial replacement during a  continuous, long-term administration of the drug.

TI  == intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime in the treatment of serious infections.
AB  == seventy-one adult patients with 72 infections were treated, by random selection,  with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin or intravenously administered ceftazidime. twenty-seven additional patients with 29 infections who were not appropriate for  random assignment were treated in an open study with intravenously administered ciprofloxacin only; the latter infections were generally more serious or were caused by ceftazidime-resistant organisms. the most common doses were ciprofloxacin, 200 mg intravenously and 500 mg orally every 12 hours and ceftazidime, 1 to 2 g intravenously every eight to 12 hours. forty-seven ciprofloxacin-treated infections and 31 ceftazidime-treated infections were evaluable for determination of efficacy. infections included lower respiratory tract (21 infections), urinary (37 infections), skin/soft tissue (14 infections), bacteremia/endocarditis (four infections), colitis (one infection), and mastoiditis (one infection). median minimal inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were, respectively: for enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, and branhamella catarrhalis, no more than 0.06 and no more than 0.25 micrograms/ml; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml; for enterococcus faecalis, 1 and more than 32 micrograms/ml; and for staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 and 8 micrograms/ml. ciprofloxacin, 200 mg intravenously, yielded mean serum concentrations 0.5 and eight hours post-intravenous infusion of 2.3 and 0.7 micrograms/ml, respectively. satisfactory clinical responses were achieved in 17 (81 percent) of 21 patients with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin, 22 (71 percent) of 31 patients with ceftazidime, and 20 (77 percent) of 26 patients with intravenous ciprofloxacin. the most common treatment failures occurred in complicated skin/soft-tissue infections treated with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin, complicated urinary tract infections treated with ceftazidime, and necrotizing p. aeruginosa pneumonia treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin; the pneumonia patients all had respiratory failure and had been previously unresponsive to treatment with other  appropriate drugs. serious adverse reactions were observed in three patients, seizures with intravenous ciprofloxacin in two patients, and clostridium difficile diarrhea with ceftazidime in one patient. we conclude that sequential intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were comparable in efficacy and safety; the ability to change from intravenous to oral therapy is a major convenience. intravenous ciprofloxacin was useful for more serious infections, often caused by ceftazidime-resistant organisms.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  == lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. in this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated  antimicrobials. lomefloxacin was very active against enterobacteriaceae (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). in common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of neisseria spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), haemophilus spp. (mic90, less  than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), legionella spp. (mic90, less than or equal  to 0.06 micrograms/ml), vibrio spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of bacteroides spp. (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) or clostridium difficile mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of clostridium perfringens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), chlamydia trachomatis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), mycoplasma hominis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), and urea-plasma urealyticum (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the mic with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the mic. these results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections  caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by s. aureus.

TI  == ciprofloxacin in combination with metronidazole.
AB  == ciprofloxacin has a reduced activity against anaerobic pathogens. therefore, a combination of ciprofloxacin with an antimicrobial agent active against anaerobes, such as metronidazole, seems to be interesting for the treatment of mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections. high metronidazole concentrations (10 mg/l or 40 mg/l) neither affected the bactericidal efficacy of ciprofloxacin on aerobic pathogens, such as escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, nor on the anaerobic pathogens clostridium  perfringens and clostridium difficile, as demonstrated by kill-kinetic curves. the same high concentrations, as well as lower therapeutically achievable concentration (2 mg/l or 5 mg/l) of metronidazole in combination with ciprofloxacin were slightly more potent for the tested clostridia than ciprofloxacin or metronidazole alone.

TI  == homology of a transferable tetracycline resistance determinant of clostridium difficile with streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis transposon tn916.
AB  == in several tetracycline-resistant (tetr) clostridium difficile strains, homology  with the tn916 part of plasmid pam120 dna was observed. this 15-kilobase transposon, carrying a tetr determinant, was originally found in streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis. hybridization experiments revealed that at least six of  seven hincii fragments of tn916, representing greater than 95% of its length, showed homology with dna of tetr c. difficile strains. therefore, a close relationship of the c. difficile tetr-determining element with the entire tn916 transposon can be assumed, although differences were observed concerning the number of hindiii cleavage sites within the transposon. in addition to strong hybridization of tetr determinants of c. difficile with tn916, weak signals were  detected when dna of tets c. difficile was hybridized with tn916. these weak signals could be attributed to a single internal hincii fragment of tn916.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of aridicins, novel glycopeptide antibiotics with high and prolonged levels in blood.
AB  == three new glycopeptide antibiotics, aridicins a, b, and c, produced by kibdelosporangium aridum have a spectrum of antimicrobial activity in vitro which is similar to that of vancomycin. the antimicrobial activities of these glycopeptides against clinical bacterial isolates were compared with those of vancomycin and other related glycopeptide antibiotics in vitro by agar dilution and microtiter broth dilution tests and in vivo in mouse protection studies. in vitro they were somewhat less effective than vancomycin against strains of staphylococcus aureus and less active against coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. however, they were more active than vancomycin against strains of streptococcus faecalis and markedly superior to vancomycin and other glycopeptide antibiotics against strains of clostridium difficile. in experimental infections, aridicin a was effective against strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pyogenes, although its 50% effective doses were higher than those of vancomycin when administered after infection. after subcutaneous administration, aridicin a had a higher peak level in serum and a longer half-life than vancomycin or teicoplanin. the aridicins were markedly superior to vancomycin when administered prior to infection in mouse protection tests, indicating long-acting potential.

AB  == the effects of sulphasalazine (sasp), azodisal sodium (ads), and their metabolites were tested in vitro on aerobic and anaerobic faecal bacterial strains. sulphapyridine (sp) had a mild to moderate effect on escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. sasp also had a growth-inhibitory effect on strep. faecalis. the other substances had no effect on the aerobic strains. sasp, sp, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and, to a certain extent, n-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid exerted a growth-inhibitory effect on the anaerobic strains. of special interest  was the inhibitory effect on clostridium difficile strains. in recent years the possibility that overgrowth of cl. difficile could cause flare-ups of inflammatory bowel disease has been discussed. some studies suggested that sasp treatment could predispose to cl. difficile superinfection, whereas others found  sasp more probable to exert a prophylactic effect. our findings support the theory that sasp treatment reduces rather than promotes the risk of cl. difficile superinfection.
