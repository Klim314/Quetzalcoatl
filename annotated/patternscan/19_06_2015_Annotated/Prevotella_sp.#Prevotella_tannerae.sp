TI  == comparison of bacterial culture and 16s rrna community profiling by clonal analysis and pyrosequencing for the characterization of the dentine caries-associated microbiome.
AB  == culture-independent analyses have greatly expanded knowledge regarding the composition of complex bacterial communities including those associated with oral diseases. a consistent finding from such studies, however, has been the under-reporting of members of the phylum actinobacteria. in this study, five pairs of broad range primers targeting 16s rrna genes were used in clonal analysis of 6 samples collected from tooth lesions involving dentine in subjects  with active caries. samples were also subjected to cultural analysis and pyrosequencing by means of the 454 platform. a diverse bacterial community of 229 species-level taxa was revealed by culture and clonal analysis, dominated by representatives of the genera prevotella, lactobacillus, selenomonas, and streptococcus. the five most abundant species were: lactobacillus gasseri, prevotella denticola, alloprevotella tannerae, s. mutans and streptococcus sp. hot 070, which together made up 31.6 % of the sequences. two samples were dominated by lactobacilli, while the remaining samples had low numbers of lactobacilli but significantly higher numbers of prevotella species. the different primer pairs produced broadly similar data but proportions of the phylum bacteroidetes were significantly higher when primer 1387r was used. all of the primer sets underestimated the proportion of actinobacteria compared to culture. pyrosequencing analysis of the samples was performed to a depth of sequencing of 4293 sequences per sample which were identified to 264 species-level taxa, and resulted in significantly higher coverage estimates than  the clonal analysis. pyrosequencing, however, also underestimated the relative abundance of actinobacteria compared to culture.

TI  == description of alloprevotella rava gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity, and reclassification of prevotella tannerae moore et al. 1994 as alloprevotella tannerae gen. nov., comb. nov.
AB  == five strains of anaerobic, gram-negative bacilli isolated from the human oral cavity were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests  and were found to comprise a homogeneous group. phylogenetic analysis of full-length 16s rrna gene sequences showed that these strains represented a novel group within the family prevotellaceae, and the most closely related species was  prevotella tannerae. p. tannerae and the novel taxon are deeply branched from the genus prevotella, with sequence identities to the type strain of the type species of prevotella, prevotella melaninogenica, of 82.2 and 85.6 %, respectively. the novel genus alloprevotella gen. nov. is proposed to accommodate the novel species alloprevotella rava gen. nov., sp. nov. and the previously named prevotella tannerae moore et al. 1994 as alloprevotella tannerae gen. nov., comb. nov. the type species is alloprevotella tannerae. the type strain of alloprevotella rava is 81/4-12(t) ( = dsm 22548(t) = ccug 58091(t)) and the type strain of alloprevotella tannerae is atcc 51259(t) = ccug 34292(t) = cip 104476(t) = nctc 13073(t). alloprevotella rava is weakly to moderately saccharolytic and produces  moderate amounts of acetic acid and major amounts of succinic acid as end products of fermentation. strains are sensitive to 20 % bile and hydrolyse gelatin. the principal cellular long-chain fatty acids are anteiso-c15 : 0, iso-c15 : 0, c16 : 0, iso-c17 : 0 and iso-c17 : 0 3-oh. the g+c content of the dna of the type strain is 47 mol%.

TI  == microbiota of deciduous endodontic infections analysed by mda and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the microbiota of endodontic infections in deciduous teeth by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization after uniform amplification of dna in samples  by multiple displacement amplification (mda). methodology: forty samples from the root canal system of deciduous teeth exhibiting pulp necrosis with or without radiographically detectable periradicular/interradicular bone resorption were collected and 32 were analysed, with three individuals contributing two samples;  these were mda-amplified and analysed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization for levels of 83 bacterial taxa. two outcome measures were used: the percentage of teeth colonized by each species and the mean proportion of each bacterial taxon present across all samples. results: the mean amount of dna in the samples prior  to amplification was 5.2 (+/-4.7) ng and 6.1 (+/-2.3) mug after mda. the mean number of species detected per sample was 19 (+/-4) (range: 3-66) to the nearest  whole number. the most prevalent taxa were prevotella intermedia (96.9%), neisseria mucosa (65.6%), prevotella nigrescens (56.2%) and tannerella forsythia  (56.2%). aggregatibacter (haemophilus) aphrophilus and helicobacter pylori were not detected. p. intermedia (10%), prevotella tannerae (7%) and prevotella nigrescens (4.3%) presented the highest mean proportions of the target species averaged across the positive samples. conclusion: root canals of infected deciduous teeth had a diverse bacterial population. prevotella sp. were commonly  found with p. intermedia, prevotella tannerae and prevotella nigrescens amongst the most prominent species detected.

TI  == descriptions of prevotella tannerae sp. nov. and prevotella enoeca sp. nov. from  the human gingival crevice and emendation of the description of prevotella zoogleoformans.
AB  == prevotella tannerae sp. nov. and prevotella enoeca sp. nov. from the human gingival crevice are described. these organisms are obligately anaerobic, non-spore-forming, nonmotile, gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria that ferment carbohydrates and produce succinic and acetic acids. bile inhibits growth. some strains (38%) of p. tannerae produce colonies with a tan to black pigment when they are grown on rabbit blood agar. the type strains are p. tannerae atcc 51259  and p. enoeca atcc 51261. in addition, the description of prevotella zoogleoformans is emended to exclude strains now recognized as members of prevotella heparinolytica.
