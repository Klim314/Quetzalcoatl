TI  == effect of weissella cibaria isolates on the formation of streptococcus mutans biofilm.
AB  == the objective of this study was to isolate and identify lactic acid bacteria able to inhibit the in vitro formation of streptococcus mutans biofilm as well as the  in vivo formation of oral biofilm. two strains, cms1 and cms3, exhibiting profound inhibitory effects on the formation of s. mutans biofilm and the proliferation of s. mutans, were isolated from children's saliva and identified as weissella cibaria by 16s rdna sequencing. the water-soluble polymers produced  from sucrose by the w. cibaria isolates also inhibited the formation of s. mutans biofilm. according to the results of thin-layer chromatographic analysis, the hydrolysates of water-soluble polymers produced by the isolates were identical to those of dextran, forming mostly alpha-(1-6) glucose linkages. in the clinical study, the subjects mouthrinsed with a solution containing w. cibaria cms1 evidenced plaque index reduction of approximately 20.7% (p < 0.001). these results indicate that the w. cibaria isolates possess the ability to inhibit biofilm formation, both in vitro and in vivo.
