TI  == sunlight-induced rapid and efficient biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles using aqueous leaf extract of linn. with enhanced antibacterial activity.
AB  == background: nanotechnology is now regarded as a distinct field of research in modern science and technology with multifaceted areas including biomedical applications. among the various approaches currently available for the generation of metallic nanoparticles, biogenic synthesis is of increasing demand for the purpose of green nanotechnology. among various natural sources, plant materials are the most readily available template-directing matrix offering cost-effectiveness, eco-friendliness, and easy handling. moreover, the inherent pharmacological potentials of these medicinal plant extracts offer added biomedical implementations of the synthesized metal nanoparticles. results: a robust practical method for eco-friendly synthesis of silver nanoparticles using  aqueous leaf extract of ocimum sanctum (tulsi) as both reducing and capping agent, under the influence of direct sunlight has been developed without applying any other chemical additives. the nanoparticles were characterized with the help  of uv-visible spectrophotometer and transmission electron microscopy (tem). the prepared silver nanoparticles exhibited considerable antibacterial activity. the  effects were more pronounced on non-endospore-forming gram-positive bacteria viz., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and listeria monocytogenes than endospore-forming species bacillus subtilis. the nanoparticles also showed prominent activity on gram-negative human pathogenic salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and plant pathogenic pantoea ananatis. a bactericidal mode of action was observed for both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by the nanoparticles. conclusions: we have developed a very simple, efficient, and practical method for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles using aqueous leaf extract of o. sanctum under the influence of direct sunlight. the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles making use of such a traditionally important medicinal plant without applying any other chemical additives, thus offers a cost-effective and environmentally benign route for their large-scale commercial production. the nanoparticles dispersed in the mother solution showed promising antibacterial efficacy. graphical abstractsunlight-induced rapid and efficient biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles using aqueous leaf extract of ocimum sanctum linn. with enhanced antibacterial activity.

TI  == metabolic engineering of escherichia coli to produce zeaxanthin.
AB  == zeaxanthin is a high-value carotenoid that is used in nutraceuticals, cosmetics,  food, and animal feed industries. zeaxanthin is chemically synthesized or purified from microorganisms as a natural product; however, increasing demand requires development of alternative sources such as heterologous biosynthesis by  recombinant bacteria. for this purpose, we molecularly engineered escherichia coli to optimize the synthesis of zeaxanthin from lycopene using fusion protein-mediated substrate channeling as well as by the introduction of tunable intergenic regions. the tunable intergenic regions approach was more efficient compared with protein fusion for coordinating expression of lycopene beta-cyclase gene crty and beta-carotene 3-hydroxylase gene crtz. the influence of the substrate channeling effect suggests that the reaction catalyzed by crtz is the rate-limiting step in zeaxanthin biosynthesis. then pantoea ananatis, pantoea agglomerans and haematococcus pluvialis crtz were compared. because p. ananatis crtz is superior to that of p. agglomerans or h. pluvialis for zeaxanthin production, we used it to generate a recombinant strain of e. coli beta-1 containing pzspba-2(p37-crtzpan) that produced higher amounts of zeaxanthin (11.95 +/- 0.21 mg/g dry cell weight) than other engineered e. coli strains described in the literature.

TI  == carotenoid analysis of a liverwort marchantia polymorpha and functional identification of its lycopene beta- and epsilon-cyclase genes.
AB  == carotenoid biosynthesis in bryophytes has yet to be clarified. the liverwort marchantia polymorpha l. is known to be an early land plant and is an emerging bryophyte model. in order to gain insight into the evolution of carotenoid biosynthesis in plants, we studied carotenoid biosynthesis in this liverwort. as  is the case in higher plants, liverwort thalli contain lutein and beta-carotene,  as major carotenoids, as well as zeaxanthin, antheraxanthin, violaxanthin and 9'-cis-neoxanthin. based on liverwort expressed sequence tag (est)/cdna and genome sequences, we isolated two cyclase genes encoding lycopene beta-cyclase (lcyb) and lycopene epsilon-cyclase (lcye), which were involved in the synthesis  of beta-carotene and alpha-carotene. these enzymes were phylogenetically positioned between corresponding proteins of a green alga (chlorophyta) and higher plants. functional analysis of the two genes was performed using a heterologous escherichia coli expression system, in which the pantoea ananatis lycopene biosynthesis genes were co-expressed. the results indicated liverwort lcyb activity for the synthesis of beta-carotene from lycopene, which was the same as that of higher plants. on the other hand, liverwort lcye was able to form two epsilon-rings from lycopene to epsilon-carotene via delta-carotene, which was different from the arabidopsis lcye enzyme which generates only one epsilon-ring  from lycopene.

TI  == 3-beta-glucosyl-3'-beta-quinovosyl zeaxanthin, a novel carotenoid glycoside synthesized by escherichia coli cells expressing the pantoea ananatis carotenoid  biosynthesis gene cluster.
AB  == escherichia coli cells that express the full six carotenoid biosynthesis genes (crte, crtb, crti, crty, crtz, and crtx) of the bacterium pantoea ananatis have been shown to biosynthesize zeaxanthin 3,3'-beta-d-diglucoside. we found that this recombinant e. coli also produced a novel carotenoid glycoside that contained a rare carbohydrate moiety, quinovose (chinovose; 6-deoxy-d-glucose), which was identified as 3-beta-glucosyl-3'-beta-quinovosyl zeaxanthin by chromatographic and spectroscopic analyses. the chirality of the aglycone of these zeaxanthin glycosides had been shown to be 3r,3'r, in which the hydroxyl groups were formed with the crtz enzyme. it was here demonstrated that zeaxanthin synthesized from beta-carotene with crtr or cyp175a1, the other hydroxylase with  similar catalytic function to crtz, possessed the same stereochemistry. it was also suggested that the singlet oxygen-quenching activity of zeaxanthin 3,3'-beta-d-diglucoside, which has a chemical structure close to the new carotenoid glycoside, was superior to that of zeaxanthin.

TI  == a new pentacyclic triterpene with potent antibacterial activity from limnophila indica linn. (druce).
AB  == a new pentacyclic triterpenoid constituent, characterized as 3-oxo-olean-12(13),18(19)-dien-29alpha-carboxylic acid (1) on the basis of detailed spectral studies, was isolated from the aerial parts and roots of limnophila indica (scrophulariaceae). compound 1 exhibited considerable antibacterial activity against three gram-positive bacteria viz. bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus and listeria monocytogenes (mics within a range of 25-30 mug/ml) and moderate activity against four gram-negative bacteria salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pantoea ananatis (mics within a range of 30-100 mug/ml). the plant pathogenic bacterium p. ananatis and human pathogenic s. typhimurium responded at comparatively higher concentrations of the compound 1, which were 75 and 100 mug/ml respectively. the  compound inhibited the growth of gram-positive b. subtilis and gram-negative p. aeruginosa completely with a clear bactericidal mode of action at their mic values. the compound upon treatment on both b. subtilis and p. aeruginosa released substantial amount of nucleic acid in the external medium and also effected the change of morphology towards pleomorphicity, thereby indicating its  probable action on cell membrane. furthermore, the triterpenoid 1 was found not to inhibit a probiotic lactic acid bacterium lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis labw4 under in vitro condition and to possess no toxicity in swiss albino mice.

TI  == high saturated fatty acids proportion in escherichia coli enhances the activity of ice-nucleation protein from pantoea ananatis.
AB  == the ice-nucleation protein (inp) from pantoea ananatis was expressed in escherichia coli. inp expression increased the freezing point of the e. coli culture by a few degrees. deletion of fabh, an important enzyme in fatty acid biosynthesis, significantly inhibited the ice-nucleation activity. increased unsaturated fatty acids in the fabh mutant cells decreased the ice-nucleation activity. adding exogenous saturated fatty acids increased both e. coli fatty acid saturation and the ice-nucleation activity. in contrast, adding unsaturated  fatty acids exhibited the opposite effects. furthermore, an e. coli mg1655-fadr strain with high saturated fatty acids content was constructed, in which the inp  activity was enhanced by about 17% compared with its activity in the wild-type mg1655 strain.

TI  == a novel l-isoleucine-4'-dioxygenase and l-isoleucine dihydroxylation cascade in pantoea ananatis.
AB  == a unique operon structure has been identified in the genomes of several plant- and insect-associated bacteria. the distinguishing feature of this operon is the  presence of tandem hila and hilb genes encoding dioxygenases belonging to the pf13640 and pf10014 (bsma) pfam families, respectively. the genes encoding hila and hilb from pantoea ananatis aj13355 were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the culturing of e. coli cells expressing hila (e. coli-hila) or both hila  and hilb (e. coli-hilab) in the presence of l-isoleucine resulted in the conversion of l-isoleucine into two novel biogenic compounds: l-4'-isoleucine and l-4,4'-dihydroxyisoleucine, respectively. in parallel, two novel enzymatic activities were detected in the crude cell lysates of the e. coli-hila and e. coli-hilab strains: l-isoleucine, 2-oxoglutarate: oxygen oxidoreductase (4'-hydroxylating) (hila) and l-4'-hydroxyisoleucine, 2-oxoglutarate: oxygen oxidoreductase (4-hydroxylating) (hilb), respectively. two hypotheses regarding the physiological significance of c-4(4')-hydroxylation of l-isoleucine in bacteria are also discussed. according to first hypothesis, the l-isoleucine dihydroxylation cascade is involved in synthesis of dipeptide antibiotic in p. ananatis. another unifying hypothesis is that the c-4(4')-hydroxylation of l-isoleucine in bacteria could result in the synthesis of signal molecules belonging to two classes: 2(5h)-furanones and analogs of n-acyl homoserine lactone.

TI  == structure of the o-antigen of the lipopolysaccharide isolated from pantoea ananatis aep17, a rhizobacterium associated with rice.
AB  == the lipopolysaccharide of a gram-negative bacterium having a putative plant-growth promoting activity (pantoea ananatis aep17) has been isolated and subjected to partial hydrolysis. the o-antigen has been studied by mass spectrometry and nmr experiments. on the basis of these experiments it is concluded that the following repeating unit is present in the polysaccharide: -->3)-beta-d-glcpnac-(1-->3)[alpha-d-galpan-(1-->2)]-alpha-l-rhap-(1-->2)-alpha-l -rhap-(1-->3)-alpha-l-rhap-(1-->2)-alpha-l-rhap-(1--> the occurrence of d-galacturonamide (galan) is unusual in bacterial o-polysaccharides. it has only  been reported in escherichia coli o65 [perry, m. b.; maclean, l. l. carbohydr. res.1999, 322, 57-66].

TI  == the biology of habitat dominance; can microbes behave as weeds?
AB  == competition between microbial species is a product of, yet can lead to a reduction in, the microbial diversity of specific habitats. microbial habitats can resemble ecological battlefields where microbial cells struggle to dominate and/or annihilate each other and we explore the hypothesis that (like plant weeds) some microbes are genetically hard-wired to behave in a vigorous and ecologically aggressive manner. these 'microbial weeds' are able to dominate the  communities that develop in fertile but uncolonized--or at least partially vacant--habitats via traits enabling them to out-grow competitors; robust tolerances to habitat-relevant stress parameters and highly efficient energy-generation systems; avoidance of or resistance to viral infection, predation and grazers; potent antimicrobial systems; and exceptional abilities to sequester and store resources. in addition, those associated with nutritionally complex habitats are extraordinarily versatile in their utilization of diverse substrates. weed species typically deploy multiple types of antimicrobial including toxins; volatile organic compounds that act as either hydrophobic or highly chaotropic stressors; biosurfactants; organic acids; and moderately chaotropic solutes that are produced in bulk quantities (e.g. acetone, ethanol).  whereas ability to dominate communities is habitat-specific we suggest that some  microbial species are archetypal weeds including generalists such as: pichia anomala, acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas putida; specialists such as dunaliella salina, saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactobacillus spp. and other lactic  acid bacteria; freshwater autotrophs gonyostomum semen and microcystis aeruginosa; obligate anaerobes such as clostridium acetobutylicum; facultative pathogens such as rhodotorula mucilaginosa, pantoea ananatis and pseudomonas aeruginosa; and other extremotolerant and extremophilic microbes such as aspergillus spp., salinibacter ruber and haloquadratum walsbyi. some microbes, such as escherichia coli, mycobacterium smegmatis and pseudoxylaria spp., exhibit characteristics of both weed and non-weed species. we propose that the concept of nonweeds represents a 'dustbin' group that includes species such as synodropsis spp., polypaecilum pisce, metschnikowia orientalis, salmonella spp., and caulobacter crescentus. we show that microbial weeds are conceptually distinct from plant weeds, microbial copiotrophs, r-strategists, and other ecophysiological groups of microorganism. microbial weed species are unlikely to  emerge from stationary-phase or other types of closed communities; it is open habitats that select for weed phenotypes. specific characteristics that are common to diverse types of open habitat are identified, and implications of weed  biology and open-habitat ecology are discussed in the context of further studies  needed in the fields of environmental and applied microbiology.

TI  == heterologous carotenoid-biosynthetic enzymes: functional complementation and effects on carotenoid profiles in escherichia coli.
AB  == a limited number of carotenoid pathway genes from microbial sources have been studied for analyzing the pathway complementation in the heterologous host escherichia coli. in order to systematically investigate the functionality of carotenoid pathway enzymes in e. coli, the pathway genes of carotenogenic microorganisms (brevibacterium linens, corynebacterium glutamicum, rhodobacter sphaeroides, rhodobacter capsulatus, rhodopirellula baltica, and pantoea ananatis) were modified to form synthetic expression modules and then were complemented with pantoea agglomerans pathway enzymes (crte, crtb, crti, crty, and crtz). the carotenogenic pathway enzymes in the synthetic modules showed unusual activities when complemented with e. coli. for example, the expression of heterologous crtes of b. linens, c. glutamicum, and r. baltica influenced p. agglomerans crti to convert its substrate phytoene into a rare product-3,4,3',4'-tetradehydrolycopene-along with lycopene, which was an expected product, indicating that crte, the first enzyme in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, can influence carotenoid profiles. in addition, crtis of r. sphaeroides  and r. capsulatus converted phytoene into an unusual lycopene as well as into neurosporene. thus, this study shows that the functional complementation of pathway enzymes from different sources is a useful methodology for diversifying biosynthesis as nature does.

TI  == the complete genome sequence of pantoea ananatis aj13355, an organism with great  biotechnological potential.
AB  == pantoea ananatis aj13355 is a newly identified member of the enterobacteriaceae family with promising biotechnological applications. this bacterium is able to grow at an acidic ph and is resistant to saturating concentrations of l-glutamic  acid, making this organism a suitable host for the production of l-glutamate. in  the current study, the complete genomic sequence of p. ananatis aj13355 was determined. the genome was found to consist of a single circular chromosome consisting of 4,555,536 bp [ddbj: ap012032] and a circular plasmid, pea320, of 321,744 bp [ddbj: ap012033]. after automated annotation, 4,071 protein-coding sequences were identified in the p. ananatis aj13355 genome. for 4,025 of these genes, functions were assigned based on homologies to known proteins. a high level of nucleotide sequence identity (99%) was revealed between the genome of p. ananatis aj13355 and the previously published genome of p. ananatis lmg 20103. short colinear regions, which are identical to dna sequences in the escherichia coli mg1655 chromosome, were found to be widely dispersed along the p. ananatis aj13355 genome. conjugal gene transfer from e. coli to p. ananatis, mediated by homologous recombination between short identical sequences, was also experimentally demonstrated. the determination of the genome sequence has paved the way for the directed metabolic engineering of p. ananatis to produce biotechnologically relevant compounds.

TI  == engineering of a plasmid-free escherichia coli strain for improved in vivo biosynthesis of astaxanthin.
AB  == background: the xanthophyll astaxanthin is a high-value compound with applications in the nutraceutical, cosmetic, food, and animal feed industries. besides chemical synthesis and extraction from naturally producing organisms like haematococcus pluvialis, heterologous biosynthesis in non-carotenogenic microorganisms like escherichia coli, is a promising alternative for sustainable  production of natural astaxanthin. recent achievements in the metabolic engineering of e. coli strains have led to a significant increase in the productivity of carotenoids like lycopene or beta-carotene by increasing the metabolic flux towards the isoprenoid precursors. for the heterologous biosynthesis of astaxanthin in e. coli, however, the conversion of beta-carotene  to astaxanthin is obviously the most critical step towards an efficient biosynthesis of astaxanthin. results: here we report the construction of the first plasmid-free e. coli strain that produces astaxanthin as the sole carotenoid compound with a yield of 1.4 mg/g cdw (e. coli bw-asta). this engineered e. coli strain harbors xanthophyll biosynthetic genes from pantoea ananatis and nostoc punctiforme as individual expression cassettes on the chromosome and is based on a beta-carotene-producing strain (e. coli bw-caro) recently developed in our lab. e. coli bw-caro has an enhanced biosynthesis of the isoprenoid precursor isopentenyl diphosphate (ipp) and produces beta-carotene in a concentration of 6.2 mg/g cdw. the expression of crtebiy along with the beta-carotene-ketolase gene crtw148 (npf4798) and the beta-carotene-hydroxylase gene (crtz) under controlled expression conditions in e. coli bw-asta directed the pathway exclusively towards the desired product astaxanthin (1.4 mg/g cdw). conclusions: by using the lambda-red recombineering technique, genes encoding for the astaxanthin biosynthesis pathway were stably integrated into the chromosome of e. coli. the expression levels of chromosomal integrated recombinant biosynthetic genes were varied and adjusted to improve the ratios of carotenoids  produced by this e. coli strain. the strategy presented, which combines chromosomal integration of biosynthetic genes with the possibility of adjusting expression by using different promoters, might be useful as a general approach for the construction of stable heterologous production strains synthesizing natural products. this is the case especially for heterologous pathways where excessive protein overexpression is a hindrance.

TI  == identification of pantoea ananatis gene encoding membrane pyrroloquinoline quinone (pqq)-dependent glucose dehydrogenase and pqqabcdef operon essential for  pqq biosynthesis.
AB  == pantoea ananatis accumulates gluconate during aerobic growth in the presence of glucose. computer analysis of the p. ananatis sc17(0) sequenced genome revealed an orf encoding a homologue (named gcd) of the mgdh (ec 1.1.99.17) apoenzyme from escherichia coli and a putative pyrroloquinoline quinone (pqq) biosynthetic operon homologous to pqqabcdef from klebsiella pneumoniae. construction of deltagcd and deltapqq mutants of p. ananatis confirmed the proposed functions of  these genetic elements. the p. ananatis pqqabcdef was cloned in vivo and integrated into the chromosomes of p. ananatis and e. coli according to the dual  in/out strategy. introduction of a second copy of pqqabcdef to p. ananatis sc17(0) doubled the accumulation of pqq. integration of the operon into e. coli mg1655deltaptsgdeltamanxy restored the growth of bacteria on glucose. the obtained data show the essential role of pqqabcdef in pqq biosynthesis in p. ananatis and e. coli. we propose that the cloned operon could be useful for an efficient phosphoenolpyruvate-independent glucose consumption pathway due to glucose oxidation and construction of e. coli strains with the advantage of phosphoenolpyruvate-derived metabolite production.

TI  == biosynthesis of zeaxanthin in recombinant pseudomonas putida.
AB  == pseudomonas putida kt2440 strain was investigated for biosynthesis of the valuable xanthophyll zeaxanthin. a new plasmid was constructed harboring five carotenogenic genes from pantoea ananatis and three genes from escherichia coli under control of an l: -rhamnose-inducible promoter. pseudomonas putida kt2440 wild type hardly tolerated the plasmids for carotenoid production. mating experiments with e. coli s17-1 strains revealed that the carotenoid products are  toxic to the pseudomonas putida cells. several carotenoid-tolerant transposon mutants could be isolated, and different gene targets for relief of carotenoid toxicity were identified. after optimization of cultivation conditions and product processing, 51 mg/l zeaxanthin could be produced, corresponding to a product yield of 7 mg zeaxanthin per gram cell dry weight. the effect of various  additives on production of hydrophobic zeaxanthin was investigated as well. particularly, the addition of lecithin during cell cultivation increased volumetric productivity of pseudomonas putida by a factor of 4.7 (51 mg/l vs. 239 mg/l).

TI  == the lycopene cyclase crty from pantoea ananatis (formerly erwinia uredovora) catalyzes an fadred-dependent non-redox reaction.
AB  == the cyclization of lycopene generates provitamin a carotenoids such as beta-carotene and paves the way toward the formation of cyclic xanthophylls playing distinct roles in photosynthesis and as precursors for regulatory molecules in plants and animals. the biochemistry of lycopene cyclization has been enigmatic, as the previously proposed acid-base catalysis conflicted with the possibility of redox catalysis as predicted by the presence of a dinucleotide binding site. we show that reduced fad is the essential lycopene cyclase (crty) cofactor. using flavin analogs, mass spectrometry, and mutagenesis, evidence was  obtained based on which a catalytic mechanism relying on cryptic (net) electron transfer can be refuted. the role of reduced fad is proposed to reside in the stabilization of a transition state carrying a (partial) positive charge or of a  positively charged intermediate via a charge transfer interaction, acid-base catalysis serving as the underlying catalytic principle. lycopene cyclase, thus,  ranks among the novel class of non-redox flavoproteins, such as isopentenyl diphosphate:dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase type 2 (idi-2) that requires the  reduced form of the cofactor.

TI  == broad-range pcr, cloning and sequencing of the full 16s rrna gene for detection of bacterial dna in synovial fluid samples of tunisian patients with reactive and undifferentiated arthritis.
AB  == introduction: broad-range rdna pcr provides an alternative, cultivation-independent approach for identifying bacterial dna in reactive and other form of arthritis. the aim of this study was to use broad-range rdna pcr targeting the 16s rrna gene in patients with reactive and other forms of arthritis and to screen for the presence of dna from any given bacterial species  in synovial fluid (sf) samples. methods: we examined the sf samples from a total  of 27 patients consisting of patients with reactive arthritis (rea) (n = 5), undifferentiated arthritis (ua) (n = 9), rheumatoid arthritis (n = 7), and osteoarthritis (n = 6) of which the latter two were used as controls. using broad-range bacterial pcr amplifying a 1400 bp fragment from the 16s rrna gene, we identified and sequenced at least 24 clones from each sf sample. to identify the corresponding bacteria, dna sequences were compared to the embl (european molecular biology laboratory) database. results: bacterial dna was identified in  20 of the 27 sf samples (74, 10%). analysis of a large number of sequences revealed the presence of dna from more than one single bacterial species in the sf of all patients studied. the nearly complete sequences of the 1400 bp were obtained for most of the detected species. dna of bacterial species including shigella species, escherichia species, and other coli-form bacteria as well as opportunistic pathogens such as stenotrophomonas maltophilia and achromobacter xylosoxidans were shared in all arthritis patients. among pathogens described to  trigger rea, dna from shigella sonnei was found in rea and ua patients. we also detected dna from rarely occurring human pathogens such as aranicola species and  pantoea ananatis. we also found dna from bacteria so far not described in human infections such as bacillus niacini, paenibacillus humicus, diaphorobacter species and uncultured bacterium genera incertae sedis op10. conclusions: broad-range pcr followed by cloning and sequencing the entire 16s rdna, allowed the identification of the bacterial dna environment in the sf samples of arthritic patients. we found a wide spectrum of bacteria including those known to be involved in rea and others not previously associated with arthritis.

TI  == isolation of an operon involved in xylitol metabolism from a xylitol-utilizing pantoea ananatis mutant.
AB  == an operon involved in cryptic xylitol metabolism of pantoea ananatis was cloned by transposon tagging. a xylitol negative mutant with a transposon insertion in the xylitol 4-dehydrogenase gene (xdh) was isolated and genomic dna around the transposon was sequenced. consequently, six consecutive genes, xytb-g are located downstream of xdh in the same strand. these seven genes are cotranscribed as a single transcript in a p. ananatis xylitol-utilizing mutant, suggesting that they comprise an operon. in addition to xdh, xytf also encodes oxidoreductase that is  a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. recombinant escherichia coli that heterologously expresses the xdh protein converts xylitol to xylulose as expected. on the other hand, the recombinant xytf protein has activity with l-arabitol but not with xylitol. xytb, xytd and xyte have significant sequence similarities to genes encoding the substrate-binding, atp-binding and permease subunits, respectively, of atp-binding cassette transporters. although the physiological role of the operon remains unknown, the  operon appears to be involved in uptake and metabolism of a various sugar alcohols. a gene encoding a deor-type transcriptional regulator, xytr, is located upstream of the operon in the opposite strand and a single nucleotide substitution that could cause a nonsense mutation is present in the xytr gene of  the xylitol-utilizing mutant. this result suggests that the product of xytr negatively controls expression of the operon like other deor regulators.

TI  == biosynthesis of the vitamin e compound delta-tocotrienol in recombinant escherichia coli cells.
AB  == the biosynthesis of natural products in a fast growing and easy to manipulate heterologous host system, such as escherichia coli, is of increasing interest in  biotechnology. this procedure allows the investigation of complex natural product biosynthesis and facilitates the engineering of pathways. here we describe the cloning and the heterologous expression of tocochromanol (vitamin e) biosynthesis genes in e. coli. tocochromanols are synthesized solely in photosynthetic organisms (cyanobacteria, algae, and higher green plants). for recombinant tocochromanol biosynthesis, the genes encoding hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase  (hpd), geranylgeranylpyrophosphate synthase (crte), geranylgeranylpyrophosphate reductase (ggh), homogentisate phytyltransferase (hpt), and tocopherol-cyclase (cyc) were cloned in a stepwise fashion and expressed in e. coli. recombinant e.  coli cells were cultivated and analyzed for tocochromanol compounds and their biosynthesis precursors. the expression of only hpd from pseudomonas putida or crte from pantoea ananatis resulted in the accumulation of 336 mg l(-1) homogentisate and 84 microg l(-1) geranylgeranylpyrophosphate in e. coli cultures. simultaneous expression of hpd, crte, and hpt from synechocystis sp. under the control of single tac-promoter resulted in the production of methyl-6-geranylgeranyl-benzoquinol (67.9 microg g(-1)). additional expression of the tocopherol cyclase gene vte1 from arabidopsis thaliana resulted in the novel  formation of a vitamin e compound-delta-tocotrienol (15 microg g(-1))-in e. coli.

TI  == identification of an alternative translation initiation site for the pantoea ananatis lycopene cyclase (crty) gene in e. coli and its evolutionary conservation.
AB  == previous sequence analyses of the lycopene cyclase gene (crt y) from pantoea ananatis revealed that translation of its protein product in escherichia coli began at the atg start codon. we found, however, that this enzyme could also be produced in e. coli without the atg start codon present. results of experiments using crt y mutants revealed that a gtg (val) sequence, located in-frame and 24 bp downstream of the atg, could act as a potential start codon. additionally, a point-mutated gta (val), replaced from alternative gtg start codon, also displayed its potential as a start codon although the strength as a translation initiation codon was considerably weak. this finding suggests that non-atg codons, especially one base pairing with the anticodon (3'-uac-5') in fmet-trna,  might be also able to function as start codon in translation process. furthermore, amino acid sequence alignment of lycopene cyclases from different sources suggested that a val residue located within the n-terminus of these enzymes might be used as an alternative translation initiation site. in particular, presence of a conserved asp, located in-frame and 12 bp upstream of potential start codon, supports this assumption in view of the fact that asp (gat or gac) can function as part of the shine-dalgano sequence (aggagg).

AB  == background: rsf1010 is a well-studied broad-host-range plasmid able to be mobilized to different bacteria and plants. rsf1010-derived plasmid vectors are widely used in both basic research and industrial applications. in the latter case, exploiting of mobilizable plasmids or even the plasmids possessing negligible mobilization frequency, but containing dna fragments that could promote conjugal transfer, is undesirable because of biosafety considerations. previously, several mutations significantly decreasing efficiency of rsf1010 mobilization have been selected. nevertheless, construction of the rsf1010 derivative lacking all known loci involved in the conjugal transfer has not been  reported yet. results: novel non-mobilizable derivatives of rsf1010 lacking all known dna sequences involved in the mobilization process have been obtained due to the exploiting of lambdared-driven recombination between the plasmid and a constructed in vitro linear dna fragment. to provide auto-regulated transcription of the essential replication gene, repb, the plasmid loci orit, mobc and moba were substituted by the dna fragment containing placuv5-->laci. mobilization of the obtained rsfmob plasmid was not detected in standard tests. the derivative of rsfmob with increased copy number has been obtained after laci elimination. high  stability of both constructed plasmids has been demonstrated in escherichia coli  and pantoea ananatis. design of rsfmob allows easy substitution of placuv5 by any desirable promoter for construction of novel derivatives with changed copy number or host range. conclusion: novel non-mobilizable derivatives of rsf1010 lacking all known dna sequences involved in the mobilization process and stably maintained at least in e. coli and p. ananatis have been constructed. the obtained plasmids became the progenitors of new cloning vectors answering all biosafety requirements of genetically modified organisms used in scale-up production.

TI  == increased beta-carotene production in recombinant escherichia coli harboring an engineered isoprenoid precursor pathway with mevalonate addition.
AB  == when pt-lycm4 containing lycopene synthetic genes was co-transformed with psucrty or pshcrty containing crty gene of pantoea ananatis (p. ananatis) or pantoea agglomerans (p. agglomerans), beta-carotene productions of 36 and 35 mg/l were obtained, respectively. no lycopene was detected in the beta-carotene production  culture. pt-hb, constructed by addition of p. ananatis crty gene into pt-lycm4, was used for co-transformation with psdxs and pssn12didi, which increased isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate synthesis. beta-carotene production significantly increased 1.5-fold (51 mg/l) with the amplification of the dxs gene through psdxs and 4-fold (135 mg/l) with the mevalonate bottom pathway of pssn12didi in the presence of 3.3 mm mevalonate. the pt-dhb, constructed by integrating the dxs gene into pt-hb, was used for cotransformation of escherichia coli (e. coli) harboring pssn12didi, resulting in beta-carotene production of 141 mg/l. recombinant e. coli harboring pt-dhb and pssn12didi was used to maximize beta-carotene production by adjusting the available amounts of glycerol, a carbon source, and mevalonate, the precursor of the mevalonate bottom pathway. when recombinant e. coli was given 16.5 mm mevalonate and 2.5% (w/v) glycerol, beta-carotene production of 503 mg/l in concentration and 49.3 mg/g dcw in content was obtained at 144 h, which was the highest level of carotenoid production in e. coli ever reported in the literature.

TI  == metabolic engineering of carotenoid biosynthesis in escherichia coli by ordered gene assembly in bacillus subtilis.
AB  == we attempted to optimize the production of zeaxanthin in escherichia coli by reordering five biosynthetic genes in the natural carotenoid cluster of pantoea ananatis. newly designed operons for zeaxanthin production were constructed by the ordered gene assembly in bacillus subtilis (ogab) method, which can assemble  multiple genes in one step using an intrinsic b. subtilis plasmid transformation  system. the highest level of production of zeaxanthin in e. coli (820 microg/g [dry weight]) was observed in the transformant with a plasmid in which the gene order corresponds to the order of the zeaxanthin metabolic pathway (crte-crtb-crti-crty-crtz), among a series of plasmids with circularly permuted gene orders. although two of five operons using intrinsic zeaxanthin promoters failed to assemble in b. subtilis, the full set of operons was obtained by repressing operon expression during ogab assembly with a p(r) promoter-ci repressor system. this result suggests that repressing the expression of foreign  genes in b. subtilis is important for their assembly by the ogab method. for all  tested operons, the abundance of mrna decreased monotonically with the increasing distance of the gene from the promoter in e. coli, and this may influence the yield of zeaxanthin. our results suggest that rearrangement of biosynthetic genes in the order of the metabolic pathway by the ogab method could be a useful approach for metabolic engineering.

TI  == engineering the lycopene synthetic pathway in e. coli by comparison of the carotenoid genes of pantoea agglomerans and pantoea ananatis.
AB  == the lycopene synthetic pathway was engineered in escherichia coli using the carotenoid genes (crte, crtb, and crti) of pantoea agglomerans and pantoea ananatis. e. coli harboring the p. agglomerans crt genes produced 27 mg/l of lycopene in 2yt medium without isopropyl-beta-d: -thiogalactopyranoside (iptg) induction, which was twofold higher than that produced by e. coli harboring the p. ananatis crt genes (12 mg/l lycopene) with 0.1 mm iptg induction. the crt genes of p. agglomerans proved better for lycopene production in e. coli than those of p. ananatis. the crt genes of the two bacteria were also compared in e.  coli harboring the mevalonate bottom pathway, which was capable of providing sufficient carotenoid building blocks, isopentenyl diphosphate (ipp) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (dmapp), with exogenous mevalonate supplementation. lycopene production significantly increased using the mevalonate bottom pathway and 60 mg/l of lycopene was obtained with the p. agglomerans crt genes, which was higher than that obtained with the p. ananatis crt genes (35 mg/l lycopene). when crte among the p. ananatis crt genes was replaced with p. agglomerans crte or archaeoglobus fulgidus gps, both lycopene production and cell growth were similar to that obtained with p. agglomerans crt genes. the crte gene was responsible for the observed difference in lycopene production and cell growth between e. coli harboring the crt genes of p. agglomerans and p. ananatis. as there was no significant difference in lycopene production between e. coli harboring p. agglomerans crte and a. fulgidus gps, farnesyl diphosphate (fpp) synthesis was not rate-limiting in e. coli.

TI  == characterization of bacterial beta-carotene 3,3'-hydroxylases, crtz, and p450 in  astaxanthin biosynthetic pathway and adonirubin production by gene combination in escherichia coli.
AB  == beta-carotene hydroxylase (crtz) is one of rate-limiting enzymes for astaxanthin  production. a complementation analysis was conducted using escherichia coli transformants to compare the catalytic efficiency of bacterial crtz from brevundimonas sp. sd212, paracoccus sp. pc1 (formerly known as alcaligenes sp. pc-1), paracoccus sp. n81106 (agrobacterium aurantiacum), pantoea ananatis (erwinia uredovora 20d3), marine bacterium p99-3, and p450 monooxygenase (cyp175a1) from thermus thermophilus hb27. each crtz or cyp175a1 gene was expressed in e. coli transformants synthesizing canthaxanthin and beta-carotene due to the respective presence of plasmids pac-cantha and paccar16deltacrtx. the  carotenoids that accumulated in the resulting recombinant e. coli cells were examined by chromatographic and spectroscopic analyses. e. coli carrying brevundimonas sp. sd212 crtz showed the highest astaxanthin production efficiency among the transformants examined, while there was no significant difference in the catalytic efficiency for conversion from beta-carotene to zeaxanthin. recombinant e. coli expressing the cyp175a1 gene, in addition to the genes for canthaxanthin synthesis, surprisingly accumulated adonirubin (phoenicoxanthin) as the main product, although the other recombinant e. coli did not accumulate any adonirubin. the present results suggest that the brevundimonas sp. sd212 crtz and t. thermophilus hb27 cyp175a1 genes could, respectively, be used for the efficient production of astaxanthin and adonirubin in heterologous hosts.

TI  == biosynthesis of novel carotenoid families based on unnatural carbon backbones: a  model for diversification of natural product pathways.
AB  == we show that the c40 carotenoid desaturase crti from pantoea ananatis (erwinia uredovora) is capable of desaturating unnaturally long c45 and c50 carotenoid backbones in recombinant e. coli. desaturation step number in these pathways is not very specific, and at least ten new c45 and c50 carotenoids were synthesized. we also present evidence for a novel asymmetric c40 backbone formed by the condensation of farnesyl diphosphate (c15pp) with farnesylgeranyl diphosphate (c25pp), and the subsequent desaturation of this backbone by crti in an atypical  manner. under some conditions, the c40, c45, and c50 carotenoid backbones synthesized in e. coli were monohydroxylated; their desaturation by crti in vitro led to yet more novel carotenoids. challenging crti with larger-than-natural substrates in vivo has allowed us to show that this enzyme regulates desaturation step number by sensing the end groups of its substrate. analysis of the mechanisms by which chemical diversity is generated and propagated through the nascent pathways provides insight into how natural product diversification occurs in nature.

TI  == cloning and expression of a xylitol-4-dehydrogenase gene from pantoea ananatis.
AB  == the pantoea ananatis atcc 43072 mutant strain is capable of growing with xylitol  as the sole carbon source. the xylitol-4-dehydrogenase (xdh) catalyzing the oxidation of xylitol to l-xylulose was isolated from the cell extract of this strain. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein was determined, and an oligonucleotide deduced from this peptide sequence was used to isolate the xylitol-4-dehydrogenase gene (xdh) from a p. ananatis gene library. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 795 bp, encoding the xylitol-4-dehydrogenase, followed by a 5' region of another open reading frame encoding an unknown protein. results from a northern analysis of total rna  isolated from p. ananatis atcc 43072 suggested that xdh is transcribed as part of a polycistronic mrna. reverse transcription-pcr analysis of the transcript confirmed the operon structure and suggested that xdh was the first gene of the operon. homology searches revealed that the predicted amino acid sequence of the  p. ananatis xdh shared significant identity (38 to 51%) with members of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. the p. ananatis xdh gene was successfully overexpressed in escherichia coli, xdh was purified to homogeneity,  and some of its enzymatic properties were determined. the enzyme had a preference for nad+ as the cosubstrate, and in contrast to previous reports, the enzyme also showed a side activity for the d-form of xylulose. xylitol was converted to l-xylulose with a high yield (>80%) by the resting recombinant cells, and the l-xylulose was secreted into the medium. no evidence of d-xylulose being synthesized by the recombinant cells was found.

TI  == posttranscriptional activation of the transcriptional activator rob by dipyridyl  in escherichia coli.
AB  == the transcriptional activator rob consists of an n-terminal domain (ntd) of 120 amino acids responsible for dna binding and promoter activation and a c-terminal  domain (ctd) of 169 amino acids of unknown function. although several thousand molecules of rob are normally present per escherichia coli cell, they activate promoters of the rob regulon poorly. we report here that in cells treated with either 2,2"- or 4,4"-dipyridyl (the latter is not a metal chelator), rob-mediated transcription of various rob regulon promoters was increased substantially. a small, growth-phase-dependent effect of dipyridyl on the rob promoter was observed. however, dipyridyl enhanced rob's activity even when rob was regulated  by a heterologous (lac) promoter showing that the action of dipyridyl is mainly posttranscriptional. mutants lacking from 30 to 166 of the c-terminal amino acids of rob had basal levels of activity similar to that of wild-type cells, but dipyridyl treatment did not enhance this activity. thus, the ctd is not an inhibitor of rob but is required for activation of rob by dipyridyl. in contrast  to its relatively low activity in vivo, rob binding to cognate dna and activation of transcription in vitro is similar to that of mara, which has a homologous ntd  but no ctd. in vitro nuclear magnetic resonance studies demonstrated that 2,2"-dipyridyl binds to rob but not to the ctd-truncated rob or to mara, suggesting that the effect of dipyridyl on rob is direct. thus, it appears that rob can be converted from a low activity state to a high-activity state by a ctd-mediated mechanism in vivo or by purification in vitro.

TI  == dual regulation of inaa by the multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) and superoxide (soxrs) stress response systems of escherichia coli.
AB  == the roles of the marrab (multiple antibiotic resistance) operon and soxrs (superoxide response) genes in the regulation of inaa, an unlinked weak-acid-inducible gene, were studied. inaa expression was estimated from the beta-galactosidase activity of a chromosomal inaa1::lacz transcriptional fusion.  marr mutations that elevate marrab transcription and engender multiple antibiotic resistance elevated inaa expression by 10- to 20-fold over that of the wild-type. similarly, one class of inaa constitutive mutants that mapped to the mar region were multiply antibiotic resistant. overexpression of mara alone on a multicopy plasmid caused high constitutive expression of inaa in a strain with an extensive (39-kbp) marrab deletion. salicylate, an inducer of marrab and of an unidentified mar-independent antibiotic resistance system, induced inaa by 6-fold. a portion of this induction was also mar independent. two soxrs constitutive mutants that were tested showed elevated levels of inaa. paraquat, an inducer of the soxrs system, elevated inaa expression by 6- to 9-fold. this induction was soxrs dependent and not mar dependent, whereas induction of inaa by salicylate was not  dependent on soxrs. paraquat induced resistance to norfloxacin in the mar-deleted strain but not in a soxrs-deleted strain. thus, induction of multiple antibiotic  resistance and inaa by salicylate occurs via mar and an unidentified pathway, while induction by paraquat occurs via soxrs.

TI  == ph dependence and gene structure of inaa in escherichia coli.
AB  == the weak-acid-inducible locus inaa in escherichia coli was mapped to 48.6 min by  p1 cotransduction of inaa mud lac fusions and linked tn10 insertions. the inaa1::lac fusion tested negative for phenotypes characteristic of mutations in the nearby locus ubig. sequence analysis of a fragment amplified by polymerase chain reaction located the inaa1::lac fusion joint within an open reading frame 311 nucleotides downstream of nrdb, transcribed in the opposite direction, encoding a 168-amino-acid polypeptide. constitutive mutant strains identified on  lactose macconkey revealed a novel regulatory locus unlinked to inaa, which mapped at 34 min (designated inar). expression of inaa1::lac increased slightly with external acidification; the presence of benzoate, a membrane-permeant weak acid, greatly increased the acid effect. the expression at various combinations of benzoate and external ph correlated with the decrease in intracellular ph. the uncouplers salicylate and dinitrophenol also caused acid-dependent induction of inaa, but substantial induction was seen at external ph values higher than the internal ph; this effect cannot be caused by internal acidification. nondissociating analogs of benzoate and salicylate, benzyl alcohol and salicyl alcohol, did not induce inaa. expression of inaa was inversely related to growth  temperature over the range of 30 to 45 degrees c. the inaa1::lac fusion was transferred to a strain defective for k+ uptake (kdpabc trka trkd) in which ph homeostasis was shown to depend on the external k+ concentration. in this construct, inaa1::lac retained ph-dependent induction by benzoate but was not induced at low k+ concentrations. induction of inaa appears to involve several factors in addition to internal ph. inar may be related to the nearby locus mara/soxq, which is inducible by acidic benzyl derivatives.
