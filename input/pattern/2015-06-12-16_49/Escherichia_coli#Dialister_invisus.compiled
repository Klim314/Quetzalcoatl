TI  - Preliminary molecular analysis of bacterial composition in periapical lesions with primary endodontic infections of deciduous teeth.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The bacterial composition of periapical lesions in deciduous teeth has not been well documented. This study was designed to explore the bacterial compositions, especially the dominant bacteria in periapical lesions using 16S rRNA sequencing. METHODS: Tissue samples were collected from 11 periapical lesions in deciduous teeth with primary endodontic infections. DNA was extracted from each sample and analyzed using 16S rRNA cloning and sequencing for the identification of bacteria. RESULTS: All DNA samples were positive for 16S rRNA gene PCR. One hundred and fifty-one phylotypes from 810 clones were identified to eight phyla, and each sample contained an average of 25.9 phylotypes. In addition, 59 phylotypes were detected in more than two samples, and Fusobacterium (F.) nucleatum (8/11), Dialister (D.) invisus (8/11), Campylobacter (C.) gracilis (7/11), Escherichia (E.) coli DH1 (6/11), Aggregatibacter (A.) segnis (6/11), and Streptococcus (S.) mitis (6/11) were the most prevalent species. Furthermore, 45 as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes were also identified. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic periapical lesions in deciduous teeth contained polymicrobial infections. F. nucleatum, D. invisus, C. gracilis, E. coli DH1, A. segnis, and S. mitis were the most prevalent species detected by 16S rRNA sequencing.
TI  - Microbial community analysis and identification of alternative host-specific fecal indicators in fecal and river water samples using pyrosequencing.
AB  - It is important to know the comprehensive microbial communities of fecal pollution sources and receiving water bodies for microbial source tracking. Pyrosequencing targeting the V1-V3 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene was used to investigate the characteristics of bacterial and Bacteroidales communities in major fecal sources and river waters. Diversity analysis indicated that cow feces had the highest diversities in the bacterial and Bacteroidales group followed by the pig sample, with human feces having the lowest value. The Bacteroidales, one of the potential fecal indicators, totally dominated in the fecal samples accounting for 31%-52% of bacterial sequences, but much less (0.6%) in the river water. Clustering and Venn diagram analyses showed that the human sample had a greater similarity to the pig sample in the bacterial and Bacteroidales communities than to samples from other hosts. Traditional fecal indicators, i.e., Escherichia coli, were detected in the human and river water samples at very low rates and Clostridium perfringens and enterococci were not detected in any samples. Besides the Bacteroidales group, some microorganisms detected in the specific hosts, i.e., Parasutterella excrementihominis, Veillonella sp., Dialister invisus, Megamonas funiformis, and Ruminococcus lactaris for the human and Lactobacillus amylovorus and Atopostipes sp. for the pig, could be used as potential host-specific fecal indicators. These microorganisms could be used as multiple fecal indicators that are not dependent on the absence or presence of a single indicator. Monitoring for multiple indicators that are highly abundant and host-specific would greatly enhance the effectiveness of fecal pollution source tracking.
TI  - Dysbiosis of the faecal microbiota in patients with Crohn's disease and their unaffected relatives.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A general dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota has been established in patients with Crohn's disease (CD), but a systematic characterisation of this dysbiosis is lacking. Therefore the composition of the predominant faecal microbiota of patients with CD was studied in comparison with the predominant composition in unaffected controls. Whether dysbiosis is present in relatives of patients CD was also examined. METHODS: Focusing on families with at least three members affected with CD, faecal samples of 68 patients with CD, 84 of their unaffected relatives and 55 matched controls were subjected to community fingerprinting of the predominant microbiota using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). To analyse the DGGE profiles, BioNumerics software and non-parametric statistical analyses (SPSS V.17.0) were used. Observed differences in the predominant microbiota were subsequently confirmed and quantified with real-time PCR. RESULTS: Five bacterial species characterised dysbiosis in CD, namely a decrease in Dialister invisus (p=0.04), an uncharacterised species of Clostridium cluster XIVa (p = 0.03), Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (p < 1.3 x 10(-)(5)) and Bifidobacterium adolescentis (p = 5.4 x 10(-)(6)), and an increase in Ruminococcus gnavus (p = 2.1 x 10(-)(7)). Unaffected relatives of patients with CD had less Collinsella aerofaciens (p = 0.004) and a member of the Escherichia coli-Shigella group (p = 0.01) and more Ruminococcus torques (p = 0.02) in their predominant microbiota as compared with healthy subjects. CONCLUSION: Unaffected relatives of patients with CD have a different composition of their microbiota compared with healthy controls. This dysbiosis is not characterised by lack of butyrate producing-bacteria as observed in CD but suggests a role for microorganisms with mucin degradation capacity.
