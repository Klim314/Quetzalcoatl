TI  == comparison of the gut microbiota profile in breast-fed and formula-fed korean infants using pyrosequencing.
AB  == background/objectives: feeding in infancy is the most significant determinant of  the intestinal microbiota in early life. the aim of this study was to determine the gut microbiota of korean infants and compare the microbiota obtained between  breast-fed and formula-fed korean infants. subjects/methods: we analyzed the microbial communities in fecal samples collected from twenty 4-week old korean (ten samples in each breast-fed or formula-fed) infants using pyrosequencing. results: the fecal microbiota of the 4-week-old korean infants consisted of the three phyla actinobacteria, firmicutes, and proteobacteria. in addition, five species, including bifidocbacterium longum, streptococcus salivarius, strepotococcus lactarius, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and lactobacillus gasseri were common commensal intestinal microbiota in all infants. the predominant intestinal microbiota in the breast-fed infants (bfi) included the phylum actinobacteria (average 70.55%), family bifidobacteriacea (70.12%), genus  bifidobacterium (70.03%) and species bifidobacterium longum (69.96%). in the microbiota from the formula-fed infants (ffi), the proportion of the phylum actinobacteria (40.68%) was less, whereas the proportions of firmicutes (45.38%)  and proteobacteria (13.85%) as well as the diversity of each taxonomic level were greater, compared to those of the bfi. the probiotic species found in the 4-week-old korean infants were bifidobacterium longum, streptococcus salivarius,  and lactobacillus gasseri. these probiotic species accounted for 93.81% of the microbiota from the bfi, while only 63.80% of the microbiota from the ffi. in particular, b. longum was more abundant in bfi (69.96%) than in ffi (34.17%). conclusions: breast milk supports the growth of b. longum and inhibits others. to the best of our knowledge, this study was the first attempt to analyze the gut microbiota of healthy korean infants according to the feeding type using pyrosequencing. our data can be used as a basis for further studies to investigate the development of intestinal microbiota with aging and disease status.

TI  == screening of probiotic candidates in human oral bacteria for the prevention of dental disease.
AB  == the oral cavity in healthy subjects has a well-balanced microbiota that consists  of more than 700 species. however, a disturbance of this balance, with an increase of harmful microbes and a decrease of beneficial microbes, causes oral disorders such as periodontal disease or dental caries. nowadays, probiotics are  expected to confer oral health benefits by modulating the oral microbiota. this study screened new probiotic candidates with potential oral health benefits and no harmful effects on the oral cavity. we screened 14 lactobacillus strains and 36 streptococcus strains out of 896 oral isolates derived from healthy subjects.  these bacteria did not produce volatile sulfur compounds or water-insoluble glucan, had higher antibacterial activity against periodontal bacteria, and had higher adherence activity to oral epithelial cells or salivary-coated hydroxyapatite in vitro. we then evaluated the risk of primary cariogenicity and  infective endocarditis of the selected oral isolates. as a result, lactobacillus  crispatus yit 12319, lactobacillus fermentum yit 12320, lactobacillus gasseri yit 12321, and streptococcus mitis yit 12322 were selected because they showed no cariogenic potential in an artificial mouth system and a lower risk of experimental infective endocarditis in a rat model. these candidates are expected as new probiotics with potential oral health benefits and no adverse effects on general health.

TI  == an assessment of adhesion, aggregation and surface charges of lactobacillus strains derived from the human oral cavity.
AB  == there is limited information concerning the adhesion and aggregation of human oral lactobacilli. in this study, the adhesion of 10 lactobacillus species was investigated using h357 oral keratinocyte cells as an in vitro model for oral mucosa. coaggregation with the representative oral pathogen, streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, and the physicochemical cell properties was also evaluated. the results demonstrated significant variations in adhesion (42-96%) and aggregation  (autoaggregation, 14-95%; coaggregation, 19-65%). all strains showed a high affinity for chloroform, and most strains had a moderate-to-high hydrophobicity.  all strains, except lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus gasseri, showed a moderate affinity for ethyl acetate. there was a strong association of autoaggregation with coaggregation (rs = 0.883, p < 0.001). the highest mean for  autoaggregation (74%) and coaggregation (47%) belonged to the lact. gasseri strains. correlations between the adhesion and surface characteristics and aggregation were observed among the lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus paracasei strains; however, there was a variation in the strains properties within and between species. this study indicated that the lact. gasseri, lact. fermentum, and lact. paracasei strains might be potential probiotics for the human oral cavity given their desirable properties. it should also be emphasized  that a selective process for probiotic strains is required. significance and impact of the study: adhesion to host tissues and bacterial aggregation (auto- and coaggregation) are the highly important criteria for selecting strains with probiotic potential. these abilities are commonly involved with surface-charged characteristics. this is the first study to investigate the oral lactobacillus species using an oral keratinocyte cell line. significant results were found for  the correlations between the adhesion and surface charge characteristics and for  aggregation among certain strains of lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus paracasei. this observation could be useful when collecting background information for the selection of probiotic strains for use  in oral health.

TI  == lactobacillus gasseri sbt2055 suppresses fatty acid release through enlargement of fat emulsion size in vitro and promotes fecal fat excretion in healthy japanese subjects.
AB  == background: lactobacillus gasseri sbt2055 (lg2055) has been shown to prevent abdominal adiposity, and suppression of lipid absorption is considered a possible mechanism, detail of which, however, are poorly understood. in the present study, we evaluated the effects of lg2055 on fat hydrolysis by determining pancreatic lipase activity and fat emulsion properties in vitro. we also examined whether lg2055 influences fecal fat excretion in humans. methods: pancreatic lipase activity was investigated in vitro using an artificially prepared fat emulsion and 4-methylumbelliferyl oleate (4-muo) as substrates. the concentrations of free fatty acids and 4-methylumbelliferone were quantified. fat emulsion droplet size  was measured using a particle size analyzer. the clinical study was performed as  a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. subjects consumed 100 g of  fermented milk (fm)/d, either with or without lg2055 supplementation, for seven days. fecal samples were collected during three-day pre-observational and fm intake periods and fecal fat levels were determined. results: lg2055 dose-dependently suppressed lipase activity in the fat emulsion assay but not in  the 4-muo assay. lg2055 dose-dependently increased fat emulsion droplet size. the effects of lg2055 on lipase activity and fat emulsion properties were increased compared with four other tested strains (lactobacillus gasseri sbt0317, lactobacillus gasseri jcm1131t, lactobacillus. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus jcm1002t and streptococcus thermophilus atcc19258t). in our clinical study, fecal fat level after fm intake was significantly increased compared with that observed before fm intake in the lg2055-containing active fm group but not the control fm  group lacking lg2055. conclusions: lg2055 increased fat emulsion droplet size, resulting in the suppression of lipase-mediated fat hydrolysis. the influence of  lg2055 on the physicochemical properties of fat emulsion provides a mechanism for the probiotic-mediated suppression of lipid absorption and promotion of fecal fat excretion in humans. trial registration: umin000015772.

TI  == establishment of a sensitive system for analysis of human vaginal microbiota on the basis of rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr.
AB  == ten specific primer sets, for lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus crispatus, atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, chlamydia trachomatis/muridarum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, and bifidobacterium angulatum, were developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: lactobacilli such as l. crispatus, l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. certain bacterial vaginosis (bv)-related bacteria, such as g. vaginalis, a. vaginae, m. curtisii, and prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. especially in one subject, both g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic bv patient. these results suggest that the rt-qpcr system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections.

TI  == comparison of bacterial culture and 16s rrna community profiling by clonal analysis and pyrosequencing for the characterization of the dentine caries-associated microbiome.
AB  == culture-independent analyses have greatly expanded knowledge regarding the composition of complex bacterial communities including those associated with oral diseases. a consistent finding from such studies, however, has been the under-reporting of members of the phylum actinobacteria. in this study, five pairs of broad range primers targeting 16s rrna genes were used in clonal analysis of 6 samples collected from tooth lesions involving dentine in subjects  with active caries. samples were also subjected to cultural analysis and pyrosequencing by means of the 454 platform. a diverse bacterial community of 229 species-level taxa was revealed by culture and clonal analysis, dominated by representatives of the genera prevotella, lactobacillus, selenomonas, and streptococcus. the five most abundant species were: lactobacillus gasseri, prevotella denticola, alloprevotella tannerae, s. mutans and streptococcus sp. hot 070, which together made up 31.6 % of the sequences. two samples were dominated by lactobacilli, while the remaining samples had low numbers of lactobacilli but significantly higher numbers of prevotella species. the different primer pairs produced broadly similar data but proportions of the phylum bacteroidetes were significantly higher when primer 1387r was used. all of the primer sets underestimated the proportion of actinobacteria compared to culture. pyrosequencing analysis of the samples was performed to a depth of sequencing of 4293 sequences per sample which were identified to 264 species-level taxa, and resulted in significantly higher coverage estimates than  the clonal analysis. pyrosequencing, however, also underestimated the relative abundance of actinobacteria compared to culture.

TI  == the female urinary microbiome: a comparison of women with and without urgency urinary incontinence.
AB  == bacterial dna and live bacteria have been detected in human urine in the absence  of clinical infection, challenging the prevailing dogma that urine is normally sterile. urgency urinary incontinence (uui) is a poorly understood urinary condition characterized by symptoms that overlap urinary infection, including urinary urgency and increased frequency with urinary incontinence. the recent discovery of the urinary microbiome warrants investigation into whether bacteria  contribute to uui. in this study, we used 16s rrna gene sequencing to classify bacterial dna and expanded quantitative urine culture (equc) techniques to isolate live bacteria in urine collected by using a transurethral catheter from women with uui and, in comparison, a cohort without uui. for these cohorts, we demonstrated that the uui and non-uui urinary microbiomes differ by group based on both sequence and culture evidences. compared to the non-uui microbiome, sequencing experiments revealed that the uui microbiome was composed of increased gardnerella and decreased lactobacillus. nine genera (actinobaculum, actinomyces, aerococcus, arthrobacter, corynebacterium, gardnerella, oligella, staphylococcus, and streptococcus) were more frequently cultured from the uui cohort. although lactobacillus was isolated from both cohorts, distinctions existed at the species level, with lactobacillus gasseri detected more frequently in the uui cohort and  lactobacillus crispatus most frequently detected in controls. combined, these data suggest that potentially important differences exist in the urinary microbiomes of women with and without uui, which have strong implications in prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of uui. importance: new evidence indicates that the human urinary tract contains microbial communities; however, the role of these communities in urinary health remains to be elucidated. urgency urinary incontinence (uui) is a highly prevalent yet poorly understood urinary condition  characterized by urgency, frequency, and urinary incontinence. given the significant overlap of uui symptoms with those of urinary tract infections, it is possible that uui may have a microbial component. we compared the urinary microbiomes of women affected by uui to those of a comparison group without uui,  using both high-throughput sequencing and extended culture techniques. we identified statistically significant differences in the frequency and abundance of bacteria present. these differences suggest a potential role for the urinary microbiome in female urinary health.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo effects of beneficial vaginal lactobacilli on pathogens responsible for urogenital tract infections.
AB  == the aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of beneficial human vaginal lactobacilli (lb) on urogenital pathogens through in vitro and in vivo experiments. co-aggregative and antimicrobial properties between five vaginal lb  strains and urogenital pathogens or potential pathogens (streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans strains) were assayed. also, associative cultures of lb strains and s. agalactiae were performed and bacterial growth, ph, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) were determined at different times. based on the results obtained, the in vivo studies were assayed  in mice with lactobacillus gasseri crl 1509 or lactobacillus salivarius crl 1328  inoculated intravaginally (i.v.) and then challenged i.v. with s. agalactiae. results were analysed by anova (repeated measures and general linear models). most of the lb strains increased the percentage of aggregation of s. agalactiae strains. only one strain (lactobacillus reuteri crl 1324) positively affected the aggregation of s. aureus and none increased the aggregation of c. albicans. the inhibition of the growth of s. agalactiae strains by production of organic acids  by lactobacilli was evidenced. the lb-s. agalactiae co-cultures showed a significant inhibition of the pathogen after 4 h and 8 h of incubation. parallel  increases in lactic acid and h2o2 levels were observed. however, in the experimental murine model, no significant differences were obtained in the number of streptococci recovered from the vaginal tract of control mice and those inoculated with lb. in conclusion, vaginal lb exhibited in vitro co-aggregative and antimicrobial effects on s. agalactiae strains, suggesting that they could be promising candidates for protection against s. agalactiae challenge. however, as  these effects were not evidenced in the murine model used, further animal studies under different experimental conditions should be conducted to evaluate the preventive effect of lb against challenge with s. agalactiae.

TI  == association between the vaginal microbiota, menopause status, and signs of vulvovaginal atrophy.
AB  == objective: the vaginal microbiota helps protect the female genital tract from disease. we sought to describe the composition of the vaginal microbiota in premenopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal women and to explore the association between the microbiota and vulvovaginal atrophy (vva). methods: eighty-seven women (aged 35-60 y) were classified as premenopausal (n = 30), perimenopausal (n = 29), or postmenopausal (n = 28) according to stages of reproductive aging workshop guidelines. midvaginal bacterial community composition was characterized by 16s ribosomal rna gene analysis. results: bacterial communities clustered into six community state types (csts), of which four were dominated by lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus iners, or lactobacillus jensenii, and two (cst iv-a and cst iv-b) had low relative abundance of lactobacillus. cst iv-a was characterized by streptococcus and prevotella, whereas cst iv-b was characterized by atopobium. there were significant associations between menopause stage and cst (p = 0.004) and between vva and cst (p = 0.002). perimenopausal women were more likely to be  classified as cst iv-a or l. gasseri cst, whereas postmenopausal women were often classified as cst iv-a. csts dominated by l. crispatus and l. iners were more prevalent in premenopausal women. nineteen participants had signs of mild or moderate vva. compared with women with no vva, the vaginal microbiota of women with mild or moderate atrophy had 25-fold greater odds of being classified as cst iv-a versus l. crispatus cst (adjusted odds ratio, 25.89; 95% credible interval,  2.98-406.79). conclusions: a distinct bacterial community state (cst iv-a) with a low relative abundance of lactobacillus is associated with vva. future studies recruiting a larger number of women are needed to replicate the findings. this study provides an impetus for future longitudinal studies designed to manage, modulate, and restore vaginal microbiota homeostasis, which would provide stronger evidence for a causal relationship with vva and ultimately improve the treatment and prevention of atrophic vaginitis in menopause.

TI  == body fluid identification by integrated analysis of dna methylation and body fluid-specific microbial dna.
AB  == identification of body fluids found at crime scenes provides important information that can support a link between sample donors and actual criminal acts. previous studies have reported that dna methylation analysis at several tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (tdmrs) enables successful identification of semen, and the detection of certain bacterial dna can allow for identification of saliva and vaginal fluid. in the present study, a method for detecting bacterial dna was integrated into a previously reported multiplex methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme-polymerase chain reaction. the developed multiplex pcr was modified by the addition of a new semen-specific marker and by  including amplicons for the 16s ribosomal rna gene of saliva- and vaginal fluid-specific bacteria to improve the efficacy to detect a specific type of body fluid. using the developed multiplex system, semen was distinguishable by unmethylation at the usp49, dact1, and pfn3 tdmrs and by hypermethylation at l81528, and saliva could be identified by detection of saliva-specific bacteria,  veillonella atypica and/or streptococcus salivarius. additionally, vaginal fluid  and menstrual blood were differentiated from other body fluids by hypomethylation at the pfn3 tdmr and the presence of vaginal fluid-specific bacteria, lactobacillus crispatus and/or lactobacillus gasseri. because the developed multiplex system uses the same biological source of dna for individual identification profiling and simultaneously analyses various types of body fluid  in one pcr reaction, this method will facilitate more efficient body fluid identification in forensic casework.

TI  == tunel analysis of dna fragmentation in mouse unfertilized oocytes: the effect of  microorganisms within human follicular fluid collected during ivf cycles.
AB  == recently we reported the presence of bacteria within follicular fluid. previous studies have reported that dna fragmentation in human spermatozoa after in vivo or in vitro incubation with bacteria results in early embryo demise and a reduced rate of ongoing pregnancy, but the effect of bacteria on oocytes is unknown. this study examined the dna within mouse oocytes after 12 hours' incubation within human follicular fluids (n=5), which were collected from women undergoing in vitro fertilization (ivf) treatment. each follicular fluid sample was cultured to detect the presence of bacteria. terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dutp nick-end labeling (tunel) was used to label dna fragmentation in ovulated, non-fertilized mouse oocytes following in vitro incubation in human follicular fluid. the bacteria streptococcus anginosus and peptoniphilus spp., lactobacillus gasseri (low-dose), l. gasseri (high-dose), enterococcus faecalis, or propionibacterium acnes were detected within the follicular fluids. the most severe dna fragmentation was observed in oocytes incubated in the follicular fluids containing p. acnes or l. gasseri (high-dose). no dna fragmentation was observed in the mouse oocytes incubated in the follicular fluid containing low-dose l. gasseri or e. faecalis. low human oocyte fertilization rates (<29%) were associated with extensive fragmentation in mouse oocytes (80-100%). bacteria colonizing human follicular fluid in vivo may cause dna fragmentation in mouse oocytes following 12h of in vitro incubation. follicular fluid bacteria may result in poor quality oocytes and/or embryos, leading to poor ivf outcomes.

TI  == characterization and in vitro properties of oral lactobacilli in breastfed infants.
AB  == background: lactobacillus species can contribute positively to general and oral health and are frequently acquired by breastfeeding in infancy. the present study aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in breast and formula-fed 4 month-old infants and to evaluate potential probiotic properties of the dominant lactobacillus species detected. saliva and oral swab samples were collected from 133 infants who were enrolled in a longitudinal study (n=240) examining the effect of a new infant formula on child growth and development. saliva was cultured and lactobacillus isolates were identified from 16s rrna gene sequences. five l. gasseri isolates that differed in 16s rrna sequence were tested for their ability to inhibit growth of selected oral bacteria and for adhesion to oral tissues. oral swab samples were analyzed by qpcr for lactobacillus gasseri. results: 43 (32.3%) infants were breastfed and 90 (67.7%) were formula-fed with either a standard formula (43 out of 90) or formula supplemented with a milk fat globule membrane (mfgm) fraction (47 out of 90). lactobacilli were cultured from saliva of 34.1% breastfed infants, but only in 4.7% of the standard and 9.3% of the mfgm supplemented formula-fed infants. l. gasseri was the most prevalent (88% of lactobacillus positive infants) of six lactobacillus species detected. l. gasseri isolates inhibited streptococcus mutans binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite,  and inhibited growth of s. mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces oris, candida albicans and fusobacterium nucleatum in a concentration dependent fashion. l. gasseri isolates bound to parotid and submandibular saliva, salivary gp340 and muc7, and purified mfgm, and adhered to  epithelial cells. l. gasseri was detected by qpcr in 29.7% of the oral swabs. breastfed infants had significantly higher mean dna levels of l. gasseri (2.14 pg/ul) than infants fed the standard (0.363 pg/ul) or mfgm (0.697 pg/ul) formula. conclusions: lactobacilli colonized the oral cavity of breastfed infants significantly more frequently than formula-fed infants. the dominant lactobacillus was l. gasseri, which was detected at higher levels in breastfed than formula-fed infants and displayed probiotic traits in vitro.

TI  == influence of vaginal bacteria and d- and l-lactic acid isomers on vaginal extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer: implications for protection against upper genital tract infections.
AB  == we evaluated levels of vaginal extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (emmprin) and matrix metalloproteinase (mmp-8) in vaginal secretions in relation  to the composition of vaginal bacterial communities and d- and l-lactic acid levels. the composition of vaginal bacterial communities in 46 women was determined by pyrosequencing the v1 to v3 region of 16s rrna genes. lactobacilli  were dominant in 71.3% of the women, followed by gardnerella (17.4%), streptococcus (8.7%), and enterococcus (2.2%). of the lactobacillus-dominated communities, 51.5% were dominated by lactobacillus crispatus, 36.4% by lactobacillus iners, and 6.1% each by lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus jensenii. concentrations of l-lactic acid were slightly higher in lactobacillus-dominated vaginal samples, but most differences were not statistically significant. d-lactic acid levels were higher in samples containing l. crispatus than in those with l. iners (p<0.0001) or gardnerella (p=0.0002). the relative proportion of d-lactic acid in vaginal communities dominated by species of lactobacilli was in concordance with the proportions found in axenic cultures of the various species grown in vitro. levels of l-lactic acid (p<0.0001) and the ratio of l-lactic acid to d-lactic acid (p=0.0060), but not concentrations of d-lactic acid, were also correlated with emmprin concentrations. moreover, vaginal concentrations of emmprin and mmp-8 levels were highly correlated (p<0.0001). taken together, the data suggest the relative proportion of l- to d-lactic acid isomers in the vagina may influence the extent  of local emmprin production and subsequent induction of mmp-8. the expression of  these proteins may help determine the ability of bacteria to transverse the cervix and initiate upper genital tract infections. importance: a large proportion of preterm births (>50%) result from infections caused by bacteria originating in the vagina, which requires that they traverse the cervix. factors  that influence susceptibility to these infections are not well understood; however, there is evidence that matrix metalloproteinase (mmp-8) is known to alter the integrity of the cervix. in this work, we show that concentrations of vaginal extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (emmprin) are influenced by members of the vaginal microbial community and concentrations of d- or l-lactic acid isomers in vaginal secretions. elevated levels of d-lactic acid and the ratio of d- to l-lactic acid influence emmprin concentrations as well as mmp-8 levels. thus, isomers of lactic acid may function as signaling molecules that alter host gene expression and influence risk of infection-related preterm birth.

TI  == in vitro study of the antibacterial properties and microbial colonization susceptibility of four self-etching adhesives used in orthodontics.
AB  == objectives: 1. to determine the in vitro antibacterial effectiveness of the orthodontic bonding transbond xt (3m unitek) and four self-etching adhesives with possible use in orthodontic bonding (clearfil protect bond, cpb; clearfil self-etching bond, csb; transbond plus self-etching primer, tsep; ibond) against  streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus gasseri in order to compare that capacity  among the adhesives and with respect to transbond xt; 2. to determine the bacterial adhesion capacity of the above mentioned microorganisms to the tested adhesives. materials and methods: the inhibitory effects of the adhesives against s. mutans and l. gasseri were examined using the agar diffusion method with whatman no.1 5mm disks loaded with 15 mul of adhesive, uv polymerized, layered on previously inoculated bhi and mrs plates incubated microaerobically for 48 hours  at 37 degree c. data were analysed with kruskal-wallis (p < 0.05) and mann-whitney tests, applying the bonferroni correction (p < 0.003). bacterial adhesion was studied with scanning electron microscopy. results: only cpb and ibond produced a clear growth inhibition halo against s. mutans and l. gasseri (p < 0.0001). ibond was the only tested product to which the bacteria adhere profusely, particularly s. mutans. conclusions: cpb has shown antimicrobial properties in vitro, and, provided the limitations of an in vitro study, the use  of this self-etching adhesive may contribute to reduce microbial decalcification, making the use of this self-etching adhesive an attractive option for bracket bonding.

TI  == [illumina sequencing 16s rrna tagging reveals diverse vaginal microbiomes associated with bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == objective: to analyze and compare vaginal microbiomes in healthy women at child-bearing ages and patients with bacterial vaginosis (bv). methods: a total of 74 vaginal swabs of the vaginal fornix were collected from 37 bv patients and  37 healthy women. bv status was assessed according to amsels clinical criteria for all the subjects and confirmed using gram-stain criteria (nugent scores). genomic dna of the samples was extracted for amplifying the 16s rrna v6 hypervariable region by pcr and pyrosequencing by illumina. bipes, uchime, tsc and gast were employed to analyze the information of the species from the samples. results: lactobacillus was the predominant species in healthy women (more than 95%), including mainly l. iners and l. crispatus, with a small quantity of gardnerella, granulicatella, streptococcus, prevotella, escherichia and other genus. the alpha diversity was significantly increased in 30 bv patients (p<0.001), and beta diversity also changed obviously shown by decreased  lactobacillus (varying from 45% to 1%, consisting mainly of l. iners) or even absence lactobacillus in 6 cases, with increased relative abundance of gardnerella, prevotella, granulicatella, anaerococcus, parvimonas, peptoniphilus.harei, peptostreptococcus, and dialister. different from previous data, 7 bv cases showed a predominance of the rare species l.gasseri and l.acidophilus (75% to 50%). conclusion: lactobacillus is the predominant vaginal  species in healthy women (mainly l. iners and l. crispatus) co-existing with many other bacteria and a variety of microorganisms. lactobacillus is significantly decreased and even absent in most of bv patients, and some cases show the predominance of the rare species l.gasseri and l.acidophilus.

TI  == antibacterial activity of probiotic candidates for oral health.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the probiotic potential of autochthonous oral lactobacilli. for this, 66 strains were screened for antibacterial activity  against two cariogenic strains (streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus) and two periodontopathogenic strains (fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis). the inhibitory activity was investigated with the agar overlay technique. positive results led us to explore some mechanisms of action. the ability to produce h(2)o(2) and the glycerol dehydratase gene were searched among all the strains. the gassericin a gene was checked among the lactobacillus gasseri. all the tested strains inhibited s. mutans and a. viscosus; only one did not inhibited f. nucleatum and 52 strains inhibited slightly the growth of p. gingivalis. no inactivation of antibacterial activity was observed after treatment with proteinase k. the gene of the gassericin a was not found in any strain. only one strain showed a 275-bp amplicon corresponding to the glycerol dehydratase gene. this strain has been identified by dna 16s sequencing as a l. gasseri. among the 66 tested strains, 7 produced hydrogen peroxide. our findings  suggest that in addition to the previous results, some of the autochthonous oral  lactobacilli tested could be considered as suitable probiotics.

TI  == bacteriocin production, antibiotic susceptibility and prevalence of haemolytic and gelatinase activity in faecal lactic acid bacteria isolated from healthy ethiopian infants.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterise lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from faecal samples of healthy ethiopian infants, with emphasis on bacteriocin production and antibiotic susceptibility. one hundred fifty lab were  obtained from 28 healthy ethiopian infants. the isolates belonged to lactobacillus (81/150), enterococcus (54/150) and streptococcus (15/150) genera.  lactobacillus species were more abundant in the breast-fed infants while enterococcus dominated the mixed-fed population. bacteriocin-producing lab species were isolated from eight of the infants. many different bacteriocins were identified, including one new bacteriocin from streptococcus salivarius, avicin a (class iia) from enterococcus avium, one class iia bacteriocin from enterococcus  faecalis strains, one unknown bacteriocin from e. faecalis and two unknown bacteriocins from lactobacillus fermentum strains and the two-peptide gassericin  t from lactobacillus gasseri isolate. susceptibility tests performed for nine antibiotics suggest that some lactobacilli might have acquired resistance to erythromycin (3 %) and tetracycline (4 %) only. the streptococci were generally antibiotic sensitive except for penicillin, to which they showed intermediate resistance. all enterococci were susceptible to ampicillin while 13 % showed penicillin resistance. only one e. faecalis isolate was vancomycin-resistant. tetracycline (51 %) and erythromycin (26 %) resistance was prevalent among the enterococci, but multidrug resistance was confined to e. faecalis (47 %) and enterococcus faecium (33 %). screening of enterococcal virulence traits revealed  that 2 % were beta-haemolytic. the structural genes of cytolysin were detected in 28 % of the isolates in five enterococcal species, the majority being e. faecalis and enterococcus raffinosus. this study shows that bacteriocin production and antibiotic resistance is a common trait of faecal lab of ethiopian infants while  virulence factors occur at low levels.

AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects,  using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus),  gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to  growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.

TI  == oral microbial profile discriminates breast-fed from formula-fed infants.
AB  == objectives: little is known about the effect of diet on the oral microbiota of infants, although diet is known to affect the gut microbiota. the aims of the present study were to compare the oral microbiota in breast-fed and formula-fed infants, and investigate growth inhibition of streptococci by infant-isolated lactobacilli. methods: a total of 207 mothers consented to participation of their 3-month-old infants. a total of 146 (70.5%) infants were exclusively and 38 (18.4%) partially breast-fed, and 23 (11.1%) were exclusively formula-fed. saliva from all of their infants was cultured for lactobacillus species, with isolate identifications from 21 infants. lactobacillus isolates were tested for their ability to suppress streptococcus mutans and s sanguinis. oral swabs from 73 infants were analysed by the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) and by quantitative polymerase chain reaction for lactobacillus gasseri. results: lactobacilli were cultured from 27.8% of exclusively and partially breast-fed infants, but not from formula-fed infants. the prevalence of 14 homim-detected taxa, and total salivary lactobacilli counts differed by feeding method. multivariate modelling of homim-detected bacteria and possible confounders clustered samples from breast-fed infants separately from formula-fed infants. the microbiota of breast-fed infants differed based on vaginal or c-section delivery. isolates of l plantarum, l gasseri, and l vaginalis inhibited growth of the cariogenic s mutans and the commensal s sanguinis: l plantarum >l gasseri >l  vaginalis. conclusions: the microbiota of the mouth differs between 3-month-old breast-fed and formula-fed infants. possible mechanisms for microbial differences observed include species suppression by lactobacilli indigenous to breast milk.

TI  == [analysis of diversity of vaginal microbiota in healthy chinese women by using dna-fingerprinting].
AB  == objective: to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in  different physiological states with pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), to establish the basis for the future study of lower genital tract infections, and to provide a theoretical basis for the development of vaginal probiotics adapted to chinese females. methods: women who underwent routine gynecologic examinations in peking university first hospital from october 2009 to january 2010 were enrolled, including 30 at reproductive age and 30 at post menopause age. vaginal samples were collected and then total bacterial dna was extracted. universal bacterial primers were used to amplify the v3 region of 16s  rdna gene. pcr products were analyzed by denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). featured bands on dgge were recovered, cloned and sequenced. alignment with known sequence was made by using blast on genbank to identify bacterial strains so as to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora  in different physiological states. results: (1) vaginal flora in healthy chinese  women at their reproductive age were relatively simple, lactobacillus were the dominant bacteria. common bacteria included: lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners,and lactobacillus gasseri. while l. iners were the dominant vaginal bacteria that could not be recognized by traditional method. (2) vaginal  bacteria in the women at post menopause age were more complex than in those at reproductive age. common bacteria included: lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus gallolyticus, veillonella sp., streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus anginosus, prevotella sp., anaerococcus lactolyticus and bacteroides fragilis. conclusion: based on the dgge analysis, the most common vaginal bacteria in chinese healthy women at reproductive age are lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners,and lactobacillus gasseri. the most common vaginal bacteria in healthy post-menopausal women are lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., prevotella sp.,bacteroides fragilis and lactic acid producing veillonella sp. and anaerococcus lactolyticus. meanwhile lactobacillus iners was firstly found by dgge to be the dominant vaginal bacteria in different physiological states.

TI  == antibiotic effects on bacterial profile in osteonecrosis of the jaw.
AB  == objective: oral infection is considered to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (bronj), and antibiotic therapy has become a mainstay of bronj therapy. this study was aimed to investigate the effect of antibiotics on bacterial diversity in bronj tissues. materials and methods: the bacterial profile from soft tissues associated with the bronj lesion was determined using 16s rrna-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and sequencing. twenty bronj subjects classified as stage  0-2 were enrolled in this study, and patient groups were divided into an antibiotic cohort (n=10) treated with systemic antibiotic and a non-antibiotic cohort (n=10) with no prior antibiotic therapy. results: the dgge fingerprints indicated no significant differences in bacterial diversity of bronj tissue samples. patients on antibiotics had higher relative abundance of phylum firmicutes with bacterial species, streptococcus intermedius, lactobacillus gasseri, mogibacterium timidum, and solobacterium moorei, whereas patients without antibiotics had greater amounts of parvimonas micra and streptococcus anginosus. thirty percent of bacterial populations were uncultured (yet-to be cultured) phylotypes. conclusion: this study using limited sample size indicated  that oral antibiotic therapy may have a limited efficacy on the bacterial population associated with bronj lesions.

TI  == inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against oral pathogens.
AB  == aims: to determine the inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against putative oral pathogens. methods and results: total 357 strains comprising 10 species of oral lactobacillus, lactobacillus fermentum (195), lactobacillus salivarius (53), lactobacillus casei (20), lactobacillus gasseri (18), lactobacillus rhamnosus (14), lactobacillus paracasei (12), lactobacillus mucosae (12), lactobacillus oris (12), lactobacillus plantarum (11) and lactobacillus vaginalis (10) were used as producer strains. inhibitory effect against a panel of indicators, periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens, was assessed. most oral lactobacillus was able to inhibit the growth of both periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens. the strongest inhibitory activity was associated with lact. paracasei, lact. plantarum, lact. rhamnosus, lact. casei and lact. salivarius. lactobacillus sd1-sd6, representing the six species with the strong inhibitory effect, inhibited growth of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 in the biofilm model. also, it was demonstrated that growth of strep. mutans was inhibited in a mixture with lact. paracasei sd1. the inhibition was enhanced in acidic condition and 5% glucose. conclusions: the results have shown that oral lactobacillus sd1-sd6 showed a strong inhibitory effect against strep. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, as well as, gram-negative periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. significance  and impact of the study: the results indicated that lactobacillus may be of benefit as probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases.

TI  == microbial risk markers for childhood caries in pediatricians' offices.
AB  == dental caries in pre-school children has significant public health and health disparity implications. to determine microbial risk markers for this infection, this study aimed to compare the microbiota of children with early childhood caries with that of caries-free children. plaque samples from incisors, molars, and the tongue from 195 children attending pediatricians' offices were assayed by 74 dna probes and by pcr to streptococcus mutans. caries-associated factors included visible plaque, child age, race, and snacking habits. species were detected more frequently from tooth than tongue samples. lactobacillus gasseri (p < 0.01), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus vaginalis, and s. mutans with streptococcus sobrinus (all p < 0.05) were positively associated with caries. by  multifactorial analysis, the probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus was negatively associated with caries. prevotella nigrescens was the only species (p < 0.05) significantly associated with caries by the 'false discovery' rate. analysis of the data suggests that selected lactobacillus species, in addition to mutans streptococci, are risk markers for early childhood caries.

TI  == prediction of surface exposed proteins in streptococcus pyogenes, with a potential application to other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the in silico prediction of bacterial surface exposed proteins is of growing interest for the rational development of vaccines and in the study of bacteria-host relationships, whether pathogenic or host beneficial. this interest is driven by the increase in the use of dna sequencing as a major tool in the early characterization of pathogenic bacteria and, more recently, even of complex ecosystems at the host-environment interface in metagenomics approaches. current  protein localization protocols are not suited to this prediction task as they ignore the potential surface exposition of many membrane-associated proteins. therefore, we developed a new flow scheme, surfg+, for the processing of protein  sequence data with the particular aim of identification of potentially surface exposed (pse) proteins from gram-positive bacteria, which was validated for streptococcus pyogenes. the results of an exploratory case study on closely related lactobacilli of the acidophilus group suggest that the yogurt bacterium lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (l. bulgaricus) dedicates a relatively  important fraction of its coding capacity to secreted proteins, while the probiotic gastrointestinal (gi) tract bacteria l. johnsonii and l. gasseri appear to encode a larger variety of pse proteins, that may play a role in the interaction with the host.

TI  == characterization of the amylovorin locus of lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471, producer of a bacteriocin active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, in combination with colistin and pyocins.
AB  == lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471 produces amylovorin l, a bacteriocin with an antibacterial activity against some strains of the lactobacillus lineage. based on the sequence of one active peptide, a gene encoding active amylovorin l was cloned and sequenced. genome walking allowed us to sequence a larger fragment of  7577 bp of genomic dna, with 12 predicted orfs. the previously characterized amylovorin l peptide-encoding gene is preceded by another gene encoding a small polypeptide with a typical bacteriocin-processing double-glycine site, suggesting that amylovorin l is a two-component class iib bacteriocin (amylovorin lalpha/beta). lalpha and lbeta show the highest similarity to gassericin t from lactobacillus gasseri sbt2055 and blpn from streptococcus pneumoniae r6, respectively, and to lafa and lafx, which form the lactacin f bacteriocin of lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533. as for other lactic acid bacteria bacteriocins,  amylovorin l showed no activity against the gram-negative opportunistic pathogen  pseudomonas aeruginosa on its own, but showed synergistic inhibitory activity when used in combination with the peptide antibiotic colistin, and, remarkably, with the p. aeruginosa soluble bacteriocins, pyocins s1 and s2.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == genetic features of circular bacteriocins produced by gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == this review highlights the main genetic features of circular bacteriocins, which  require the co-ordinated expression of several genetic determinants. in general terms, it has been demonstrated that the expression of such structural genes must be combined with the activity of proteins involved in maturation (cleavage/circularization) and secretion outside the cell via different transporter systems, as well as multifaceted immunity mechanisms essential to ensuring the bacteria's self-protection against such strong inhibitors. several circular antibacterial peptides produced by gram-positive bacteria have been described to date, including enterocin as-48, from enterococcus faecalis s-48 (the first one characterized), gassericin a, from lactobacillus gasseri la39, and a similar one, reutericin 6, from lactobacillus reuteri la6, butyrivibriocin ar10, from the ruminal anaerobe butyrivibrio fibrisolvens ar10, uberolysin, from  streptococcus uberis, circularin a, from clostridium beijerinckii atcc 25752, and subtilosin a, from bacillus subtilis. we summarize here the progress made in the  understanding of their principal genetic features over the last few years, during which the functional roles of circular proteins with wide biological activity have become clearer.

TI  == [beneficial effects of consumption of a dairy product containing two probiotic strains, lactobacillus coryniformis cect5711 and lactobacillus gasseri cect5714 in healthy children].
AB  == objective: in the last decades there has been an increasing interest in the manipulation of intestinal microbiota with probiotics for the prevention and treatment of certain paediatric diseases. in addition, it has been suggested that probiotics could play a role in the development of immune system. recent studies  suggest that the administration of two probiotic strains, lactobacillus coryniformis cect5711 and lactobacillus gasseri cect5714 improves intestinal function of healthy adults and enhances the immune response. since there are few  studies reporting the use of probiotic in children, the main consumers of these products, the aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of the administration of the mentioned probiotic strains in healthy children. interventions: 30 children (age range 3-12) with no gastrointestinal pathology were included in the study. in addition to their usual diet, during the first 3 weeks they received 200 ml of a conventional yogurt containing lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus. during the following three weeks this  yogurt was substi-tuted for 80 ml of a probiotic product (max defensas, puleva food s.l.) containing the same amounts of streptococcus thermophilus and the l. bulgaricus was substituted by a mixture of the target probiotic strains: l. coryniformis cect5711 and l. gasseri cect5714. samples of faeces and saliva were  taken at the beginning of the protocol, at week 3 and at the end of the study. intestinal microbiota, faecal citotoxicity and the inhibition of salmonella cholerasusis ssp. cholerasuis adhesion to intestinal mucins by the faeces were analyzed. finally, iga concentration was determined in the faecal and saliva samples. results: tolerance of the probiotic product was good in all the children included in the study. an increase in faecal lactobacilli counts was shown at the end of the experimental protocol (p < 0,05). in addition citotoxicity of faecal samples was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced after probiotic consumption. the inhibition of s. cholerasuis adhesion to intestinal mucins was significantly higher (p < 0.05) for faecal waters from children in week 6 compared to samples form week 0 and 3. probiotic consumption was also shown to increase iga concentration in faeces and saliva (p < 0.05). conclusions: the consumption of a  probiotic product containing l. coryniformis cect5711 and l. gasseri cect5714 improves intestinal flora of healthy children, enhancing the defence against gastrointestinal aggressions and infections both by inhibiting pathogen adhesion  to intestinal mucins and enhancing the immune function.

TI  == anti-inflammatory properties of lactobacillus gasseri expressing manganese superoxide dismutase using the interleukin 10-deficient mouse model of colitis.
AB  == emerging evidence has implicated reactive oxygen species (ros) in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). although intestinal epithelial  cells produce the ros-neutralizing enzyme superoxide dismutase (sod), the protein and activity levels of copper/zinc (cu/zn) and manganese (mn) sod are perturbed in inflamed tissues of ibd patients. thus we investigated the ability of mnsod from streptococcus thermophilus to reduce colitis symptoms in interleukin (il) 10-deficient mice using lactobacillus gasseri as a delivery vehicle. cohorts of 13-15 il-10-deficient mice were left untreated or supplemented with native l. gasseri or l. gasseri expressing mnsod for 4 wk. colonic tissue was collected and inflammation was histologically scored. the presence of innate immune cells was investigated by immunohistochemistry and the host antioxidant response was determined by quantitative pcr. it was demonstrated that l. gasseri was stably maintained in mice for at least 3 days. l. gasseri producing mnsod significantly  reduced inflammation in il-10-deficient mice compared with untreated controls (p  < 0.05), whereas the anti-inflammatory effects of both native and mnsod producing l. gasseri were more pronounced in males. the anti-inflammatory effects of l. gasseri were associated with a reduction in the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages. transcripts of antioxidant genes were equivalent in colonic tissues  obtained from control and probiotic-treated il-10-deficient mice. this study demonstrates that l. gasseri producing mnsod has significant anti-inflammatory activity that reduces the severity of colitis in the il-10-deficient mouse.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies  levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus  pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.

TI  == probiotic properties of vaginal lactic acid bacteria to prevent metritis in cattle.
AB  == aims: the isolation of bovine vaginal lactic acid bacteria (lab) and the screening of their beneficial properties to select those that could be used as probiotics in the prevention of bovine metritis were performed. methods and results: out of 76 lactobacillus sp. and seven streptococcus sp. strains, a small number showed high- and medium hydrophobicity when the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons method (math) was applied. in the agar plate diffusion test, a large number of strains inhibited vaginal bovine escherichia coli 99/14 and human e. coli. this inhibition was due to acid. only a few strains inhibited actinomyces pyogenes 96/393, a pathogen isolated from bovine metritis. this inhibition remained after neutralization. the taxonomic identification of the selected strains was carried out by an amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). most of the strains were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, a few as lactobacillus gasseri and one as lactobacillus rhamnosus. conclusions: bovine vaginal lactobacilli strains have differential surface properties. the strains selected are capable of inhibiting specific metritis pathogens. significance and  impact of the study: our results can be applied for future studies to design a probiotic product to prevent metritis in dairy postpartum cows.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == comparison between gram stain and culture for the characterization of vaginal microflora: definition of a distinct grade that resembles grade i microflora and  revised categorization of grade i microflora.
AB  == background: the microbiological diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is usually made  using nugent's criteria, a useful but rather laborious scoring system based on counting bacterial cell types on gram stained slides of vaginal smears. ison and  hay have simplified the score system to three categories and added a fourth category for microflora with a predominance of the streptococcus cell type. because in the nugent system several cell types are not taken into account for a  final score, we carried out a detailed assessment of the composition of the vaginal microflora in relation to standard gram stain in order the improve the diagnostic value of the gram stain. to this purpose we compared gram stain based  categorization of vaginal smears with i) species specific pcr for the detection of gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae and with ii) tdna-pcr for the identification of most cultivable species. results: a total of 515 samples were obtained from 197 pregnant women, of which 403 (78.3%) were categorized as grade  i microflora, 46 (8.9%) as grade ii, 22 (4.3%) as grade iii and 8 (1.6%) as grade iv, according to the criteria of ison and hay. another 36 samples (7.0%) were assigned to the new category 'grade i-like', because of the presence of diphtheroid bacilli cell types. we found that 52.7% of the grade i-like samples contained bifidobacterium spp. while l. crispatus was present in only 2.8% of the samples and g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were virtually absent; in addition, the species diversity of this category was similar to that of grade ii specimens.based on the presence of different lactobacillus cell types, grade i specimens were further characterized as grade ia (40.2%), grade iab (14.9%) and grade ib (44.9%). we found that this classification was supported by the finding  that l. crispatus was cultured from respectively 87.0% and 76.7% of grade ia and  iab specimens while this species was present in only 13.3% of grade ib specimens, a category in which l. gasseri and l. iners were predominant. conclusion: further refinement of gram stain based grading of vaginal smears is possible by distinguishing additional classes within grade i smears (ia, iab and ib) and by adding a separate category, designated grade i-like. a strong correlation was found between grade ia and the presence of l. crispatus and between grade i-like  and the presence of bifidobacteria. this refinement of gram stain based scoring of vaginal smears may be helpful to improve the interpretation of the clinical data in future studies, such as the understanding of response to treatment and recurrence of bacterial vaginosis in some women, and the relationship between bacterial vaginosis and preterm birth.

AB  == a strategy for functional gene replacement in the chromosome of lactobacillus gasseri is described. the phospho-beta-galactosidase ii gene (lacii) was functionally replaced by the manganese superoxide dismutase (mnsod) gene (soda) from streptococcus thermophilus, by adapting the insertional inactivation method  described for lactobacilli [russell, w.m. and klaenhammer, t.r. 2001 efficient system for directed integration into the lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus gasseri chromosomes via homologous recombination. appl. environ. microbiol. 67, 4361-4364]. l. gasseri carrying the heterologous soda gene grew on lactose as efficiently as the wild-type parent. an active mnsod was expressed in  the transgenic strain, and the enzyme migrated on page-sod activity gels to the same position as that of mnsod from s. thermophilus. the expression of mnsod from a single copy of soda integrated in the chromosome of l. gasseri provided enhanced tolerance to hydrogen peroxide, and extended the viability of carbon/energy starved cultures stored at 25 degrees c. this is the first report showing the successful utilization of the pori plasmids system to generate marker-free gene integration in l. gasseri strains.

TI  == expression of a heterologous manganese superoxide dismutase gene in intestinal lactobacilli provides protection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
AB  == in living organisms, exposure to oxygen provokes oxidative stress. a widespread mechanism for protection against oxidative stress is provided by the antioxidant  enzymes: superoxide dismutases (sods) and hydroperoxidases. generally, these enzymes are not present in lactobacillus spp. in this study, we examined the potential advantages of providing a heterologous sod to some of the intestinal lactobacilli. thus, the gene encoding the manganese-containing sod (soda) was cloned from streptococcus thermophilus ao54 and expressed in four intestinal lactobacilli. a 1.2-kb pcr product containing the soda gene was cloned into the shuttle vector ptrk563, to yield psoda, which was functionally expressed and complemented an escherichia coli strain deficient in mn and fesods. the plasmid,  psoda, was subsequently introduced and expressed in lactobacillus gasseri nck334, lactobacillus johnsonii nck89, lactobacillus acidophilus nck56, and lactobacillus reuteri nck932. molecular and biochemical analyses confirmed the presence of the  gene (soda) and the expression of an active gene product (mnsod) in these strains of lactobacilli. the specific activities of mnsod were 6.7, 3.8, 5.8, and 60.7 u/mg of protein for l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. reuteri, respectively. the expression of s. thermophilus mnsod in l. gasseri and l. acidophilus provided protection against hydrogen peroxide stress. the data show that mnsod protects cells against hydrogen peroxide by removing o(2)(.-) and preventing the redox cycling of iron. to our best knowledge, this is the first report of a soda from s. thermophilus being expressed in other lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == molecular analysis of the microflora associated with dental caries.
AB  == molecular techniques have revealed many novel, presumed unculturable, taxa in oral infections. the aim of this study was to characterize the bacterial community of the middle and advancing front of carious dental lesions by cultural and molecular analyses. samples were collected with a hand excavator from five teeth with carious lesions involving dentine. samples were cultured on blood agar and rogosa agar incubated in air plus 5% co(2) and on fastidious anaerobe agar anaerobically. dna was also extracted directly from the samples and 16s rrna genes were amplified by pcr with universal primers. pcr products were singularized by cloning, and the cloned inserts and cultured isolates were identified by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. we identified 95 taxa among the 496 isolates and 1,577 clones sequenced; 44 taxa were detected by the molecular method alone; 31 taxa were previously undescribed. only three taxa, streptococcus mutans, rothia dentocariosa, and an unnamed propionibacterium sp., were found in  all five samples. the predominant taxa by anaerobic cultivation were the novel propionibacterium sp. (18%), olsenella profusa (14%), and lactobacillus rhamnosus (8%). the predominant taxa in the molecular analysis were streptococcus mutans (16%), lactobacillus gasseri/johnsonii (13%), and lactobacillus rhamnosus (8%). there was no significant difference between the compositions of the microflora in the middle and advancing front samples (p < 0.05, wilcoxon matched pairs, signed  ranks test). in conclusion, combined cultural and molecular analyses have shown that a diverse bacterial community is found in dentinal caries and that numerous  novel taxa are present.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == bifidobacterium lactis dsm 10140: identification of the atp (atpbefhagdc) operon  and analysis of its genetic structure, characteristics, and phylogeny.
AB  == the atp operon is highly conserved among eubacteria, and it has been considered a molecular marker as an alternative to the 16s rrna gene. pcr primers were designed from the consensus sequences of the atpd gene to amplify partial atpd sequences from 12 bifidobacterium species and nine lactobacillus species. all pcr products were sequenced and aligned with other atpd sequences retrieved from public databases. genes encoding the subunits of the f(1)f(0)-atpase of bifidobacterium lactis dsm 10140 (atpbefhagdc) were cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences of these subunits showed significant homology with the sequences of other organisms. we identified specific sequence signatures for  the genus bifidobacterium and for the closely related taxa bifidobacterium lactis and bifidobacterium animalis and lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus johnsonii, which could provide an alternative to current methods for identification of lactic acid bacterial species. northern blot analysis showed that there was a transcript at approximately 7.3 kb, which corresponded to the size of the atp operon, and a transcript at 4.5 kb, which corresponded to the atpc, atpd, atpg, and atpa genes. the transcription initiation sites of these two mrnas were mapped by primer extension, and the results revealed no consensus promoter sequences. phylogenetic analysis of the atpd genes demonstrated that the lactobacillus atpd gene clustered with the genera listeria, lactococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus and that the higher g+c content and highly biased codon usage with respect to the genome average support the hypothesis that there  was probably horizontal gene transfer. the acid inducibility of the atp operon of b. lactis dsm 10140 was verified by slot blot hybridization by using rna isolated from acid-treated cultures of b. lactis dsm 10140. the rapid increase in the level of atp operon transcripts upon exposure to low ph suggested that the atpase complex of b. lactis dsm 10140 was regulated at the level of transcription and not at the enzyme assembly step.

TI  == molecular ecological analysis of porcine ileal microbiota responses to antimicrobial growth promoters.
AB  == cultivation-independent microbial molecular ecology approaches were used to examine the effects of antibiotic growth promoters on the pig ileal microbiota. five-week-old barrows were fitted with a simple t-cannula at the distal ileum. three diets meeting or exceeding the minimum nutrient requirements were fed for 5 wk and supplemented as follows: 1) negative control (no antibiotic; n = 5), 2) continuous tylosin administration (n = 5), and 3) an antibiotic rotation sequence (wk 1, chlorotetracycline sulfathiazole penicillin; wk 2, bacitracin and roxarsone; wk 3, lincomycin; wk 4, carbadox; wk 5, virginiamycin; n = 5). ileal luminal contents were collected for dna isolation at the end of each of the 5 wk  of the testing period. the v3 region of 16s rdna was amplified by pcr and analyzed via denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). resulting pcr-dgge band numbers (bacterial species) were counted, and the banding patterns analyzed by calculating sorenson's pairwise similarity coefficients (c(s)), an index measuring bacterial  species in common among samples. band numbers and total bacterial dna concentrations decreased (p < 0.05) temporally in antibiotic-treated pigs compared with controls. comparisons between treatments yielded low intertreatment c(s) indices, indicating treatment-dependent alterations in banding patterns, whereas intratreatment comparisons revealed increased homogeneity in antibiotic-treated vs. control pigs. sequence analysis of treatment-specific bands identified three lactobacillus, one streptococcus, and one bacillus species that were diminished with antibiotic rotation treatment, whereas tylosin selected for the presence of l. gasseri. lactobacillus-specific qpcr was performed and analyzed as a percentage of total bacteria to further evaluate the effects of antibiotic administration on this genus. total bacteria were decreased (p < 0.05) by tylosin and rotation treatments, whereas the percentage of lactobacilli increased (p < 0.05) by d 14 and through d 28 in tylosin-treated pigs. the decrease in total bacteria by antibiotics may reduce host-related intestinal or immune responses, which would divert energy that could otherwise be used for growth. conversely, the ability of tylosin to improve animal growth may relate to its apparent selection for lactobacilli, commensals known to competitively exclude potentially pathogenic species from colonizing the intestine.

TI  == effectiveness of dentine bonding agents against cariogenic bacteria in vitro: a comparison of two methods.
AB  == data obtained from studies on the antimicrobial properties of bonding agents are  the subject of controversy, probably because of methodological differences. this  study compared two commonly used in vitro methods, the disc agar diffusion test and the well agar diffusion test. agar plates were seeded with streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus gasseri, or actinomyces naeslundii. for the well diffusion test, wells cut out of the agar were filled with the test material, and for the disc method, discs impregnated with the test material were applied to the agar; the discs and wells were both 9 mm in diameter. after incubation, measurements of the zones of inhibition showed little agreement between the two methods when bonding agents were tested; the mean differences (+/- sdiff) in the  zones of inhibition between the methods were 0.7 +/- 3.4 mm (p = 0.40, one sample t-test against zero), 4.9 +/- 4.4 mm (p = 0.97), and 0.8 +/- 4.3 mm (p = 0.47) for s. sobrinus, l. gasseri, and a. naeslundii, respectively. mean differences were less contrasting when chlorhexidine and pure components were tested (p < 0.05 for s. sobrinus and l. gasseri). these results indicate the need for a gold  standard method to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of bonding agents.

TI  == lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  == samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. yeasts (20.1%), streptococcus spp. (8.7%), staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. the lactobacillus isolates were l. brevis (24.6%) l. fermentum (18.5%) l. casei (16.9%), l. delbrueckii (15.4%), l. plantarum (9.23%), l. acidophilus (7.69%), l. jensenii (4.62%), l. salivarius (1.54%) and l. gasseri (1.54%). the most common species was l. brevis (24.6%). the strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. all the lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, s. sonnei, klebsiella spp. and campylobacter sp. all the lactobacilli except l. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. the involvement of lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. the ability of lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.

TI  == comparative genomics of the late gene cluster from lactobacillus phages.
AB  == three prophage sequences were identified in the lactobacillus johnsoni strain ncc533. prophage lj965 predicted a gene map very similar to those of pac-site streptococcus thermophilus phages over its dna packaging and head and tail morphogenesis modules. sequence similarity linked the putative dna packaging and  head morphogenesis genes at the protein level. prophage lj965/s. thermophilus phage sfi11/lactococcus lactis phage tp901-1 on one hand and lactobacillus delbrueckii phage ll-h/lactobacillus plantarum phage phig1e/listeria monocytogenes phage a118 on the other hand defined two sublines of structural gene clusters in pac-site siphoviridae from low-gc gram-positive bacteria. bacillus subtilis phage spp1 linked both sublines. the putative major head and tail proteins from lj965 shared weak sequence similarity with phages from gram-negative bacteria. a clearly independent line of structural genes in siphoviridae from low-gc gram-positive bacteria is defined by temperate cos-site  phages including lactobacillus gasseri phage adh, which also shared sequence similarity with phage d3 infecting a gram-negative bacterium. a phylogenetic tree analysis demonstrated that the clpp-like protein identified in four cos-site siphoviridae from lactobacillus, lactococcus, streptococcus, and pseudomonas showed graded sequence relationships. the tree suggested that the clpp-like proteins from the phages were not acquired by horizontal gene transfer from their corresponding bacterial hosts.

TI  == proinflammatory cytokine and nitric oxide induction in murine macrophages by cell wall and cytoplasmic extracts of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == cells from a number of bacterial genera have been shown to possess mitogenic and  polyclonal activating properties when cultured with cells of the immune system. based on previously reported health immune-enhancing effects of fermented dairy products, we tested the potentiating effects of representative lactic acid bacteria and their extracts on leukocyte function. specifically, the effects of in vitro exposure to heat-killed cells of bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. gasseri, l. helveticus, l. reuteri, and  streptococcus thermophilus, their cell walls, and their cytoplasmic extracts on proliferation as well as cytokine and nitric oxide (no) production were examined  in the raw 264.7 macrophage cell line. a similar strategy was applied to murine cultures composed of peritoneal, spleen, and peyer's patch cells. both the cell wall and cytoplasmic fractions of lactic acid bacteria were able to stimulate cloned macrophages to produce significant amounts of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, (interleukin) il-6, and no. pronounced enhancement of il-6 production by peritoneal cells was observed when cultured with those extracts, whereas, effects were not noted in spleen and peyer's patch cell cultures from mice. based on the  results, it appears that, as a group, the lactic acid bacteria were capable of stimulating macrophages and possibly other immune cells to produce cytokines and  no, and both their cell walls and cytoplasm contributed to these capacities.

TI  == ex vivo effects of lactobacilli, streptococci, and bifidobacteria ingestion on cytokine and nitric oxide production in a murine model.
AB  == increasing numbers of functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations are being  promoted with health claims based on the potential probiotic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria and on their capacity for stimulating the host immune system. however, the specific immune effects of oral administration of these microbes still remains undefined. in this study, we tested the hypothesis that production of immunologic mediators by leukocytes in mice is affected by orally administered lactic acid bacteria. the specific objectives of this study were to  evaluate the effects of exposure to eight different lactic acid bacteria in mice  on ex vivo cytokine and nitric oxide production in leukocyte cultures. mice were  gavaged with 1 x 10(9) viable bacteria and peritoneal, peyer's patch and splenic  leukocytes were isolated 8 h later. these were cultured for 2 or 5 days in the presence or absence of mitogens and then interleukin (il)-6, il-12, interferon (ifn)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and nitric oxide production was measured. the results revealed that lactobacillus acidophilus and l. casei potentiated il-6 and il-12 production by peritoneal cells whereas l. acidophilus  upregulated ifn-gamma and nitric oxide. in contrast, l. helveticus, l. gasseri, l. reuteri, and bifidobacterium attenuated the production of il-6, ifn-gamma, and nitric oxide by peritoneal cells. tnf-alpha was not detectable in peritoneal cultures. none of the bacteria altered ex vivo production of cytokines or nitric  oxide by peyer's patch or spleen cell cultures. taken together, the results suggest that prior oral exposure to lactic acid bacteria could differentially potentiate or attenuate subsequent cytokine and nitric oxide production by peritoneal cells.

TI  == adherence of human vaginal lactobacilli to vaginal epithelial cells and interaction with uropathogens.
AB  == three strains of lactobacillus, identified as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus jensenii, were selected from among 70 isolates from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women for properties relevant  to mucosal colonization or antagonism. all three self-aggregated and adhered to epithelial vaginal cells, displacing well-known vaginal pathogens, such as g. vaginalis, and inhibiting the growth in vitro of escherichia coli and streptococcus agalactiae. the surface components involved in self-aggregation appeared to be proteins for l. gasseri and lipoproteins for l. acidophilus and l. jensenii, as judged by susceptibility to treatment with appropriate degrading enzymes. the factors responsible for adherence to epithelial vaginal cells seemed to be glycoproteins (l. acidophilus and l. gasseri) and carbohydrate (l. jensenii). the receptors of the vaginal cells were glycolipids, which presumably  were the targets of the competition observed between the lactobacilli and the pathogenic microbes.

TI  == lactobacillus- and bifidobacterium-mediated antigenotoxicity in the colon of rats.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are proposed to have several beneficial effects, including the inactivation of carcinogens. we have studied the potential of lactobacillus acidophilus (from a commercially available yogurt), lactobacillus gasseri (p79), lactobacillus confusus (dsm20196), streptococcus thermophilus (ncim 50083), bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium longum (from human infant stool) to prevent the induction of dna damage by n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng, 7.5 mg/kg body wt) in colon cells of  the rat. using the new technique of single cell microgel electrophoresis, all investigated strains were antigenotoxic toward mnng after a single dose of 10(10) viable cells/kg body wt p.o. eight hours before the carcinogen. one-half and one-tenth of this initial dose resulted in a loss of protective activity. high doses of heat-treated l. acidophilus strains were also not antigenotoxic. one mechanism of the preventive effect could be that bacterial metabolites or components are responsible. accordingly, selected examples were investigated in vitro in colon cells of the rat. metabolically active l. acidophilus cells, as well as an acetone extract of the culture, prevented mnng-induced dna damage. different cell fractions from l. acidophilus (cytoplasm, cell wall skeleton, cell wall) were devoid of antigenotoxic activity, whereas the peptidoglycan fraction and whole freeze-dried cells were antigenotoxic. as a second carcinogen, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh) was used. a dose- and time-response study was first performed to assess the effects of dmh in several segments of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract. exposure for 16 hours to 15 or 25 mg dmh/kg body wt  p.o. induced dna damage in cells of the distal colon of rats, whereas no cytotoxicity was seen. pretreatment orally with lab on four consecutive mornings  before dmh gavage (8 hours after the last lab application) revealed that l. acidophilus, l. confusus, l. gasseri, b. longum, and b. breve inhibited the genotoxic effect of dmh. one of four s. thermophilus and one of three lactobacillus delbrueckeii ssp. bulgaricus strains were also protective. heat-treated l. acidophilus did not inhibit dmh-induced genotoxicity. a few aliquots of the colon cells were processed immunohistochemically for the presence of the "proliferation cell nuclear antigen" (pcna). dmh treatment did not increase pcna, nor was there any modulation by lab. the effect of l. acidophilus  on foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes (phase i and phase ii) in liver and colon cells of rats revealed only one parameter to be modulated, namely, a two- to three-fold increase in the levels of nadph-cytochrome p-450 reductase. the meaning of this finding, in terms of possible chemoprevention by lab, remains unclear. in conclusion, our studies show that most, but not all, lab tested could strongly inhibit genotoxicity in the gi tract of the rat and that viable lab organisms are required for the protective effect in vivo. the comet assay technique is a powerful tool to elucidate such in vivo antigenotoxic activities in tumor target tissues.

TI  == primary structure and functional analysis of the lysis genes of lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phi adh.
AB  == the lysis genes of the lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phi adh were isolated  by complementation of a lambda sam mutation in escherichia coli. nucleotide sequencing of a 1,735-bp dna fragment revealed two adjacent coding regions of 342 bp (hol) and 951 bp (lys) in the same reading frame which appear to belong to a common transcriptional unit. proteins corresponding to the predicted gene products, holin (12.9 kda) and lysin (34.7 kda), were identified by in vitro and  in vivo expression of the cloned genes. the phi adh holin is a membrane-bound protein with structural similarity to lysis proteins of other phage, known to be  required for the transit of murein hydrolases through the cytoplasmic membrane. the phi adh lysin shows homology with mureinolytic enzymes encoded by the lactobacillus bulgaricus phage mv4, the streptococcus pneumoniae phage cp-1, cp-7, and cp-9, and the lactococcus lactis phage phi lc3. significant homology with the n termini of known muramidases suggests that phi adh lysin acts by a similar catalytic mechanism. in e. coli, the phi adh lysin seems to be associated with the total membrane fraction, from which it can be extracted with lauryl sarcosinate. either one of the phi adh lysis proteins provoked lysis of e. coli when expressed along with holins or lysins of phage lambda or bacillus subtilis phage phi 29. concomitant expression of the combined holin and lysin functions of phi adh in e. coli, however, did not result in efficient cell lysis.
