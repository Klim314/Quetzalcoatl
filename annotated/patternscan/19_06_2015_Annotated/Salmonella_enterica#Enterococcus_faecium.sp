TI  == intraepithelial lymphocyte numbers and histomorphological parameters in the porcine gut after enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 feeding in a salmonella typhimurium challenge.
AB  == salmonellae are among the most widespread sources of foodborne infections and salmonella typhimurium, in particular, is correlated with human disease caused by the consumption of contaminated pork. intraepithelial lymphocytes (iel) have early contact with intestinal antigens and play an important role in the detection of pathogenic bacteria. the objective of this study was to determine whether a presumed probiotic enterococcus faecium strain could improve histomorphological and immune system-related parameters of gut function after a salmonella challenge in weaned pigs. in particular the morphological parameters villus length and width, crypt depth and width as well as the actual enlargement  of the intestinal epithelial surface were calculated and the number of iel was evaluated in sections of the porcine gut. weaned piglets were challenged with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt 104, and half of them also received enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 in the diet. animals were sacrificed at days post infection (dpi) 2 and 28. the effect of the factors "time post-infection/age" and "probiotic treatment" on jejunal morphology and iel numbers and distribution was evaluated by light microscopy. the time post-infection had significant effects in both feeding groups. animals sacrificed at dpi 28 had longer and wider villi, deeper and wider crypts, a higher villus enlargement factor, a higher ratio between villus and crypt enlargement factors as well as more iel. probiotic treatment resulted in longer villi, a higher ratio of villus surface/crypt circumference enlargement factors and significantly more  iel. the larger total number of iel displayed by the probiotic group resulted from significantly higher numbers of iel at the nuclear and apical levels of the  intraepithelial compartment but not from the number of iel situated at the basement membrane. the probiotic effects were only measurable 28 dpi. it is proposed that enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 exerts an immune modulatory effect by increasing the numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes.

TI  == effects of the probiotic enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 on selected lactic acid bacteria and enterobacteria in co-culture.
AB  == enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 is used as a probiotic for piglets and has been  shown to modify the porcine intestinal microbiota. however, the mode of action of this probiotic modification is still unclear. one possible explanation is the direct growth inhibiting or stimulating effect of the probiotic on other indigenous bacteria. therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the growth interactions of the probiotic with different indigenous porcine bacteria in vitro. reference strains were cultivated with the probiotic e. faecium strain  ncimb10415 (sf68) in a checkerboard assay with 102 to 105 cells/ml inoculum per strain. growth kinetics were recorded for 8 h and used to determine specific growth of the co-cultures. additionally, total dna was extracted from the co-cultures at the end of the incubation to verify which strain in the co-culture was affected. co-cultivation with eight enterococcus spp. tester strains showed strain-specific growth differences. three of four e. faecium strains were not influenced by the probiotic strain. pcr results showed reduced growth of the probiotic strain in co-culture with e. faecium dsm 6177. three of four enterococcus faecalis strains showed reduced specific growth in co-culture with the probiotic strain. however, e. faecalis dsm 20478 impaired growth of the probiotic e. faecium strain. the growth of lactobacillus johnsonii dsm 10533 and  lactobacillus reuteri dsm 20016 was enhanced in co-culture with the probiotic strain, but co-cultivations with lactobacillus mucosae dsm13345 or lactobacillus  amylovorus dsm10533 showed no differences. co-cultures with the probiotic e. faecium showed no impact on the growth rate of four different enterobacterial reference strains (2 strains of salmonella enterica and 2 strains of escherichia  coli), but pcr results showed reduced cell numbers for a pathogenic e. coli isolate at higher concentration of the probiotic strain. as the in vitro effect of the probiotic e. faecium on enterococci was strain specific and the growth of  certain lactobacillus spp. was enhanced by the probiotic, these results indicate  a direct effect of the probiotic on certain members of the porcine gastro intestinal microbiota.

TI  == in-vitro screening of malaysian honey from different floral sources for antibacterial activity on human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: different researches on therapeutic effects of honey have been conducted in different regions; however the study on the potential antibacterial  activity of malaysian honey is still limited. in this study, antibacterial activities of different monofloral honey samples were tested against several common human pathogenic bacteria. materials and methods: the well-diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) techniques were employed to investigate the putative antibacterial activity of malaysian monofloral honey from koompassia excelsa (becc.) taub (tualang), melaleuca cajuputi powell (gelam) and durio zibethinus murr. (durian). honey samples were tested against staphylococcus aureus atcc6518  and atcc25923, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc12228, enterococcus faecium lmg16192, enterococcus faecalis lmg16216 and atcc29212, escherichia coli atcc25922, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc14028 and klebsiella pneumoniae atcc13883. results: marked variations were observed in the antibacterial activity of these honey samples. durian honey failed to produce substantial antibacterial activity, whereas tualang and gelam honey showed a spectrum of antibacterial activity with their growth inhibitory effects against all of the tested bacterial species including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). conclusion: present findings suggested gelam honey possesses highest antibacterial effect among the tested malaysian honey samples.

TI  == thiouracil-forming bacteria identified and characterized upon porcine in vitro digestion of brassicaceae feed.
AB  == in recent years, the frequent detection of the banned thyreostat thiouracil (tu)  in livestock urine has been related to endogenous tu formation following digestion of glucosinolate-rich brassicaceae crops. recently, it was demonstrated that, upon in vitro digestion of brassicaceae, fecal bacteria induce tu detection in livestock (porcine livestock > bovines). therefore, the present study was intended to isolate and identify bacteria involved in this intestinal tu formation upon brassicaceae digestion and to gain more insight into the underlying mechanism in porcine livestock. twenty porcine fecal inocula (gilts and multiparous sows) were assessed through static in vitro colonic-digestion simulations with rapeseed. after derivatization and extraction of the fecal suspensions, tu was analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (lc-ms(2)). on average, lower tu concentrations were observed in fecal colonic simulations in gilts (8.35 ng g(-1) rapeseed +/- 3.42 [mean +/- standard deviation]) than in multiparous sows (52.63 ng g(-1) +/- 16.17), which correlates with maturation of the gut microbial population with age. further exploration of  the mechanism showed cell-dependent activity of the microbial conversion and sustained tu-forming activity after subjection of the fecal inoculum to moderate  heat over a time span of up to 30 min. finally, nine tu-producing bacterial species were successfully isolated and identified by a combination of biochemical and molecular techniques as escherichia coli (n = 5), lactobacillus reuteri (n =  2), enterococcus faecium (n = 1), and salmonella enterica subsp. arizonae (n = 1). this report demonstrates that endogenous formation of tu is brassicaceae induced and occurs under colonic conditions most likely through myrosinase-like enzyme activity expressed by different common intestinal bacterial species.

TI  == survival of salmonella tennessee, salmonella typhimurium dt104, and enterococcus  faecium in peanut paste formulations at two different levels of water activity and fat.
AB  == long-term survival of heat-stressed salmonella tennessee, salmonella typhimurium  dt104, and enterococcus faecium was evaluated in four model peanut paste formulations with a combination of two water activity (aw) levels (0.3 and 0.6) and two fat levels (47 and 56%) over 12 months at 20 +/- 1 degrees c. prior to storage, the inoculated peanut paste formulations were heat treated at 75 degrees c for up to 50 min to obtain an approximately 1.0-log reduction of each organism. the cell population of each organism in each formulation was monitored with tryptic soy agar plate counts, immediately after heat treatment, at 2 weeks for the first month, and then monthly for up to 1 year. the log reductions (log cfu per gram) following 12 months of storage were between 1.3 and 2.4 for salmonella  tennessee, 1.8 and 2.8 for salmonella typhimurium, and 1.1 and 2.1 for e. faecium in four types of model peanut paste formulations. enhanced survivability was observed in pastes with lower aw for all organisms, compared with those with higher aw (p < 0.05). in contrast, the effect of fat level (47 and 56%) on survival of all organisms was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). whereas survivability of salmonella tennessee and typhimurium dt104 did not differ significantly (p > 0.05), e. faecium demonstrated higher survivability than salmonella (p < 0.05). salmonella survived in the model peanut pastes well over 12 months, which is longer than the expected shelf life for peanut butter products. the information from this study can be used to design safer food processing and food safety plans for peanut butter processing.

TI  == a broad-spectrum antibiofilm peptide enhances antibiotic action against bacterial biofilms.
AB  == biofilm-related infections account for at least 65% of all human infections, but  there are no available antimicrobials that specifically target biofilms. their elimination by available treatments is inefficient since biofilm cells are between 10- and 1,000-fold more resistant to conventional antibiotics than planktonic cells. here we describe the synergistic interactions, with different classes of antibiotics, of a recently characterized antibiofilm peptide, 1018, to potently prevent and eradicate bacterial biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant eskape (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) pathogens. combinations of peptide 1018 and the antibiotic ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, or tobramycin were synergistic in 50% of assessments and decreased by 2- to 64-fold the concentration of antibiotic required to treat biofilms formed by pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, and methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus. furthermore, in flow cell biofilm studies, combinations of low, subinhibitory levels of the peptide (0.8 mug/ml) and ciprofloxacin (40 ng/ml) decreased dispersal and triggered cell death in mature p. aeruginosa biofilms. in addition, short-term treatments with the peptide in combination with ciprofloxacin prevented biofilm formation and reduced p. aeruginosa pa14 preexisting biofilms. pcr studies indicated that the peptide suppressed the expression of various antibiotic targets in biofilm cells. thus, treatment with the peptide represents a novel strategy to potentiate antibiotic activity against biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant pathogens.

TI  == potential of goat probiotic to bind mutagens.
AB  == the mutagen binding ability of the goat probiotics (lactobacillus reuteri ddl 19, lactobacillus alimentarius ddl 48, enterococcus faecium dde 39, and bifidobacterium bifidum ddba) was evaluated. the oral administration of these probiotics reduced fecal mutagens and intestinal cancer markers in goats. secondly, the effects of probiotics against the mutagenesis induced by sodium azide (sa), and benzopyrene (b[alpha]p) by performing the modified ames test using salmonella typhimurium ta 100 was investigated. the capacity to bind benzopyrene and the stability of the bacterial-mutagen complex was analyzed by hplc. the dismutagenic potential against both mutagens was proportional to probiotic concentration. results showed that probiotic antimutagenic capacity against sa was ranging from 13 to 78%. the mixture of four goat probiotics (mgp)  displayed higher antimutagenic activity against sa than any individual strains at the same cell concentration. this study shows that the highest diminution of mutagenicity in presence of b[alpha]p (74%) was observed in presence of mgp. the  antimutagenic activity of nearly all the individual probiotic and the mgp were in concordance with the b[alpha]p binding determined by hplc. according to our results, the b[alpha]p binding to probiotic was irreversible still after being washed with dmso solution. the stability of the toxic compounds-bacterial cell binding is a key consideration when probiotic antimutagenic property is evaluated. mgp exhibits the ability to bind and detoxify potent mutagens, and this property can be useful in supplemented foods for goats since it can lead to  the removal of potent mutagens and protect and enhance ruminal health and hence food safety of consumers.

TI  == in ovo inoculation of chicken embryos with probiotic bacteria and its effect on posthatch salmonella susceptibility.
AB  == the feasibility of establishing probiotic bacteria in the intestine of broiler chickens by in ovo inoculation was investigated, followed by verifying possible subsequent protection against salmonella enteriditis infection. in a first study, 7 commercially available probiotics were screened for compatibility with in ovo inoculation. two of these probiotics, one being a enterococcus faecium and the other a bacillus subtilis, were selected for colonizing the chick gut without compromising hatchability. in a second study, these 2 products were administered  in ovo and in the feed to chicks reared until 18 d in comparison with noninoculated chicks and with chicks fed an antibiotic. all chicks were orally challenged with salmonella enteritidis at 4 d of age. results showed reduced performance of salmonella enteritidis challenged chicks fed no additives compared with challenged chicks fed antibiotic, but no significant differences in mortality was observed. probiotics offered in ovo or through the diet could only  partially recover performance compared with antibiotic-fed chicks. a significant  reduction in the number of salmonella enteritidis positive chicks was observed when chicks were in ovo inoculated with e. faecium and continued receiving it in  the diet. this work establishes standards for future in ovo colonization research and emphasizes its value as a promising method to deliver individual precise dose of probiotics to poultry in mass scale at the earliest possible age based on the  competitive exclusion concept. in ovo colonization with probiotic can therefore become an important ally in combination with other approaches to combat salmonella and other intestinal bacterial infections in poultry.

TI  == high inhibition of paenibacillus larvae and listeria monocytogenes by enterococcus isolated from different sources in tunisia and identification of their bacteriocin genes.
AB  == a total of 300 isolates of enterococcus, from different sources including faeces  of poultry, cow and sheep, raw milk, ricotta cheese and water, in tunisia, were screened for their antibacterial activity. amongst them, 59 bacteriocin-producing strains were detected and identified by molecular methods. genes encoding for enta, entp, entb, entl50a/b, as-48 and bac31 bacteriocins were targeted by pcr. the bacteriocin-producing strains were assigned to the species enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus mundtii and enterococcus durans, respectively, 34, 19, 3, 2 and 1 isolates. antimicrobial activity was specifically observed against different spoilage and pathogenic micro-organisms, such as listeria monocytogenes, listeria innocua, listeria ivanovii, escherichia coli, ent. faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis and paenibacillus larvae. the inhibitory activity was totally lost after proteinase k treatment, thereby revealing the proteinaceous nature of the antimicrobial compound. only three bacteriocin genes, namely entp, enta and entl50a/b were detected in the isolates included in this study. enterocins a and p were the most frequent genes and they were found in 55  (93.2%) and 39 isolates (66.1%), respectively, followed by enterocin l50a/b present in 27 isolates (45.7%). these newly identified bacteriocin-producing enterococci have the potential to be used in bio-preservation of food as well as  biological control of foulbrood disease. significance and impact of the study: enterococci possess interesting properties not only for the food industry, but also for animal and human health. the antimicrobial potential of these bacteria includes principally bacteriocin-like molecules. with the aim of identifying bacteriocinogenic strains, a collection of 300 enterococci isolated from different origins were screened and their spectrum of action, as well as the gene encoding the bacteriocin, was determined. fifty-nine bacteriocin-producing enterococcus showed high activity against listeria monocytogenes and paenibacillus larvae, the causative agent of american foulbrood. enterocins a, p  and l50a/b were found in various combinations. the most important finding of this study is the growth inhibition of p. larvae due to bacteriocin-producing enterococcus, which opens up the possibility to use these strains to control the  disease in honeybees.

TI  == characterization of cd4+ subpopulations and cd25+ cells in ileal lymphatic tissue of weaned piglets infected with salmonella typhimurium with or without enterococus faecium feeding.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to test the effect of enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 (e. faecium) on cd4+ t helper immune cell subpopulations and cd25+ cells in ileal lymphatic tissue after challenge with salmonella (s.) typhimurium dt 104. german landrace piglets treated with e. faecium (n=16) as a feed additive and untreated controls (n=16) were challenged with s. typhimurium 10 days after weaning. the expression of lineage specific t helper cell subtype master transcription factors on mrna level was measured in the whole tissue of the gut associated lymphoid tissues (ileocecal mesenteric lymph node, ileum with peyer's  patches and papilla ilealis) and in magnetically sorted t helper cells from blood and ileocecal mesenteric lymph nodes at two and 28 days post infection. cd25 protein expression of t helper cells was studied by flow cytometry in ileal peyer's patches, lymph nodes and blood. distribution and morphology of cd25+ cells was demonstrated in situ by immunohistochemistry in paraffin embedded specimens of the ileum and the ileocecal mesenteric lymph nodes. the data provide evidence for a higher t helper 2 cell driven immune response in the control group compared to the e. faecium treated group (p<0.05) in cd4+ magnetically sorted lymphocytes from the ileocecal mesenteric lymph nodes at two and 28 days post infection. we did not observe differences for cd25+ cells in immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry between e. faecium fed pigs and the control group, but provided a detailed description of the occurrence and morphology of these cells in the gut associate lymphoid tissues of piglets. in conclusion we suggest that (i) prolonged feeding with e. faecium can result in changes of the t helper cell  response leading to a stronger infection with s. typhimurium and (ii) that it is  important to examine purified immune cells to be able to detect effects on t helper cell subpopulations.

TI  == use of enterococcus faecium as a surrogate for salmonella enterica during extrusion of a balanced carbohydrate-protein meal.
AB  == multiple outbreaks of salmonellosis have been associated with the consumption of  low-moisture products, including extruded products. therefore, there is a need for a nonpathogenic, surrogate microorganism that can be used to validate extrusion processes for salmonella. the objective of this research was to determine if enterococcus faecium nrrl b-2354 is an adequate surrogate organism for salmonella during extrusion. extrusions at different temperatures were done in material contaminated with both organisms. results indicated that the minimum  temperature needed to achieve a 5-log reduction of e. faecium was 73.7 degrees c. above 80.3 degrees c, the enumeration of e. faecium showed counts below the detectable levels (<10 cfu g(- 1)). salmonella was reduced by 5 log at 60.6 degrees c, and above 68.0 degrees c the levels of this organism in the product were below the detection limit of the method. the data show that e. faecium is inactivated at higher temperatures than salmonella, indicating that its use as a  surrogate would provide an appropriate margin of error in extrusion processes designed to eliminate this pathogen. attempting to minimize risk, the industry could validate different formulations, in combination with thermal treatments, using e. faecium as a safer alternative for those validation studies.

TI  == enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 supplementation affects intestinal immune-associated gene expression in post-weaning piglets.
AB  == in a salmonella challenge study of weaned piglets supplemented with the probiotic enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 (sf68), we observed a delayed, post-infection proliferative response of purified blood mononuclear cell fractions towards salmonella antigens. in order to clarify this observation, we examined the patterns of immune-associated gene expression in long-term feeding trials of both pre- and post-weaning piglets. piglets supplemented with e. faecium ncimb 10415 showed a post-weaning dysregulation in the expression patterns of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression in intestinal tissues and spleen. piglets of the supplemented group showed significantly reduced levels of il-8, il-10 and  the co-stimulatory molecule cd86 mrna expression in ileal peyer's patches. the expression of ctla4, an inhibitor of t-cell activation/proliferation, showed similar levels of expression in all tissues examined, particularly in ileal peyer's patches post-weaning where il-8, il-10 and cd86 transcript levels were significantly reduced relative to control animals. blood serum cytokine protein levels showed elevated tgfbeta in pre-weaning piglets which, together with il-6,  may have suppressed ifngamma production in the probiotic-fed animals. in a second salmonella challenge study, post-weaning, e. faecium-fed animals showed significantly elevated levels of il-8 gene expression in mesenteric lymph nodes,  but reduced levels in the spleen. at early times post-infection, the probiotic-fed group showed similar levels of il-10, cd86 and ctla4 mrna expression as the control animals in intestinal peyer's patches, despite high relative levels of il-8 expression in mesenteric lymph nodes. the sum of the observations suggests that supplementation of pre-weaning piglets with e. faecium affects intestinal immune-associated gene expression, which is aggravated post-weaning when the animals receive increased levels of the probiotic in feed.  we suggest the post-weaning reductions in gene expression may delay the host response to infections, and provide pathogenic bacteria such as salmonella with a "window of opportunity", leading to the increased bacterial loads and shedding observed in challenge trials. possible mechanisms explaining these effects of e.  faecium ncimb 10415 are discussed.

AB  == the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase aph(3')-iia primarily inactivates kanamycin and neomycin, whilst aph(3')-iiia also inactivates amikacin. the aim of this study was to determine the frequency of both resistance genes in major human pathogens to obtain their baseline prevalence in the gene pool of these bacterial populations in austria. in total, 10 541 escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica and staphylococcus aureus isolates were collected representatively without selection bias between 2008 and 2011. isolates were analysed by aph(3')-iiia/nptiii- and aph(3')-iia/nptii-specific taqman real-time pcr. for positive strains, mics using etests were performed and resistance gene sequences  were determined. the overall prevalence of aph(3')-iiia/nptiii was 1.62 % (95 % confidence interval: 1.38-1.88 %). in escherichia coli, enterococci, staphylococcus aureus, p. aeruginosa and salmonella spp., the aph(3')-iiia/nptiii prevalence was 0.47 % (0-1.47 %), 37.53 % (32.84-42.40 %), 2.90 % (1.51-5.02 %),  0 % (0-0.32 %) and 0 % (0-0.037 %), respectively. eleven of a total of 169 carriers showed single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the resistance allele. the overall prevalence of aph(3')-iia/nptii was 0.0096 % (0-0.046 %). escherichia coli (0-0.70 %), enterococci (0-0.75 %), staphylococcus aureus (0-0.73 %) and p.  aeruginosa (0-0.32 %) did not carry aph(3')-iia. a single salmonella isolate was  positive, resulting in an aph(3')-iia prevalence of 0.013 % (0-0.058 %). aph(3')-iiia/nptiii carriers were moderately prevalent in the strains tested except for in enterococci, which appeared to be an important reservoir for aph(3')-iiia. aph(3')-iia/nptii genes were detected at clinically irrelevant frequencies and played no significant role in the aminoglycoside resistance gene  pool during the observation period.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == food-borne zoonotic pathogens and antimicrobial resistance of indicator bacteria  in urban wild boars in barcelona, spain.
AB  == wildlife is increasingly abundant in urban environments, but little is known about the zoonotic pathogens carried by these populations. urban wild boars are of particular concern because this species is well-known as a pathogen reservoir, and thus, we studied selected zoonotic pathogens in urban wild boars in barcelona, spain (n=41). salmonella enterica was found in 5.00% (95% ci 0.61-16.91) and campylobacter coli in 4.88% (95% ci 0.6-16.53) of the animals. e. coli o157:h7 and c. jejuni were not found. other thermophilic campylobacter were  moderately prevalent (19.51%, 95% ci 8.82-34.87). additionally, we screened for antimicrobial resistance in indicator bacteria: resistance was most frequent in enterococcus faecium (95% of the isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent), followed by enterococcus faecalis (50%) and escherichia coli (10%). for the first time resistance to linezolid in bacteria carried by wildlife is reported. these findings pose a concern for public health, and thus,  further research is needed on wildlife in urban environments.

AB  == enterococcus faecium yf5, a strain previously isolated from sourdough, was assessed for safety and probiotic potential. its virulence and antibiotic resistant phenotypes (cytolysin and gelatinase production, antibiotic susceptibility) and genes (cyla, gele, ace, agg, esp, and vana) were surveyed. results indicated that the tested virulence determinants were nontoxic. in addition, e. faecium yf5 was sensitive to 3 antibiotics such as amoxicillin, vancomycin, and chloramphenicol. furthermore, results of in vivo animal acute oral toxicity of e. faecium yf5 studies were similar to the control group that indicated no abnormalities. in addition, e. faecium yf5 stably survived in low ph, bile salts, gastric, and intestinal fluids in vitro. moreover, e. faecium yf5 was found to adhere to human colon cancer cell line ht-29 at 3.39 (+/-0.67) x 10(5) cfu/ml. when cocultured with pathogenic organisms (enterobacter sakazakii cmcc45402, escherichia coli cmcc44102, enterohemorrhage escherichia coli o157: h7 cmcc44828, salmonella typhimurium cmcc50071, shigella flexneri 301, and shigella  sonnei atcc 29930) and 2 gram-positive strains (listeria monocytogenes cmcc54001  and staphylococcus aureus cmcc 26003), it inhibited these foodborne pathogens with exception of s. aureus. therefore, e. faecium yf5 can be regarded as a safe  strain and it may be used as a probiotic preparation or for microecologics.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils from mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar  diffusion method. the essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against gram-positive (listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and  gram-negative strains (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for most essential oils examined, s. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while p. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. in general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.

AB  == the diversity of bacteria associated with the fermentation of inyu, also known as black soy sauce, was studied through the nested pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of samples collected from the fermentation stages of the inyu production process. the dgge profiles targeted the bacterial 16s rdna and revealed the presence of citrobacter farmeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter  hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, pantoea agglomerans, salmonella enterica, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus sciuri and weissella confusa. the bacterial compositions of 4 fermented samples were further elucidated using the plate count method. the bacteria isolated from the koji-making stage exhibited the highest diversity; brachybacterium rhamnosum, e.  hormaechei, k. pneumoniae, kurthia gibsonii, pantoea dispersa, staphylococcus gallinarum, staphylococcus kloosii and s. sciuri were identified. koji collected  during the preincubation stage presented the largest cell counts, and e. hormaechei, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and enterobacter pulveris were identified.  in brine samples aged for 7 and 31 days, the majority of the bacteria isolated belonged to 4 bacillus species, but 4 staphylococcus species and delftia tsuruhatensis were also detected. this study demonstrates the benefits of using a combined approach to obtain a more complete picture of microbial populations and  provides useful information for the control or development of bacterial flora during inyu fermentation.

TI  == no beneficial effects evident for enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 in weaned pigs infected with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104.
AB  == salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt 104 is the major pathogen for salmonellosis outbreaks in europe. we tested if the probiotic bacterium enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 can prevent or alleviate salmonellosis. therefore, piglets of the german landrace breed that were treated with e. faecium (n = 16) as a feed additive and untreated controls (n = 16) were challenged with  s. typhimurium 10 days after weaning. the presence of salmonellae in feces and selected organs, as well as the immune response, were investigated. piglets treated with e. faecium gained less weight than control piglets (p = 0.05). the feeding of e. faecium had no effect on the fecal shedding of salmonellae and resulted in a higher abundance of the pathogen in tonsils of all challenged animals. the specific (anti-salmonella igg) and nonspecific (haptoglobin) humoral immune responses as well as the cellular immune response (t helper cells, cytotoxic t cells, regulatory t cells, gammadelta t cells, and b cells) in the lymph nodes, peyer's patches of different segments of the intestine (jejunal and  ileocecal), the ileal papilla, and in the blood were affected in the course of time after infection (p < 0.05) but not by the e. faecium treatment. these results led to the conclusion that e. faecium may not have beneficial effects on  the performance of weaned piglets in the case of s. typhimurium infection. therefore, we suggest a critical discussion and reconsideration of e. faecium ncimb 10415 administration as a probiotic for pigs.

TI  == controlling salmonella infection in weanling pigs through water delivery of direct-fed microbials or organic acids: part ii. effects on intestinal histology  and active nutrient transport.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of water-delivered, direct-fed microbials (dfm) or organic acids on intestinal morphology and active  nutrient absorption in weanling pigs after deliberate salmonella infection. pigs  (n = 88) were weaned at 19 +/- 2 d of age and assigned to 1 of the following treatments, which were administered for 14 d: 1) control diet; 2) control diet +  dfm (enterococcus faecium, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus licheniformis) in drinking water at 10(9) cfu/l for each strain of bacteria; 3) control diet + organic acid-based blend (predominantly propionic, acetic, and benzoic acids) in  drinking water at 2.58 ml/l; and 4) control diet + 55 mg/kg carbadox. pigs were challenged with 10(10) cfu salmonella enterica var typhimurium 6 d after commencement of treatments. pigs (n = 22/d) were harvested before salmonella challenge and on d 2, 4, and 8 after challenge. duodenal, jejunal, and ileal mucosal tissues were sampled for measurement of villus height and crypt depth. jejunal tissue was sampled for determination of active nutrient absorption in modified ussing chambers. duodenal villus height was greater in pigs fed in-feed  antibiotic before infection (p < 0.05). jejunal crypts were deeper in dfm- and acid-treated pigs on d 4 after infection compared with all other treatments (p <  0.05). salmonella infection resulted in a linear decrease in phosphorus (p < 0.001) and glucose (p < 0.05) active transport, and an increase (p < 0.001) in glutamine uptake immediately after challenge. salmonella infection reduced basal  short-circuit current (i(sc)); however, water-delivered dfm or organic acid treatments caused greater basal i(sc) on d 2 after challenge than did carbadox. carbachol-induced chloride ion secretion was greatest in negative control pigs before infection (p < 0.01) and dfm-treated pigs (p < 0.05) after infection. in conclusion, both the dfm and acidification treatments induced increases in basal  active ion movement and jejunal crypt depth, which could be interpreted as responses consistent with increased salmonella pathology, but none of the additives markedly affected intestinal absorptive and secretory function in response to salmonella challenge.

TI  == efficacy of multiple metals against copper-resistant bacterial strains.
AB  == aims: the antibacterial efficacy of zeolites containing copper (cu) or silver (ag) ions or a combination was assessed against several reported copper-resistant (cu(r)) bacterial strains. methods and results: comparison strains were obtained  from the american type culture collection that had no documented metal resistance. reductions in bacterial populations were determined after exposure time intervals of 3, 6 and 24 h. all three cu(r) strains of salmonella enterica exhibited resistance to cu, ag and cu/ag after three and 6 h of exposure. both the cu(r) and comparison strain of enterococcus faecium were resistant to both metals and the metal combination. cu(r) pseudomonas putida was significantly reduced by all zeolites within 3 h. the cu(r) escherichia coli strain was more sensitive to cu, but more resistant to ag than the comparison strain; however, significant reductions were achieved within 3 h with both cu and cu/ag, and within 24 h with ag. conclusions: some strains with reported resistance to cu were also resistant to ag, suggestive of a shared resistance mechanism such as an indiscriminate cu efflux pump. ent. faecium appears to have innate resistance to  both metals. in general, ent. faecium was the most resistant species to the individual metals and the combination of metals, ps. putida the least resistant,  and the salmonella strains were more resistant than e. coli. significance and impact of the study: several of the comparison strains with no reported copper resistance were resistant to one or both metals. this may call into question the  methods for determining bacterial metal resistance, which typically use nutrient-rich media containing metals to assess the ability of the bacteria to grow in comparison with a wild-type strain. nevertheless, all the cu(r) strains evaluated in this study, with the exception of ent. faecium, were reduced using the cu and ag zeolite combination.

TI  == studies on the effect of an enterococcus faecium probiotic on t cell populations  in peripheral blood and intestinal epithelium and on the susceptibility to salmonella during a challenge infection with salmonella typhimurium in piglets.
AB  == although enterococcus faecium is used as a probiotic feed supplement in animal production, feeding of the bacterium to piglets resulted in a more severe infection with salmonella typhimurium dt104 during a challenge experiment. to enlighten the mode of action by which e. faecium affected the piglets' health, we investigated the influence of the probiotic bacterium on the development of intestinal and circulating immune cells during a challenge experiment with s. typhimurium dt104. to minimise varying impacts of the maternal immunity on the course of infection, only piglets were implemented that descended from salmonella-free sows. in addition, the potency of purified blood and intraepithelial immune cells to control the growth of salmonella was tested in vitro. in animals treated with e. faecium, a reduction of intraepithelial cd8alphabeta t cells, reduced circulating cd8alphabeta t cells and a less efficient control of intracellular salmonella growth, mediated by peripheral blood mononuclear cells, were observed.

TI  == controlling salmonella infection in weanling pigs through water delivery of direct-fed microbials or organic acids. part i: effects on growth performance, microbial populations, and immune status.
AB  == pigs (n = 88) weaned at 19 +/- 2 d of age were used in a 14-d study to evaluate the effects of water-delivered direct-fed microbials (dfm) or organic acids on growth, immune status, salmonella infection and shedding, and intestinal microbial populations after intranasal inoculation of salmonella typhimurium (10(10) cfu/pig). pigs were challenged with salmonella 6 d after commencement of  water treatments. treatments were 1) control diet; 2) control diet + dfm (enterococcus faecium, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus licheniformis) in drinking water at 10(9) cfu/l for each strain of bacteria; 3) control diet + an organic acid-based blend (predominantly propionic, acetic, and benzoic acid) in drinking  water at 2.58 ml/l; and 4) control diet + 55 mg/kg of carbadox. serum samples were taken on d 6, 8, 10, and 14 for determination of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnfalpha) concentrations. fecal samples were taken on d 0, 5, 7, and 11 for determination of salmonella shedding and enumeration of coliforms. pigs were euthanized on d 6, 8, 10, and 14. intestinal and cecal tissue and digesta and mesenteric lymph nodes were sampled and analyzed for salmonella. duodenal, jejunal, and ileal mucosal scrapings were sampled for measurement of mucosal tnfalpha concentrations. water delivery of dfm prevented a decline in adg on d 2  to 6 postchallenge compared with the negative control (p < 0.05). coliform counts tended to be greater (p = 0.09) in the cecum of the dfm treatment group on d 2 postinfection compared with the negative control and acid treatment groups. however, salmonella prevalence in the feces, gastrointestinal tract, or lymph nodes was not affected by water delivery of acids or dfm. serum and mucosal tnfalpha concentrations were not affected by treatment throughout the study with  the exception of ileal concentrations on d 4 postchallenge, which were greater in the negative control group compared with all other treatments (p < 0.05). the in-feed antibiotic was the only treatment that reduced salmonella prevalence and  this was localized to the cecum on d 8 postinfection. in conclusion, the dfm and  organic acid treatments used in this study offered little or no benefits to pigs  infected with salmonella and should not be considered under the constraints of this study as viable alternatives to in-feed antibiotics in a pathogen challenge  situation.

AB  == the protective effect of enterococcus faecium ef55 in chickens challenged with salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis phage type 4 (se pt4) was assessed. the antibacterial effect on the bacterial microflora in the small intestine in relation to white blood cell count, phenotyping of peripheral blood and intestinal lymphocytes, functional activity of lymphocytes and phagocytes and mucin quantitation were investigated. day-old chicks (85) were randomly divided into four groups. the probiotic group (ef) and salmonella+probiotic group (efse)  received e. faecium ef55 (10(9) cfu - 3 g/group/day) for 21 days. the salmonella  group (se) and efse group were infected with salmonella enteritidis (10(8) cfu in 0.2 ml pbs) in a single dose per os on day four of the experiment. the control group chicks (c) were fed a commercial diet without added bacteria. supplementation of ef55 in the diet of the chickens in the efse group, challenged with s. enteritidis, caused the density of the intestinal mucin layer to increase significantly in non-specific regions (duodenum and jejunum), but decrease significantly in target regions (caeca) for s. enteritidis. probiotic treatment also appeared to result in a significantly higher number of lymphocytes in peripheral blood and a tendency to increase cd3, cd4, cd8, and igm positive cells 3 days post-infection with s. enteritidis. the results demonstrated an antibacterial effect and suggested that ef55 had a moderating effect on intestinal mucin production and leukocytic response in the early phase of s. enteritidis infection.

AB  == pediococcus sp. nrrl b-2354 was investigated as a potential nonpathogenic surrogate for salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis phage type 30 (se pt30) on  the surface of almonds subjected to moist-air heating. both microorganisms were subjected to various time, temperature, and humidity regimens on almonds processed in a computer-controlled, laboratory-scale, moist-air convection oven.  overall, the mean log reductions for pediococcus sp. were 0.6 log and 1.4 log lower than those for se pt30 (p < 0.05) at predicted reductions of 3 and 5 log, respectively. also, the d(ref)-values for pediococcus sp., calculated using a modified inactivation model (accounting for moisture) for se pt30 on the surface  of almonds subjected to moist-air heating (30 to 90% moisture by volume) were ~30% larger than those for se pt30. based on these findings, pediococcus sp. nrrl b-2354 can be used as a conservative surrogate for se pt30 during moist-air heating, and this organism is also likely to be an acceptable surrogate for steam heating.

TI  == bifidobacterium animalis ahc7 protects against pathogen-induced nf-kappab activation in vivo.
AB  == background: bifidobacteria and lactobacilli are among the early and important colonizers of the gastrointestinal tract and are generally considered to be part  of a normal, healthy microbiota. it is believed that specific strains within the  microbiota can influence host immune-reactivity and may play a role in protection from infection and aberrant inflammatory activity. one such strain, bifidobacterium animalis ahc7, has been previously shown to protect against salmonella typhimurium infection in mice and helps resolve acute idiopathic diarrhea in dogs. the aim of this study was to investigate the potential molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning the bifidobacterium animalis ahc7  protective effect. results: following 4 hours of infection with salmonella typhimurium, nf-kappab activation was significantly elevated in vivo in placebo and enterococcus faecium-fed animals while bifidobacterium animalis ahc7 consumption significantly attenuated the nf-kappab response. in vitro anti-cd3/cd28 stimulated peyer's patch cells secreted significantly less tnf-alpha and ifn-gamma following bifidobacterium animalis ahc7 consumption. stimulated cells released more il-12p70 but this difference did not reach statistical significance. no alteration in mucosal il-6, il-10 or mcp-1 levels were observed. no statistically significant change in the cytokine profile of mesenteric lymph node cells was noted. in vitro, bifidobacterium animalis ahc7 was bound by dendritic cells and induced secretion of both il-10 and il-12p70. in addition, co-culture of cd4+ t cells with bifidobacterium animalis ahc7-stimulated dendritic cells resulted in a significant increase in cd25+foxp3+ t cell numbers. conclusion: bifidobacterium animalis ahc7 exerts an anti-inflammatory effect via the attenuation of pro-inflammatory transcription factor activation in response to an infectious insult associated with modulation  of pro-inflammatory cytokine production within the mucosa. the cellular mechanism underpinning bifidobacterium animalis ahc7 mediated attenuation of nf-kappab activation may include recognition of the bacterium by dendritic cells and induction of cd25+foxp3+ t cells.

TI  == inactivation of cronobacter sakazakii by ultrasonic waves under pressure in buffer and foods.
AB  == the objective of this research was to characterize the resistance of cronobacter  sakazakii to ultrasonic waves under pressure (manosonication, ms). the d(ms) value (decimal reduction time value) of c. sakazakii in standard conditions (35 degrees c, 117 mum, 200 kpa, citrate-phosphate buffer ph 7.0) was 0.41 min. this  value was higher than that of yersinia enterocolitica (d(ms)=0.19 min) and lower  than those of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis (d(ms)=0.61 min), listeria  monocytogenes (d(ms)=0.86 min), and enterococcus faecium (d(ms)=1.2 min). strain  studied (atcc 29544, nctc 8155, 9238, and 9529), growth temperature (10, 20, 30,  and 37 degrees c), and ph of the treatment media (4.0, 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0) did not significantly change c. sakazakii ms resistance. conversely, entry into stationary growth phase, decreasing water activity of the treatment media (0.98,  0.96, and 0.94), and treatment in food products (apple and orange juices, chicken and vegetable soups, and rehydrated powdered milk) resulted in up to a 1.6-, 3.9-, and 2.5-fold maximum change in d(ms) values, respectively. whereas an exponential relationship between the amplitude of ultrasonic waves and d(ms) values was found, the relationship between static pressure and d(ms) values was better described by a quadratic equation. the energy transferred into the medium  determined the lethality of the ultrasonic waves regardless of the combination of pressure (0, 50, 100, 200 and 300 kpa) and amplitude (34, 62, 90, 117 and 145 mum) applied. there was an exponential relationship between d(ms) values and the  power input: an increase of 134 w increased the inactivation rate ten times regardless of the treatment medium. no c. sakazakii cells with sublethally injured cytoplasmic membrane or with sublethal oxidative damage occurred after ms treatments, but the results indicated that damage to the outer membrane preceded  microbial death.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic activities of animal intestinal strains against swine-associated pathogens.
AB  == a wide range of enteropathogens cause costly diarrhoeal diseases in fattening piglets and account for food-related infections in humans. the objective of this  study was to screen beneficial bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract  of various animal sources for antagonistic activity against diverse pathogens associated with hazardous pig production times. using agar spot assays, 15 well-characterized strains belonging to lactobacillus, enterococcus, bifidobacterium and bacillus were studied for inhibition of clostridium perfringens type a, various serovars of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, as well as brachyspira pilosicoli. strong antagonists were further analyzed by studying their cell-free supernatants with and without ph neutralization, proteinase k and catalase treatment. enterobacteriaceae were effectively inhibited by lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus reuteri strains, independent from the animal source, and on a lower level by single strains belonging to lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus amylovorus and bifidobacterium thermophilum, due to organic acid production. the bacillus subtilis strain was found to produce an anti-clostridial and anti-brachyspira metabolite of proteinaceous nature. homofermentative lactobacilli and b. thermophilum could suppress the growth of b. pilosicoli, the causative agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, whereas heterofermentative strains belonging to l. reuteri and l. mucosae had no effect. the lactic acid bacteria exerted their activity primarily by organic acid release, except one enterococcus faecium and l. amylovorus strain, which exhibited antagonism through joint activity of lactate and hydrogen peroxide. the findings of this study provide a basis for further in vitro studies and encourage feeding studies to evaluate the antagonistic potential of promising strains in pig production.

AB  == the protective effect of enterococcus faecium ef 55 against salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis phage type 4 (se pt4) was studied in 1-day-old chicks. the ef 55 strain (isolated and characterised by the authors earlier) was applied daily (1.10(9) cfu/0.2 ml pbs) for 7 days. oral inoculation of the se pt4 strain was performed on day 8 in a single dose of 5.10(8) cfu/0.2 ml pbs. the experiment lasted for 21 days. samples were collected on day 1 of the experiment to verify the absence of salmonella, on day 8 to check colonisation of ef 55 and immunological status in experimental birds, and on days 2, 4, 6, 8 and 14 after se pt4 infection of chicks. strain ef 55 sufficiently colonised the digestive tract of chicks after 7 days of application. the highest numbers of ef 55 in the  faeces of chicks were observed before se infection and persisted to day 6 post infection (p.i.) in both the ef and ef+se groups. pcr confirmed the identity of the ef 55 strain. the counts of se pt4 strain in faeces of the ef+se group were significantly reduced in comparison to those in the se group on days 2 and 14 p.i. (p < 0.01). the significant reduction of salmonellae in the caecum was recorded at the end of the experiment (day 14 p.i.) in the ef+se group in comparison to the se group (p < 0.01). at day 4 p.i., colonies of s. enteritidis  pt4 were found in the liver of chicks of the se group in a higher concentration than in chicks of the ef+se group (p < 0.001). salmonellae were isolated from the liver until days 8 and 6 p.i. in the se and ef+se groups, respectively. the mean  values of actual lymphocyte subpopulations in the blood and the relative percentage of caecal intraepithelial lymphocyte subpopulations (cd4, cd8, cd44, tcr, mhc ii and igm) were not influenced at a statistically significant level by  the application of the ef 55 and/or the se pt4 strain. the results demonstrate the antimicrobial effect of e. faecium ef 55 against s. enteritidis pt4.

AB  == the beneficial effects of probiotic enterococcus spp. in different hosts, such as mice and humans, have previously been reported in several studies. however, studies of large domestic animals, as well as challenge studies with pathogenic microorganisms, are very rare. here, we investigated the influence of oral treatment of pigs with the probiotic bacterium enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 on salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 infections in weaning piglets. clinical symptoms, fecal excretion, the organ distribution of salmonella, and the humoral immune response (immunoglobulin g [igg], igm, and iga levels) in serum were examined. a pool of 89 piglets was randomly divided into probiotic and control groups. the probiotic group received a feed supplement containing e. faecium starting on day 14 postpartum prior to challenge with salmonella serovar  typhimurium dt104 at 28 days postpartum. after challenge with salmonella serovar  typhimurium dt104, piglets in both groups showed no severe clinical signs of salmonellosis. however, fecal excretion and colonization of salmonella in organs  were significantly greater in piglets fed e. faecium. likewise, the humoral immune response against salmonella (serum igm and iga levels) was significantly greater in the probiotic group animals than in control animals. the results of this study suggest that e. faecium ncimb 10415 treatment enhanced the course of infection in weaning piglets challenged with salmonella serovar typhimurium dt104. however, the probiotic treatment also appeared to result in greater production of specific antibodies against salmonella serovar typhimurium dt104.

AB  == in this study 635 lactic acid bacteria of food origin were evaluated for their potential application as protective cultures in foods. a stepwise selection method was used to obtain the most appropriate strains for application as protective cultures in chicken meat. specifically, all strains were examined for  antimicrobial activity against various gram positive and gram negative pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. strains exhibiting anti-bacterial activity were subsequently examined for survival in simulated food processing and gastrointestinal tract conditions, such as high temperatures, low ph, starvation  and the presence of nacl and bile salts. selected strains where then examined for basic safety properties such as antibiotic resistance and haemolytic potential, while their antimicrobial activity was further investigated by pcr screening for  possession of known bacteriocin genes. two chosen strains were then applied on raw chicken meat to evaluate their protective ability against two common food pathogens, listeria monocytogenes and salmonella enteritidis, but also to identify potential spoilage effects by the application of the protective cultures on the food matrix. antimicrobial activity in vitro was evident against gram positive indicators, mainly listeria and brochothrix spp., while no antibacterial activity was obtained against any of the gram negative bacteria tested. the antimicrobial activity was of a proteinaceous nature while strains with anti-listerial activity were found to possess one or more bacteriocin genes, mainly enterocins. strains generally exhibited sensitivity to ph 2.0, but good survival at 45 degrees c, in the presence of bile salts and nacl as well as during starvation, while variable survival rates were obtained at 55 degrees c. none of the strains was found to be haemolytic while variable antibiotic resistance profiles were obtained. finally, when the selected strains enterococcus faecium pcd71 and lactobacillus fermentum aca-dc179 were applied as  protective cultures in chicken meat against l. monocytogenes and s. enteritidis respectively, a significantly reduced growth of these pathogenic bacteria was observed. in addition, these two strains did not appear to have any detrimental effect on biochemical parameters related to spoilage of the chicken meat.

TI  == probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria isolated from fermented dairy milks on antiproliferation of colon cancer cells.
AB  == fifty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria obtained from fermented dairy milks were investigated for possible use as probiotics and for colon cancer biological  products. five of these strains inhibited growth of eight food-borne pathogens including helicobacter pylori, escherichia coli, and salmonella typhimurium. three of these strains survived at ph 2.5 and in 0.3% bile salts. additionally they produced no haemolysis, were resistant to kanamycin and adhered to caco-2 cells. 16s rrna gene sequences of probiotic strains indicated that rm11 and rm28  were enterococcus faecium and lactobacillus fermentum, respectively. both the cultured medium and live whole cells from probiotic strains were tested for antiproliferation of colon cancer cells through mtt and trypan blue exclusion assays. the probiotic strains of e. faecium rm11 and l. fermentum rm28 also triggered antiproliferation of colon cancer cells at the rates of 21-29%, and 22-29%, respectively. this suggested that both strains could be used as potential probiotics in functional food or for colon cancer biological products.

TI  == modeling the combined effects of enterocins a and b, lactate, and edta on the growth of salmonella at different temperatures.
AB  == the effects of enterocins a and b (produced by enterococcus faecium ctc492), lactate, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) on the growth of salmonella were modeled together with temperature using the response surface methodology. six serovars of salmonella enterica were inoculated (ca. 10(3) cells/ml) in brain-heart infusion broth with different levels of the studied factors and then  incubated at different temperatures. the results showed that while salmonella growth was affected by all the factors, temperature was the most important factor influencing the time to detection of the pathogen. all factors, including temperature, showed significant two-way interactions. the presence of enterocins  a and b, lactate, and edta had an inhibitory effect that was enhanced at suboptimal temperatures for growth, thus delaying the time to detection. moderate-low concentrations of lactate and edta increased the inhibitory effect of enterocins a and b. the effectiveness of these bacteriocins was not further enhanced by high concentrations of lactate (>3.6%) or edta (>200 mg/l). the mathematical model obtained from these analyses provides a useful tool to assess  the effects of natural antimicrobials and their interactions with other growth-related factors on the growth response of salmonella. the results can be applied to determine the most effective combination of hurdles to be used in the  preservation of food products.

TI  == kinetic and structural analysis of bisubstrate inhibition of the salmonella enterica aminoglycoside 6'-n-acetyltransferase.
AB  == aminoglycosides are antibacterial compounds that act by binding to the a site of  the small 30s bacterial ribosomal subunit and inhibiting protein translation. clinical resistance to aminoglycosides is generally the result of the expression  of enzymes that covalently modify the antibiotic, including phosphorylation, adenylylation, and acetylation. bisubstrate analogs for the aminoglycoside n-acetyltransferases are nanomolar inhibitors of enterococcus faecium aac(6')-ii. however, in the case of the salmonella enterica aac(6')-iy-encoded aminoglycoside n-acetyltransferase, we demonstrate that a series of bisubstrate analogs are only micromolar inhibitors. in contrast to studies with aac(6')-ii, the inhibition constants toward aac(6')-iy are essentially independent of both the identity of the aminoglycoside component of the bisubstrate and the number of carbon atoms that are used to link the coa and aminoglycoside components. the patterns of inhibition suggest that the coa portion of the bisubstrate analog can bind to the enzyme-aminoglycoside substrate complex and that the aminoglycoside portion can bind to the enzyme-coa product complex. however, at the high concentrations of bisubstrate analog used in crystallization experiments, we could crystallize and  solve the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme-bisubstrate complex. the structure reveals that both the coa and aminoglycoside portions bind in essentially the same positions as those previously observed for the enzyme-coa-ribostamycin complex, with only a modest adjustment to accommodate the "linker". these results are compared to previous studies of the interaction of similar bisubstrate analogs with other aminoglycoside n-acetyltransferases.

TI  == isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as  antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis,  s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20  other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment  with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability  by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized  with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.

TI  == predicting microbial heat inactivation under nonisothermal treatments.
AB  == the aim of this study was to develop an equation that accurately predicts microbial heat inactivation under nonisothermal treatments at constantly rising heating rates (from 0.5 to 5 degrees c/min) in media with different ph values (4.0 or 7.4). the survival curves of all bacteria (enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella senftenberg 775w, salmonella typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus) tested under isothermal treatments were nearly linear. for the most heat-resistant microorganism (e. faecium), the estimated dt-values at ph 7.4 were at least 100 times those of the second most thermotolerant microorganism (salmonella senftenberg 775w). the heat resistance of e. faecium was up to 30 times lower at ph 4.0 than at ph 7.4. however, e. faecium was still the most heat-resistant microorganism under nonisothermal treatments at both ph values. inactivation under nonisothermal conditions was not accurately estimated from heat resistance parameters of isothermal treatments when microbial adaptation or sensibilization occurred during the heating up lag phases. the under-prediction of the number of survivors might be greater than 15  log cfu within the nonisothermal treatment conditions investigated. therefore, the nonisothermal survival curves of the most heat-resistant microorganisms were  fitted with the following equation: log s(t) = -(t/delta)p. this equation accurately described the survival curves of all the bacteria tested. we observed  a linear relationship between the log of the scale parameter (delta) and the log  of the heating rate. a p value characteristic of each microorganism and ph tested was calculated. two equations capable of predicting the inactivation rate of all  bacteria tested under nonisothermal treatments at ph 7.4, 5.5, or 4.0 were developed. the model was evaluated in skim milk and apple juice. the results of this study could be used to help minimize public health risks and to extend the shelf life of those foods requiring long heating up lag phases during processing.

TI  == inhibitory effects of enterococcus strains obtained from a probiotic product on in vitro growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis strain ifo3313.
AB  == enterococcus faecium and enterococcus gallinarum strains were isolated from a commercial probiotic product and the effects of these strains on the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis strain ifo3313 were investigated. viable  cell counts of salmonella enteritidis in mixed cultures with the probiotic product isolate of e. faecium were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than those in pure cultures after 6, 8, and 24 h when the cultures were incubated in heart infusion broth at 37 and 41 degrees c. significant differences in viable cell counts of salmonella enteritidis in mixed cultures with the probiotic product isolate of e. gallinarum and those in pure cultures were also observed after 8 and 24 h at 37 and 41degrees c. similar observations were shown in mixed cultures of salmonella enteritidis with the reference strains of e. faecium gifu8355 and e. gallinarum atcc 49573. significant differences in viable cell counts of these  enterococcal strains were not shown among pure and mixed cultures with salmonella enteritidis. the ph values in pure and mixed cultures were 7.0 or 7.5 throughout  the experiments. e. faecium strains were found to harbor the genes encoding enterocins a and b and showed inhibitory zones with a diameter of 4 to 6 mm against growth of salmonella enteritidis in the enterocin production assays. however, the e. gallinarum strains possessed neither of the enterocin genes tested and exhibited no inhibition zone in the enterocin production assays. these results indicated that enterococcal strains exhibit inhibitory effects on the growth of salmonella enteritidis and these effects were due to both enterocin and nonenterocin factors.

TI  == morphine withdrawal lowers host defense to enteric bacteria: spontaneous sepsis and increased sensitivity to oral salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium infection.
AB  == understanding the consequences of drug withdrawal on immune function and host defense to infection is important. we, and others, previously demonstrated that morphine withdrawal results in immunosuppression and sensitizes to lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock. in the present study, the effect of morphine withdrawal on spontaneous sepsis and on oral infection with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium was examined. mice were chronically exposed to morphine for 96 h by implantation of a slow-release morphine pellet. abrupt withdrawal was induced by removal of the pellet. in the sepsis model, bacterial colonization was examined and bacterial species were identified by necropsy of various tissues. it was found that at 48 h postwithdrawal, morphine-treated mice  had enteric bacteria that were detected in the peyer's patches (4/5), mesenteric  lymph nodes (4/5), spleens (4/10), livers (6/10), and peritoneal cavities (8/10). in placebo pellet-withdrawn mice, only 2/40 cultures were positive. the most frequently detected organisms in tissues of morphine-withdrawn mice were enterococcus faecium followed by klebsiella pneumoniae. both organisms are part of the normal gastrointestinal flora. in the infection model, mice were orally inoculated with s. enterica 24 h post-initiation of abrupt withdrawal from morphine. withdrawal significantly decreased the mean survival time and significantly increased the salmonella burden in various tissues of infected mice compared to placebo-withdrawn animals. elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokines were observed in spleens of morphine-withdrawn mice, compared to placebo-withdrawn mice. these findings demonstrate that morphine withdrawal sensitizes to oral infection with a bacterial pathogen and predisposes mice to bacterial sepsis.

TI  == predicting the thermal inactivation of bacteria in a solid matrix: simulation studies on the relative effects of microbial thermal resistance parameters and process conditions.
AB  == a combined mathematical model for predicting heat penetration and microbial inactivation in a solid body heated by conduction was tested experimentally by inoculating agar cylinders with salmonella typhimurium or enterococcus faecium and heating in a water bath. regions of growth where bacteria had survived after  heating were measured by image analysis and compared with model predictions. visualisation of the regions of growth was improved by incorporating chromogenic  metabolic indicators into the agar. preliminary tests established that the model  performed satisfactorily with both test organisms and with cylinders of different diameter. the model was then used in simulation studies in which the parameters d, z, inoculum size, cylinder diameter and heating temperature were systematically varied. these simulations showed that the biological variables d,  z and inoculum size had a relatively small effect on the time needed to eliminate bacteria at the cylinder axis in comparison with the physical variables heating temperature and cylinder diameter, which had a much greater relative effect.

TI  == eliminating the carriage of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis in domestic fowls by feeding activated charcoal from bark containing wood vinegar liquid (nekka-rich).
AB  == the protective efficacy of activated charcoal containing wood vinegar liquid (nekka-rich) against intestinal infection with salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis was sought. in the present study, the adsorption effects of activated charcoal of nekka-rich on s. enteritidis and normal bacterial flora in the intestine, enterococcus faecium, were examined. s. enteritidis was effectively adsorbed by activated charcoal of nekka-rich. on the other hand, activated charcoal of nekka-rich showed lower binding capacity to e.faecium. the effects of wood vinegar liquid included in nekka-rich on the growth of s. enteritidis and normal bacterial flora in the intestine, e. faecium and bifidobacterium thermophilum, were also assessed. wood vinegar liquid had an inhibitory effect on the s. enteritidis growth, whereas growth of e. faecium and b. thermophilum was enhanced by wood vinegar liquid. furthermore, the protective effects of nekka-rich were evaluated in a challenge chicken model with s. enteritidis. chickens were fed a basal diet containing nekka-rich or immunized with commercially obtained s. enteritidis vaccine and challenged with s. enteritidis.  significantly less fecal excretion of s. enteritidis was observed in chickens fed nekka-rich for 10 d after challenge. on d 15 after challenge, s. enteritidis was  not isolated from fecal samples. on the other hand, immunization of chickens with s. enteritidis vaccine did not fully inhibit bacterial growth. fecal excretion of s. enteritidis was consistently observed in the vaccinated chickens after challenge. these results suggest that nekka-rich would be a good product for eliminating the carriage of s. enteritidis in domestic fowl.

TI  == overexpression and characterization of an aminoglycoside 6'-n-acetyltransferase with broad specificity from an epsilon-poly-l-lysine producer, streptomyces albulus ifo14147.
AB  == streptomyces albulus ifo14147 produces epsilon-poly-l-lysine, which exhibits antimicrobial activity. in the mic studies with antibiotics, s. albulus ifo14147  was shown to be resistant to kanamycin and amikacin, which are aminoglycoside (ag) antibiotics. we report here the isolation of the ag-resistance gene from s.  albulus ifo14147 and the substrate specificity of the gene product, aac(6')-isa,  which catalyzes n-acetylation at the 6' position of ags, thereby inactivating them. kinetic studies revealed that this enzyme has remarkably wide substrate specificity. the v(max)/k(m) values determined for ags vary by a factor of up to  6,300, a much wider range than those observed for the aac(6')s from enterococcus  faecium [aac(6')-ii] and salmonella enteritidis [aac(6')-iy]. in addition, aac(6')-isa was able to acetylate lividomycin a, which has a hydroxy group at the 6' position. enzymatically acetylated lividomycin a was found to be highly susceptible to mild base hydrolysis, suggesting that the enzyme also catalyzes o-acetyltransfer.

TI  == international dissemination of antibiotic resistant strains of bacterial pathogens.
AB  == the increasing incidence of methicillin and multiple resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) in nosocomial infections is mainly associated with a wide, international dissemination of well defined clonal lineages (epidemic mrsa) which are clearly different from community acquired mrsa by molecular typing patterns and structure of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome containing the meca gene. although belonging to a definite subpopulation within the species enterococcus faecium, hospital associated vancomycin resistant isolates also containing the esp gene have very likely evolved by acquisition of glycopeptide resistance gene  clusters at different occasions and at different times by a susceptible already disseminated clonal lineage. there is obviously a continuous selection of new types of extended spectrum beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae and also horizontal spread of bla-genes. intrahospital dissemination of particular strains has often been observed, however, an international dissemination until now has been described only for salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium producing the ctx-m-3 enzyme. multiresistant isolates of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium phage type dt104 harbour a multiresistant gene cluster with resistance genes from taxonomically more unrelated species (tetg, flor, bla(pse1)). although in vitro transduction has been demonstrated, this gene cluster has only rarely been reported from isolates exhibiting other phage patterns of the same serovar or from other serovars of s. enterica.

TI  == interaction between probiotic lactic acid bacteria and canine enteric pathogens:  a risk factor for intestinal enterococcus faecium colonization?
AB  == selected probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab) have been shown to elicit positive  health effects particularly in humans. competitive exclusion of pathogens is one  of the most important beneficial health claims of probiotic bacteria. the effect  of probiotic lab on competitive exclusion of pathogens has been demonstrated in humans, chicken and pigs. in this study we evaluated the ability of certain lab strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium lactis bb12, lactobacillus pentosus uk1a, l. pentosus sk2a, enterococcus faecium m74 and e. faecium sf273) to inhibit the adhesion of selected canine and zoonotic pathogens (staphylococcus intermedius, salmonella typhimurium atcc 14028, clostridium perfringens and campylobacter jejuni) to immobilised mucus isolated from canine jejunal chyme in  vitro. adhesion of c. perfringens was reduced significantly by all tested lab strains, between 53.7 and 79.1% of the control without lab, the lab of canine origin yielding the best reduction. the adhesion of s. typhimurium and s. intermedius were not significantly altered by any of the lab included in the study. both enterococci tested significantly enhanced the adhesion of c. jejuni,  to 134.6 and 205.5% of the control without lab. e. faecium may thus favor the adhesion and colonization of c. jejuni in the dog's intestine, making it a potential carrier and possibly a source for human infection. enhanced c. jejuni adhesion is a new potential risk factor of enterococci. our results further emphasize the importance of safety guidelines to be established for the probiotics intended for animal use.

AB  == this study describes the establishment and first results of a continuous surveillance system of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria isolated from pigs, cattle and broilers in denmark. the three categories of bacteria tested were: 1) indicator bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium), 2) zoonotic bacteria (campylobacter coli/jejuni, salmonella enterica, yersinia enterocolitica), and 3) animal pathogens (e. coli,  staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus hyicus, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae). a total of 3304 bacterial isolates collected from october 1995 through december 1996 were tested for susceptibility  to all major classes of antimicrobial agents used for therapy in denmark. bacterial species intrinsically resistant to an antimicrobial were not tested towards that antimicrobial. acquired resistance to all antimicrobials was found.  the occurrence of resistance varied by animal origin and bacterial species. in general, resistance was observed more frequently among isolates from pigs than from cattle and broilers. the association between the occurrence of resistance and the consumption of the antimicrobial is discussed, as is the occurrence of resistance in other countries. the results of this study show the present level of resistance to antimicrobial agents among a number of bacterial species isolated from food animals in denmark. thus, the baseline for comparison with future prospective studies has been established, enabling the determination of trends over time.

AB  == necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) is a serious gastrointestinal disorder of preterm infants. other than an association with prematurity and gastrointestinal feeding, no single factor or mechanism has been consistently linked to this disease. we have previously demonstrated that escherichia coli isolates obtained from the stool of infants with nec caused nec-like injury in a weanling rabbit ileal loop  model; this injury, in turn, could be blocked by coinfection with selected gram(+) bacteria (enterococcus faecium) isolated from asymptomatic controls. using caco-2 cells in a trans-well system, we now demonstrate that the same e. coli isolates can cross epithelial cell monolayers in the absence of ultrastructural change or damage. these results with e. coli contrast with those  seen with salmonella typhimurium, which passed through the monolayer at a higher  rate and were associated with striking ultrastructural damage. transcytosis of e. coli was reduced 3-5-fold in the presence of e. faecium previously shown to block nec-like injury in the loop model. there was a mild increase in the rate of e. coli transcytosis when studies were conducted with younger, undifferentiated cells; these immature cells had no brush border, had decreased production of brush border-specific enzymes, but retained well defined tight junctions, as demonstrated by transepithelial electrical resistance and electron microscopy. a  further reduction/ complete blockage of e. coli transcytosis was observed when e. faecium was used as the coinfectant in studies with these undifferentiated cells. we hypothesize that the ability of e. coli to cross epithelial cell layer is a critical initial step in the cascade of events which lead ultimately to nec; blockage or reduction in e. coli transcytosis in the presence of certain gram(+)  organisms may play a significant role in prevention of nec.

TI  == application of direct-fed microbial bacteria and fructooligosaccharides for salmonella control in broilers during feed withdrawal.
AB  == providing direct-fed-microbial (dfm) bacteria and fructooligosaccharides (fos) for the control of potential escalation of salmonella colonization during simulated feed withdrawal and confinement was assessed. eight hundred and eighty  broilers (16 pens; 55 chicks per pen) were reared to 6 wk of age. chicks were sprayed with a solution containing 10(6) nalidixic-acid resistant salmonella typhimuriumnr cells per milliliter on the 2nd d after hatching. because this first challenge did not yield a high infection rate, chickens were rechallenged per os at day 18 by providing water containing 10(7) cells of s. typhimuriumnr per milliliter. at 3 and 5 wk of age, 10 birds per pen were euthanatized and cecal salmonella were quantified (log colony-forming units per gram). feed was removed from all pens at 6 wk, and pens were randomly assigned to be either the treatment group or the control group. the treatment groups were provided a dfm (mixture of nine bacteria) and fos 50 (r) (10%) in the drinking water. the control groups received drinking water only. after 6 h of feed withdrawal, chickens were cooped (eight per coop) and held 10 h. immediately after confinement, 10 chickens were used for cecal enumeration of s. typhimuriumnr. salmonella colonization declined from 99% at 3 wk to 44% at 5 wk. after feed withdrawal, application of the treatment, and confinement, 11 and 14% of the treated and control groups, respectively, yielded s. typhimuriumnr by direct plating from ceca (3.87 and 3.75 log 10 cfu/g, respectively). no difference (p >  0.05) in salmonella colonization occurred between the treated and the control groups; however, enrichment of ceca (incubation in nutrient broth at 37 c for 24  h) yielded a higher incidence of s. typhimuriumnr in the control groups (32% in the treated vs 51% in the control). ceca weights were greater in the treated group (p < 0.05). simulated feed withdrawal and confinement did not escalate salmonella colonization in the chicken ceca.
