TI  == probiotic assessment of enterococcus faecalis cp58 isolated from human gut.
AB  == a total of seventy lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from the faeces of healthy humans and their identities were confirmed by sequencing of their 16s rdna genes. of these only 5 isolates were found to resist bile salts and indicated survival in the simulated in vitro digestion assay which reproduces the stomach and intestinal digestion indicating their tolerance to gastric enzymes and the low ph conditions. species that showed the best resistance to these conditions were: lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus sp., uncultured bifidobacteria, enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus anginosus. these strains  were investigated further to study their capacity to adhere to human intestinal caco-2 cells. e. faecalis was the most adherent strain. examination of the virulence determinants for this strain indicated that it was positive for efaafs, gele, agg, cpd, cob, ccf and cad, a profile that is similar to that of many e. faecalis isolates from food sources. the cytolysin biosynthetic genes cyla, cylb  and cylm that are more associated with the clinical isolates of e. faecium were not detected in this strain. the antibiotic susceptibility tests indicated that the strain was sensitive to vancomycin, tetracycline, rifampicin and erythromycin but resistant only to kanamycin and chloramphenicol. these data suggest that the  strain e. faecalis cp58 may be tested further for beneficial properties and developed as a new probiotic.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.
