TI  == effect of lactobacillus salivarius ls-33 on fecal microbiota in obese adolescents.
AB  == background & aims: this study is a part of the clinical trials with probiotic bacterium lactobacillus salivarius ls-33 conducted in obese adolescents. previously reported clinical studies showed no effect of ls-33 consumption on the metabolic syndrome in the subject group. the aim of the study was to investigate  the impact of l. salivarius ls-33 on fecal microbiota in obese adolescents. methods: the study was a double-blinded intervention with 50 subjects randomized  to intake of l. salivarius ls-33 or placebo for 12 weeks. the fecal microbiota was assessed by real-time quantitative pcr before and after intervention. concentrations of fecal short chain fatty acids were determined using gas chromatography. results: ratios of bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group to  firmicutes belonging bacteria, including clostridium cluster xiv, blautia coccoides_eubacteria rectale group and roseburia intestinalis, were significantly increased (p </= 0.05) after administration of ls-33. the cell numbers of fecal bacteria, including the groups above as well as clostridium cluster i, clostridium cluster iv, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, enterobacteriaceae, enterococcus, the lactobacillus group and bifidobacterium were not significantly  altered by intervention. similarly, short chain fatty acids remained unaffected.  conclusion: l. salivarius ls-33 might modify the fecal microbiota in obese adolescents in a way not related to metabolic syndrome. clinical trial number: nct 01020617.
