TI  == involvement of coenzyme a esters and two new enzymes, an enoyl-coa hydratase and  a coa-transferase, in the hydration of crotonobetaine to l-carnitine by escherichia coli.
AB  == two proteins (caib and caid) were found to catalyze the reversible biotransformation of crotonobetaine to l-carnitine in escherichia coli in the presence of a cosubstrate (e.g., gamma-butyrobetainyl-coa or crotonobetainyl-coa). caib (45 kda) and caid (27 kda) were purified in two steps  to electrophoretic homogeneity from overexpression strains. caib was identified as crotonobetainyl-coa:carnitine coa-transferase by maldi-tof mass spectrometry and enzymatic assays. the enzyme exhibits high cosubstrate specificity to coa derivatives of trimethylammonium compounds. in particular, the n-terminus of caib shows significant identity with other coa-transferases (e.g., flda from clostridium sporogenes, frc from oxalobacter formigenes, and bbse from thauera aromatica) and coa-hydrolases (e.g., baif from eubacterium sp.). caid was shown to be a crotonobetainyl-coa hydratase using maldi-tof mass spectrometry and enzymatic assays. besides crotonobetainyl-coa caid is also able to hydrate crotonyl-coa with a significantly lower vmax (factor of 10(3)) but not crotonobetaine. the substrate specificity of caid and its homology to the crotonase confirm this enzyme as a new member of the crotonase superfamily. concluding these results, it was verified that hydration of crotonobetaine to l-carnitine proceeds at the coa level in two steps: the caid catalyzed hydration  of crotonobetainyl-coa to l-carnitinyl-coa, followed by a coa transfer from l-carnitinyl-coa to crotonobetaine, catalyzed by caib. when gamma-butyrobetainyl-coa was used as a cosubstrate (coa donor), the first reaction is the coa transfer. the optimal ratios of caib and caid during this hydration reaction, determined to be 4:1 when crotonobetainyl-coa was used as cosubstrate and 5:1 when gamma-butyrobetainyl-coa was used as cosubstrate, are different from that found for in vivo conditions (1:3).
