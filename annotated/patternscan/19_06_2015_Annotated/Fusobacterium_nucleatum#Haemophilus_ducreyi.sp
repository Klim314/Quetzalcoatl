TI  == characterization of the tet m determinants in urogenital and respiratory bacteria.
AB  == tetracycline-resistant fusobacterium nucleatum, haemophilus ducreyi, mycoplasma hominis, peptostreptococcus spp., ureaplasma urealyticum, and veillonella parvula had dna sequences which showed homology throughout the length of the tet m transposon, tn916. in contrast, gardnerella vaginalis, commensal neisseria spp.,  and the 25.2-megadalton plasmid family lacked the complete transposon.
