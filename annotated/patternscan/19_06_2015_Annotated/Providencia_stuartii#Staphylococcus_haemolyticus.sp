TI  == emergence of bacterial resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin in a university hospital.
AB  == we have continuously monitored the in-vitro activities of imipenem and ciprofloxacin against large numbers of non-fastidious clinical isolates. after eight years of use, 97-100% of enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter baumannii remained susceptible to imipenem, but susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa declined from 100% to 91%. after six years of use, 94%-100% of enterobacteriaceae (except providencia stuartii) remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin but susceptibility of p. stuartii, a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa declined from 100%  to 46%, 66% and 84%, respectively. oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were considered to be resistant to imipenem and all beta-lactams. there were no quinolone-resistant staphylococci observed in 1986, but susceptibilities of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus to ciprofloxacin decreased to 85-93% for oxacillin-susceptible strains and to 7-39% for oxacillin-resistant strains. enterococcus faecalis has remained susceptible to imipenem and the modal mic of ciprofloxacin has remained 1 mg/l; however, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin 2 mg/l decreased from 94% to 64%. imipenem-quinolone cross-resistance was observed for staphylococci but not for p. aeruginosa.
