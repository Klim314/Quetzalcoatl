TI  == oxalobacter formigenes colonization and oxalate dynamics in a mouse model.
AB  == animal and human studies have provided compelling evidence that colonization of the intestine with oxalobacter formigenes reduces urinary oxalate excretion and lowers the risk of forming calcium oxalate kidney stones. the mechanism providing protection appears to be related to the unique ability of o.formigenes to rely on oxalate as a major source of carbon and energy for growth. however, much is not known about the factors that influence colonization and host bacterial interactions. we have colonized mice with o.formigenes oxcc13 and systematically  investigated the impact of diets varying in calcium and oxalate on o.formigenes intestinal densities and urinary and intestinal oxalate levels. measurement of intestinal oxalate levels in mice colonized and not colonized with o. formigenes  demonstrated the highly efficient degradation of soluble oxalate by o.formigenes  relative to other microbiota. the ratio of calcium to oxalate in diets was important in determining colonization densities and conditions where urinary oxalate and fecal oxalate excretion were modified, and were consistent with studies we have performed with colonized and non-colonized humans. the use of low oxalate purified diets showed that 80% of animals retained o.formigenes colonization after one week dietary oxalate deprivation. animals not colonized with o.formigenes excreted two times more oxalate in feces than that ingested. this non-dietary source of oxalate may play an important role in the survival of  o.formigenes during periods of dietary oxalate deprivation. these studies suggest that the mouse will be a useful model to further characterize interactions between o.formigenes and the host and factors that impact colonization.

TI  == [oxalate: a poorly soluble organic waste with consequences].
AB  == oxalate is a highly insoluble metabolic waste excreted by the kidneys. disturbances of oxalate metabolism are encountered in enteric hyperoxaluria (secondary to malabsorption, gastric bypass or in case of insufficient oxalobacter colonization), in hereditary hyperoxaluria and in intoxication (ethylene glycol, vitamin c). hyperoxaluria causes a large spectrum of diseases,  from isolated hyperoxaluria to kidney stones and nephrocalcinosis formation, eventually leading to kidney failure and systemic oxalosis with life-threatening  deposits in vital organs. new causes of hyperoxaluria are arising recently, in particular after gastric bypass surgery, which requires regular and preemptive monitoring. the treatment of hyperoxaluria involves reduction in oxalate intake and increase in calcium intake. optimal urine dilution and supplementation with inhibitors of kidney stone formation (citrate) are required. some conditions may  need vitamin b6 supplementation, and the addition of probiotics might be useful in the future. primary care physicians should identify cases of recurrent calcium oxalate stones and severe hyperoxaluria. further management of hyperoxaluria requires specialized care.

TI  == analysis of commercial kidney stone probiotic supplements.
AB  == objective: to examine the levels of oxalobacter formigenes in probiotic supplements marketed by pro-lab, ltd, toronto, canada, and capsules of oxalo purchased from sanzyme ltd, hyderabad, india, and to measure the ability of these preparations to degrade oxalate in vitro. methods: probiotic supplements and pure cultures of o. formigenes were cultured in a number of media containing oxalate.  optical density at 595 nm (od595) was used to measure bacterial growth, and ion chromatography was used to measure loss of oxalate in culture media. o. formigenes-specific and degenerate lactobacillus primers to the oxalate decarboxylase gene (oxc) were used in polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: incubating probiotic supplements in different media did not result in the growth  of oxalate-degrading organisms. pcr indicated the absence of organisms harboring  the oxc gene. culture and 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene sequencing indicated the pro-lab supplement contained viable lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (genbank accession no. kj095656.1), whereas oxalo contained several bacillus species and lactobacillus plantarum. conclusion: the probiotic supplement sold over the internet by pro-lab ltd and sanzyme ltd did not contain  identifiable o. formigenes or viable oxalate-degrading organisms, and they are unlikely to be of benefit to calcium oxalate kidney stone patients.

TI  == oxalobacter formigenes: opening the door to probiotic therapy for the treatment of hyperoxaluria.
AB  == abstract objective. the aim of this study was to determine the early effect of the administration of oxalobacter formigenes on the metabolic pattern of patients with calcium oxalate stones, comparing it with potassium magnesium citrate (kmgcit). materials and methods. eighty patients were randomized to receive either 30 meq of kmgcit or 700 million o. formigenes, both twice a day. serum creatinine, serum urate, serum calcium and phosphorus, serum intact parathyroid hormone (if serum calcium >10.5 mg/dl) and 24 h urine metabolic evaluation for various metabolites (e.g. oxalate, calcium, phosphorus, citrate, magnesium, urate and creatinine) were evaluated at baseline and 1 month after starting the treatment. results. in both groups hyperoxaluria was the most common abnormality, followed by hypercalciuria. the incidence of hyperoxaluria decreased at 1 month compared to baseline in both kmgcit (77.5% vs 37.5%, p = 0.0006) and o. formigenes preparation (82.5% vs 15%, p < 0.0001) groups, while other urinary metabolic abnormalities were similar at baseline and 1 month in both groups. three patients in the kmgcit had mild self-limiting secondary symptoms. conclusion. compared with kmgcit, o. formigenes preparation is more effective in  decreasing the incidence of hyperoxaluria, opening the door to probiotic therapy  as a potential new weapon against hyperoxaluria.

TI  == the relationship between colonization of oxalobacter formigenes serum oxalic acid and endothelial dysfunction in hemodialysis patients: from impaired colon to impaired endothelium.
AB  == cardiovascular disease (cvd) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in chronic kidney disease (ckd) patients receiving hemodialysis (hd). oxalic acid is a uremic retention molecule that has been extensively studied in the pathogenesis of calcium-oxalate stones. oxalobacter formigenes (o. formigenes), a component of the colonic microbiota, plays an important role in oxalate homeostasis. little is known regarding the colonization of hd patients by o. formigenes and the exact role of this bacterial species in oxalic acid metabolism in these patients. we hypothesized that oxalic acid may be insufficiently degraded in hd patients due to under colonization of the colon by o. formigenes in these patients. to test this hypothesis, we sought to quantitatively measure fecal o. formigenes levels and serum oxalic acid levels in hd patients. we also suggest that increased oxalic acid levels may be associated with endothelial dysfunction and aortic stiffness, both of which are commonly observed in hd patients. increased colonization with o. formigenes via the ingestion of prebiotics and probiotics could potentially decrease serum oxalic acid levels and improve cardiovascular outcomes in hd patients.

TI  == helicobacter pylori and urinary system stones: endoluminal damage as sub-hypothesis to support the current stone theory.
AB  == helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) is a atypical gram-negative bacteria preferring gastric mucosa which also have bizarre multisystem effects extended to some malignancies, hematologic and vascular disorders through some not well defined pathophysiologic pathways. our pioneer data was pointing that the urinary system  stone existence was seemed to be high in the group of h. pylori+cases. while the  explanation of the reason of the coincidence of renal-gall bladder stones, it was previously suggested that there may be a shift mechanism of intestinal microbial  flora, from oxalobacter formigenes that may reduce the risk of renal stone by consuming intestinal oxalate, to h. pylori which is known to induce gallstone by  unknown mechanism. this hypothesis is an indirect one and highly controversial for the effect of h. pylori in the renal stone formation because intestinal absorption of oxalate is not significant when it is compared with the endogen oxalate. the present preliminary unique data in connection with our hypothesis claimed that a possible relation between h. pylori and renal stones. we think that this detrimental effect is due to the possible systemic influence such as vascular and/or endoluminal sickness due to the h. pylori other than directs bacteriologic colonization. there is strong evidence that h. pylori have some role in the atherosclerotic procedure. the vascular theory of randall plaque formation at renal papilla and subsequent calcium oxalate stone development that  suggests microvascular injury of renal papilla in an atherosclerotic-like fashion results in calcification near vessel walls that eventually erodes as a calculus format into the urinary system. briefly, theories of stone and atherosclerosis seemed to be overlap and h. pylori is one of the factor of both processes. in addition to our hypothesis, we claimed that h. pylori might have same detrimental effect on endoluminal surfaces of urinary and genital systems and resulting in some special pathologies as hunner's ulcers in interstitial cystitis and even posttesticular infertility. the accumulating knowledge about extragastric sequelae of h. pylori may open new aspects on therapeutic and the prevention strategies of urolithiasis and even this progress may reach to chronic pelvic pain syndromes and idiopathic infertility.

TI  == closure of the cytoplasmic gate formed by tm5 and tm11 during transport in the oxalate/formate exchanger from oxalobacter formigenes.
AB  == oxlt, the oxalate/formate exchanger of oxalobacter formigenes, is a member of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters. in the present work, substrate (oxalate) was found to enhance the reactivity of the cysteine mutant s336c on the cytoplasmic end of helix 11 to methanethiosulfonate ethyl carboxylate. in addition, s336c is found to spontaneously cross-link to s143c in tm5 in either native or reconstituted membranes under conditions that support transport. continuous wave epr measurements are consistent with this result and indicate that positions 143 and 336 are in close proximity in the presence of substrate. these two residues are localized within helix interacting gxxxg-like motifs (g(1)(4)(0)lasg(1)(4)(4) and s(3)(3)(6)difg(3)(4)(0)) at the cytoplasmic poles of tm5 and tm11. pulse epr measurements were used to determine distances and distance distributions across the cytoplasmic or periplasmic ends of oxlt and were compared with the predictions of an inside-open homology model. the data indicate that a significant population of transporter is in an outside-open configuration in the presence of substrate; however, each end of the transporter  exhibits significant conformational heterogeneity, where both inside-open and outside-open configurations are present. these data indicate that tm5 and tm11, which form part of the transport pathway, transiently close during transport and  that there is a conformational equilibrium between inside-open and outside-open states of oxlt in the presence of substrate.

TI  == screening of different probiotic strains for their in vitro ability to metabolise oxalates: any prospective use in humans?
AB  == background: oxalate is the salt-forming ion of oxalic acid and can generate oxalate salts combining with various cations, such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. approximately 75% of all kidney stones are composed primarily of calcium oxalate (caox) and hyperoxaluria, a condition involving high urinary oxalate concentration, is considered a primary risk factor for kidney stone formation, known as nephrolithiasis. current therapeutic strategies often fail in their compliance or effectiveness, and caox stone recurrence is still common. after an initial stone, there is a 50% chance of forming a second stone within 7 years if the condition is left untreated. the potential therapeutic application of some probiotics, mainly lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, in reducing hyperoxaluria in vivo through intestinal oxalate degrading activity is compelling and initial reports are promising. this study was undertaken to screen different lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains for their capacity to degrade oxalate in vitro using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). methods: the oxalate-degrading activity of 13 lactobacilli and 5 bifidobacteria was tested using a novel hplc method after growth in a broth culture added with 10 mm ammonium oxalate. experiments were repeated 3 times. oxalobacter formigenes (dsm 4420) was used as positive reference to validate hplc oxalate-degrading capability assays. results: lactobacillus strains were more efficient than bifidobacteria in degrading oxalates. l. paracasei lpc09 (dsm 24243) gave the best result, as 68.5% of ammonium oxalate was converted at the end of incubation, whereas the following best converters belong to the l. gasseri and l. acidophilus species. the relatively low conversion rate observed for most  bifidobacteria can probably be attributed to intrinsic oxalate toxicity toward this genus. conclusions: humans lack the enzymes needed to directly metabolise oxalate, and this potentially toxic compound is, therefore, managed using alternative pathways. as oxalate-degrading bacteria are present in the endogenous microbiota of the human intestine, although with significant individual differences, it is possible to hypothesise that the administration of selected oxalate-degrading probiotics could be an alternative and innovative approach to reducing the intestinal absorption of oxalate and the resulting urinary excretion.

TI  == bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis decreases urinary oxalate excretion in a mouse model of primary hyperoxaluria.
AB  == hyperoxaluria significantly increases the risk of calcium oxalate kidney stone formation. since several bacteria have been shown to metabolize oxalate in vitro, including probiotic bifidobacteria, we focused on the efficiency and possible mechanisms by which bifidobacteria can influence oxalate handling in vivo, especially in the intestines, and compared these results with the reported effects of oxalobacter formigenes. bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis dsm 10140 and b. adolescentis atcc 15703 were administered to wild-type (wt) mice and to mice deficient in the hepatic enzyme alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (agxt(-/-), a mouse model of primary hyperoxaluria) that were fed an oxalate-supplemented diet. the administration of b. animalis subsp. lactis led to a significant decrease in urinary oxalate excretion in wt and agxt(-/-) mice when compared to treatment with b. adolescentis. detection of b. animalis subsp. lactis in feces revealed that 3 weeks after oral gavage with the bacteria 64% of  wt mice, but only 37% of agxt(-/-) mice were colonized. examining intestinal oxalate fluxes showed there were no significant changes to net oxalate secretion  in colonized animals and were therefore not associated with the changes in urinary oxalate excretion. these results indicate that colonization with b. animalis subsp. lactis decreased urinary oxalate excretion by degrading dietary oxalate thus limiting its absorption across the intestine but it did not promote  enteric oxalate excretion as reported for o. formigenes. preventive or therapeutic administration of b. animalis subsp. lactis appears to have some potential to beneficially influence dietary hyperoxaluria in mice.

TI  == the structure and function of oxlt, the oxalate transporter of oxalobacter formigenes.
AB  == oxlt, the oxalate transporter of oxalobacter formigenes, is a member of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters (mfs), one of the largest groups of membrane proteins with substantial relevance to solute transport physiology, pharmacology, and possible drug development. mfs proteins transport a wide range  of substrates such as organic and inorganic anions, sugars, drugs, and neurotransmitters. this review succinctly summarizes experimental work on a model mfs protein, oxlt, beginning with its identification as an electrogenic oxalate/formate exchanger, its three-dimensional structure, and discussion of biochemical and biophysical data that have shed further light on its structure and function. we also discuss the structure and function of oxlt in relation to notable mfs carriers such as lacy and glpt.

TI  == [oxalobacter formigenes--characteristics and role in development of calcium oxalate urolithiasis].
AB  == microorganisms are one of the important factors for urinary calculi formation. while urease-positive bacteria and nanobacteria contribute to stone formation, oxalobacter formigenes rods play a protective role against the development of urolithiasis. proteus mirabilis alkaline environment of the urinary tract and cause crystallization mainly of struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate). however, nanobacteria, due to the possibility of apatite deposition on the surface of their cells, have long been considered as an etiological factor of urinary calculi consisting of calcium phosphates. o. formigenes is an anaerobe using oxalate as the main source of carbon and energy and occurs as natural gastrointestinal microflora of humans and animals. these bacteria control the amount of oxalate excretion degrading oxalates and regulating their transport by  intestinal epithelium. lower colonization of the human colon by o. formigenes can cause increased oxalate excretion and lead to the development of oxalate urolithiasis. due to the positive influence of o. formigenes, there is ongoing research into the use of this microorganism as a probiotic in the prophylaxis or  treatment of hyperoxaluria, both secondary and primary. the results of these studies are very promising, but they still require continuation. future studies focus on the exact characteristics of o. formigenes including their metabolism and the development of methods for applying as a therapeutic agent the bacteria or their enzymes degrading the oxalate.

TI  == a human strain of oxalobacter (hc-1) promotes enteric oxalate secretion in the small intestine of mice and reduces urinary oxalate excretion.
AB  == enteric oxalate secretion that correlated with reductions in urinary oxalate excretion was previously reported in a mouse model of primary hyperoxaluria, and  in wild type (wt) mice colonized with a wild rat strain (oxwr) of oxalobacter (am j physiol 300:g461-g469, 2010). since a human strain of the bacterium is more likely to be clinically used as a probiotic therapeutic, we tested the effects of hc-1 in wt. following artificial colonization of wt mice with hc-1, the bacteria  were confirmed to be present in the large intestine and, unexpectedly, detected in the small intestine for varying periods of time. the main objective of the present study was to determine whether the presence of hc-1 promoted intestinal secretion in the more proximal segments of the gastrointestinal tract. in addition, we determined whether hc-1 colonization led to reductions in urinary oxalate excretion in these mice. the results show that the human oxalobacter strain promotes a robust net secretion of oxalate in the distal ileum as well as  in the caecum and distal colon and these changes in transport correlate with the  beneficial effect of reducing renal excretion of oxalate. we conclude that oxwr effects on intestinal oxalate transport and oxalate homeostasis are not unique to the wild rat strain and that, mechanistically, hc-1 has significant potential for use as a probiotic treatment for hyperoxaluria especially if it is also targeted  to the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == function and x-ray crystal structure of escherichia coli yfde.
AB  == many food plants accumulate oxalate, which humans absorb but do not metabolize, leading to the formation of urinary stones. the commensal bacterium oxalobacter formigenes consumes oxalate by converting it to oxalyl-coa, which is decarboxylated by oxalyl-coa decarboxylase (oxc). oxc and the class iii coa-transferase formyl-coa:oxalate coa-transferase (fcoct) are widespread among bacteria, including many that have no apparent ability to degrade or to resist external oxalate. the evga acid response regulator activates transcription of the escherichia coli yfdxwuve operon encoding yfdw (fcoct), yfdu (oxc), and yfde, a class iii coa-transferase that is ~30% identical to yfdw. yfdw and yfdu are necessary and sufficient for oxalate-induced protection against a subsequent acid challenge; neither of the other genes has a known function. we report the purification, in vitro characterization, 2.1-a crystal structure, and functional  assignment of yfde. yfde and uctc, an orthologue from the obligate aerobe acetobacter aceti, perform the reversible conversion of acetyl-coa and oxalate to oxalyl-coa and acetate. the annotation of yfde as acetyl-coa:oxalate coa-transferase (acoct) expands the scope of metabolic pathways linked to oxalate catabolism and the oxalate-induced acid tolerance response. fcoct and acoct active sites contain distinctive, conserved active site loops (the glycine-rich loop and the gnxh loop, respectively) that appear to encode substrate specificity.

TI  == the genetic composition of oxalobacter formigenes and its relationship to colonization and calcium oxalate stone disease.
AB  == oxalobacter formigenes is a unique intestinal organism that relies on oxalate degradation to meet most of its energy and carbon needs. a lack of colonization is a risk factor for calcium oxalate stone disease. protection against calcium oxalate stone disease appears to be due to the oxalate degradation that occurs in the gut on low calcium diets with a possible further contribution from intestinal oxalate secretion. much remains to be learned about how the organism establishes  and maintains gut colonization and the precise mechanisms by which it modifies stone risk. the sequencing and annotation of the genomes of a group 1 and a group 2 strain of o. formigenes should provide the informatic tools required for the identification of the genes and pathways associated with colonization and survival. in this review we have identified genes that may be involved and where  appropriate suggested how they may be important in calcium oxalate stone disease. elaborating the functional roles of these genes should accelerate our understanding of the organism and clarify its role in preventing stone formation.

TI  == the role of oxalobacter formigenes colonization in calcium oxalate stone disease.
AB  == about 75% of urinary stones contain oxalate. as oxalobacter formigenes is a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium that degrades oxalate in the intestinal tract,  we assessed the role of o. formigenes in oxalate metabolism by evaluating its intestinal absorption, plasma concentration, and urinary excretion. of 37 calcium oxalate stone formers, 26 tested negative for o. formigenes and were compared with the 11 patients who tested positive. patients provided 24-h urine samples on both a self-selected and a standardized diet. urinary oxalate excretion did not differ significantly on the self-selected diet, but was significantly lower in o. formigenes-positive than in o. formigenes-negative patients under controlled, standardized conditions. intestinal oxalate absorption, measured using [(13)c(2)]oxalate, was similar in the patients with or without o. formigenes. plasma oxalate concentrations were significantly higher in noncolonized (5.79 mumol/l) than in colonized stone formers (1.70 mumol/l). colonization with o. formigenes was significantly inversely associated with the number of stone episodes. our findings suggest that o. formigenes lowers the intestinal concentration of oxalate available for absorption at constant rates, resulting in decreased urinary oxalate excretion. thus, dietary factors have an important role in urinary oxalate excretion. the data indicate that o. formigenes colonization may reduce the risk of stone recurrence.

TI  == the colon: an overlooked site for therapeutics in dialysis patients.
AB  == morbidity and mortality related to chronic kidney disease remain unacceptably high, despite tremendous progress in its prevention and treatment. in an ongoing  quest to improve outcome in chronic kidney disease patients, the colon might be an appealing, but largely underexplored, therapeutic target. a clear bi-directional functional relationship exists between the colon and kidney, also  referred as to the colo-renal axis. uremia has an important impact on the colonic microbiome. the microbiome, in turn, is an important source of uremic toxins, with p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate as important prototypes. these co-metabolites accumulate in the face of a falling kidney function, and may accelerate the progression of renal and cardiovascular disease. several therapeutic interventions, including prebiotics and adsorbants, specifically target these colon-derived uremic toxins originating from bacterial metabolism. as kidney function declines, the colon also gains importance in the homeostasis and disposal of potassium and oxalate. their colonic secretion may be increased by drugs increasing the expression of camp and by probiotics (e.g., oxalobacter formigenes).

TI  == impact of oxalic acid on rumen function and bacterial community in sheep.
AB  == oxalic acid (oa) is a secondary compound occurring in a wide range of plants consumed by ruminants, especially in saline lands or in arid and semi-arid regions. however, its impact on the rumen microbial community and its changes over time, as well as the potential consequences on ruminal function, remain unknown. to examine this impact, five ewes fitted with a ruminal cannula and fed  low-quality grass hay were dosed daily with 0.6 mmol of oa/kg body weight through the cannula for 14 days. on days 0 (before the start), 4, 7 and 14 of the administration period, samples of ruminal digesta were collected throughout the day (0, 3, 6 and 9 h after the morning feeding) for analysis of the bacterial community and fermentation parameters (ph, ammonia and volatile fatty acid (vfa)  concentrations). in addition, two feedstuffs were incubated in situ using the nylon bag technique to estimate ruminal degradation. terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism was employed to monitor the dynamics of total bacteria, and quantitative real-time pcr was used to investigate the abundance of the oxalate-degrading oxalobacter formigenes. neither ph nor total vfa concentrations were affected. nevertheless, oa dosing altered molar proportions of most individual vfa and ammonia concentrations (p < 0.001). the dry matter disappearance of alfalfa hay was reduced on days 7 and 14 and that of barley straw only on day 7 (p < 0.01). these slight changes were related to others observed in the relative frequency of a number of terminal restriction fragments. variations in the ruminal microbiota occurred rapidly with oa administration, which did not modify the bacterial diversity significantly but altered the structure of the community. however, many of these changes were reversed by the end of the experiment, with no significant differences between days 0 and 14 of dosing. these results suggest a rapid adaptation of the rumen bacterial community linked to the estimated increase in the abundance of o. formigenes (from 0.002% to 0.007% of oxc gene in relation to the total bacteria 16s rdna; p < 0.01), which is assumed to be responsible for oxalate breakdown.

TI  == response to dietary oxalate after bariatric surgery.
AB  == background and objectives: bariatric surgery (bs) may be associated with increased oxalate excretion and a higher risk of nephrolithiasis. this study aimed to investigate urinary abnormalities and responses to an acute oxalate load as an indirect assessment of the intestinal absorption of oxalate in this population. design, setting, participants, & measurements: twenty-four-hour urine specimens were collected from 61 patients a median of 48 months after bs (post-bs) as well as from 30 morbidly obese (mo) participants; dietary information was obtained through 24-hour food recalls. an oral oxalate load test  (olt), consisting of 2-hour urine samples after overnight fasting and 2, 4, and 6 hours after consuming 375 mg of oxalate (spinach juice), was performed on 21 mo and 22 post-bs patients 12 months after bs. ten post-bs patients also underwent olt before surgery (pre-bs). results: there was a higher percentage of low urinary volume (<1.5 l/d) in post-bs versus mo (p<0.001). hypocitraturia and hyperoxaluria (p=0.13 and p=0.36, respectively) were more frequent in bs versus mo patients. the olt showed intragroup (p<0.001 for all periods versus baseline)  and intergroup differences (p<0.001 for post-bs versus mo; p=0.03 for post-bs versus pre-bs). the total mean increment in oxaluria after 6 hours of load, expressed as area under the curve, was higher in both post-bs versus mo and in post-bs versus pre-bs participants (p<0.001 for both). conclusions: the mean oxaluric response to an oxalate load is markedly elevated in post-bariatric surgery patients, suggesting that increased intestinal absorption of dietary oxalate is a predisposing mechanism for enteric hyperoxaluria.

TI  == sensitivity of human strains of oxalobacter formigenes to commonly prescribed antibiotics.
AB  == objective: to determine the sensitivity of 4 strains of oxalobacter formigenes (oxf) found in humans--hc1, va3, cc13, and oxk--to varying concentrations of commonly prescribed antibiotics. oxf gut colonization has been associated with a  decreased risk of forming recurrent calcium oxalate kidney stones. methods: for each strain and each antibiotic concentration, 100 mul of an overnight culture and 100 mul of the appropriate antibiotic were added to a 7-ml vial of oxalate culture medium containing 20 mm oxalate. on the fourth day, vials were visually examined for growth, and a calcium oxalate precipitation test was performed to determine whether oxf grew in the presence of the antibiotic. results: all 4 oxf  strains were resistant to amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ceftriaxone, cephalexin, and vancomycin, and they were all sensitive to azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, clindamycin, doxycycline, gentamicin, levofloxacin, metronidazole, and tetracycline. one strain, cc13, was resistant to nitrofurantoin, and the others were sensitive. differences in minimum inhibitory  concentration between strains were demonstrated. conclusion: four human strains of oxf are sensitive to a number of antibiotics commonly used in clinical practice; however, minimum inhibitory concentrations differ between strains.

AB  == aim: to examine whether enhanced diversity or numbers of oxalate-degrading bacteria in the gastrointestinal tracts of black south africans play a role in determining the rarity of urolithiasis in this group. methods and results: fresh  faecal samples collected from healthy black and white south african male volunteers were analysed in terms of bacterial oxalate-degrading activity, bacterial diversity and relative species abundance. varied bacterial populations  prepared from samples from the low-risk black group showed a significantly higher level of oxalate degradation. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analyses of lactobacillus and related spp. and bifidobacterium spp. 16s rrna pcr products revealed a significantly higher faecal lactobacillus diversity for the low-risk black group relative to the higher-risk white group. quantitative real-time pcr experiments did not show any significant differences between the study groups for lactobacillus and related spp.. however, bifidobacterium spp. were present at a significantly higher relative abundance in the black group. oxalobacter formigenes was present only at very low levels in either group. conclusions: the  low abundance of o. formigenes and increased diversity and abundance of oxalate-degrading lactobacillus and bifidobacterium spp. in the black south african population suggest that these strains rather than o. formigenes may protect this group against calcium oxalate kidney stone disease. significance and impact of the study: the south african black population harbours a pool of potential oxalate-degrading lactic acid bacteria, which is more abundant and diverse than that of white south africans. this may be useful in developing probiotics for calcium oxalate kidney stone prophylaxis.

AB  == we report a 29 year old male cystic fibrosis patient with end stage lung disease  and normal renal function who underwent a sequential double lung transplant. medical history included: an ileal resection and pancreatic exocrine dysfunction. the postoperative period was complicated with haemorrhage and repeat surgery, requiring multiple blood transfusions and extensive antibiotic cover. pancreatic  supplements were interrupted. acute renal failure attributed to haemodynamically-mediated acute tubular necrosis was managed expectantly. he remained dialysis dependent 8 weeks post surgery and was maintained on triple immunosuppression with tacrolimus, mycophenolate and prednisolone. a dtpa study was consistent with atn. renal biopsy revealed features consistent with tubular injury due to acute oxalate nephropathy (aon). further biochemical characterization excluded primary hyperoxaluria but confirmed increased 24 hour urinary oxalate. he was maintained on enhanced frequency hdf and subsequently received an uncomplicated live related renal transplant 10 months post lung transplant with only additional basiliximab. calcium carbonate was continued to manage post transplant hyperoxaluria and an early renal biopsy excluded recurrent oxalate injury. enteric hyperoxaluria due to malabsorption in patients with cf especially with ileal resection, in addition to loss of gut oxalobacter formigenes due to prolonged antimicrobials, increases the risk of aon. increased  awareness of this condition and screening prior to lung transplant is recommended.

TI  == presence of oxalobacter formigenes in the intestinal tract is associated with the absence of calcium oxalate urolith formation in dogs.
AB  == the incidence of calcium oxalate (caox) urolithiasis in dogs has increased steadily over the last two decades. a potential mechanism to minimize caox urolithiasis is to reduce enteric absorption of dietary oxalate by oxalate-metabolizing enteric bacteria. enteric colonization of oxalobacter formigenes, an anaerobe which exclusively relies on oxalate metabolism for energy, is correlated with absence of hyperoxaluria or caox urolithiasis or both  in humans and laboratory animals. we thus hypothesized that decreased enteric colonization of o. formigenes is a risk factor for caox urolithiasis in dogs. fecal samples from dogs with caox uroliths, clinically healthy, age-, breed- and  gender-matched dogs, and healthy non-stone forming breed dogs were screened for the presence of o. formigenes by quantitative pcr to detect the oxalyl coa decarboxylase (oxc) gene, and by oxalate degrading biochemical activity in fecal  cultures. prevalence of o. formigenes in dogs with caox uroliths was 25%, compared to 50% in clinically healthy, age-, breed- and gender-matched dogs, and  75% in healthy non-stone forming breeds. the presence of oxc genes of o. formigenes was significantly higher in healthy non-stone forming breed dogs than  in the dogs with caox stones. further, dogs with calcium oxalate stones and the stone-forming breed-matched controls showed comparable levels of biochemical oxalate degrading activity. we conclude that the absence of enteric colonization  of o. formigenes is a risk factor for caox urolithiasis.

TI  == quantitative analysis of colonization with real-time pcr to identify the role of  oxalobacter formigenes in calcium oxalate urolithiasis.
AB  == the objective of the study was to quantitatively measure the number of oxalobacter formigenes (o. formigenes) colonizations in the gastrointestinal tract in calcium oxalate-forming patients with real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). calcium oxalate-forming patients (n: 27) were included in the study. serum calcium, sodium, potassium, urea and creatinine levels, as well as 24 h urine levels of calcium and oxalate were measured. the numbers of o. formigenes colonies in stool samples were detected by real-time pcr. one or two metabolic abnormalities were detected in 15 of 27 patients. the o. formigenes levels in patients with metabolic disturbance were significantly decreased when compared to the patients with no metabolic abnormalities (p: 0.038). the undetectable levels of o. formigenes were encountered in one of five patients with hypercalciuria, in three of four patients with hyperoxaluria and in four of  six patients with both hypercalciuria and hyperoxaluria. in nine patients with a  history of stone recurrence, o. formigenes colonization was significantly lower than the patients with the first stone attack (p: 0.001). o. formigenes formation ceased or significantly diminished in patients with calcium oxalate stones with a coexistence of both hyperoxaluria and hypercalciuria. the measurement of o. formigenes colonies by real-time pcr seemed to be an inconvenient and expensive method. for this reason, the real-time pcr measurements can be spared for the patients with stone recurrences and with metabolic abnormalities like hypercalciuria and hyperoxaluria. the exact measurement of o. formigenes may also help more accurate programming of o. formigenes-based treatments.

TI  == oral antibiotic treatment of helicobacter pylori leads to persistently reduced intestinal colonization rates with oxalobacter formigenes.
AB  == background and purpose: oxalobacter formigenes (of) may play a protective role in preventing calcium oxalate stones. this is the first prospective study to evaluate the effect of antibiotics on of colonization. intestinal colonization by of is associated with reduced urinary oxalate excretion. exposure to antibiotics  may be an important factor determining rates of colonization. materials and methods: the effect of antibiotics on of colonization was compared in two groups: a group receiving antibiotics for gastric infection with helicobacter pylori (hp) and a group without hp whose members were not receiving antibiotics. of colonization in stool was detected by oxalate degradation at baseline and after 1 and 6 months. results: the prevalence at baseline of intestinal colonization with of was 43.1% among all patients screened. among the 12 patients who were positive for of who did not receive antibiotics, 11 (92%) had of on stool tests at 1 month and 6 months. of the 19 participants who were positive for of and who received antibiotics for hp, only 7 (36.8%) continued to be colonized by of on follow-up stool testing at 1 and 6 months (p=0.003 by fisher exact test). amoxicillin and clarithromycin caused 62.5% of subjects to become negative for of at 1 month; 56.2% remained negative for of at 6 months. conclusions: antibiotics for hp infection effectively reduced colonization with of, an effect present at 1 and 6  months after treatment. the lasting elimination of of could be associated with hyperoxaluria and be a factor in recurrent kidney stone disease.

TI  == the construction of an oxalate-degrading intestinal stem cell population in mice: a potential new treatment option for patients with calcium oxalate calculus.
AB  == about 80% of all urological stones are calcium oxalate, mainly caused by idiopathic hyperoxaluria (ih). the increased absorption of oxalate from the intestine is the major factor underlying ih. the continuous self-renewal of the intestinal epithelium is due to the vigorous proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells. if the intestinal stem cell population can acquire the ability to metabolize calcium oxalate by means of oxc and frc transgenes, this will prove a promising new therapy option for ih. in our research, the oxalate-degrading genes of oxalobacter formigenes (oxf)-the frc gene and oxc gene-were cloned and transfected into a cultured mouse-derived intestinal sc population to give the latter an oxalate-degrading function. oxf was isolated and cultivated and the oxalate-degrading genes-frc and oxc-were cloned. the dicistronic eukaryotic expression vector pires-oxc-frc was constructed and transferred into the mouse stem cell population. after selection with g418, the expression of the genes was identified. the oxalate-degrading function of transfected cells was determined by transfection into the intestinal stem cell population of the mouse. the change in oxalate concentration was determined with  an ion chromatograph. the recombinant plasmid containing oxc and frc genes was transfected into the stem cell population of the mouse and the expression of the  genes found normal. the cell population had acquired an oxalate-degrading function. the oxc and frc genes could be transfected into the intestinal stem cell population of the mouse and the cells acquired an oxalate-degrading function.

TI  == oligomeric state of the oxalate transporter, oxlt.
AB  == oxlt, the oxalate transporter of oxalobacter formigenes, was studied to determine its oligomeric state in solution and in the membrane. three independent approaches were used. first, we used triple-detector (sec-ls) size exclusion chromatography to analyze purified oxlt in detergent/lipid micelles. these measurements evaluate protein mass in a manner independent of contributions from  detergent and lipid; such work shows an average oxlt mass near 47 kda for detergent-solubilized material, consistent with that expected for monomeric oxlt  (46 kda). a disulfide-linked oxlt mutant was used to verify that it was possible  detect dimers under these conditions. a second approach used amino-reactive cross-linkers of varying spacer lengths to study oxlt in detergent/lipid micelles and in natural or artificial membranes, followed by analysis via sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. these tests, performed under conditions where the presence of dimers can be documented for either of two known dimeric transporters (adic or tetl), indicate that oxlt exists as a monomer in the membrane and retains this status upon detergent solubilization. in a final test, we showed that reconstitution of oxlt into lipid vesicles at variable protein/lipid ratios has no effect on the specific activity of subsequent oxalate transport, as the oxlt content varies between 0.027 and 5.4 oxlt monomers/proteoliposome. we conclude that oxlt is a functional monomer in the membrane and in detergent/lipid micelles.

TI  == reduction of plasma oxalate levels by oral application of oxalobacter formigenes  in 2 patients with infantile oxalosis.
AB  == the spectrum of primary hyperoxaluria type i is extremely heterogeneous, ranging  from singular to recurrent urolithiasis and early end-stage renal disease (esrd). in infantile oxalosis, the most devastating form, esrd occurs as early as within  the first weeks of life. no kidney replacement therapy sufficiently removes endogenously overproduced oxalate. however, curative combined liver-kidney transplant often is impracticable in small infants. oxalobacter formigenes (o formigenes), an anaerobic oxalate-degrading bacterium, is a colonizer of the healthy human colon. oral administration of o formigenes has been shown to significantly decrease urine and plasma oxalate levels in patients with primary hyperoxaluria. we report compassionate use of o formigenes in two 11-month-old girls with infantile oxalosis and esrd. they received o formigenes twice a day for 4 weeks (or until transplant). dialysis regimens were unchanged. plasma oxalate levels decreased from >110 mumol/l before to 71.53 mumol/l under treatment in patient 1 and from >90 to 68.56 mumol/l (first treatment period) and 50.05 mumol/l (second treatment period) in patient 2. o formigenes was well tolerated. no serious side effects were reported. extremely increased plasma oxalate levels in patients with infantile oxalosis may enable intestinal elimination of endogenous oxalate in the presence of o formigenes. therefore, o formigenes therapy may be helpful as a bridging procedure until transplant in such patients.

TI  == oxalate and sucralose absorption in idiopathic calcium oxalate stone formers.
AB  == objectives: to better understand intestinal oxalate transport by correlating oxalate and sucralose absorption in idiopathic calcium oxalate stone formers. oxalate has been hypothesized to undergo absorption in the large and small intestine by both paracellular and transepithelial transport. sucralose is a chlorinated sugar that is absorbed by paracellular mechanisms. methods: idiopathic calcium oxalate stone formers were recruited to provide urine specimens on both a self-selected diet and after a meal containing 90 mg of (13)c(2-)oxalate and 5 g of sucralose, and a stool sample for determination of oxalobacter formigenes colonization. the 24-hour urine collections were fractionated into the first 6 hours and the subsequent 18 hours. sucralose and oxalate excretion were measured during these periods and used to estimate absorption. results: thirty-eight subjects were evaluated. the majority of both the (13)c(2-)oxalate and sucralose absorption occurred within the 0-6-hour collection. the (13)c(2-)oxalate and sucralose absorptions were significantly correlated at the 0-6 hour, the 6-24 hour, and the total 24-hour time periods (p  <.04). all 5 oxalate hyperabsorbers(>15% absorption) also absorbed significantly  more sucralose during the 0-6 hour and whole 24-hour time points (p <.04). oxalobacter formigenes colonization did not significantly alter oxalate absorption. conclusions: the results suggest that most oxalate is absorbed in the proximal portion of the gastrointestinal tract and that paracellular transport is involved. augmented paracellular transport, as evidenced by increased sucralose absorption, may also influence oxalate absorption.

TI  == impact of dietary calcium and oxalate, and oxalobacter formigenes colonization on urinary oxalate excretion.
AB  == purpose: enteric colonization with oxalobacter formigenes, a bacterium whose main energy source is oxalate, has been demonstrated to decrease the risk of recurrent calcium oxalate kidney stone formation. we assessed the impact of diets controlled in calcium and oxalate contents on urinary and fecal analytes in healthy subjects who were naturally colonized with o. formigenes or not colonized with o. formigenes. materials and methods: a total of 11 o. formigenes colonized  and 11 noncolonized subjects were administered diets controlled in calcium and oxalate contents. we assayed 24-hour urine collections and stool samples obtained on the last 4 days of each 1-week diet for stone risk parameters and o. formigenes levels. mixed model analysis was used to determine the effects of colonization status on these variables. results: urinary calcium and oxalate excretion were significantly altered by the dietary changes in o. formigenes colonized and noncolonized individuals. mixed model analysis showed significant interaction between colonization status and oxalate excretion on a low calcium (400 mg daily)/moderate oxalate (250 mg daily) diet (p = 0.026). urinary oxalate  excretion was 19.5% lower in o. formigenes colonized subjects than in noncolonized subjects on the low calcium/moderate oxalate diet (mean +/- se 34.9  +/- 2.6 vs 43.6 +/- 2.6 mg, p = 0.031). conclusions: results suggest that o. formigenes colonization decreases oxalate excretion during periods of low calcium and moderate oxalate intake.

TI  == oxalobacter colonization in the morbidly obese and correlation with urinary stone risk.
AB  == objective: to establish the baseline preoperative prevalence of oxalobacter formigenes (of) colonization in a cohort of obese patients scheduled for roux-en-y gastric bypass (rygb) and determine the effect of of colonization on urinary oxalate excretion. it has been proposed that loss of of colonization after rygb may contribute to the development of hyperoxaluria. methods: adult patients scheduled to undergo rygb were requested to provide a stool specimen and 24-hour urine collection before surgery. of colonization status was determined by the calcium precipitation test. the 24-hour urine specimens were analyzed by the  litholink corporation (chicago, il). results: of the 51 patients submitting initial stool specimens, only 8 (16%) tested positive for of, whereas 43 (84%) were negative. patients colonized with of were older than uncolonized subjects (52.9+/-6.8 vs 46.0+/-10.4 years, p=.03). urinary oxalate was not significantly different between these groups (p=.14). conclusion: of colonization is uncommon in morbidly obese patients (16%) before surgery. because hyperoxaluria develops in more than 50% of patients after rygb, it is unlikely that loss of of colonization is the primary cause.

TI  == efficacy and safety of oxalobacter formigenes to reduce urinary oxalate in primary hyperoxaluria.
AB  == background: primary hyperoxaluria (ph) is a rare genetic disease, in which high urinary oxalate (uox) cause recurrent kidney stones and/or progressive nephrocalcinosis, often followed by early end-stage renal disease, as well as extremely high plasma oxalate, systemic oxalosis and premature death. oxalobacter formigenes, an anaerobic oxalate degrading bacterium, naturally colonizes the colon of most humans. orally administered o. formigenes (oxabact) was found to significantly reduce urine and plasma oxalate. we aimed to evaluate its effect and safety in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study. methods: oral oxabact was given to ph patients (>5 years old, uox > 1.0 mmol/1.73 m(2)/day, glomerular filtration rate (gfr) > 50 ml/min) at nine ph referral sites worldwide. primary endpoint was the change from baseline in uox (mmol/1.73 m(2)/day) after 24 weeks of treatment (>20% reduction). results: of the 43 subjects randomized, 42 patients received either placebo (23 subjects) or oxabact (19 subjects). the change in uox was <20% and not different between groups (p = 0.616). ad hoc analysis was performed in 37 patients compliant with medication and urine processing. change in uox was -19% in subjects given oxabact and -10% in placebo, (p = 0.288), but -21 and -7% with uox expressed as molar creatinine ratio (ox:cr, mmol/mol, p = 0.06). reduction of ox:cr was more obvious for patients with higher baseline values (>160 mmol/mol, oxabact -28%, placebo -6%; p < 0.082). no serious adverse events were reported. conclusion: oxabact was safe and well tolerated. however, as no significant change in uox was seen, further studies to evaluate the efficacy of oxabact treatment are needed.

TI  == factors related to colonization with oxalobacter formigenes in u.s. adults.
AB  == goals: to elucidate the determinants of oxalobacter formigenes colonization in humans. background: o. formigenes is a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium that colonizes the colon of a substantial proportion of the normal population and metabolizes dietary and endogenous oxalate. the bacterium has been associated with a large reduction in the odds of recurrent calcium oxalate kidney stones. subjects were 240 healthy individuals from massachusetts and north carolina. o. formigenes was detected by culture of fecal swabs. information on factors of interest was obtained by telephone interviews and self-administered questionnaires. study results: the overall prevalence of o. formigenes was 38%. use of specific antibiotics previously thought to affect the bacterium was significantly related to colonization, with prevalences of 17%, 27%, and 36%, for those who had used these drugs <1, 1-5, and >5 years ago, compared with 55% in nonusers. there were no significant associations with demographic factors, nutrient intake, or medical history, although the prevalence appeared to increase somewhat with increasing oxalate consumption. conclusions: some antibiotics markedly affect colonization with o. formigenes. although no other factor was identified as having a material influence on the prevalence of the bacterium, there is much to learn about how an individual acquires the organism and which factors affect persistence of colonization.

TI  == enteric oxalate elimination is induced and oxalate is normalized in a mouse model of primary hyperoxaluria following intestinal colonization with oxalobacter.
AB  == oxalobacter colonization of rat intestine was previously shown to promote enteric oxalate secretion and elimination, leading to significant reductions in urinary oxalate excretion (hatch et al. kidney int 69: 691-698, 2006). the main goal of the present study, using a mouse model of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (ph1), was to test the hypothesis that colonization of the mouse gut by oxalobacter formigenes could enhance enteric oxalate secretion and effectively reduce the hyperoxaluria associated with this genetic disease. wild-type (wt) mice and mice  deficient in liver alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (agxt) exhibiting hyperoxalemia and hyperoxaluria were used in these studies. we compared the unidirectional and net fluxes of oxalate across isolated, short-circuited large intestine of artificially colonized and noncolonized mice. in addition, plasma and urinary oxalate was determined. our results demonstrate that the cecum and distal colon contribute significantly to enteric oxalate excretion in oxalobacter-colonized agxt and wt mice. in colonized agxt mice, urinary oxalate excretion was reduced 50% (to within the normal range observed for wt mice). moreover, plasma oxalate concentrations in agxt mice were also normalized (reduced 50%). colonization of wt mice was also associated with marked (up to 95%) reductions in urinary oxalate excretion. we conclude that segment-specific effects of oxalobacter on intestinal oxalate transport in the ph1 mouse model are associated with a normalization of plasma oxalate and urinary oxalate excretion in otherwise hyperoxalemic and hyperoxaluric animals.

TI  == oxalate-degrading bacteria of the human gut as probiotics in the management of kidney stone disease.
AB  == humans lack the enzymes needed to metabolize endogenous and dietary oxalate, a toxic compound causing hyperoxaluria and calcium oxalate urolithiasis. oxalate in humans can be eliminated through (1) excretion in urine, (2) forming insoluble calcium oxalate and elimination in feces, or (3) oxalate degradation by gastrointestinal (git) microorganisms. in this article, anaerobic oxalate catabolism in gut bacteria is reviewed, and the possible use of these bacteria as probiotics for treating kidney stone disease is evaluated. oxalobacter formigenes and lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species are the best studied in this regard, with oxalate degradation in the lactic acid bacteria being both species-  and strain-specific. the git oxalate-degrading bacteria express the catabolic enzymes formyl-coa transferase (frc) and oxalyl-coa decarboxylase (oxc). the genes encoding these proteins are clustered on the genomes and show strong phylogenetic relationships. clinical trials investigating reduced hyperoxaluria through administering o. formigenes or its enzymes show a promising trend, but the data need confirmation through larger scale, well-controlled trials. similar  studies using lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species also show in vivo oxalate reduction, but these data are still controversial. in particular, further investigations need to determine whether there is a direct link between the lack  of oxalate-degrading bacteria and hyperoxaluria and whether their absence is a risk factor. key experiments linking microbial numbers, functional oxalate degradation, molecular analysis of the regulation of the genes involved, and the  ability of the bacteria to survive in the gut are crucial elements in identifying suitable probiotics for treating kidney stone disease.

TI  == probiotic-induced reduction of gastrointestinal oxalate absorption in healthy subjects.
AB  == both a high dietary oxalate intake and increased intestinal absorption appear to  be major causes of elevated urine oxalate, a risk factor for kidney stone formation. by favorably altering the gastrointestinal bacterial population, probiotics have the potential to lower oxalate absorption/urinary excretion. this study assessed whether a 4-wk daily consumption of a commercially available probiotic by 11 healthy volunteers (8 females, 3 males), aged 21-36 y, would decrease oxalate absorption. the study involved the ingestion of a probiotic (vsl#3) for a 4 wk period followed by a 4 wk washout period. oxalate load tests,  providing a total of 80 mg oxalate, were conducted at baseline (pre-probiotic), and after the probiotic and washout periods. in the total subject population, mean total 22 h oxalate absorption at baseline (30.8 %) was significantly higher  than after the probiotic (11.6 %) and washout (11.5 %) periods. however, four subjects identified as high oxalate absorbers at baseline had a particularly marked probiotic-induced reduction in oxalate absorption, which largely accounted for the reduction observed in the total subject population. the overall data suggested that in individuals characterized by high oxalate absorption levels, vsl#3 ingestion has the potential to reduce gastrointestinal oxalate absorption,  which could decrease risk of kidney stones and other disorders related to hyperoxaluria.

TI  == intestinal colonization with oxalobacter formigenes and its relation to urinary oxalate excretion in pediatric patients with idiopathic calcium urolithiasis.
AB  == background and aim: oxalobacter formigenes is an intestinal bacterium that utilizes oxalate as the only source of energy. it has been suggested that the lack of colonization with this organism may be a risk factor for calcium oxalate  urolithiasis. because this problem was not investigated in pediatric stone formers, we decided to assess it in our patients. methods: the presence of o. formigenes in stool samples of 76 children and adolescents (aged 4.1-18 years) with idiopathic calcium urolithiasis (36 with chemically confirmed calcium oxalate stones and 40 children with a strong clinical suspicion of this type of urolithiasis) was assessed using pcr method. simultaneously, urinary oxalate excretion was measured in this group. fifty healthy, age- and sex-matched subjects served as controls. results: o. formigenes was found in 21/76 patients (27.6%). in controls, frequency of colonization was similar (26%). the median 24h urinary oxalate excretion in patients colonized with o. formigenes was significantly lower in comparison with non-colonized patients, 0.319 (range 0.141-0.546) and 0.437 (range 0.198-0.967) mmol/1.73 m(2)/24h, respectively. conclusions: higher urinary oxalate excretion in children with calcium urolithiasis may be a result of the absence of o. formigenes. the reasons for similarly low intestinal colonization with this bacterium in normal subjects and  stone formers remain speculative. thus, further studies are necessary to clarify  this issue.

AB  == objective: the oxalate-degradation genes of oxalobacter formigenes (ox.f)-frc gene and oxc gene-were cloned and transfected into intestinal stem cell population of the mouse to make the latter obtain oxalate-degradation function. methods: (1) the dicistronic eukaryotic expression vector, which could express oxc gene and frc gene in the same time, pires-oxc-frc was constructed. (2) the intestinal stem cell population of the mouse were isolated and cultured, and the  function of the cell growth and differentiation was identified. (3) the cells were transfected with pires-oxc-frc. after selection by g418, the function of the cell growth and differentiation and the the expression of the objective genes were identified. (4) the concentration of the oxalate in the culture medium which was used to culture the transgenic cells was determined by ion chromatography to  explore the oxalate-degradation function of the cells. results: ox.f could be isolated and cultured from the feces of chinese people. compared with the foreign reports, a certain morphologic variation of the ox.f existed. but the oxc gene and frc gene showed high homology with the sequence reported in genbank. the recombinant plasmid containing oxc gene and frc gene could successfully be transfected into the intestinal stem cell population of the mouse. the expression of the objective genes was normal. the concentration of the oxalate in the culture fluid of the transgenic intestinal stem cell population [(2.48 +/- 0.03 g/l)] was lower than those of the normal group [(2.69 +/- 0.01) g/l] and the control group [(2.69 +/- 0.01) g/l, p < 0.01]. conclusion: the oxc gene and the frc gene could be transfected into the intestinal stem cell population of the mouse, and the cells could be given oxalate-degrading function. the gene of prokaryocyte could be introduced into the eukaryocyte for a successful expression.

TI  == prospects for dietary therapy of recurrent nephrolithiasis.
AB  == the goal of this article is to propose a randomized controlled trial (rct) that tests a hypothesis that dietary manipulation prevents recurrent kidney stones. dietary interventions based on epidemiologic and pathophysiologic data are reviewed. the only diet trial successful in preventing stones showed that calcium intake of 1,200 mg/d, accompanied by restriction of animal protein, salt, and oxalate ingestion, was superior to 400 mg of calcium and restricted oxalate intake. this study may be worth repeating in women and in a society in which salt restriction might be less effective (eg, united states). the net result of diet trials establishes significant positive effects on urine chemistries, but these have not yet shown efficacy with regard to stone recurrence. oxalate restriction  alone could be effective, but many questions regarding which populations to study are not defined, and dietary oxalate's contribution to stone formation is disputed. would such a study be limited to patients identified as having high dietary oxalate intake or high intestinal oxalate absorption? would colonization  with oxalobacter formigenes influence the result? the increased prevalence of stones is linked to weight gain and obesity, making weight loss a possible therapy to prevent stones. randomized trials show that diets consisting of low-fat content or low-caloric content cause modest weight loss and might be effective in reducing stone formation. because the efficacy of thiazides in the prevention of stones in patients with hypercalciuria is clear, i propose dietary  comparison of higher calcium intake to thiazides for the prevention of calcium-based kidney stones.

AB  == hyperoxaluria is a major risk factor for the formation of calcium oxalate stones, but dietary restriction of oxalate intake might not be a reliable approach to prevent recurrence of stones. hence, other approaches to reduce urinary oxalate to manage stone disease have been explored. the gut-dwelling obligate anaerobe oxalobacter formigenes (of) has attracted attention for its oxalate-degrading property. in this review we critically evaluate published studies and identify major gaps in knowledge. recurrent stone-formers are significantly less likely to be colonized with of than controls, but this appears to be due to antibiotic use. studies in animals and human subjects show that colonization of the gut with of can decrease urinary oxalate levels. however, it remains to be determined whether colonization with of can affect stone disease. reliable methods are needed to detect and quantify colonization status and to achieve durable colonization. new  information about oxalate transport mechanisms raises hope for pharmacological manipulation to decrease urinary oxalate levels. in addition, probiotic use of lactic acid bacteria that metabolize oxalate might provide a valid alternative to of.

TI  == projection structure of a member of the amino acid/polyamine/organocation transporter superfamily.
AB  == the l-arginine/agmatine antiporter adic is a key component of the arginine-dependent extreme acid resistance system of escherichia coli. phylogenetic analysis indicated that adic belongs to the amino acid/polyamine/organocation (apc) transporter superfamily having sequence identities of 15-17% to eukaryotic and human apc transporters. for functional and structural characterization, we cloned, overexpressed, and purified wild-type adic and the point mutant adic-w293l, which is unable to bind and consequently transport l-arginine. purified detergent-solubilized adic particles were dimeric. reconstitution experiments yielded two-dimensional crystals of adic-w293l diffracting beyond 6 angstroms resolution from which we determined the projection structure at 6.5 angstroms resolution. the projection map showed 10-12 density peaks per monomer and suggested mainly tilted helices with the exception of one distinct perpendicular membrane spanning alpha-helix. comparison of adic-w293l with the projection map of the oxalate/formate antiporter from oxalobacter formigenes, a member from the major facilitator superfamily, indicated different  structures. thus, two-dimensional crystals of adic-w293l yielded the first detailed view of a transport protein from the apc superfamily at sub-nanometer resolution.

TI  == cysteine scanning mutagenesis of tm5 reveals conformational changes in oxlt, the  oxalate transporter of oxalobacter formigenes.
AB  == we constructed a single-cysteine panel encompassing tm5 of the oxalate transporter, oxlt. the 25 positions encompassed by tm5 were largely tolerant of mutagenesis, and functional product was recovered for 21 of the derived variants. for these derivatives, thiol-directed mts-linked agents (mtsea, mtsce, and mtses) were used as probes of transporter function, yielding 11 mutants that responded to probe treatment, as indicated by effects on oxalate transport. further study identified three biochemical phenotypes among these responders. group 1 included  seven mutants, exemplified by g151c, displaying substrate protection against probe inhibition. group 2 was comprised of a single mutant, p156c, which had unexpected behavior. in this case, we observed increased activity if weak acid/base or neutral probes were used, while exposure to probes introducing a fixed charge led to decreased function. in both instances, the presence of substrate prevented the observed response. group 3 contained three mutants (e.g., s143c) in which probe sensitivity was increased by the presence of substrate. the finding of substrate-protectable probe modification in groups 1 and 2 suggests that tm5 lies on the permeation pathway, as do its structural counterparts, tm2,  tm8, and tm11. in addition, we speculate that substrate binding facilitates tm5 conformational changes that allow new regions to become accessible to mts-linked  probes (group 3). these biochemical data are consistent with the recently developed oxlt homology model.

TI  == use of drugs for nephrolithiasis.
AB  == renal stone disease often begins by renal colic. in order to manage this event adequately, several goals should be pursued: first, attenuate pain; second, favour progression and spontaneous expulsion of stones; third, prevent from obstructive and infectious complications. all of the aforementioned points pertain to medical management of this disease. concerning prevention, it is widely agreed that pathogenesis of kidney stones is a consequence of abnormalities in urine environment, leading to a disequilibrium between promoters and inhibitors of crystallization. therefore, the rationale for therapy is to make urine less conductive to stone formation, by both decreasing state of saturation and increasing inhibitory potential. in only some types of stone-forming salts it is possible to obtain undersaturation with the solid phase. indeed, uric acid stones can be chemically dissolved by using alkali and allopurinol. to a lesser extent, this also applies to cystine stones, with the use of thiols and alkali. in these subsets, the aforementioned tools are also effective to prevent new stone formation. much more challenging appears the treatment of calcium containing stones. about 10% of such stones is caused by systemic disorders and, in these cases, the prevention of new stones is successfully accomplished by curing the underlying disease. for instance, parathyroidectomy cures calcium nephrolithiasis in case of hyperparathyroidism. however, the majority of patients with calcium stones are idiopathic stone-formers, in whom metabolic abnormalities often occur, namely, hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia. the correction of these abnormalities by using thiazide diuretics, alkaline citrates, potassium phosphate and bisphosphonates is based on the prevailing metabolic defect. among the most recent available tools, oxalobacter formigenes and probiotics have been proposed  to treat primary or secondary hyperoxalurias. in general, the treatment of stone  disease reduces its recurrence rate, but only seldom results in stable remission. anyway, less stones mean reduction of the need for urological procedures and the  associated infective or obstructive complications. of course, medical prevention  implies financial efforts, but a careful cost to benefit analysis demonstrates that these are well justified.

TI  == gut microbiology - broad genetic diversity, yet specific metabolic niches.
AB  == analysis of 16s ribosomal rna (rrna)-encoding gene sequences from gut microbial ecosystems reveals bewildering genetic diversity. some metabolic functions, such  as glucose utilisation, are fairly widespread throughout the genetic spectrum. others, however, are not. despite so many phylotypes being present, single species or perhaps only two or three species often carry out key functions. among ruminal bacteria, only three species can break down highly structured cellulose,  despite the prevalence and importance of cellulose in ruminant diets, and one of  those species, fibrobacter succinogenes, is distantly related to the most abundant ruminal species. fatty acid biohydrogenation in the rumen, particularly  the final step of biohydrogenation of c18 fatty acids, stearate formation, is achieved only by a small sub-group of bacteria related to butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. individuals who lack oxalobacter formigenes fail to metabolise oxalate and suffer kidney stones composed of calcium oxalate. perhaps the most celebrated example of the difference a single species can make is the 'mimosine story' in ruminants. mimosine is a toxic amino acid found in the leguminous plant, leucaena leucocephala. mimosine can cause thyroid problems by being converted to the goitrogen, 3-hydroxy-4(1h)-pyridone, in the rumen. observations  that mimosine-containing plants were toxic to ruminants in some countries but not others led to the discovery of synergistes jonesii, which metabolises 3-hydroxy-4(1h)-pyridone and protects animals from toxicity. thus, despite the complexities indicated by molecular microbial ecology and genomics, it should never be forgotten that gut communities contain important metabolic niches inhabited by species with highly specific metabolic capability.

TI  == the roles and mechanisms of intestinal oxalate transport in oxalate homeostasis.
AB  == the mammalian intestine has an important role in the dynamics of oxalate exchange and thereby is significant in the etiology of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. here we review some of the phenomenologic observations that have led to the conclusion that anion exchangers (antiporters) are important mediators of secondarily active, net oxalate transport along the intestine (both absorptive and secretory). understanding the mechanisms of transepithelial oxalate transport has been advanced radically in recent years by the identification of the solute-linked carrier (slc)26 family of anion transporters, which has facilitated the identification of specific proteins mediating individual apical or basolateral oxalate transport pathways. moreover, identification of specific exchangers has underscored their relative importance to oxalate homeostasis as revealed by using knockout mouse models and has facilitated studies of oxalate transport regulation in heterologous expression systems. finally, the significance of oxalate degrading bacteria to oxalate homeostasis is considered from basic and applied perspectives.

TI  == oxalobacter formigenes may reduce the risk of calcium oxalate kidney stones.
AB  == most kidney stones are composed primarily of calcium oxalate. oxalobacter formigenes is a gram-negative, anaerobic bacterium that metabolizes oxalate in the intestinal tract and is present in a large proportion of the normal adult population. it was hypothesized that the absence of o. formigenes could lead to increased colonic absorption of oxalate, and the subsequent increase in urinary oxalate could favor the development of stones. to test this hypothesis, a case-control study involving 247 adult patients with recurrent calcium oxalate stones and 259 age-, gender-, and region-matched control subjects was performed.  the prevalence of o. formigenes, determined by stool culture, was 17% among case  patients and 38% among control subjects; on the basis of multivariate analysis controlling demographic factors, dietary oxalate, and antibiotic use, the odds ratio for colonization was 0.3 (95% confidence interval 0.2 to 0.5). the inverse  association was consistently present within strata of age, gender, race/ethnicity, region, and antibiotic use. among the subset of participants who  completed a 24-h urine collection, the risk for kidney stones was directly proportional to urinary oxalate, but when urinary factors were included in the multivariable model, the odds ratio for o. formigenes remained 0.3 (95% confidence interval 0.1 to 0.7). surprisingly, median urinary oxalate excretion did not differ with the presence or absence of o. formigenes colonization. in conclusion, these results suggest that colonization with o. formigenes is associated with a 70% reduction in the risk for being a recurrent calcium oxalate stone former.

TI  == differential substrate specificity and kinetic behavior of escherichia coli yfdw  and oxalobacter formigenes formyl coenzyme a transferase.
AB  == the yfdxwuve operon appears to encode proteins that enhance the ability of escherichia coli mg1655 to survive under acidic conditions. although the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenotypic behavior remain to be elucidated, findings from structural genomic studies have shown that the structure of yfdw, the protein encoded by the yfdw gene, is homologous to that of the enzyme that mediates oxalate catabolism in the obligate anaerobe oxalobacter formigenes, o. formigenes formyl coenzyme a transferase (frc). we now report the first detailed  examination of the steady-state kinetic behavior and substrate specificity of recombinant, wild-type yfdw. our studies confirm that yfdw is a formyl coenzyme a (formyl-coa) transferase, and yfdw appears to be more stringent than the corresponding enzyme (frc) in oxalobacter in employing formyl-coa and oxalate as  substrates. we also report the effects of replacing trp-48 in the frc active site with the glutamine residue that occupies an equivalent position in the e. coli protein. the results of these experiments show that trp-48 precludes oxalate binding to a site that mediates substrate inhibition for yfdw. in addition, the replacement of trp-48 by gln-48 yields an frc variant for which oxalate-dependent substrate inhibition is modified to resemble that seen for yfdw. our findings illustrate the utility of structural homology in assigning enzyme function and raise the question of whether oxalate catabolism takes place in e. coli upon the  up-regulation of the yfdxwuve operon under acidic conditions.

TI  == oxalate balance in fat sand rats feeding on high and low calcium diets.
AB  == oxalate reduces calcium availability of food because it chelates calcium, forming the sparingly soluble salt calcium-oxalate. nevertheless, fat sand rats (psammomys obesus; gerbillinae) feed exclusively on plants containing much oxalate. we measured the effects of calcium intake on oxalate balance by comparing oxalate intake and excretion in wild fat sand rats feeding on their natural, oxalate-rich, calcium-poor diet with commercially-bred fat sand rats feeding on an artificial, calcium-rich, oxalate-poor diet of rodent pellets. we also tested for the presence of the oxalate degrading bacterium oxalobacter sp. in the faeces of both groups. fat sand rats feeding on saltbush ingested significantly more oxalate than fat sand rats feeding on pellets (p < 0.001) and  excreted significantly more oxalate in urine and faeces (p < 0.01 for both). however the fraction of oxalate recovered in excreta [(oxalate excreted in urine  + oxalate excreted in faeces)/oxalate ingested] was significantly higher in pellet-fed fat sand rats (61%) than saltbush-fed fat sand rats (27%). we found o. sp. in the faeces of both groups indicating that fat sand rats harbor oxalate degrading bacteria, and these are able, to some extent, to degrade oxalate in its insoluble form.

TI  == reinvestigation of the catalytic mechanism of formyl-coa transferase, a class iii coa-transferase.
AB  == formyl-coenzyme a transferase from oxalobacter formigenes belongs to the class iii coenzyme a transferase family and catalyzes the reversible transfer of a coa  carrier between formyl-coa and oxalate, forming oxalyl-coa and formate. formyl-coa transferase has a unique three-dimensional fold composed of two interlaced subunits locked together like rings of a chain. we here present an intermediate in the reaction, formyl-coa transferase containing the covalent beta-aspartyl-coa thioester, adopting different conformations in the two active sites of the dimer, which was identified through crystallographic freeze-trapping experiments with formyl-coa and oxalyl-coa in the absence of acceptor carboxylic  acid. the formation of the enzyme-coa thioester was also confirmed by mass spectrometric data. further structural data include a trapped aspartyl-formyl anhydride protected by a glycine loop closing down over the active site. in a crystal structure of the beta-aspartyl-coa thioester of an inactive mutant variant, oxalate was found bound to the open conformation of the glycine loop. together with hydroxylamine trapping experiments and kinetic as well as mutagenesis data, the structures of these formyl-coa transferase complexes provide new information on the class iii coa-transferase family and prompt redefinition of the catalytic steps and the modified reaction mechanism of formyl-coa transferase proposed here.

TI  == variability of oxalobacter formigenes and oxalate in stool samples.
AB  == purpose: the intestinal organism oxalobacter formigenes is unique in using oxalate as its primary carbon and energy source. intestinal colonization with o.  formigenes may have clinical significance by decreasing intestinal oxalate and its absorption, thereby influencing the concentration of oxalate in plasma and urine, and the development of calcium oxalate stone disease. because the oxalate  content of the diet varies considerably, we hypothesized that the number of o. formigenes and amount of oxalate would vary in feces. materials and methods: to enumerate the number of o. formigenes in feces an accurate and reproducible real-time polymerase chain reaction assay was developed to quantify o. formigenes dna. stool samples were obtained from 10 colonized individuals to determine the levels of o. formigenes by this assay and the oxalate content by ion chromatography. results: concentrations of o. formigenes ranged from lower than the limit of detection of 5 x 10(3) to 1.04 x 10(9) cells per gm stool. the total oxalate content of stool samples varied from 0.1 to 1.8 mg/gm and fecal water oxalate varied from 60 to 600 microm. all parameters measured varied within each  stool collection, among stool collections on different days and among individuals. notably in 7 of 10 individuals at least 1 stool sample contained no  detectable o. formigenes. in addition, 7 of 10 subjects had a fecal colonization  of less than 4 x 10(4) per gm stool. conclusions: this study demonstrates that there is intrastool and interstool sample variability in the amount of o. formigenes measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction that did not correlate with the quantity of oxalate in stool. most subjects had a fecal colonization of  less than 4 x 10(4) per gm stool.

TI  == stable expression of the oxc and frc genes from oxalobacter formigenes in human embryo kidney 293 cells: implications for gene therapy of hyperoxaluria.
AB  == hyperoxaluria can lead to multiple pathologic conditions such as recurrent urolithiasis, oxalosis, nephrocalcinosis and even renal failure, but there is no  known oxalate-degrading pathway in the human body, and current therapeutic options for patients with hyperoxaluria are limited. oxalyl-coa decarboxylase and formyl-coa transferase are the key enzymes in the oxalate catabolism of oxalobacter formigenes which dwell in the intestine of vertebrates and have an important symbiotic relationship with their hosts. the aim of this study was to insert the oxalate-degrading enzyme genes into human embryo kidney (hek) 293 cells and to evaluate if the oxalate-degrading enzymes could be expressed in these cells and keep their enzyme activity. we present here the cloning of the two genes from o. formigenes and their subsequent expression in hek293 cells. the results showed that the expression of oxalyl-coa decarboxylase and formyl-coa transferase was confirmed by rt-pcr and western blotting, and the proteins were located in the cytoplasm of transfected cells. furthermore, the transfected cells were capable to a certain degree of degrading oxalate. these findings suggest that the transfer of oxalate-degrading enzyme genes into human cells is possibly  a potential candidate for the gene therapy of hyperoxaluria.

TI  == hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia, hypomagnesiuria, and lack of intestinal colonization by oxalobacter formigenes in a cervical spinal cord injury patient with suprapubic cystostomy, short bowel, and nephrolithiasis.
AB  == although urolithiasis is common in spinal cord injury patients, it is presumed that the predisposing factors for urinary stones in spinal cord injury patients are immobilization-induced hypercalciuria in the initial period after spinal injury and, in later stages, urine infection by urease-producing micro-organisms, e.g., proteus sp., which cause struvite stones. we describe a patient who sustained c-7 complete tetraplegia in a road traffic accident in 1970, when he was 16 years old. left ureterolithotomy was performed in 1971 followed by left nephrectomy in 1972. probably due to adhesions, this patient developed volvulus of the intestine in 1974. as he had complete tetraplegia, he did not feel pain in the abdomen and there was a delay in the diagnosis of volvulus, which led to ischemia of a large segment of the small bowel. all but 1 ft of jejunum and 1 ft  of ileum were resected leaving the large bowel intact. in 1998, suprapubic cystostomy was performed. in 2004, this patient developed calculus in the solitary right kidney. complete stone clearance was achieved by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. stone analysis: calcium oxalate 60% and calcium phosphate 40%. metabolic evaluation revealed hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia, and hypomagnesiuria. since this patient had hyperoxaluria, the stool was tested for oxalobacter formigenes, a specific oxalate-degrading, anerobic bacterium inhabiting the gastrointestinal tracts of humans; absence of this bacterium appears to be a risk factor for development of hyperoxaluria and, subsequently, calcium oxalate kidney stone disease. dna from the stool was extracted using the  qiaamp dna stool mini kit (qiagen, chatsworth, ca). the genomic dna was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers for oxc gene (developed by sidhu and associates). the stool sample tested negative for o. formigenes. the patient was prescribed potassium citrate mixture; he was advised to avoid oxalate-rich food, maintain recommended levels of calcium in his diet, and take live bio-yogurt. two months later, 24-h urinary oxalate decreased from 0.618 to 0.411 mmol/day; 24-h urine citrate increased from 0.58 to 1.10 mmol/day. six months later, an oxalate absorption test was performed. the patient swallowed a capsule, soluble in gastric juice, containing 50 mg (0.37 mmol) sodium [13c2]oxalate corresponding to 33.8 mg of [13c2]oxalic acid. the amount of labeled oxalate, excreted in urine, was measured by a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric assay. oxalate absorption, expressed as the percentage of the labeled dose recovered in the 24-h urine after dosing, was 8.3% (reference range: 2.3-17.5%). in addition to other conventional measures, oral administration of o. formigenes or lactic acid bacteria mixture to promote bacterial degradation of oxalate in the gut, and thus combat hyperoxaluria, may play a role in prevention  of calcium oxalate kidney stones.

TI  == determination of oxalyl-coenzyme a decarboxylase activity in oxalobacter formigenes and lactobacillus acidophilus by capillary electrophoresis.
AB  == oxalyl-coenzyme a decarboxylase (oxc) is a key enzyme in the catabolism of the highly toxic oxalate, catalysing the decarboxylation of oxalyl-coenzyme a (ox-coa) to formyl-coenzyme a (for-coa). in the present study, a capillary electrophoretic (ce) method was proposed for the assessment of the activity of recombinant oxc from two bacteria, namely oxalobacter formigenes dsm 4420 and lactobacillus acidophilus la 14. in particular, the degradation of the substrate  ox-coa occurring in the enzymatic reaction could be monitored by the off-line ce  method. a capillary permanently coated with polyethylenimine (pei) was used and in the presence of a neutral background electrolyte (50 mm phosphate buffer at ph 7.0), a reversal of the electroosmotic flow was obtained. under these conditions, the anodic migration of ox-coa (substrate) and for-coa (reaction product) occurred and their separation was accomplished in less than 12 min. the ce method was validated for selectivity, linearity (range of ox-coa within 0.005-0.650 mm), sensitivity (lod of 1.5 microm at the detection wavelength of 254 nm), precision  and accuracy. steady state kinetic constants (v(max), k(m) or k') of oxc were finally estimated for both the bacteria showing that although l. acidophilus la 14 provided a lower oxalate breakdown than o. formigenes dsm 4420, it could be a  potentially useful probiotic in the prevention of diseases related to oxalate.

TI  == analysis of substrate-binding elements in oxlt, the oxalate:formate antiporter of oxalobacter formigenes.
AB  == an oxlt homology model suggests r272 and k355 in transmembrane helices 8 and 11,  respectively, are critical to oxlt-mediated transport. we offer positive evidence supporting this idea by studying oxlt function after cysteine residues were separately introduced at these positions. without further treatment, both mutant  proteins had a null phenotype when they were reconstituted into proteoliposomes.  by contrast, significant recovery of function occurred when proteoliposomes were  treated with mtsea (methanethiosulfonate ethylamine), a thiol-specific reagent that implants a positively charged amino group. in each case, there was a 2-fold  increase in the michaelis constant (k(m)) for oxalate self-exchange (from 80 to 160 microm), along with a 5-fold (k355c) or 100-fold (r272c) reduction in v(max)  compared to that of the cysteine-less parental protein. analysis by maldi-tof confirmed that mtsea introduced the desired modification. we also examined substrate selectivity for the treated derivatives. while oxalate remained the preferred substrate, there was a shift in preference among other substrates so that the normal rank order (oxalate > malonate > formate) was altered to favor smaller substrates (oxalate > formate > malonate). this shift is consistent with  the idea that the substrate-binding site is reduced in size via introduction of the sch(2)ch(2)nh(3)(+) adduct, which generates a side chain that is approximately 1.85 a longer than that of lysine or arginine. these findings lead  us to conclude that r272 and k355 are essential components of the oxlt substrate-binding site.

TI  == oxalobacter formigenes: a potential tool for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1.
AB  == primary hyperoxaluria is characterized by severe urolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis,  and early renal failure. as treatment options are scarce, we aimed for a new therapeutic tool using colonic degradation of endogenous oxalate by oxalobactor formigenes. oxalobacter was orally administered for 4 weeks as frozen paste (ixoc-2) or as enteric-coated capsules (ixoc-3). nine patients (five with normal  renal function, one after liver-kidney transplantation, and three with renal failure) completed the ixoc-2 study. seven patients (six with normal renal function and one after liver-kidney transplantation) completed the ixoc-3 study.  urinary oxalate or plasma oxalate in renal failure was determined at baseline, weekly during treatment and for a 2-week follow-up. the patients who showed >20%  reduction both at the end of weeks 3 and 4 were considered as responders. under ixoc-2, three out of five patients with normal renal function showed a 22-48% reduction of urinary oxalate. in addition, two renal failure patients experienced a significant reduction in plasma oxalate and amelioration of clinical symptoms.  under ixoc-3 treatment, four out of six patients with normal renal function responded with a reduction of urinary oxalate ranging from 38.5 to 92%. although  all subjects under ixoc-2 and 4 patients under ixoc-3 showed detectable levels of o. formigenes in stool during treatment, fecal recovery dropped directly at follow up, indicating only transient gastrointestinal-tract colonization. the preliminary data indicate that o. formigenes is safe, leads to a significant reduction of either urinary or plasma oxalate, and is a potential new treatment option for primary hyperoxaluria.

TI  == oxalobacter sp. reduces urinary oxalate excretion by promoting enteric oxalate secretion.
AB  == the primary goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that oxalobacter colonization alters colonic oxalate transport thereby reducing urinary oxalate excretion. in addition, we examined the effects of intraluminal calcium on oxalobacter colonization and tested the hypothesis that endogenously derived colonic oxalate could be degraded by lyophilized oxalobacter enzymes targeted to  this segment of the alimentary tract. oxalate fluxes were measured across short-circuited, in vitro preparations of proximal and distal colon removed from  sprague-dawley rats and placed in ussing chambers. for these studies, rats were colonized with oxalobacter either artificially or naturally, and urinary oxalate, creatinine and calcium excretions were determined. colonized rats placed on various dietary treatment regimens were used to evaluate the impact of calcium on oxalobacter colonization and whether exogenous or endogenous oxalate influenced colonization. hyperoxaluric rats with some degree of renal insufficiency were also used to determine the effects of administering encapsulated oxalobacter lysate on colonic oxalate transport and urinary oxalate excretion. we conclude that in addition to its intraluminal oxalate-degrading capacity, oxalobacter interacts physiologically with colonic mucosa by inducing enteric oxalate secretion/excretion leading to reduced urinary excretion. whether oxalobacter, or products of oxalobacter, can therapeutically reduce urinary oxalate excretion and influence stone disease warrants further investigation in long-term studies in various patient populations.

AB  == current treatment options in patients with primary and secondary hyperoxaluria are limited and do not always lead to sufficient reduction in urinary oxalate excretion. intestinal oxalate degrading bacteria are capable of degrading oxalate to co(2) and formate, the latter being further metabolized and excreted via the feces. it is speculated, that both endogenously produced, as well as dietary oxalate can be significantly removed via the intestinal tract. oxalobacter formigenes, an obligate anaerobic microbe normally found in the intestinal tract  has one oxalate degrading enzyme, oxalyl-coa decarboxylase, which is also found in bifidobacterium lactis. other bacteria with possible oxalate degrading potency are lactic acid bacteria, as well as enterococcus faecalis and eubacterium lentum. however, specific therapeutic studies on humans are scarce and, except for oxalobacter, data are not congruent. we found the oral application of oxalobacter successful in patients with primary hyperoxaluria. however, long-term post-treatment follow-up of 1-2 years showed that constant intestinal colonization is not achieved in most patients. in one patient with constant colonization, urinary oxalate excretion normalized over time. short-term studies  with other bacteria such as lactic acid bacteria did not show a specific reduction in urinary oxalate excretion. o. formigenes might be a promising new therapeutic tool in patients with primary and secondary hyperoxaluria.

TI  == structural basis for activation of the thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzyme oxalyl-coa decarboxylase by adenosine diphosphate.
AB  == oxalyl-coenzyme a decarboxylase is a thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzyme that plays an important role in the catabolism of the highly toxic compound oxalate. we have determined the crystal structure of the enzyme from oxalobacter formigenes from a hemihedrally twinned crystal to 1.73 a resolution and characterized the steady-state kinetic behavior of the decarboxylase. the monomer of the tetrameric enzyme consists of three alpha/beta-type domains, commonly seen in this class of enzymes, and the thiamin diphosphate-binding site is located at  the expected subunit-subunit interface between two of the domains with the cofactor bound in the conserved v-conformation. although oxalyl-coa decarboxylase is structurally homologous to acetohydroxyacid synthase, a molecule of adp is bound in a region that is cognate to the fad-binding site observed in acetohydroxyacid synthase and presumably fulfils a similar role in stabilizing the protein structure. this difference between the two enzymes may have physiological importance since oxalyl-coa decarboxylation is an essential step in atp generation in o. formigenes, and the decarboxylase activity is stimulated by  exogenous adp. despite the significant degree of structural conservation between  the two homologous enzymes and the similarity in catalytic mechanism to other thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzymes, the active site residues of oxalyl-coa decarboxylase are unique. a suggestion for the reaction mechanism of the enzyme is presented.

TI  == detection and characterization of merohedral twinning in crystals of oxalyl-coenzyme a decarboxylase from oxalobacter formigenes.
AB  == oxalyl-coenzyme a decarboxylase is a thiamin diphosphate dependent enzyme active  in the catabolism of the highly toxic compound oxalate. the enzyme from oxalobacter formigenes has been expressed as a recombinant protein in escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity and crystallized. two crystal forms were obtained,  one showing poor diffraction and the other merohedral twinning. crystals in the former category belong to the tetragonal space group p4(2)2(1)2. data to 4.1 a resolution were collected from these crystals and an incomplete low resolution structure was initially determined by molecular replacement. crystals in the latter category were obtained by co-crystallizing the protein with coenzyme a, thiamin diphosphate and mg(2+)-ions. data to 1.73 a were collected from one of these crystals with apparent point group 622. the crystal was found to be heavily twinned, and a twin ratio of 0.43 was estimated consistently by different established methods. the true space group p3(1)21 was deduced, and a molecular replacement solution was obtained using the low resolution structure as template  when searching in detwinned data.

TI  == absorptive hyperoxaluria leads to an increased risk for urolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis in cystic fibrosis.
AB  == background: hyperoxaluria has been incriminated to account for the increased incidence of urolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis in patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). hyperoxaluria presumably is caused by fat malabsorption and the absence of  such intestinal oxalate-degrading bacteria as oxalobacter formigenes. to better elucidate its pathophysiological characteristics, we prospectively studied patients with cf by determining these parameters and performing renal ultrasonography twice yearly. methods: in addition to routine tests in urine (lithogenic and stone-inhibitory substances), the presence of o formigenes was tested in stool, plasma oxalate was measured, and a [13c2]oxalate absorption test was performed in 37 patients with cf aged 5 to 37 years (15 females, 22 males) who were constantly hyperoxaluric before the study. results: hyperoxaluria (oxalate, 46 to 141 mg/1.73 m2/24 h [0.51 to 1.57 mmol/1.73 m2/24 h]; normal, < 45 mg/1.73 m2/24 h [< 0.5 mmol/1.73 m2/24 h]) was now found in 24 patients (64.8%). plasma oxalate levels were elevated in 6 patients (7.92 to 19.5 micromol/l; normal, 6.3 +/- 1.1 micromol/l). oxalobacter species were detected in only 1 patient. intestinal oxalate absorption was elevated (11.4% to 28.5%; normal, < 10%) in 23 patients. hypocitraturia was present in 17 patients (citrate, 0.35 to 2.8 g/1.73 m2/24 h [0.2 to 1.1 mmol/1.73 m2/24 h]; normal female, > 2.8 mg/1.73 m2/24 h [> 1.6 mmol/1.73 m2/24 h]; male, > 3.3 mg/1.73 m2/24 h [> 1.9 mmol/1.73 m2/24 h]). urine calcium oxalate saturation was elevated in 17 patients (5.62 to 28.9 relative units; normal female, < 5.5 relative units; male, < 6.3 relative units). in 16% of patients, urolithiasis (n = 2) or nephrocalcinosis (n = 4) was diagnosed ultrasonographically. conclusion: absorptive hyperoxaluria and hypocitraturia are the main culprits for the increased incidence of urolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis in patients with cf. we  advocate high fluid intake, low-oxalate/high-calcium diet, and alkali citrate medication, if necessary. additional studies are necessary to determine the influence of oxalobacter species or other oxalate-degrading bacteria on oxalate handling in patients with cf.

TI  == oxalate-degrading providencia rettgeri isolated from human stools.
AB  == background: oxalate-degrading bacteria are thought to metabolize intestinal oxalate and thus decrease the urinary excretion of oxalate by reducing its intestinal absorption. methods: we have isolated several novel oxalate-degrading  bacteria from human stools. oxalate degrading bacteria were investigated to characterize their protein profiles with antibodies against oxalyl-coenzyme a decarboxylase (65 kda) and formyl-coenzyme a transferase (48 kda) purified from oxalobacter formigenes. results: one of these isolates was identified as providencia rettgeri, which showed two proteins (65 kda and 48 kda) on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) that were not found in non-oxalate-degrading p. rettgeri. antibodies reacted with the 65 and 48 kda proteins from the p. rettgeri strain on western blotting. an oxalobacter formigenes formyl-coenzyme a transferase gene probe reacted with chromosomal dna  from p. rettgeri on southern blotting under high stringency conditions, while an  oxalobacter formigenes oxalyl-coenzyme a decarboxylase gene probe did not react under the same conditions. conclusions: the mechamism of oxalate degradation by p. rettgeri appears to be similar to that of oxalobacter formigenes. this is the  first report of a facultative oxalate-degrading organism that is one of the enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == experimental tests of a homology model for oxlt, the oxalate transporter of oxalobacter formigenes.
AB  == using the x-ray structure of the glycerol 3-phosphate transporter (glpt), we devised a model for the distantly related oxalate transporter, oxlt. the model accommodates all earlier biochemical information on oxlt, including the idea that lys-355 lies on the permeation pathway, and predicts that lys-355 and a second positive center, arg-272, comprise the binding site for divalent oxalate. study of r272k, r272a, and r272q derivatives verifies that arg-272 is essential, and comparisons with glpt show that both anion transporters bind substrates within equivalent domains. in 22 single-cysteine variants in tm7 and tm8, topology as marked by accessibility to oregon green maleimide is predicted by the model, with similar concordance for 52 positions probed earlier. the model also reconciles cross-linking of a cysteine pair placed near the periplasmic ends of tm2 and tm7, and retrospective study of tm2 and tm11 confirms that positions supporting disulfide trapping lie at a helical interface. our work describes a pathway to the modeling of oxlt and other transporters in the major facilitator superfamily  and outlines simple experimental tests to evaluate such proposals.

TI  == crystal structure of escherichia coli crotonobetainyl-coa: carnitine coa-transferase (caib) and its complexes with coa and carnitinyl-coa.
AB  == l-carnitine (r-[-]-3-hydroxy-4-trimethylaminobutyrate) is found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells and participates in diverse processes including  long-chain fatty-acid transport and osmoprotection. the enzyme crotonobetainyl/gamma-butyrobetainyl-coa:carnitine coa-transferase (caib; e.c. 2.8.3.-) catalyzes the first step in carnitine metabolism, leading to the final product gamma-butyrobetaine. the crystal structures of escherichia coli apo-caib, as well as its asp169ala mutant bound to coa and to carnitinyl-coa, have been determined and refined to 1.6, 2.4, and 2.4 a resolution, respectively. caib is composed of two identical circular chains that together form an intertwined dimer. each monomer consists of a large domain, containing a rossmann fold, and a small domain. the monomer and dimer resemble those of formyl-coa transferase from oxalobacter formigenes, as well as e. coli yfdw, a putative type-iii coa transferase of unknown function. the coa cofactor-binding site is formed at the interface of the large domain of one monomer and the small domain from the second monomer. most of the protein-coa interactions are formed with the rossmann fold domain. while the location of cofactor binding is similar in the three proteins,  the specific coa-protein interactions vary somewhat between caib, formyl-coa transferase, and yfdw. coa binding results in a change in the relative positions  of the large and small domains compared with apo-caib. the observed carnitinyl-coa product in crystals of the caib asp169ala mutant cocrystallized with crotonoyl-coa and carnitine could result from (i) a catalytic mechanism involving a ternary enzyme-substrate complex, independent of a covalent anhydride intermediate with asp169, (ii) a spontaneous reaction of the substrates in solution, followed by binding to the enzyme, or (iii) an involvement of another residue substituting functionally for asp169, such as glu23.

TI  == effect of antibiotics on oxalobacter formigenes colonization of human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == background and purpose: oxalobacter formigenes is a bacterium residing in the human gastrointestinal tract that degrades oxalate and reduces its availability for absorption. this bacterium is assumed to be antibiotic sensitive, and repeated antibiotic therapies could eradicate it. the aim of the present study was to determine the differences in the colonization by o. formigenes of individuals who had been on antibiotics for at least 5 days at the time of sample collection and individuals who had not taken antibiotics for at least 3 months. patients and methods: stool samples were collected from 80 individuals without stone disease (35 with and 45 without antibiotic consumption) and 100 patients with stone disease (20 with and 80 without antibiotic consumption). oxalobacter formigenes was detected by a polymerase chain reaction-based method, and the presence/absence of o. formigenes was correlated with urinary oxalate concentrations. results: lower percentages of individuals without stone disease and with stone disease who were consuming antibiotics had o. formigenes colonization than individuals without antibiotic consumption. urinary oxalate concentrations were higher in the individuals without o. formigenes than in colonized individuals. conclusion: our observations confirm a direct association  between antibiotic consumption and absence of o. formigenes. absence of intestinal o. formigenes could represent a pathogenic factor in calcium oxalate urolithiasis when antibiotics are prescribed generously.

TI  == bacterial community composition determined by culture-independent and -dependent  methods during propane-stimulated bioremediation in trichloroethene-contaminated  groundwater.
AB  == an in situ co-metabolic air sparging (cas) study was carried out at mcclellan air force base (mafb), sacramento, ca, usa, in a trichloroethene- (tce) and cis-dichloroethene (cis-dce)-contaminated aquifer where one test zone received 2% propane in air and the other served as a control and received only air. as part of that study, bacterial population shifts were evaluated by length heterogeneity polymerase chain reaction (lh-pcr). the results showed that an organism(s) that had a fragment size of 385 bp was positively correlated with propane removal rates. the 385 bp fragment consisted of up to 83% of the total fragments in the analysis when propane removal rates peaked. a 16s rrna clone library made from the bacteria sampled from the propane-sparged groundwater included clones of a tm7 division bacterium that had a 385 bp lh-pcr fragment; no other bacterial species with this fragment size were detected. both propane removal rates and the 385 bp lh-pcr fragment decreased as nitrate levels in the groundwater decreased.  extinction culturing in natural unamended groundwater medium was used to assess the bacterial diversity of the culturable fraction of microorganisms in both cas  and air-sparged groundwater and to bring novel species into culture for further study. the dominant cultures acquired from the cas groundwater were from the herbaspirillum/oxalobacter clade. the dominant cultures from the air-sparged groundwater were from a novel beta-proteobacterial clade, which we named after isolate htcc333.

TI  == infrequency of colonization with oxalobacter formigenes in inflammatory bowel disease: possible role in renal stone formation.
AB  == background and aim: calcium oxalate renal stones (rs) and hyperoxaluria are common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). the absence of intestinal oxalate degrading bacteria, oxalobacter formigenes, may cause hyperoxaluria in ibd. the aim of the present study was to examine: (i) the colonization of o. formigenes in patients with ibd and controls and to correlate  its presence with urinary oxalate excretion; and (ii) urinary analytes contributing to rs in ibd. methods: stool samples were studied for o. formigenes  using polymerase chain reaction and southern blotting in patients with ibd (n = 48: ulcerative colitis, 37; crohn's disease, 11), rs (n = 87) and healthy subjects that were used as controls (n = 48). levels of urinary oxalate, citrate, calcium, magnesium, creatinine and uric acid were estimated spectrophotometrically in each patient and in 13 controls for 24 h. results: five of the 48 (10.4%) patients with ibd had rs. five of the 48 (10.4%) patients with  ibd, 25 of the 87 (29%) with rs and 27 of the 48 (56%) controls were colonized with o. formigenes (p < 0.001 for rs vs controls and p = 0.01 for rs vs ibd). patients without o. formigenes had higher urinary oxalate than those with it (ibd, median 0.48 [range 0.11-2.09]vs 0.43 [range 0.16-1.10] mmol/24 h, p = ns; rs, median 0.59 mmol/24 h, range 0.14-1.90 vs 0.44 mmol/24 h, range 0.23-0.97; p  = 0.008, mann-whitney u-test). median excretion of oxalate was higher in ibd and  rs than in controls (0.47 [0.11-2.09], 0.56 [0.14-1.9] and 0.41 [0.21-0.62] mmol/24 h; p < 0.01), respectively. median calcium was also higher in ibd and rs  than in controls (6.50 [1.38-21.00], 6.78 [1.55-20.30] and 4.99 [1.47-9.60] mmol/24 h; p < 0.05, kruskal-wallis h-test), respectively. median urinary magnesium was higher in ibd than in rs and controls (4.57 [1.50-12.30], 3.60 [0.90-6.35] and 2.49 [0.74-4.80]; p < 0.001, kruskal-wallis h-test), respectively. urinary citrate excretion was comparable in ibd, rs and controls. conclusions: patients with ibd and rs rarely have o. formigenes in their stools as compared with controls; this may contribute to hyperoxaluria in ibd. hyperoxaluria and hypercalciuria may contribute to rs in patients with ibd. hypermagnesuria in patients with ibd may protect them from rs.

TI  == role of dietary intake and intestinal absorption of oxalate in calcium stone formation.
AB  == the factors affecting the urinary excretion of oxalate are critical to the risk of forming calcium oxalate stones. this article reviews the role of dietary and intestinal oxalate in determining the level of oxalate excreted in urine. the amount of oxalate available for absorption throughout the intestine is highly dependent on the state of oxalate (a) in the food ingested, and (b) in the intestinal contents at each section of the intestinal tract since only the soluble form of oxalate can be absorbed. in this respect, the solubility of calcium oxalate (caox) under the prevailing conditions is paramount in determining the amount of oxalate available for absorption at any particular site. in turn, the main factors that control how much oxalate is in the soluble form are ph and the concentrations of calcium, magnesium and (indirectly) phosphate. based on these parameters, a model of the intestine has been constructed which brings together the available evidence on the prevailing concentrations of these various factors at different sites in the intestine after allowing for dietary intake and the concentration of the above ions in intestinal secretions. the model then calculates the likely concentration of oxalate that is in the soluble form at each site and therefore available for passive absorption at that site. the model shows that oxalate is likely to be absorbed in the stomach, although it can be also absorbed in the small intestine, particularly at the distal end (after the absorption of calcium), and in the colon, since, on a normal intake of calcium and phosphate, most of the calcium in the large bowel would be anticipated to be precipitated as calcium phosphate under the prevailing alkaline conditions and high concentration of phosphate. the amount of free oxalate in the colon is also controlled by the presence or absence of oxalobacter formigenes, an anaerobe that has an obligate requirement for oxalate as a source  of energy and cellular carbon.

TI  == microorganisms and calcium oxalate stone disease.
AB  == microorganisms may have a role in the pathogenesis and prevention of kidney stones. the subjects of this review include nanobacteria, oxalobacter formigenes, and lactic acid bacteria. not reviewed here is the well-described role of infections of the urinary tract with proteus species and other urease-producing organisms associated with struvite stone formation. nanobacteria have been proposed to be very small (0.08-0.5 nm), ubiquitous organisms that could play a role in stone formation. the theory is that nanobacteria can nucleate carbonate apatite on their surfaces and thereby provide the nidus for stone formation. however, their existence remains uncertain and many investigators are openly skeptical. recent investigations suggest that they are artifacts, and not actually living organisms, but their proponents continue to study them. o. formigenes is an obligate anaerobe which may be important in the prevention of stone formation. its sole substrate for generation of atp is oxalate. it may thereby metabolize its human host's dietary oxalate and diminish intestinal absorption and subsequent urinary excretion of oxalate. there is evidence that the organism's absence, perhaps sometimes due to courses of antibiotics, may be a cause of hyperoxaluria and stone formation. in early investigations, patients not colonized with the organism can be recolonized. urinary oxalate can be diminished by accompanying an oxalate-containing meal with the organism. one study demonstrated that a preparation of lactic acid bacteria successfully reduced urinary oxalate excretion in 6 patients with calcium oxalate stones and hyperoxaluria. the mechanism of this effect is uncertain since these bacteria lacked the gene possessed by o. formigenes which codes for that organism's oxalate uptake mechanism. the author is currently completing a small randomized controlled clinical trial with this preparation in calcium stone-forming patients with idiopathic hyperoxaluria.

TI  == [future perspective on the prevention of nephrolithiasis].
AB  == renal stone formation has been explained by the physicochemical theory; i.e., nucleation, growth and aggregation of crystals in the urine. current medical prevention is based on this theory and seeks to modulate promoters and inhibitors of stone formation. recent studies have identified increasing numbers of macromolecular inhibitors such as glycosaminoglycans, bikunin, osteopontin and urinary prothrombin f1. these appear to be more important than low-molecular inhibitors like citrate. on the other hand, many investigators have focused on the role of tubular epithelial cells in stone formation. while crystal retention  in the nephron has been considered necessary for stone formation, we and others have found that calcium oxalate crystals can bind to renal epithelial cells. moreover, available evidence suggests that oxalate and/or calcium oxalate crystals can damage renal epithelial cells and enhance crystal binding. concurrently, oxalate exposure induces genes coding macromolecular inhibitors, which are supposed to be a protective mechanism against stone formation. thus, understanding of the mechanisms involved in kidney stone formation could lead to  new therapeutic approaches to preventing stone recurrence. however, clinical application of the prophylactic approaches proposed here awaits further progress  in basic research using rapidly growing new technologies. application of the dna  microarray technique to the rat stone model may provide a clue to understanding stone forming process at the genetic level. in addition, case-control association analysis using single nucleotide polymorphism as a marker may be useful for detecting susceptibility genes in patients with calcium stone disease.

TI  == characterization and heterologous expression of the oxalyl coenzyme a decarboxylase gene from bifidobacterium lactis.
AB  == oxalyl coenzyme a (coa) decarboxylase (oxc) is a key enzyme in the catabolism of  the highly toxic compound oxalate, catalyzing the decarboxylation of oxalyl-coa to formyl-coa. the gene encoding a novel oxalyl-coa decarboxylase from bifidobacterium lactis dsm 10140 (oxc) was identified and characterized. this strain, isolated from yogurt, showed the highest oxalate-degrading activity in a  preliminary screening with 12 strains belonging to bifidobacterium, an anaerobic  intestinal bacterial group largely used in probiotic products. the oxc gene was isolated by probing a b. lactis genomic library with a probe obtained by amplification of the oxalyl-coa decarboxylase gene from oxalobacter formigenes, an anaerobic bacterium of the human intestinal microflora. the oxc dna sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1,773 bp encoding a deduced 590-amino-acid protein with a molecular mass of about 63 kda. analysis of amino acid sequence showed a significant homology (47%) with oxalyl-coa decarboxylase of o. formigenes and a typical thiamine pyrophosphate-binding site that has been  reported for several decarboxylase enzymes. primer extension experiments with oxc performed by using rna isolated from b. lactis identified the transcriptional start site 28 bp upstream of the atg start codon, immediately adjacent to a presumed promoter region. the protein overexpressed in escherichia coli cross-reacted with an anti-o. formigenes oxalyl-coa decarboxylase antibody. enzymatic activity, when evaluated by capillary electrophoresis analysis, demonstrated that the consumption substrate oxalyl-coa was regulated by a product inhibition of the enzyme. these findings suggest a potential role for bifidobacterium in the intestinal degradation of oxalate.

TI  == structure and transport mechanism of the bacterial oxalate transporter oxlt.
AB  == membrane proteins that belong to the major facilitator superfamily (mfs) are found in organisms across the evolutionary spectrum and mediate the transport of  a variety of substrates ranging from small metabolites to neurotransmitters. the  oxalate transporter (oxlt) is a representative mfs protein, and exchanges formate for oxalate across the cytoplasmic membrane of the organism oxalobacter formigenes. here, we present a structural model for the protein conformational changes that occur during oxalate transport by combining a three-dimensional map  of the oxalate-bound, "closed" state of oxlt at 6.5 a determined by cryo-electron microscopy with a model of the "open" state of oxlt based on the atomic structures of the related transporters, glycerol-3-phosphate transporter (glpt) and lactose permease (lacy). we demonstrate that the principal structural change  associated with substrate transport is a concerted rocking movement of the two structurally similar halves of the protein relative to each other. our structural model places two positively charged residues, arg-272 and lys-355 in the central  cavity, suggesting that electrostatic interactions between these residues and the oxalate anion is a key step in generating the conformational change between the open and closed states of the transporter.

TI  == kinetic and mechanistic characterization of the formyl-coa transferase from oxalobacter formigenes.
AB  == oxalobacter formigenes is an obligate anaerobe that colonizes the human gastrointestinal tract and employs oxalate breakdown to generate atp in a novel process involving the interplay of two coupled enzymes and a membrane-bound oxalate:formate antiporter. formyl-coa transferase is a critical enzyme in oxalate-dependent atp synthesis and is the first class iii coa-transferase for which a high resolution, three-dimensional structure has been determined (ricagno, s., jonsson, s., richards, n., and lindqvist, y. (2003) embo j. 22, 3210-3219). we now report the first detailed kinetic characterizations of recombinant, wild type formyl-coa transferase and a number of site-specific mutants, which suggest that catalysis proceeds via a series of anhydride intermediates. further evidence for this mechanistic proposal is provided by the  x-ray crystallographic observation of an acylenzyme intermediate that is formed when formyl-coa transferase is incubated with oxalyl-coa. the catalytic mechanism of formyl-coa transferase is therefore established and is almost certainly employed by all other members of the class iii coa-transferase family.

TI  == colonization of the neonatal rat intestinal tract from environmental exposure to  the anaerobic bacterium oxalobacter formigenes.
AB  == oxalobacter formigenes, an anaerobic bacterium that inhabits the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, has an important symbiotic relationship with its vertebrate hosts by regulating oxalic acid homeostasis. epidemiological studies of o. formigenes colonization in man have shown that colonization occurs in young children, that every child can become colonized naturally, that >20% lose colonization during adolescence or as adults and that stable colonization can be  disrupted by antibiotic use or changes in diet, greatly affecting subsequent health. as o. formigenes is a fastidious anaerobe that seldom re-colonizes adults, the question arises as to how initial colonization occurs. to investigate this question, non-colonized female laboratory rats were placed on diets high in  oxalate and were colonized by oesophageal gavage with o. formigenes either before or after being impregnated. faecal specimens from their offspring were tested for the presence of o. formigenes. although the bacterium was first detected in a few neonates as early as 7 days post-partum, colonization of all the offspring did not occur until after weaning. in each case, the offspring were colonized with the bacterial strain carried by their mothers. to determine whether o. formigenes colonization occurs vertically or horizontally, newborn rats were placed with foster mothers that were either non-colonized or colonized with an o. formigenes  strain different from that of their natural mothers. colonization occurred temporally in a manner similar to natural colonization but all offspring became colonized only with the o. formigenes strain of the foster mothers. these data indicate that intestinal colonization occurs horizontally, but does not answer the question of how o. formigenes survives the aerobic environment in order to be transmitted.

TI  == oxalobacter formigenes and its role in oxalate metabolism in the human gut.
AB  == oxalate is ingested in a wide range of animal feeds and human foods and beverages and is formed endogenously as a waste product of metabolism. bacterial, rather than host, enzymes are required for the intestinal degradation of oxalate in man  and mammals. the bacterium primarily responsible is the strict anaerobe oxalobacter formigenes. in humans, this organism is found in the colon. o. formigenes has an obligate requirement for oxalate as a source of energy and cell carbon. in o. formigenes, the proton motive force for energy conservation is generated by the electrogenic antiport of oxalate(2-) and formate(1-) by the oxalate-formate exchanger, oxlt. the coupling of oxalate-formate exchange to the  reductive decarboxylation of oxalyl coa forms an 'indirect' proton pump. oxalate  is voided in the urine and the loss of o. formigenes may be accompanied by elevated concentrations of urinary oxalate, increasing the risk of recurrent calcium oxalate kidney stone formation. links between the occurrence of nephrolithiasis and the presence of oxalobacter have led to the suggestion that antibiotic therapy may contribute to the loss of this organism from the colonic microbiota. studies in animals and human volunteers have indicated that, when administered therapeutically, o. formigenes can establish in the gut and reduce the urinary oxalate concentration following an oxalate load, hence reducing the likely incidence of calcium oxalate kidney stone formation. the findings to date  suggest that anaerobic, colonic bacteria such as o. formigenes, that are able to  degrade toxic compounds in the gut, may, in future, find application for therapeutic use, with substantial benefit for human health and well-being.

AB  == oxlt is a bacterial transporter protein with 12 transmembrane segments that belongs to the major facilitator superfamily of transporters. it facilitates the  exchange of oxalate and formate across the membrane of the gram-negative bacterium oxalobacter formigenes. from an electron crystallographic analysis of two-dimensional, tube-like crystals of oxlt, we have previously determined the three-dimensional structure of this transporter at 6.5 a resolution. here, we report conditions to obtain crystalline, two-dimensional sheets of oxlt with diameters exceeding 2 microm. images of the crystalline sheets were recorded at liquid nitrogen temperatures on a transmission electron microscope equipped with  a field-emission gun, operated at 300 kv. computed optical diffraction patterns from the best images display measurable reflections to about 3.4a, and electron diffraction patterns show spots to about 3.2 a resolution in the best cases. as in the case of the tube-like crystals, the new crystalline sheets also belong to  the p22(1)2(1) symmetry group. however, the unit cell dimensions of 102.7a x 67.3 a are significantly smaller in one direction than those previously observed with  the tube-like crystals that display unit cell dimensions of 100.3a x 79.0 a. different regions of oxlt are involved in intermolecular contacts in the two types of crystals, and the improved resolution of the sheet crystals appears to be mainly attributable to this tighter packing of the monomers within the unit cell.

TI  == urinary oxalate levels and the enteric bacterium oxalobacter formigenes in patients with calcium oxalate urolithiasis.
AB  == objectives: we performed a prospective study to evaluate the intestinal colonization of oxalobacter formigenes and its relationship with urinary oxalate  levels in patients with calcium oxalate stone disease. methods: one hundred and three patients with calcium oxalate urolithiasis, ranging in age from 21 to 73 years (mean age, 47 years) who were followed from august 2000 to september 2001 participated in this study. fresh stool and 24-hour urine samples were collected. genus specific oligonucleotide sequences corresponding to the homologous regions  residing in the oxc gene were designed. in order to quantify o. formigenes in clinical specimens, a quantitative-pcr-based assay system utilizing a competitive dna template as an internal standard was developed. urine volume, ph, creatinine, oxalate, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, citrate and uric acid were measured. results: intestinal oxalobacteria were detected in 45.6% (n=47) of calcium oxalate stone patients by pcr. in stone formers who tested negative for oxalobacteria, the average urinary oxalate level was 0.36 mmol/day, and this compared to 0.29 mmol/day for those patients that tested positive for oxalobacteria (p<0.05). mean colony forming units per gram of stool of all patients was 1.1 x 10(7) (0-4.1 x 10(8)), and the level of 24 hours urine oxalate significantly decreased with increasing level of colony forming units of o. formigenes (r=-0.356, p=0.021). conclusion: our results support the concept that  o. formigenes is important in maintaining oxalate homeostasis and that its absence from the gut may be the risk of calcium oxalate urolithiasis.

TI  == [detection of oxalobacter formigenes in human feces and study of related genes in a new oxalate-degrading bacterium].
AB  == the first objective of the present study was to examine the presence of oxalobacter formigenes (an oxalate-degrading bacterium in the human intestine) according to sex in a large number of japanese. the second objective was to study the presence of three related genes in bifidobacterium breve, which is considered to be a new oxalate-degrading bacterim. fecal samples were collected from 55 male and 37 female healthy volunteers. o. formigenes was detected by a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and a culture-based method. dna was amplified by the pcr method including the site of important base sequences of each gene in order to detect oxc, frc, and oxlt. o. formigenes was present in 80% of 54 male and 62% of 34 female subjects in the pcr-based assay, while it was present in 62% of 40 male and 50% of 24 female subjects in the culture-based assay. the partial base sequences of the three related genes in b. breve were determined. the rna polymerase-binding site in promoters and the rho-independent termination sequence were preserved in oxc and frc. in conclusion, the rate of the presence of o. formigenes was the same as in previous reports. female subjects showed a 15% lower rate than males. b. breve is considered to be an oxalate-degrading bacterium since it was found to have oxalic acid-degrading ability and three genes involved in oxalate degradation.

TI  == stone composition, metabolic profile and the presence of the gut-inhabiting bacterium oxalobacter formigenes as risk factors for renal stone formation.
AB  == objective: to examine stone composition, metabolic evaluation and colonization of oxalobacter formigenes as risk factors for renal stone formation. subjects and methods: eighty patients with renal stones and 70 healthy controls were enrolled  in the study. of the 80 patients, 48 were first-time stone formers (fsf) and 32 were 'recurrent' stone formers (rsf), recurrent indicating 2 or more episodes of  stone formation. stone analysis by x-ray crystallography, 24-hour urine metabolic profile and detection of o. formigenes-specific dna by pcr were performed for each patient. detection of o. formigenes was also performed on 45 and urinary metabolic profile on an additional 25 controls. results: calcium oxalate monohydrate was the major component of stones, hyperoxaluria and hypocitraturia were the most common urinary abnormalities in the 80 patients, 46% of rsf patients had hypercalciuria. urinary abnormalities were far less frequent in the  controls, with the exception of hypocitraturia (40%). of the urinary metabolites, only calcium levels were significantly different (p < 0.05) between fsf (6.50 +/- 4.08 mmol/24 h) and rsf (8.21 +/- 5.26 mmol/24 h) patients. colonization of o. formigenes was higher in controls (62.2%) than in fsf (33.3%) or rsf (28%) patients, it was least in patients with more than 4 episodes (7%) of stone formation. conclusion: the findings indicate that lack of colonization of o. formigenes may be an important risk factor for recurrence of stone formation (calcium oxalate monohydrate).

TI  == diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in patients with secondary hyperoxaluria.
AB  == secondary hyperoxaluria is due either to increased intestinal oxalate absorption  or to excessive dietary oxalate intake. certain intestinal diseases like short bowel syndrome, chronic inflammatory bowel disease or cystic fibrosis and other malabsorption syndromes are known to increase the risk of secondary hyperoxaluria. although the urinary oxalate excretion is usually lower than in primary hyperoxaluria, it may still lead to significant morbidity by recurrent urolithiasis or progressive nephrocalcinosis. a clear distinction between primary and secondary hyperoxalurias is important. as correct classification may be difficult, appropriate diagnostic tools are needed to delineate the metabolic background as a basis for optimal treatment. we developed an individual approach  for the evaluation of patients with suspected secondary hyperoxaluria. first, 24  h urines are examined repeatedly for lithogenic (e.g. calcium, oxalate, uric acid) and stone-inhibitory (e.g. citrate, magnesium) substances, and the patients are asked to fill in a dietary survey form. urinary saturation is calculated using the computer based program equil2, and the bonn-risk-index is determined. the measurement of plasma oxalate and of urinary glycolate helps to distinguish between primary and secondary hyperoxalurias. if secondary hyperoxaluria is suspected, the stool is examined for oxalobacter formigenes, an intestinal oxalate degrading bacterium, as lack or absence may lead to increased intestinal  oxalate absorption. the last diagnostic step is to study the intestinal oxalate absorption using [13c2]oxalate. depending on the results, various therapeutic options are available: 1) a diet low in oxalate, but normal or high in calcium, 2) a high fluid intake (>1.5 l/m2/d), 3) medications to increase the urinary solubility, 4) specific therapeutic measures in patients with malabsorption syndromes, depending on the underlying pathology, and 5) intestinal recolonization of oxalobacter formigenes or the treatment with other oxalate degrading bacteria.

TI  == oxalate-degrading enzymes from oxalobacter formigenes: a novel device coating to  reduce urinary tract biomaterial-related encrustation.
AB  == background and purpose: the long-term placement of biomaterials within the urinary tract is limited by the development of encrustation. in a noninfected urinary environment, encrustation often results from the deposition of calcium oxalate on the biomaterial surface. there is an association between the absence of oxalobacter formigenes, a commensal colonic bacterium capable of degrading oxalate, and calcium oxalate stone formation. this pilot study was designed to evaluate several oxalate-degrading enzymes produced by o. formigenes as a potential biomaterial coating to reduce urinary tract encrustation. materials and methods: circular silicone disks of 6-mm diameter were incubated for 48 hours in  oxalylcoenzyme a decarboxylase (oxc), formyl-coenzyme a transferase (frc), and coenzyme a, while control disks were incubated in distilled water. the adsorption of oxc and frc was assessed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ecl) and atomic force microscopy (afm). coated and uncoated disks (20 of each) were implanted in  the bladders of 40 female new zealand white rabbits. after 30 days, the disks were recovered, and the degree of encrustation on the polymer surface was evaluated utilizing dry weight measurement, calcium atomic absorption spectroscopy (aas), and scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive x-ray analysis (sem/edx). results: both ecl and afm demonstrated coating of the silicone disks with oxc and frc. the mean dry weights of the coated and control disks following explantation were 0.591 +/- 0.438 g and 0.747 +/- 0.428 g, respectively (p = 0.307). the mean weight of calcium on the coated and control disks, as determined by aas, was 154.1 +/- 96.25 mg and 258 +/- 181.35 mg, respectively (p = 0.008). conclusions: the use of oxalate-degrading enzymes from  o. formigenes to coat urinary biomaterials represents a novel paradigm to reduce  biomaterial-related encrustation. coating of silicone with oxalate-degrading enzymes from o. formigenes results in a modest reduction in encrustation with no  apparent toxicity. further studies are warranted.

TI  == the crystal structure of the escherichia coli yfdw gene product reveals a new fold of two interlaced rings identifying a wide family of coa transferases.
AB  == because of its toxicity, oxalate accumulation from amino acid catabolism leads to acute disorders in mammals. gut microflora are therefore pivotal in maintaining a safe intestinal oxalate balance through oxalate degradation. oxalate catabolism was first identified in oxalobacter formigenes, a specialized, strictly anaerobic bacterium. oxalate degradation was found to be performed successively by two enzymes, a formyl-coa transferase (frc) and an oxalate decarboxylase (oxc). these two genes are present in several bacterial genomes including that of escherichia  coli. the frc ortholog in e. coli is yfdw, with which it shares 61% sequence identity. we have expressed the yfdw open reading frame product and solved its crystal structure in the apo-form and in complex with acetyl-coa and with a mixture of acetyl-coa and oxalate. yfdw exhibits a novel and spectacular fold in  which two monomers assemble as interlaced rings, defining the coa binding site at their interface. from the structure of the complex with acetyl-coa and oxalate, we propose a putative formyl/oxalate transfer mechanism involving the conserved catalytic residue asp169. the similarity of yfdw with bacterial orthologs (approximately 60% identity) and paralogs (approximately 20-30% identity) suggests that this new fold and parts of the coa transfer mechanism are likely to be the hallmarks of a wide family of coa transferases.

TI  == formyl-coa transferase encloses the coa binding site at the interface of an interlocked dimer.
AB  == formyl-coa transferase catalyses transfer of coa from formate to oxalate in the first step of oxalate degradation by oxalobacter formigenes, a bacterium present  in the intestinal flora which is implicated in oxalate catabolism in mammals. formyl-coa transferase is a member of a family of coa-transferases for which no structural information is available. we now report the three-dimensional structure of o.formigenes formyl-coa transferase, which reveals a novel fold and  a very striking assembly of the homodimer. the subunit is composed of a large and a small domain where residues from both the n- and c-termini of the subunit are part of the large domain. the linkers between the domains give the subunit a circular shape with a hole in the middle. the enzyme monomers are tightly interacting and are interlocked. this fold requires drastic rearrangement of approximately 75 residues at the c-terminus for formation of the dimer. the structure of a complex of formyl-coa transferase with coa is also reported and sets the scene for a mechanistic understanding of enzymes of this family of coa-transferases.

TI  == the association of nephrolithiasis with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == background: there is a growing body of evidence regarding the association between cystic fibrosis (cf) and nephrolithiasis and the role that oxalobacter formigenes may have in that association. methods: we performed a medline search of "cystic fibrosis and nephrolithiasis" and "oxalobacter formigenes." epidemiological and experimental evidence and possible mechanisms explaining the association were critically reviewed. results: of patients with cf, 3.0% to 6.3% are affected with nephrolithiasis, a percentage greater than that of age-matched controls without cf, in whom the rate is 1% to 2%. studies have suggested possible mechanisms for  the association, including hyperuricosuria, hyperoxaluria, primary defects in calcium handling caused by mutation of the cf transmembrane regulator (cftr), hypocitraturia, and lack of colonization with o formigenes, an enteric oxalate-degrading bacterium. the absence of colonization could be related to frequent courses of antibiotics. conclusion: although the incidence of stones in  patients with cf may be increased compared with controls without cf, many possible mechanisms are implicated. the relative contributions of these mechanisms remain uncertain. future directions may include specific identification of lithogenic risks and therapy aimed at stone prevention in this  population.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of fecal oxalobacter formigenes in healthy adults living in seoul, korea.
AB  == background and purpose: oxalobacter formigenes is a member of the intestinal flora that degrades oxalate. this bacterium maintains an important symbiotic relation with its hosts by regulating oxalic acid absorption in the intestine as  well as oxalic acid concentrations in plasma. we tried to define the prevalence of fecal o. formigenes positivity in healthy adults. materials and methods: whole-bacterial dna was isolated directly from fresh stool samples obtained from  233 healthy adults known to be free of urolithiasis. genus-specific oligonucleotide sequences corresponding to homologous regions residing in the oxc gene that encodes oxalyl-coenzyme a decarboxylase were designed. a pcr-based assay was done on the stool samples. results: a pcr product of 416 bp encoding the oxc gene was detected in 197 of the 233 stool samples (76.8%). adjusted to the seoul population census 1995, the calibrated fecal o. formigenes-positive rate was estimated to be 76.7%: 79.2% in men and 74.2% in women, with no significance difference according to age or sex. conclusion: these results suggest that o. formigenes inhabits the intestine of three fourths of the normal  korean populations. these data provide a base for further studies to uncover the  relation between o. formigenes and urolithiasis.

TI  == intestinal oxalobacter formigenes colonization in calcium oxalate stone formers and its relation to urinary oxalate.
AB  == background and purpose: oxalobacter formigenes is an anaerobic commensal colonic  bacterium capable of degrading oxalate through the enzyme oxalyl-coa decarboxylase. it has been theorized that individuals who lack this bacterium have higher intestinal oxalate absorption, leading to a higher urinary oxalate concentration and an increased risk of calcium oxalate urolithiasis. we performed a prospective, controlled study to evaluate o. formigenes colonization in calcium oxalate stone formers and to correlate colonization with urinary oxalate and other standard urinary stone risk factors. patients and methods: thirty-five first-time calcium oxalate stone formers were compared with 10 control subjects having no history of urolithiasis and a normal renal ultrasound scan. all subjects underwent standard metabolic testing by submitting serum and 24-hour urine specimens. in addition, all subjects submitted stool samples for culture and detection of o. formigenes by xentr(ix) o. formigenes monitor. results: intestinal oxalobacter was detected in only 26% of the stone formers compared with 60% of the controls (p < 0.05). overall, the average urinary oxalate excretion by the two groups was similar (38.6 mg/day v 40.8 mg/day). among stone  formers, however, there were statistically higher urinary oxalate concentrations  in o. formigenes-negative patients compared with those testing positive (41.7 mg/day v 29.4 mg/day) (p = 0.03). furthermore, all 10 stone formers with hyperoxaluria (>44 mg/day) tested negative for o. formigenes (p < 0.05). conclusions: calcium oxalate stone formers have a low rate of colonization with o. formigenes. among stone formers, absence of intestinal oxalobacter correlates  with higher urinary oxalate concentration and an increased risk of hyperoxaluria. introduction of the oxalobacter bacterium or an analog of its enzyme oxalyl-coa decarboxylase into the intestinal tract may be a treatment for calcium oxalate stone disease.

TI  == probiotics and the urologist.
AB  == emerging from the stigma of once being referred to as "snake oil", excellent scientific and clinical evidence now exists to indicate that probiotics do indeed have a role to play in medicine. the proper definition of probiotics is important "live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health  benefit on the host", for several reasons. it rules out so-called probiotics that have no clinically proven, peer-reviewed data, and it states the need to have viable bacteria present, unlike these pseudo products which are often wrongly labeled, poorly manufactured, with low or no viability at time of use. guidelines, prepared by the united nations and world health organization are now  available to guide physicians and consumers as to the types of strains with documented benefits. in urology, the most studied strains are lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum b-54 and rc-14. their use daily in oral form, or  once to three times weekly as a vaginal suppository, have been shown to reduce the urogenital pathogen load and the risk of urinary tract and vaginal infections. organisms such as oxalobacter formigenes, still in the r&d phase, offer great potential to reduce kidney stone formation via oxalate degradation in the intestine. some studies using l. casei shirota suggest a possible effect against bladder cancer, while studies using l. plantarum 299 show significantly reduced infection rates in patients undergoing major surgical procedures. in short, specific probiotic strains hold much promise for use in the urology setting.

TI  == medical management of stone disease.
AB  == purpose of review: dietary manipulation still remains one of the most important strategies for therapy. a growing body of evidence, however, suggests that severe calcium restriction is inappropriate in patients with recurrent nephrolithiasis.  dietary recommendations based on recent evidence and the role of bacteria in the  pathogenesis of calcium nephrolithiasis are discussed. recent findings: new evidence strongly supports the role of oxalate, salt and animal protein dietary restrictions in the prevention of calcium stone recurrence. moderate calcium restriction is only effective in absorptive hypercalciuria. calcium restriction is not effective in other etiologies of calcium stones and its implementation can lead to bone demineralization. new evidence has implicated the lack of intestinal bacteria to be responsible for the degradation of dietary oxalate, with its higher absorption resulting in an increased risk of calcium oxalate stone formation. the role of oxalobacter formigenes is herein discussed. summary: metabolic abnormalities responsible for stone recurrence are currently identified in 97% of evaluated patients and remission rates of medical prophylaxis in calcium stone formers are approaching 80%. urinary calcium excretion in most renal stone formers is more dependent on the dietary acid load than on the dietary calcium intake itself. reducing the acid-ash content of the diet has an impact on decreasing stone recurrence, while preventing bone loss. new evidence associates the decolonization of oxalate degrading intestinal flora with a higher risk of calcium oxalate stone formation, possibly opening the door for biological manipulation as a novel approach for the prevention of urinary stone formation.

TI  == infections and urinary stone disease.
AB  == the relationship between urinary infections and stone formation has been recognized since antiquity and it has been over a century since bacterial degradation of urea was postulated to cause struvite stones. specific therapy for urease-producing bacteria, such as urease-inhibitors and antibiotics, has allowed for treatment for this subset of urinary stones. future directions for research include development of novel urease-inhibitors and chemicals to enhance the protective glycosaminoglycan layer. an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of calcium-based stones has led to the discovery of potential roles for nanobacteria and oxalobacter formingenes. methods of altering intestinal regulation of oxalate by reintroduction of lactic acid bacteria may significantly impact the treatment of calcium oxalate stones. the use of catheters, both urethral and ureteral, is common in the urinary tract and is associated with significant morbidity, primarily from associated infections. catheters to prevent bacterial colonization and formation of biofilms have been created using various  coatings, including ciprofloxacin, hydrogel, and silver. use of these types of catheters may minimize infections and encrustation inherent with their placement  in the urinary tract.

TI  == oxalobacter formigenes and its potential role in human health.
AB  == oxalate degradation by the anaerobic bacterium oxalobacter formigenes is important for human health, helping to prevent hyperoxaluria and disorders such as the development of kidney stones. oxalate-degrading activity cannot be detected in the gut flora of some individuals, possibly because oxalobacter is susceptible to commonly used antimicrobials. here, clarithromycin, doxycycline, and some other antibiotics inhibited oxalate degradation by two human strains of  o. formigenes. these strains varied in their response to gut environmental factors, including exposure to gastric acidity and bile salts. o. formigenes strains established oxalate breakdown in fermentors which were preinoculated with fecal bacteria from individuals lacking oxalate-degrading activity. reducing the  concentration of oxalate in the medium reduced the numbers of o. formigenes bacteria. oxalate degradation was established and maintained at dilution rates comparable to colonic transit times in healthy individuals. a single oral ingestion of o. formigenes by adult volunteers was, for the first time, shown to  result in (i) reduced urinary oxalate excretion following administration of an oxalate load, (ii) the recovery of oxalate-degrading activity in feces, and (iii) prolonged retention of colonization.

TI  == three-dimensional structure of a bacterial oxalate transporter.
AB  == the major facilitator superfamily (mfs) represents one of the largest classes of  evolutionarily related membrane transporter proteins. here we present the three-dimensional structure at 6.5 a resolution of a bacterial member of this superfamily, oxlt. the structure, derived from an electron crystallographic analysis of two-dimensional crystals, reveals that the 12 helices in the oxlt molecule are arranged around a central cavity, which is widest at the center of the membrane. the helices divide naturally into three groups: a peripheral set comprising helices 3, 6, 9 and 12; a second set comprising helices 2, 5, 8 and 11 that faces the central substrate transport pathway across most of the length of the membrane; and a third set comprising helices 1, 4, 7 and 10 that participate  in the pathway either on the cytoplasmic side (4 and 10) or on the periplasmic side (1 and 7). overall, the architecture of the protein is remarkably symmetric, providing a compelling molecular explanation for the ability of such transporters to carry out bi-directional substrate transport.

TI  == structure/function relationships in oxlt, the oxalate/formate antiporter of oxalobacter formigenes: assignment of transmembrane helix 2 to the translocation  pathway.
AB  == we constructed a single cysteine panel encompassing transmembrane helix two (tm2) of oxlt, the oxalate/formate antiporter of oxalobacter formigenes. among the 21 positions targeted, cysteine substitution identified one (phenylalanine 59) as essential to oxlt expression and three (glutamine 56, glutamine 66, and serine 69) as potentially critical to oxlt function. by probing membranes with a bulky hydrophilic probe (oregon green maleimide) we also located a central inaccessible core of at least eight residues in length, extending from leucine 61 to glycine 68. functional assays based on reconstitution of crude detergent extracts showed  that of single cysteine mutants within the tm2 core only the q63c variant was substantially (> or =95%) inhibited by thiol-specific agents (carboxyethyl methanethiosulfonate and ethylsulfonate methanethiosulfonate). subsequent analytical work using the purified q63c protein showed that inhibition by ethylsulfonate methanethiosulfonate was blocked by substrate and that the concentration dependence of such substrate protection occurred with a binding constant of 0.16 mm oxalate, comparable with the michaelis constant observed for  oxalate transport (0.23 mm). these findings lead us to conclude that position 63  lies on the oxlt translocation pathway. our conclusion is strengthened by the finding that position 63, along with most other positions relevant to tm2 function, is found on a helical face that can be cross-linked to the pathway-facing surface of tm11 (fu, d., sarker, r. i., bolton, e., and maloney, p. c.

AB  == objective: to develop a simple and rapid polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method for detecting oxalobacter formigenes (which degrades oxalate in the gut) in fecal specimens from healthy volunteers and patients with urolithiasis, and to determine whether o. formigenes can be detected in frozen or fresh fecal samples. materials and methods: whole bacterial dna was isolated directly from fresh and frozen fecal samples obtained from 30 healthy volunteers free from urolithiasis and from fresh fecal samples obtained from 38 patients with urolithiasis. genus-specific oligonucleotide sequences were designed, corresponding to homologous regions residing in the oxc gene that encodes for oxalyl-coenzyme a decarboxylase. a pcr-based assay was used on both fresh and frozen fecal samples, and the nucleotide sequences analysed to confirm oxc. results: a pcr product of 416 bp encoding the oxc gene was detected in 23 (77%) of 30 healthy volunteers free from urolithiasis and in 14 (37%) of 38 patients with urolithiasis. in healthy volunteers, the results of pcr for the fresh and the frozen samples were  identical in each subject. the nucleotide sequence analysis showed that the sequence of the amplified product was compatible with that of oxc. conclusion: o. formigenes can be identified easily and efficiently using this pcr-based detection system. the colonization rate of o. formigenes in patients with urolithiasis was significantly lower than that in healthy volunteers known to be  free from urolithiasis. furthermore, as the pcr-based assay results in the frozen fecal samples were identical to those from fresh samples in each subject, immediate processing of fecal samples may not be necessary to detect o. formigenes in the clinical setting.

TI  == urinary oxalate excretion in female calcium oxalate stone formers with and without a history of recurrent urinary tract infections.
AB  == therapy with antibiotics in recurrent urinary tract infections may destroy colonies of oxalobacter formigenes in the intestinal tract. a lack of oxalate degradation caused by the absence of this bacterium is suggested to contribute to the hyperabsorption of dietary oxalate and to the increase in urinary oxalate excretion. the present study was performed to evaluate the effect of recurrent urinary tract infections and subsequent changes induced in the urinary excretion  profile in female calcium oxalate stone formers. serum biochemical profiles, 24-h urinary parameters, and the personal characteristics of 57 female calcium oxalate stone patients with recurrent urinary tract infections (ruti) were compared with  78 female calcium oxalate stone patients without a history of urinary tract infection. all subjects were recruited during the same period. in female patients with ruti, urinary oxalate excretion was significantly higher (0.374 mmol/day) than in females without urinary tract infection (0.308 mmol/day) (p < 0.05). moreover, the mean 24-h ph value and urinary sodium excretion were significantly  higher in women with ruti than in women without a history of urinary tract infection. the significantly higher urinary oxalate excretion in female calcium oxalate stone formers with recurrent urinary tract infections may be associated with the application of antibiotics and a subsequent temporary or permanent decolonization of oxalobacter formigenes.

TI  == involvement of coenzyme a esters and two new enzymes, an enoyl-coa hydratase and  a coa-transferase, in the hydration of crotonobetaine to l-carnitine by escherichia coli.
AB  == two proteins (caib and caid) were found to catalyze the reversible biotransformation of crotonobetaine to l-carnitine in escherichia coli in the presence of a cosubstrate (e.g., gamma-butyrobetainyl-coa or crotonobetainyl-coa). caib (45 kda) and caid (27 kda) were purified in two steps  to electrophoretic homogeneity from overexpression strains. caib was identified as crotonobetainyl-coa:carnitine coa-transferase by maldi-tof mass spectrometry and enzymatic assays. the enzyme exhibits high cosubstrate specificity to coa derivatives of trimethylammonium compounds. in particular, the n-terminus of caib shows significant identity with other coa-transferases (e.g., flda from clostridium sporogenes, frc from oxalobacter formigenes, and bbse from thauera aromatica) and coa-hydrolases (e.g., baif from eubacterium sp.). caid was shown to be a crotonobetainyl-coa hydratase using maldi-tof mass spectrometry and enzymatic assays. besides crotonobetainyl-coa caid is also able to hydrate crotonyl-coa with a significantly lower vmax (factor of 10(3)) but not crotonobetaine. the substrate specificity of caid and its homology to the crotonase confirm this enzyme as a new member of the crotonase superfamily. concluding these results, it was verified that hydration of crotonobetaine to l-carnitine proceeds at the coa level in two steps: the caid catalyzed hydration  of crotonobetainyl-coa to l-carnitinyl-coa, followed by a coa transfer from l-carnitinyl-coa to crotonobetaine, catalyzed by caib. when gamma-butyrobetainyl-coa was used as a cosubstrate (coa donor), the first reaction is the coa transfer. the optimal ratios of caib and caid during this hydration reaction, determined to be 4:1 when crotonobetainyl-coa was used as cosubstrate and 5:1 when gamma-butyrobetainyl-coa was used as cosubstrate, are different from that found for in vivo conditions (1:3).

TI  == rapid reversal of hyperoxaluria in a rat model after probiotic administration of  oxalobacter formigenes.
AB  == purpose: the gut inhabiting bacterium oxalobacter formigenes may be a negative risk factor in recurrent calcium oxalate kidney stone disease that apparently maintains oxalic acid homeostasis in its host via the degradation of dietary oxalate. the possibility of using this bacterium as probiotic treatment to reduce urinary oxalate was investigated in a rat model. materials and methods: male sprague-dawley rats were placed on a diet supplemented with ammonium oxalate to induce a state of severe hyperoxaluria. subgroups of these rats received an esophageal gavage of 1 x 10(3), 10(5), 10(7) or 10(9) o. formigenes per feeding for a 2-week period. each rat was followed for general health and changes in urinary oxalate. results: rats with chronic hyperoxaluria resulting from high dietary oxalate that were treated with o. formigenes showed decreased urinary oxalate within 2 days of initiating probiotic supplementation. the amount of the  decrease in a 2-week period proved directly proportional to the dose of bacteria. urinary oxalate in rats receiving higher amounts of o. formigenes returned to almost normal. throughout the study the rats remained healthy with no signs of toxicity, antibody development or a histopathological condition. conclusions: probiotic treatment of hyperoxaluric rats with o. formigenes may significantly and rapidly reduce the level of oxalate in the urine. this probiotic treatment appears to be safe and well tolerated. the approach may be feasible for treating  calcium oxalate kidney stone disease.

TI  == reduction of oxaluria after an oral course of lactic acid bacteria at high concentration.
AB  == background: hyperoxaluria is a major risk factor for renal stones, and in most cases, it appears to be sustained by increased dietary load or increased intestinal absorption. previous studies have shown that components of the endogenous digestive microflora, in particular oxalobacter formigenes, utilize oxalate in the gut, thus limiting its absorption. we tested the hypothesis of whether oxaluria can be reduced by means of reducing intestinal absorption through feeding a mixture of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. methods: six patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis and mild hyperoxaluria (>40 mg/24 h) received daily a mixture containing 8 x 10(11) freeze-dried lactic acid  bacteria (l. acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. brevis, s. thermophilus, b. infantis)  for four weeks. the 24-hour urinary excretion of oxalate was determined at the end of the study period and then one month after ending the treatment. the ability of bacteria to degrade oxalate and grow in oxalate-containing media, and  the gene expression of ox1t, an enzyme that catalyzes the transmembrane exchange  of oxalate, also were investigated. results: the treatment resulted in a great reduction of the 24-hour excretion of oxalate in all six patients enrolled. mean  levels +/- sd were 33.5 +/- 15.9 mg/24 h at the end of the study period and 28.3  +/- 14.6 mg/24 h one month after treatment was interrupted compared with baseline values of 55.5 +/- 19.6 mg/24 h (p < 0.05). the treatment was associated with a strong reduction of the fecal excretion of oxalate in the two patients tested. two bacterial strains among those used for the treatment (l. acidophilus and s. thermophilus) proved in vitro to degrade oxalate effectively, but their growth was somewhat inhibited by oxalate. one strain (b. infantis) showed a quite good degrading activity and grew rapidly in the oxalate-containing medium. l. plantarum and l. brevis showed a modest ability to degrade oxalate even though they grew significantly in oxalate-containing medium. no strain expressed the ox1t gene. conclusions: the urinary excretion of oxalate, a major risk factor for renal stone formation and growth in patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis, can be greatly reduced with treatment using a high concentration of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. we postulate that the biological manipulation  of the endogenous digestive microflora can be a novel approach for the prevention of urinary stone formation.

TI  == projection structure and molecular architecture of oxlt, a bacterial membrane transporter.
AB  == the major facilitator superfamily (mfs) represents the largest collection of evolutionarily related members within the class of membrane 'carrier' proteins. oxlt, a representative example of the mfs, is an oxalate-transporting membrane protein in oxalobacter formigenes. from an electron crystallographic analysis of  two-dimensional crystals of oxlt, we have determined the projection structure of  this membrane transporter. the projection map at 6 a resolution indicates the presence of 12 transmembrane helices in each monomer of oxlt, with one set of six helices related to the other set by an approximate internal two-fold axis. the projection map reveals the existence of a central cavity, which we propose to be  part of the pathway of oxalate transport. by combining information from the projection map with related biochemical data, we present probable models for the  architectural arrangement of transmembrane helices in this protein superfamily.

TI  == helix proximity in oxlt, the oalate:formate antiporter of oxalobacter formigenes. cross-linking between tm2 and tm11.
AB  == experiments were designed to evaluate the proximity of transmembrane helices two  (tm2) and eleven (tm11) in the tertiary structure of oxlt, the oxalate:formate exchange transporter of oxalobacter formigenes. a tandem duplication of the factor xa protease cleavage site (iegriegr) was inserted into the central cytoplasmic loop of an oxlt cysteine-less derivative in which an endogenous cleavage site had been eliminated by mutagenesis (r248q). using this host, double cysteine derivatives were constructed so as to pair one of seventeen positions in tm2 with one of four positions in tm11. following treatment of membrane vesicles  with cu(ii)(1,10-phenanthroline)(3), molecular iodine, or n,n'-o-phenylenedimaleimide, samples were exposed to factor xa, and disulfide bond formation was assessed after sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by staining with antibody directed against the oxlt c terminus. in the absence of disulfide bond formation, exposure to factor xa revealed the expected c-terminal  22-kda fragment, a result unaffected by the presence of reductant. by contrast, after disulfide formation, oxlt mobility remained at 35 kda, and appearance of the 22-kda fragment required addition of 200 mm dithiothreitol prior to electrophoresis. the four tm11 positions chosen for cysteine substitution lie on  a helical face known to interact with substrate. similarly, tm2 positions supporting disulfide trapping were also confined to a single helical face. we conclude that tm2 and tm11 are in close juxtaposition to one another in the tertiary structure of oxlt.

TI  == topology of oxlt, the oxalate transporter of oxalobacter formigenes, determined by site-directed fluorescence labeling.
AB  == the topology of oxlt, the oxalate:formate exchange protein of oxalobacter formigenes, was established by site-directed fluorescence labeling, a simple strategy that generates topological information in the context of the intact protein. accessibility of cysteine to the fluorescent thiol-directed probe oregon green maleimide (ogm) was examined for a panel of 34 single-cysteine variants, each generated in a his(9)-tagged cysteine-less host. the reaction with ogm was readily scored by examining the fluorescence profile after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of material purified by ni2+ linked affinity chromatography. a position was assigned an external location if its single-cysteine derivative reacted with ogm added to intact cells; a position was designated internal if ogm labeling required cell lysis. we also showed that labeling of external, but not internal, positions was blocked by prior exposure of cells to the impermeable and nonfluorescent thiol-specific agent ethyltrimethylammonium methanethiosulfonate. of the 34 positions examined in this way, 29 were assigned unambiguously to either an internal or external location; 5 positions could not be assigned, since the target cysteine failed to react with ogm. there was no evidence of false-positive assignment. our findings document a  simple and rapid method for establishing the topology of a membrane protein and show that oxlt has 12 transmembrane segments, confirming inferences from hydropathy analysis.

TI  == structure/function relationships in oxlt, the oxalate-formate transporter of oxalobacter formigenes. assignment of transmembrane helix 11 to the translocation pathway.
AB  == oxlt, the oxalate:formate antiporter of oxalobacter formigenes, has a lone charged residue, lysine 355 (lys-355), at the center of transmembrane helix 11 (tm11). because lys-355 is the only charged residue in the hydrophobic sector, we tested the hypothesis that lysine 355 contributes to the binding site for the anionic substrate, oxalate. this idea was supported by mutational analysis, which showed that of five variants studied (lys-355 --> cys, gly, gln, arg, or thr), residual function was found for only the k355r derivative, in which catalytic efficiency had fallen 2,600-fold. further insight came from a study of tm11 single-cysteine mutants, using the impermeant, thiol-specific reagents, carboxyethyl methanethiosulfonate and ethyltrimethylammonium methanethiosulfonate. of the five reactive positions identified in tm11, four were at the cytoplasmic or periplasmic ends of tm11 (s344c and a345c, and g366c and a370c, respectively), whereas the fifth was at the center of the helix (s359c). added study with carboxyethyl methanethiosulfonate and ethylsulfonate methylthiosulfonate showed that the attack on s359c could be blocked by the presence of the substrate, oxalate, and that protection could be predicted quantitatively by a kinetic model in which s359c is accessible only in the unliganded form of oxlt. parallel study showed that the proteoliposomes used in such work contained oxlt of right side-out and inside-out orientations in about equal amounts. accordingly, full inhibition of s359c by the impermeable methanethiosulfonate-linked probes must reflect an approach from both the cytosolic and periplasmic surfaces of the protein. this, coupled with the finding of substrate protection, leads us to conclude that s359c lies on the translocation pathway through oxlt. since position 359 and 355 lie on the same helical face, we suggest that lys-355 also lies on the translocation pathway, consistent with the idea that the essential nature of lys-355 reflects its role in binding the anionic substrate, oxalate.

TI  == oxalate-degrading enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == an oxalate-degrading enterococcus faecalis was isolated from human stools under anaerobic conditions. the bacteria required a poor nutritional environment and repeated subculturing to maintain their oxalate-degrading ability. the e. faecalis produced 3 proteins (65, 48, and 40 kda) that were not produced by non-oxalate-degrading e. faecalis as examined by sds-page. antibodies against oxalyl-coenzyme a decarboxylase (65 kda) and formyl-coenzyme a transferase (48 kda) obtained from oxalobacter formigenes (an oxalate-degrading anaerobic bacterium in the human intestine) reacted with 2 of the proteins (65 and 48 kda)  from the e. faecalis as examined by western blottings. this is the first report on the isolation of oxalate-degrading facultative anaerobic bacteria from humans.

TI  == urinary oxalate excretion in urolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis.
AB  == aims: to investigate urinary oxalate excretion in children with urolithiasis and/or nephrocalcinosis and to classify hyperoxaluria (hyox). methods: a total of 106 patients were screened. in those in whom the oxalate: creatinine ratio was increased, 24 hour urinary oxalate excretion was measured. liver biopsy and/or genomic analysis was performed if primary hyperoxaluria (ph) was suspected. stool specimens were examined for oxalobacter formigenes in hyox not related to ph type 1 or 2 (ph1, ph2) and in controls. results: a total of 21 patients screened had hyox (>0.5 mmol/24 h per 1.73 m(2)); they were classified into five groups. eleven had ph (ph1 in nine and neither ph1 nor ph2 in two). six had secondary hyox: two enteric and four dietary. four could not be classified. seven patients  had concomitant hypercalciuria. only one of 12 patients was colonised with o formigenes compared to six of 13 controls. conclusions: hyox is an important risk factor for urolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis in children, and can coexist with hypercalciuria. a novel type of ph is proposed. absence of o formigenes may contribute to hyox not related to ph1.

TI  == direct correlation between hyperoxaluria/oxalate stone disease and the absence of the gastrointestinal tract-dwelling bacterium oxalobacter formigenes: possible prevention by gut recolonization or enzyme replacement therapy.
AB  == oxalobacter formigenes is a specific oxalate-degrading, anaerobic bacterium inhabiting the gastrointestinal tracts of vertebrates, including humans. this bacterium maintains an important symbiotic relationship with its host by regulating oxalate homeostasis, primarily by preventing enteric absorption. increased absorption of oxalate can lead to multiple complications associated with hyperoxaluria, especially recurrent calcium oxalate urolithiasis. detection  of o. formigenes in the gastrointestinal tract has attracted attention because the absence of this bacterium appears to be a risk factor for development of hyperoxaluria and/or recurrent calcium oxalate kidney stone disease. in the present study, epidemiologic studies with patients at high risk for calcium oxalate urolithiasis showed a direct correlation between the number of recurrent  kidney stone episodes and the lack of o. formigenes colonization. as expected, the lack of o. formigenes revealed a clear association with prophylactic antibiotic therapy. to confirm the importance of o. formigenes in regulating hyperoxaluria, laboratory rats known to be noncolonized were colonized with live  bacteria or treated with a preparation of oxalate-degrading enzymes derived from  o. formigenes to determine any subsequent increased resistance to high oxalate challenge. rats receiving either bacteria or enzyme replacement therapy excreted  far lower levels of oxalate, did not develop the crystalluria observed with control rats, and resisted the formation of calcium oxalate crystals in their nephrons. these observations, taken together, support the concept that o. formigenes is important in maintaining oxalate homeostasis, that its absence from the gut increases the risk for hyperoxaluria and recurrent kidney stone disease,  and that replacement therapy is an efficient procedure to prevent hyperoxaluria and its complications.

TI  == absence of oxalobacter formigenes in cystic fibrosis patients: a risk factor for  hyperoxaluria.
AB  == background: patients with cystic fibrosis have an increased risk of hyperoxaluria, and of subsequent nephrocalcinosis and calcium-oxalate urolithiasis. oxalate homoeostasis is controlled, in part, by the intestinal bacterium, oxalobacter formigenes. the loss of this bacterium from the gut flora  is associated with an increased risk of hyperoxaluria and calcium-oxalate urolithiasis. we investigated whether the absence of o. formigenes and the presence of hyperoxaluria are correlated in cystic fibrosis (cf) patients. methods: stool specimens from 43 patients with cf aged 3-9 years and from 21 similarly aged healthy volunteers were examined for o. formigenes by culture and  dna analysis. at the same time, 24 h urine samples were collected and analysed for oxalate and other factors that promote or inhibit stone formation. findings:  15 (71%) of 21 healthy volunteers but only seven (16%) of 43 cf patients were colonised with o. formigenes. detection of o. formigenes in six of these seven patients required dna-based identification, suggesting low numbers of colony-forming units, and the cf patient with normal numbers of o. formigenes was the only one of the 43 patients who had not been treated with antibiotics. all seven cf patients colonised with o. formigenes had normal urinary oxalate levels, but 19 (53%) of 36 patients not colonised with o. formigenes were hyperoxaluric,  with the most severe hyperoxaluria occurring in young patients. interpretation: absence of o. formigenes from the intestinal tract of cf patients appears to lead to increased absorption of oxalate, thereby increasing the risk of hyperoxaluria  and its complications (eg, nephrocalcinosis, urolithiasis). prolonged widespread  use of antibiotics, and alterations of the gastrointestinal tract that occur in cf, may induce a permanent decolonisation in cf patients.

AB  == a novel nodule-specific gene, ljnod70, associated with late stages in lotus japonicus nodule development and/or functioning was characterized. the ljnod70 gene is a member of a small family of closely related l. japonicus genes. two major mrna species corresponding to the ljnod70 gene were identified in nodules and shown to be the result of a mechanism resembling alternative splicing. the longer, presumably unspliced, mrna species was shown to contain a single open reading frame (orf), encoding a polytopic hydrophobic protein, ljn70, with a predicted molecular mass of 70 kda. the second, presumably spliced, mrna species  was shown to be less abundant in nodules. the absence of the presumptive 'intron' was found to divide the reading frame into an upstream and a downstream orf encoding the partial n- and c-terminal regions of the ljn70 protein, respectively. the predicted amino acid sequence of nodulin ljn70 revealed structural features characteristic of transport proteins, and was found to share  similarity with the oxalate/formate exchange protein of oxalobacter formigenes. therefore, we postulate that the l. japonicus ljnod70 gene family encodes nodule-specific transport proteins, which may have evolved as a result of exon-intron shuffling.

TI  == structure-function relationships in oxlt, the oxalate/formate transporter of oxalobacter formigenes. topological features of transmembrane helix 11 as visualized by site-directed fluorescent labeling.
AB  == analysis of hydropathy suggests that in oxlt, the oxalate/formate antiporter of oxalobacter formigenes, lysine 355 is within transmembrane helix no. 11. to test  this idea, we used single-cysteine, histidine-tagged oxlt variants to study the organization of a 30-residue segment (residues 344-373) containing this region. topology was examined by probing the a345c and a370c proteins with oregon green maleimide carboxylic acid, an impermeant and fluorescent thiol-reactive agent. examination of purified protein showed that only a370c was fluorescent after treating intact cells with the probe, while both proteins were modified in tests  with isolated membrane ghosts. in addition, labeling of a370c, but not a345c, was blocked when external cysteines were protected with the impermeant and nonfluorescent agent, methanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium. these findings confirm that a345 faces the cytoplasm, while a370c faces the periplasm. a similar study focused on 13 single-cysteine variants positioned throughout the target segment. that work revealed a striking discontinuity in reactivity toward oregon  green maleimide; cysteines within a 10-residue central core (residues 351-360) were not labeled when membranes were probed, but were readily modified after protein denaturation. we suggest this core resides within the lipid bilayer, unavailable to an impermeant reporter. since this region includes position 355, we also suggest that lysine 355 lies within the oxlt hydrophobic sector, where it may facilitate the binding and translocation of the anionic substrates, oxalate and formate.

TI  == evaluating children in the ukraine for colonization with the intestinal bacterium oxalobacter formigenes, using a polymerase chain reaction-based detection system.
AB  == background: oxalobacter formigenes is a recently discovered anaerobic bacterium residing in the gastrointestinal tracts of most vertebrates, including humans. evidence suggests that this bacterium plays an important symbiotic relationship with its hosts by regulating oxalic acid homeostasis. oxalic acid is a ubiquitous toxic by-product of metabolism associated with numerous pathologic conditions, including hyperoxaluia, cardiac myopathy and conductance disorders, kidney stones, and even death. despite the potential importance of o. formigenes in several major health disorders, the difficulty in culturing, isolating, and identifying this fastidious anaerobe has limited research of its disease associations. because o. formigenes must use two unique enzymes to catabolize oxalic acid, this bacterium appeared to be a suitable model for dna-based identification, thereby circumventing the labor-intensive procedures currently used. methods and results: in this study, genus- and group-specific oligonucleotide sequences were designed corresponding to homologous regions residing in the oxc gene that enodes for oxalyl-coenzyme a decarboxylase. a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based amplification of the 5'end of this gene directly from genomic dna isolated from various strains of o. formigenes was used to show that the genus- and group-specific oligonucleotide probes could identify  and subgroup the bacterium. field testing of this pcr-based detection system with 100 fecal cultures collected from children aged 0-12 years demonstrated the ease  and efficacy with which o. formigenes can now be identified. furthermore, these latter data provide a profile for the natural colonization of a human population  with this intestinal bacterium. conclusions: development and use of this pcr-based detection system permit the rapid identification and classification of  the gut-associated bacterium o. formigenes, thereby circumventing the need for the more labor-intensive and lengthy method currently used. the first field test  of this detection system indicates that humans apparently do not become colonized with o. formigenes until they begin crawling about in the environment. furthermore, studies investigating the association between several disorders (eg, kidney stones, irritable bowel syndrome, and hyperoxaluria) and the absence of the bacterium from the gut will now prove far easier.

AB  == oxlt, the oxalate/formate exchange transporter of oxalobacter formigenes, was purified as a histidine-tagged variant, oxlthis, using ni2+-linked affinity chromatography. oxlthis was readily obtained in high purity (>/=95%) and reasonable yield (>/=60%), and showed kinetic and biochemical features characteristic of its parent, oxlt, including an unusually high maximal velocity  (60 micromol/min per mg of protein at 4 degrees c). circular dichroism spectroscopy of purified oxlthis identified the alpha-helix as its dominant secondary structural unit, encompassing 60-70% of oxlthis residues and consistent with a model suggesting 60% of oxlt (oxlthis) residues are involved in the construction of 12 transmembrane alpha-helices (abe, k., ruan, z.-s., and maloney, p. c. (1996) j. biol. chem. 271, 6789-6793). in either octyl glucoside/lipid or dodecylmaltoside/lipid micelles, solubilized oxlthis showed a  striking substrate-induced stabilization of function, and at saturating levels of substrate (1000 x kd) activity recoverable by reconstitution disappeared with a half-life of 7 days at 23 degrees c. measurement of changes of ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of time and substrate concentration showed that maintenance of function was attributable to a substrate-induced stabilization of the alpha-helical ensemble with a kd of 10 microm for the 1:1 binding of oxalate to oxlthis.

TI  == assimilation of oxalate, acetate, and co2 by oxalobacter formigenes.
AB  == oxalobacter formigenes is the only well-documented oxalate-degrading bacterium isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of animals. the production of atp by oxalobacter formigenes is centered around oxalate metabolism and oxalate is required for growth. a small amount of acetate (0.5 mm) is also required. oxalate is decarboxylated to formate plus co2 in nearly equimolar amounts. experiments were conducted to determine which potential carbon sources (oxalate, acetate, formate, co2) were assimilated by oxalobacter formigenes and which metabolic pathways were operative in carbon assimilation. measurements of the specific activities of total cell carbon after growth with different 14c-labeled precursors indicated that at least 54% of the total cell carbon was derived from  oxalate and at least 7% was derived from acetate. carbonate was also assimilated, but formate was not a significant source of cell carbon. labeling patterns in amino acids from cells grown in [14c]oxalate or 14co3 were different; however, in both cases 14c was widely distributed into most cellular amino acids. carbon from [14c]acetate was less widely distributed and detected mainly in those amino acids known to be derived from alpha-ketoglutarate, oxaloacetate, and pyruvate. cell-free extracts contained citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase activities. the labeling observed in amino acids derived from acetate is in agreement with the function of these enzymes in biosynthesis and indicates that the majority of acetate carbon entered into amino acid biosynthesis via well-known pathways.

TI  == generation of a proton motive force by the anaerobic oxalate-degrading bacterium  oxalobacter formigenes.
AB  == the generation of transmembrane ion gradients by oxalobacter formigenes cells metabolizing oxalate was studied. the magnitudes of both the transmembrane electrical potential (delta psi) and the ph gradient (internal alkaline) decreased with increasing external ph; quantitatively, the delta psi was the most important component of the proton motive force. as the extracellular ph of metabolizing cells was increased, intracellular ph increased and remained alkaline relative to the external ph, indicating that o. formigenes possesses a limited capacity to regulate internal ph. the generation of a delta psi by concentrated suspensions of o. formigenes cells was inhibited by the k+ ionophore valinomycin and the protonophore carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone, but not by the na+ ionophore monensin. the h+ atpase inhibitor n,n'-dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide inhibited oxalate catabolism but did not dissipate the delta psi. the results support the concept that energy from oxalate metabolism by o. formigenes is conserved not as a sodium ion gradient but rather, at least partially, as a transmembrane hydrogen ion gradient produced during the  electrogenic exchange of substrate (oxalate) and product (formate) and from internal proton consumption during oxalate decarboxylation.

AB  == oxlt is the oxalate/formate exchange protein that represents the vectorial component of a proton-motive metabolic cycle in oxalobacter formigenes. here we report the cloning and sequencing of oxlt and describe its expression in escherichia coli. the oxlt amino acid sequence specifies a polytopic hydrophobic  protein of 418 residues with a mass of 44,128 daltons. analysis of hydropathy and consideration of the distribution of charged residues suggests an oxlt secondary  structure having 12 transmembrane segments, oriented so that the n and c termini  face the cytoplasm. expression of oxlt in e. coli coincides with appearance of a  capacity to carry out the self-exchange of oxalate and the heterologous, electrogenic exchange of oxalate with formate. the unusually high velocity of oxlt-mediated transport is also preserved in e. coli. we conclude that the essential features of oxlt are retained on its expression in e. coli.

TI  == the relationship of oxalobacter formigenes and calcium oxalate calculi.
AB  == the intestinal oxalobacter formigenes were isolated in 30 cases of urolithaiasis  and in 45 controls. the biologic characters and morphology of the bacteria were also observed. the results showed that the colony counts in urolith group 9 (mean 10(3)/g. faeces) were significantly less than that of controls (mean 10(8)/g. faeces) (p < 0.001). it is believed that the lesser amount of oxalobacter formigenes in urolith was the important factor of the calcium oxalate calculi formation.

TI  == bacterial anion exchange: reductionist and integrative approaches to membrane biology.
AB  == studies of two different bacterial anion exchange proteins (antiporters) led us to conclude that both reductionist and integrative approaches contribute to progress in understanding membrane biology. we have used a reductionist perspective in applying cysteine scanning mutagenesis to probe individual amino acid positions of uhpt (uptake of hexose phosphate transporter), the carrier responsible for transport of glucose 6-phosphate by escherichia coli. this work has established experimental criteria that should allow one to identify and localize the translocation pathway in such membrane proteins. an integrative view is exemplified by work with oxlt (oxalate transporter), the carrier used by an anaerobe oxalobacter formigenes to catalyze the antiport of divalent oxalate and  monovalent formate. the activity of oxlt is functionally coordinated with that of a cytosolic oxalyl decarboxylase; together, these vectorial and scalar activities constitute a metabolic proton pump, allowing o. formigenes to display decarboxylative phosphorylation. the role played by oxlt argues that membrane carriers can assume unanticipated emergent properties when their biochemical functions are properly articulated in relation to other aspects of cell function.

TI  == molecular cloning, dna sequence, and gene expression of the oxalyl-coenzyme a decarboxylase gene, oxc, from the bacterium oxalobacter formigenes.
AB  == oxalic acid, a highly toxic by-product of metabolism, is catabolized by a limited number of bacterial species by an activation-decarboxylation reaction which yields formate and co2. oxc, the gene encoding the oxalic acid-degrading enzyme oxalyl-coenzyme a decarboxylase, was cloned from the bacterium oxalobacter formigenes. the dna sequence revealed a single open reading frame of 1,704 bp capable of encoding a 568-amino-acid protein with a molecular weight of 60,691. the identification of a presumed promoter region and a rho-independent termination sequence indicates that this gene is not part of a polycistronic operon. a pcr fragment encoding the open reading frame, when overexpressed in escherichia coli, produced a product which cross-reacted antigenically with native enzyme on western blots (immunoblots), appeared to form homodimers spontaneously, and exhibited enzymatic activity similar to that of the purified native enzyme.

TI  == identification, purification, and reconstitution of oxlt, the oxalate: formate antiport protein of oxalobacter formigenes.
AB  == we had proposed earlier that the anaerobe oxalobacter formigenes sustains a proton-motive force by exploiting a secondary carrier rather than a primary proton pump. in this view, a carrier protein would catalyze the exchange of extracellular oxalate, a divalent anion, and intracellular formate, the monovalent product of oxalate decarboxylation. such an electrogenic exchange develops an internally negative membrane potential, and since the decarboxylation reaction consumes an internal proton, the combined activity of the carrier and the soluble decarboxylase would constitute an "indirect" proton pump with a stoichiometry of 1h+ per turnover. this model is now verified by identification and purification of oxlt, the protein responsible for the anion exchange reaction. membranes of o. formigenes were solubilized at ph 7 with 1.25% octyl glucoside in 20 mm 3-(n-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid/k, in the presence of 0.4% escherichia coli phospholipids and with 20% glucerol present as the osmolyte stabilant. rapid methods for reconstitution were developed to monitor the distribution of oxlt during biochemical fractionation, allowing its purification  by sequential anion and cation exchange chromatography. oxlt proved to be a single hydrophobic polypeptide, of 38 kda mobility during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with a turnover number estimated as at least 1000/s. the properties of oxlt point to an indirect proton pump as the mechanism by which a proton-motive force arises in o. formigenes, and one may reasonably argue that indirect proton pumps take part in bacterial events such as acetogenesis, malolactate fermentation, and perhaps methanogenesis.

TI  == measurement of the substrate dissociation constant of a solubilized membrane carrier. substrate stabilization of oxlt, the anion exchange protein of oxalobacter formigenes.
AB  == oxlt, a secondary carrier found in oxalobacter formigenes, mediates the exchange  of divalent oxalate and monovalent formate. because oxlt has an unusually high turnover number (greater than or equal to 1000/s), and because formate, one its substrates, shows high passive membrane permeability as formic acid, it has been  difficult to obtain information on protein-substrate interactions using traditional methods in membrane biology. for this reason, we devised a new way to measure substrate dissociation constants. detergent-solubilized material was exposed to inactivating temperatures in the absence or presence of oxlt substrates, and periodic reconstitution was used to monitor the kinetics of thermal decay. the data were consistent with a simple scheme in which only unliganded oxlt was temperature-sensitive; this premise, along with the assumption of equilibrium between liganded and unliganded species, allowed calculation of substrate dissociation constants for oxalate (18 +/- 3 microm), malonate (1.2 +/- 0.2 mm), and formate (3.1 +/- 0.6 mm). further analysis revealed that substrate binding energy contributed at least 3.5 kcal/mol to stabilization of solubilized oxlt. accordingly, we suggest that substrate binding energy is directly involved in driving protein structure reorganization during membrane transport. this new approach to analyzing protein-substrate interactions may have wider application in the study of membrane carriers.

TI  == cloning and expression of the oxalyl-coa decarboxylase gene from the bacterium, oxalobacter formigenes: prospects for gene therapy to control ca-oxalate kidney stone formation.
AB  == evidence suggests that the formation of calcium-oxalate stones in the urine is dependent on the saturation levels of both calcium and oxalate; thus, management  of one or both of these ions in individuals susceptible to urolithiasis appears important. since there are no known naturally occurring enzymes in vertebrates capable of degrading oxalate, we have initiated a study to insert a plant-derived oxalate degrading enzyme gene into human cells as a means of lowering plasma and  urinary oxalate concentrations. we present here the cloning of the oxalyl-coa decarboxylase gene from the bacterium oxalobacter formigenes and its subsequent expression in a foreign environment. these results provide the basis for eventual transfer of an oxalate decarboxylase gene into mammalian cells.

TI  == purification and characterization of formyl-coenzyme a transferase from oxalobacter formigenes.
AB  == formyl-coenzyme a (formyl-coa) transferase was purified from oxalobacter formigenes by high-pressure liquid chromatography with hydrophobic interaction chromatography and by deae anion-exchange chromatography. the enzyme was a single entity on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel permeation chromatography (mr, 44,000). it had an isoelectric point of 4.7. the enzyme catalyzed the transfer of coa from formyl-coa to either oxalate or succinate. apparent km and vmax values, respectively, were 3.0 mm and 29.6 mumols/min per mg for formyl-coa with an excess of succinate. the maximum specific activity was 2.15 mumols of coa transferred from formyl-coa to oxalate per min per mg of protein.

TI  == oxalate:formate exchange. the basis for energy coupling in oxalobacter.
AB  == in the gram-negative anaerobe, oxalobacter formigenes, the generation of metabolic energy depends on the transport and decarboxylation of oxalate. we have now used assays of reconstitution to study the movements of oxalate and to characterize the exchange of oxalate with formate, its immediate metabolic derivative. membranes of o. formigenes were solubilized with octyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside in the presence of 20% glycerol and escherichia coli phospholipid, and detergent extracts were reconstituted by detergent dilution. [14c]oxalate was taken up by proteoliposomes loaded with unlabeled oxalate, but not by similarly loaded liposomes or by proteoliposomes containing sulfate in place of oxalate. oxalate transport did not depend on the presence of sodium or potassium, nor was it affected by valinomycin (1 microm), nigericin (1 microm), or a proton conductor, carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (5 microm) when potassium was at equal concentration on either side of the membrane. such data suggest the presence of an overall neutral oxalate self-exchange, independent of common cations or anions. kinetic analysis of the reaction in proteoliposomes gave a michaelis constant (kt) for oxalate transport of 0.24 mm and a maximal velocity (vmax) of 99 mumol/min/mg of protein. a direct exchange of oxalate and formate was indicated by the observations that formate inhibited oxalate transport and that delayed addition of formate released [14c]oxalate accumulated during oxalate exchange. moreover, [14c]formate was taken up by oxalate-loaded proteoliposomes (but not liposomes), and this heterologous reaction could be blocked by external oxalate. further studies, using formate-loaded proteoliposomes, suggested that the heterologous exchange was electrogenic. thus, for assays in which n-methylglucamine served as both internal and external cation, formate-loaded particles took up oxalate at a rate of 2.4 mumol/min/mg of protein. when external or internal n-methylglucamine was replaced by potassium in the presence of valinomycin, there was, respectively, a 7-fold stimulation or an 8-fold inhibition of oxalate accumulation, demonstrating that net negative charge moved in parallel with oxalate during the heterologous exchange. the work summarized here suggests the presence of an unusually rapid and electrogenic oxalate2-:formate1- antiport in membranes of o. formigenes. since a proton is consumed during the intracellular decarboxylation that converts oxalate into formate plus co2, antiport of oxalate and formate would play a central role in a biochemical cycle consisting of (a) oxalate influx, (b) oxalate decarboxylation, and (c) formate efflux.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == purification and characterization of oxalyl-coenzyme a decarboxylase from oxalobacter formigenes.
AB  == oxalyl-coenzyme a (oxalyl-coa) decarboxylase was purified from oxalobacter formigenes by high-pressure liquid chromatography with hydrophobic interaction chromatography, deae anion-exchange chromatography, and gel permeation chromatography. the enzyme is made up of four identical subunits (mr, 65,000) to  give the active enzyme (mr, 260,000). the enzyme catalyzed the thiamine ppi-dependent decarboxylation of oxalyl-coa to formate and carbon dioxide. apparent km and vmax values, respectively, were 0.24 mm and 0.25 mumol/min for oxalyl-coa and 1.1 pm and 0.14 mumol/min for thiamine pyrophosphate. the maximum  specific activity was 13.5 microm oxalyl-coa decarboxylated per min per mg of protein.

TI  == intestinal colonization of laboratory rats with oxalobacter formigenes.
AB  == six strains of oxalobacter formigenes (anaerobic oxalate-degrading bacteria) were examined for their ability to colonize the gastrointestinal tracts of adult laboratory rats. these rats did not harbor o. formigenes. strain oxcr6, isolated  from the cecal contents of a laboratory rat that was naturally colonized by oxalate-degrading bacteria, colonized the ceca and colons of adult rats fed a diet that contained 4.5% sodium oxalate. five days after rats were inoculated intragastrically with 10(9) viable cells of strain oxcr6, oxalate degradation rates in cecal and colonic contents increased by 19 and 40 times, respectively. viable counts of strain oxcr6 from these rats averaged 10(8)/g (dry weight) of cecal contents. strain oxcr6 was not detected in the cecal contents of inoculated rats fed diets that contained less than 3.0% sodium oxalate. strains of o. formigenes isolated from the cecal contents of swine, guinea pigs, and wild rats  and from human feces also colonized the ceca of laboratory rats; a ruminal strain failed to colonize the rat cecum.

TI  == microbial degradation of oxalate in the gastrointestinal tracts of rats.
AB  == rates of oxalate degradation by mixed bacterial populations in cecal contents from wild rats ranged from 2.5 to 20.6 mumol/g (dry weight) per h. the oxalate-degrading activity in cecal contents from three strains of laboratory rats (long-evans, wistar, and sprague-dawley) from four commercial breeders was generally lower, ranging from 1.8 to 3.5 mumol/g (dry weight) of cecal contents per h. this activity did not increase when diets were supplemented with oxalate.  when sprague-dawley rats from a fifth commercial breeder were fed an oxalate diet, rates of oxalate degradation in cecal contents increased from 2.0 to 23.1 mumol/g (dry weight) per h. obligately anaerobic, oxalate-degrading bacteria, similar to ruminal strains of oxalobacter formigenes, were isolated from the latter group of laboratory rats and from wild rats. viable counts of these bacteria were as high as 10(8)/g (dry weight) of cecal contents, which was less than 0.1% of the total viable population. this report presents the first evidence for the presence of anaerobic oxalate-degrading bacteria in the cecal contents of rats and represents the first direct measurement of the concentration of these bacteria in the large bowel of monogastric animals. we propose that methods used  for the maintenance of most commercial rat colonies often preclude the intestinal colonization of laboratory rats with anaerobic oxalate-degrading bacteria.

TI  == oxalate degradation by gastrointestinal bacteria from humans.
AB  == anaerobic bacteria that metabolize oxalic acid have only recently been isolated from the rumen and from other gastrointestinal habitats. they constitute a new genus and species, oxalobacter formigenes. this report presents the first comparison of cultural counts of these organisms from human feces and indicates that numbers as high as 10(7)/g may be present in feces from normal humans. rates of oxalate degradation by mixed bacterial populations in feces from seven normal  humans ranged from 0.1 to 4.8 mumol/(g x h). with fecal samples from eight patients that had undergone jejunoileal bypass surgery, rates were much lower [0-0.006 mumol/(g x h)]. we propose that oxalic acid degradation by oxalobacter formigenes may influence absorption of oxalate from the intestine and that lower  rates or lack of oxalate degradation in the colons of jejunoileal bypass patients may contribute to the increased absorption of dietary oxalate and the hyperoxaluria commonly associated with such patients.
