TI  - Gemella parahaemolysans sp. nov. and Gemella taiwanensis sp. nov., isolated from  human clinical specimens.
AB  - Four Gram-staining-positive, catalase-negative, coccoid isolates, designated NTUH_1465(T), NTUH_2196, NTUH_4957 and NTUH_5572(T), were isolated from human specimens. The four isolates displayed more than 99.6% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Gemella haemolysans ATCC 10379(T), and 96.7 to 98.6% similarity with Gemella sanguinis ATCC 700632(T), Gemella morbillorum ATCC 27824(T) or Gemella cuniculi CCUG 42726(T). However, phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequences of three housekeeping genes, groEL, rpoB and recA, suggested that the four isolates were distinct from G. haemolysans ATCC 10379(T) and other species. Isolates NTUH_2196, NTUH_4957 and NTUH_5572(T) clustered together and formed a stable monophyletic clade. DNA-DNA hybridization values among strains NTUH_1465(T) and NTUH_5572(T) and their phylogenetically related neighbours were all lower than 49%. The four isolates could be distinguished from G. haemolysans and other species by phenotypic characteristics. Based on the phylogenetic and phenotypic results, two novel species Gemella parahaemolysans sp. nov. (type strain NTUH_1465(T) = BCRC 80365(T) = JCM 18067(T)) and Gemella taiwanensis sp. nov. (type strain NTUH_5572(T) = BCRC 80366(T) = JCM 18066(T)) are proposed.
TI  - Use of groESL as a target for identification of Abiotrophia, Granulicatella, and  Gemella species.
AB  - We determined the groESL sequences of three species of nutritionally variant streptococci (Abiotrophia defectiva, Granulicatella adiacens, and Granulicatella elegans) and three Gemella species (Gemella morbillorum, Gemella haemolysans, and Gemella sanguinis). The nucleotide sequence similarities between the groES and groEL genes of the above genera were 41.7 to 85.9% and 63.7 to 84.3%, respectively. The intraspecies similarities of groESL sequences for the isolates of Abiotrophia and Granulicatella species were 94.4 to 97.8% for groES and 94.0 to 98.2% for groEL. For Ge. morbillorum and Ge. sanguinis, all strains showed the same groESL spacer length (8 bp), and sequence identities within species were >97.8% for groES and >96.1% for groEL. However, higher intraspecies heterogeneity was observed in Ge. haemolysans. Phylogenetic analysis of groEL sequences separated the 6 isolates of Ge. haemolysans into two subgroups. Among these isolates, three isolates with the same groESL spacer region length (45 bp) clustered together but were distant from the ATCC reference strain (with a spacer length of 8 bp). The remaining three isolates, with a spacer length of 50 or 8 bp, clustered together. Although 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis did not provide enough discrimination for the 6 Ge. haemolysans isolates, rpoB gene sequence analysis supported the subgrouping. Based on the obtained groESL sequences, we developed a multiplex PCR that enables simple, rapid, and accurate identification of Abiotrophia, Granulicatella, and Gemella at the genus level. This assay would be helpful for identifying these fastidious and slow-growing organisms in clinical laboratories.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin against clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - We determined the activity of daptomycin, a recently FDA-approved antimicrobial agent, against clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria, including viridans group streptococci (16 Streptococcus mitis species group, 12 S. mutans species group, 9 S. anginosus species group, 8 S. sanguinis species group, 5 S. salivarius species group) from patients with infective endocarditis, 32 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 32 high-level penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, 38 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including 1 linezolid-resistant isolate), and the following unusual Gram-positive bacteria: 3 Listeria monocytogenes, 4 Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, 9 Corynebacterium species, 10 Abiotrophia/Granulicatella species, 2 Rothia (Stomatococcus) mucilaginosus, and 4 Gemella morbillorum. Daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)(90) values for the viridans group streptococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, and Enterococcus species were 0.5, 0.5, < or =0.125, and 4 microg/ml, respectively. The daptomycin MIC range for the unusual Gram-positive bacteria was < or =0.125-2 microg/ml. We conclude that daptomycin has in vitro activity against viridans group streptococci associated with endocarditis as well as against several types of unusual Gram-positive bacteria that can cause endocarditis.
TI  - Characterization of a Gemella-like organism isolated from an abscess of a rabbit: description of Gemella cunicula sp. nov.
AB  - An unknown Gram-positive, catalase-negative, ovoid-shaped bacterium isolated from the submandibular abscess of a rabbit was subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic analysis. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated the unknown coccus represents a new subline within the genus Gemella. The unknown isolate was readily distinguished from other recognized members of the genus Gemella, namely Gemella haemolysans, Gemella bergeri, Gemella morbillorum, Gemella palaticanis and Gemella sanguinis, by biochemical tests and electrophoretic analysis of whole-cell proteins. Based on both phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium is classified in the genus Gemella as Gemella cuniculi sp. nov. The type strain is CCUG 42726T.
TI  - Immunoglobulin A1 protease activity in Gemella haemolysans.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the occurrence and nature of immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) protease activity in members of the genus Gemella and related taxa. Among a total of 22 Gemella strains belonging to the four species Gemella haemolysans, Gemella morbillorum, Gemella sanguinis, and Gemella bergeriae and four reference strains of the species Helcococcus kunzii, Facklamia hominis, and Globicatella sanguinis, IgA1 protease activity was an exclusive character of all nine isolates of G. haemolysans. The IgA1 protease of G. haemolysans appears to be a metallo-type IgA1 protease that cleaves the Pro(227)-Thr(228) peptide bond in the hinge region of the alpha1 chain like that of several Streptococcus species. Phenotypic characterization of the isolates demonstrates that screening for IgA1 protease activity provides a valuable means for species differentiation in this group of bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of a Gemella-like organism from the oral cavity of a dog: description of Gemella palaticanis sp. nov.
AB  - A hitherto unknown Gram-positive, catalase-negative, facultatively anaerobic coccus isolated from a vesicle on the gum of a dog was characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies demonstrated that the isolate represents a new subline within the genus Gemella. The unknown bacterium was readily distinguished from all currently described members of this genus, Gemella haemolysans, Gemella bergeri, Gemella morbillorum and Gemella sanguinis, by biochemical tests and electrophoretic analysis of whole-cell proteins. On the basis of phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium be classified as Gemella palaticanis sp. nov. The type strain of Gemella palaticanis is CCUG 39489T.
TI  - Description of Gemella sanguinis sp. nov., isolated from human clinical specimens.
AB  - Six strains of a hitherto undescribed gram-positive, catalase-negative, facultatively anaerobic coccus isolated from human sources were characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies demonstrated that the unknown strains were genealogically identical and constitute a new subline within the genus Gemella. The unknown bacterium was readily distinguished from Gemella haemolysans, Gemella bergeriae, and Gemella morbillorum by biochemical tests and electrophoretic analysis of whole-cell proteins. Based on phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium be classified as Gemella sanguinis sp. nov. The type strain is CCUG 37820(T).
