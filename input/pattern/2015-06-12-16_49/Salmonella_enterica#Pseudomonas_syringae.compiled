TI  - tRNA modification enzymes GidA and MnmE: potential role in virulence of bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Transfer RNA (tRNA) is an RNA molecule that carries amino acids to the ribosomes  for protein synthesis. These tRNAs function at the peptidyl (P) and aminoacyl (A) binding sites of the ribosome during translation, with each codon being recognized by a specific tRNA. Due to this specificity, tRNA modification is essential for translational efficiency. Many enzymes have been implicated in the modification of bacterial tRNAs, and these enzymes may complex with one another or interact individually with the tRNA. Approximately, 100 tRNA modification enzymes have been identified with glucose-inhibited division (GidA) protein and MnmE being two of the enzymes studied. In Escherichia coli and Salmonella, GidA and MnmE bind together to form a functional complex responsible for the proper biosynthesis of 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine (mnm(5)s(2)U34) of tRNAs. Studies have implicated this pathway in a major pathogenic regulatory mechanism as deletion of gidA and/or mnmE has attenuated several bacterial pathogens like Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Pseudomonas syringae, Aeromonas hydrophila, and many others. In this review, we summarize the potential role of the GidA/MnmE tRNA modification pathway in bacterial virulence, interactions with the host, and potential therapeutic strategies resulting from a greater understanding of this regulatory mechanism.
TI  - UV light inactivation of human and plant pathogens in unfiltered surface irrigation water.
AB  - Fruit and vegetable growers continually battle plant diseases and food safety concerns. Surface water is commonly used in the production of fruits and vegetables and can harbor both human- and plant-pathogenic microorganisms that can contaminate crops when used for irrigation or other agricultural purposes. Treatment methods for surface water are currently limited, and there is a need for suitable treatment options. A liquid-processing unit that uses UV light for the decontamination of turbid juices was analyzed for its efficacy in the treatment of surface waters contaminated with bacterial or oomycete pathogens, i.e., Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Listeria monocytogenes, Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, and Phytophthora capsici. Five-strain cocktails of each pathogen, containing approximately 10(8) or 10(9) CFU/liter for bacteria or 10(4) or 10(5) zoospores/liter for Ph. capsici, were inoculated into aliquots of two turbid surface water irrigation sources and processed with the UV unit. Pathogens were enumerated before and after treatment. In general, as the turbidity of the water source increased, the effectiveness of the UV treatment decreased, but in all cases, 99.9% or higher inactivation was achieved. Log reductions ranged from 10.0 to 6.1 and from 5.0 to 4.2 for bacterial pathogens and Ph. capsici, respectively.
TI  - Host lipidation: a mechanism for spatial regulation of Legionella effectors.
AB  - Bacterial pathogens have evolved the capacity to translocate proteins into the cytosol of infected cells to manipulate host processes. How do pathogens regulate spatially these bacterial effector proteins once they are released into the host cell? One mechanism, which is used by Legionella and other bacterial pathogens, is to encode effectors that mimic the substrates of eukaryotic lipid transferases. In this review we discuss three membrane-targeting pathways in eukaryotes that are exploited by Legionella and other pathogens-prenylation, palmitoylation, and myristoylation. Lipidation of bacterial substrates primes the effectors for coincidence detection-mediated targeting onto membrane-bound organelles by increasing membrane affinity. Intracellular membrane-targeting strategies that exploit protein fatty acylation and prenylation direct bacterial effectors to compartments where their target substrates reside and thus are critical for effector function.
TI  - Evolutionary analysis and lateral gene transfer of two-component regulatory systems associated with heavy-metal tolerance in bacteria.
AB  - Microorganisms have adapted intricate signal transduction mechanisms to coordinate tolerance to toxic levels of metals, including two-component regulatory systems (TCRS). In particular, both cop and czc operons are regulated by TCRS; the cop operon plays a key role in bacterial tolerance to copper, whereas the czc operon is involved in the efflux of cadmium, zinc, and cobalt from the cell. Although the molecular physiology of heavy metal tolerance genes has been extensively studied, their evolutionary relationships are not well-understood. Phylogenetic relationships among heavy-metal efflux proteins and their corresponding two-component regulatory proteins revealed orthologous and paralogous relationships from species divergences and ancient gene duplications. The presence of heavy metal tolerance genes on bacterial plasmids suggests these genes may be prone to spread through horizontal gene transfer. Phylogenetic inferences revealed nine potential examples of lateral gene transfer associated with metal efflux proteins and two examples for regulatory proteins. Notably, four of the examples suggest lateral transfer across major evolutionary domains. In most cases, differences in GC content in metal tolerance genes and their corresponding host genomes confirmed lateral gene transfer events. Three-dimensional protein structures predicted for the response regulators encoded by cop and czc operons showed a high degree of structural similarity with other known proteins involved in TCRS signal transduction, which suggests common evolutionary origins of functional phenotypes and similar mechanisms of action for these response regulators.
TI  - Effects of pesticides on the reduction of plant and human pathogenic bacteria in  application water.
AB  - Overhead spray applications of in-field tomato treatments dissolved in aqueous solutions have specific pest targets (fungal, bacterial, insect, or other). Any organism present in the solution or on treated plant surfaces that is not a specific target of the application is unlikely inactivated and can instead be spread through the phyllosphere. In this laboratory study, commercially labeled pesticides (including Actigard 50WG, Bravo Weather Stik 6F, Cabrio 20EG, Kasumin, Kocide 3000 46WG, Oxidate 27L, Penncozeb 75DF, ProPhyt 54.5L, Stimplex 100L, Firewall, 22.4WP, and Tanos 50DF) in common use in commercial tomato production fields of the Eastern Shore of Virginia were investigated for activity against in vitro bacterial contamination of pesticide application waters. Pesticides of interest were tank mixed individually with one of the plant pathogens Ralstonia solanacearum, Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, or one of two serovars (Newport and Montevideo) of the human pathogen Salmonella enterica to assess reduction values during the average time between mixing and initial application. Observations suggested that while some treatments had a noticeable effect on population levels, only the oxidizer, peroxyacetic acid, showed significant and consistent levels of suppression against all bacteria investigated, at levels that could have practical implications.
TI  - Salmonella colonization activates the plant immune system and benefits from association with plant pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Despite increasing incidences of human salmonellosis caused by consumption of contaminated vegetables, relatively little is known about how the plant immune system responds to and may inhibit Salmonella colonization. Here we show that Salmonella Typhimurium activates the plant immune system primarily due to its recognition of the flg22 region in Salmonella flagellin. Several previously identified plant genes that play a role in immunity were found to affect the host response to Salmonella. The Salmonella flg22 (Seflg22) peptide induced the immune response in leaves which effectively restricted the growth of Salmonella as well as the plant pathogenic bacterium, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. Induction of immune responses by Seflg22 was dependent on the plant FLS2 receptor. Salmonella multiplied poorly on plant tissues similar to other bacteria which are non-pathogenic to plants. However, Salmonella populations increased significantly when co-inoculated with P. syringae pv. tomato but not when co-inoculated with a type III secretion system mutant of this pathogen. Our results suggest that Salmonella benefits from the immune-suppressing effects of plant pathogenic bacteria, and this growth enhancement may increase the risk of salmonellosis.
TI  - Resident bacteria on leaves enhance survival of immigrant cells of Salmonella enterica.
AB  - Although Salmonella enterica apparently has comparatively low epiphytic fitness on plants, external factors that would influence its ability to survive on plants after contamination would be of significance in the epidemiology of human diseases caused by this human pathogen. Viable population sizes of S. enterica applied to plants preinoculated with Pseudomonas syringae or either of two Erwinia herbicola strains was >/=10-fold higher than that on control plants that were not precolonized by such indigenous bacteria when assessed 24 to 72 h after the imposition of desiccation stress. The protective effect of P. fluorescens, which exhibited antibiosis toward S. enterica in vitro, was only approximately 50% that conferred by other bacterial strains. Although S. enterica could produce small cellular aggregates after incubation on wet leaves for several days, and the cells in such aggregates were less susceptible to death upon acute dehydration than solitary cells (as determined by propidium iodide staining), most Salmonella cells were found as isolated cells when it was applied to leaves previously colonized by other bacterial species. The proportion of solitary cells of S. enterica coincident with aggregates of cells of preexisting epiphytic species that subsequently were judged as nonviable by viability staining on dry leaves was as much as 10-fold less than those that had landed on uncolonized portions of the leaf. Thus, survival of immigrant cells of S. enterica on plants appears to be strongly context dependent, and the presence of common epiphytic bacteria on plants can protect such immigrants from at least one key stress (i.e., desiccation) encountered on leaf surfaces.
TI  - An image classification approach to analyze the suppression of plant immunity by  the human pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The enteric pathogen Salmonella is the causative agent of the majority of food-borne bacterial poisonings. Resent research revealed that colonization of plants by Salmonella is an active infection process. Salmonella changes the metabolism and adjust the plant host by suppressing the defense mechanisms. In this report we developed an automatic algorithm to quantify the symptoms caused by Salmonella infection on Arabidopsis. RESULTS: The algorithm is designed to attribute image pixels into one of the two classes: healthy and unhealthy. The task is solved in three steps. First, we perform segmentation to divide the image into foreground and background. In the second step, a support vector machine (SVM) is applied to predict the class of each pixel belonging to the foreground. And finally, we do refinement by a neighborhood-check in order to omit all falsely classified pixels from the second step. The developed algorithm was tested on infection with the non-pathogenic E. coli and the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae and used to study the interaction between plants and Salmonella wild type and T3SS mutants. We proved that T3SS mutants of Salmonella are unable to suppress the plant defenses. Results obtained through the automatic analyses were further verified on biochemical and transcriptome levels. CONCLUSION: This report presents an automatic pixel-based classification method for detecting "unhealthy" regions in leaf images. The proposed method was compared to existing method and showed a higher accuracy. We used this algorithm to study the impact of the human pathogenic bacterium Salmonella Typhimurium on plants immune system. The comparison between wild type bacteria and T3SS mutants showed similarity in the infection process in animals and in plants. Plant epidemiology is only one possible application of the proposed algorithm, it can be easily extended to other detection tasks, which also rely on color information, or even extended to other features.
TI  - Functional and computational analysis of amino acid patterns predictive of type III secretion system substrates in Pseudomonas syringae.
AB  - Bacterial type III secretion systems (T3SSs) deliver proteins called effectors into eukaryotic cells. Although N-terminal amino acid sequences are required for translocation, the mechanism of substrate recognition by the T3SS is unknown. Almost all actively deployed T3SS substrates in the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato strain DC3000 possess characteristic patterns, including (i) greater than 10% serine within the first 50 amino acids, (ii) an aliphatic residue or proline at position 3 or 4, and (iii) a lack of acidic amino acids within the first 12 residues. Here, the functional significance of the P. syringae T3SS substrate compositional patterns was tested. A mutant AvrPto effector protein lacking all three patterns was secreted into culture and translocated into plant cells, suggesting that the compositional characteristics are not absolutely required for T3SS targeting and that other recognition mechanisms exist. To further analyze the unique properties of T3SS targeting signals, we developed a computational algorithm called TEREE (Type III Effector Relative Entropy Evaluation) that distinguishes DC3000 T3SS substrates from other proteins with a high sensitivity and specificity. Although TEREE did not efficiently identify T3SS substrates in Salmonella enterica, it was effective in another P. syringae strain and Ralstonia solanacearum. Thus, the TEREE algorithm may be a useful tool for identifying new effector genes in plant pathogens. The nature of T3SS targeting signals was additionally investigated by analyzing the N-terminus of FtsX, a putative membrane protein that was classified as a T3SS substrate by TEREE. Although the first 50 amino acids of FtsX were unable to target a reporter protein to the T3SS, an AvrPto protein substituted with the first 12 amino acids of FtsX was translocated into plant cells. These results show that the T3SS targeting signals are highly mutable and that secretion may be directed by multiple features of substrates.
TI  - Cloning, protein expression and display of synthetic multi-epitope mycobacterial  antigens on Salmonella typhi Ty21a cell surface.
AB  - Expressing proteins of interest as fusion to proteins of bacterial envelope is a  powerful technique for biotechnological and medical applications. The synthetic gene (VacII) encoding for T-cell epitopes of selected genes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis namely, ESAT6, MTP40, 38 kDa, and MPT64 was fused with N- terminus of Pseudomonas syringae ice nucleation protein (INP) outer membrane protein. The fused genes were cloned into a bacterial expression vector pKK223-3. The recombinant protein was purified by Ni-NAT column. VacII gene was displayed on the cell surface of Salmonella typhi Ty21a using N-terminal region of ice nucleation proteins (INP) as an anchoring motif. Glycine method confirmed that VacII was anchored on the cell surface. Western blot analysis further identified the synthesis of INP derivatives containing the N-terminal domain INP- VacII fusion protein of the expected size (52 kDa).
TI  - [Absence of mutagenic effect of Pseudomonas syringae pv. atrofaciens 9400 and Pantoea agglomerans P324 culture liquids].
AB  - The mutagenic activity of the culture liquids of phytopathogenic strain Pseudomonas syringae pv. atrofaciens 9400 and epiphytic strain Pantoea agglomerans P324 was studied in the Ames test and Allium cepa-test. In pro- and eucariotic test-systems no effect of the culture liquids of these bacteria on spontaneous mutations of Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 or chromosome aberrations in the cells of Allium cepa root apical meristem was found.
TI  - Specific and rapid enumeration of viable but nonculturable and viable-culturable  gram-negative bacteria by using flow cytometry.
AB  - An issue of critical concern in microbiology is the ability to detect viable but  nonculturable (VBNC) and viable-culturable (VC) cells by methods other than existing approaches. Culture methods are selective and underestimate the real population, and other options (direct viable count and the double-staining method using epifluorescence microscopy and inhibitory substance-influenced molecular methods) are also biased and time-consuming. A rapid approach that reduces selectivity, decreases bias from sample storage and incubation, and reduces assay time is needed. Flow cytometry is a sensitive analytical technique that can rapidly monitor physiological states of bacteria. This report outlines a method to optimize staining protocols and the flow cytometer (FCM) instrument settings for the enumeration of VBNC and VC bacterial cells within 70 min. Experiments were performed using the FCM to quantify VBNC and VC Escherichia coli O157:H7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas syringae, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium cells after staining with different fluorescent probes: SYTO 9, SYTO 13, SYTO 17, SYTO 40, and propidium iodide (PI). The FCM data were compared with those for specific standard nutrient agar to enumerate the number of cells in different states. By comparing results from cultures at late log phase, 1 to 64% of cells were nonculturable, 40 to 98% were culturable, and 0.7 to 4.5% had damaged cell membranes and were therefore theoretically dead. Data obtained using four different gram-negative bacteria exposed to heat and stained with PI also illustrate the usefulness of the approach for the rapid and unbiased detection of dead versus live organisms.
TI  - From small reads do mighty genomes grow.
AB  - This month's Genome Watch discusses the use of next-generation sequencing technologies to assemble draft genomes for two pseudomonad species.
TI  - Accurate prediction of secreted substrates and identification of a conserved putative secretion signal for type III secretion systems.
AB  - The type III secretion system is an essential component for virulence in many Gram-negative bacteria. Though components of the secretion system apparatus are conserved, its substrates--effector proteins--are not. We have used a novel computational approach to confidently identify new secreted effectors by integrating protein sequence-based features, including evolutionary measures such as the pattern of homologs in a range of other organisms, G+C content, amino acid composition, and the N-terminal 30 residues of the protein sequence. The method was trained on known effectors from the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae and validated on a set of effectors from the animal pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) after eliminating effectors with detectable sequence similarity. We show that this approach can predict known secreted effectors with high specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, by considering a large set of effectors from multiple organisms, we computationally identify a common putative secretion signal in the N-terminal 20 residues of secreted effectors. This signal can be used to discriminate 46 out of 68 total known effectors from both organisms, suggesting that it is a real, shared signal applicable to many type III secreted effectors. We use the method to make novel predictions of secreted effectors in S. Typhimurium, some of which have been experimentally validated. We also apply the method to predict secreted effectors in the genetically intractable human pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis, identifying the majority of known secreted proteins in addition to providing a number of novel predictions. This approach provides a new way to identify secreted effectors in a broad range of pathogenic bacteria for further experimental characterization and provides insight into the nature of the type III secretion signal.
TI  - Characterization of the osmoprotectant transporter OpuC from Pseudomonas syringae and demonstration that cystathionine-beta-synthase domains are required for its osmoregulatory function.
AB  - The plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae may cope with osmotic stress on plants, in part, by importing osmoprotective compounds. In this study, we found that P. syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 was distinct from most bacterial species in deriving greater osmoprotection from exogenous choline than from glycine betaine. This superior osmoprotection was correlated with a higher capacity for uptake of choline than for uptake of glycine betaine. Of four putative osmoregulatory ABC transporters in DC3000, one, designated OpuC, functioned as the primary or sole transporter for glycine betaine and as one of multiple transporters for choline under high osmolarity. Surprisingly, the homolog of the well-characterized ProU transporter from Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium did not function in osmoprotection. The P. syringae pv. tomato OpuC transporter was more closely related to the Bacillus subtilis and Listeria monocytogenes OpuC transporters than to known osmoprotectant transporters in gram-negative bacteria based on sequence similarity and genetic arrangement. The P. syringae pv. tomato OpuC transporter had a high affinity for glycine betaine, a low affinity for choline, and a broad substrate specificity that included acetylcholine, carnitine, and proline betaine. Tandem cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) domains in the ATP-binding component of OpuC were required for transporter function. The presence of these CBS domains was correlated with osmoregulatory function among the putative transporters examined in DC3000 and was found to be predictive of functional osmoregulatory transporters in other pseudomonads. These results provide the first functional evaluation of an osmoprotectant transporter in a Pseudomonas species and demonstrate the usefulness of the CBS domains as predictors of osmoregulatory activity.
TI  - [Mechanism of antimutagenic activity of Pseudomonas syringae lipopolysaccharides].
AB  - The antimutagenic activity of lipopolysaccharides of phytopathogenic bacteria,which are the agents of grain crops diseases, has been investigated using bacterial test-system with Salmonella typhimurium. It has been established that the greatest antimutagen activity of Pseudomonas syringae pv. atrofaciens and P. syringae pv. coronafaciens lipopolysaccharides was,if they and bichromate potassium be simultaneously added to cells test-strains of S. typhimurium. They decreased to a less degree quantity of His+ -revertants in S. typhimurium cells pretreated by potassium bichromate. Li popolysaccharides of pathovars of P. syringae do not increase test-strain cells resistance to mutagenic effect of potassium bichromate under pretreatment of S. typhimurium by them.
TI  - Regulation of enteric endophytic bacterial colonization by plant defenses.
AB  - Bacterial endophytes reside within the interior of plants without causing disease or forming symbiotic structures. Some endophytes, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae 342 (Kp342), enhance plant growth and nutrition. Others, such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium), are human pathogens that contaminate raw produce. Several lines of evidence are presented here to support the hypothesis that plant defense response pathways regulate colonization by endophytic bacteria. An ethylene-insensitive mutant of Medicago truncatula is hypercolonized by Kp342 compared to the parent genotype. Addition of ethylene, a signal molecule for induced systemic resistance in plants, decreased endophytic colonization in Medicago spp. This ethylene-mediated inhibition of endophytic colonization was reversed by addition of the ethylene action inhibitor, 1-methylcyclopropene. Colonization of Medicago spp. by S. typhimurium also was affected by exogenous ethylene. Mutants lacking flagella or a component of the type III secretion system of Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (TTSS-SPI1) colonize the interior of Medicago spp. in higher numbers than the wild type. Arabidopsis defense response-related genotypes indicated that only salicylic acid (SA)-independent defense responses contribute to restricting colonization by Kp342. In contrast, colonization by S. typhimurium is affected by both SA-dependent and -independent responses. S. typhimurium mutants further delineated these responses, suggesting that both flagella and TTSS-SPI1 effectors can be recognized. Flagella act primarily through SA-independent responses (compromising SA accumulation still affected colonization in the absence of flagella). Removal of a TTSS-SPI1 effector resulted in hypercolonization regardless of whether the genotype was affected in either SA-dependent or SA-independent responses. Consistent with these results, S. typhimurium activates the promoter of PR1, a SA-dependent pathogenesis-related gene, while S. typhimurium mutants lacking the TTSS-SPI1 failed to activate this promoter. These observations suggest approaches to reduce contamination of raw produce by human enteric pathogens and to increase the number of growth-promoting bacteria in plants.
TI  - Differential survival of solitary and aggregated bacterial cells promotes aggregate formation on leaf surfaces.
AB  - The survival of individual Pseudomonas syringae cells was determined on bean leaf surfaces maintained under humid conditions or periodically exposed to desiccation stress. Cells of P. syringae strain B728a harboring a GFP marker gene were visualized by epifluorescence microscopy, either directly in situ or after recovery from leaves, and dead cells were identified as those that were stained with propidium iodide in such populations. Under moist, conducive conditions on plants, the proportion of total live cells was always high, irrespective of their aggregated state. In contrast, the proportion of the total cells that remained alive on leaves that were periodically exposed to desiccation stress decreased through time and was only approximately 15% after 5 days. However, the fraction of cells in large aggregates that were alive on such plants in both condition was much higher than more solitary cells. Immediately after inoculation, cells were randomly distributed over the leaf surface and no aggregates were observed. However, a very aggregated pattern of colonization was apparent within 7 days, and >90% of the living cells were located in aggregates of 100 cells or more. Our results strongly suggest that, although conducive conditions favor aggregate formation, such cells are much more capable of tolerating environmental stresses, and the preferential survival of cells in aggregates promotes a highly clustered spatial distribution of bacteria on leaf surfaces.
TI  - Genomewide identification of proteins secreted by the Hrp type III protein secretion system of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000.
AB  - The ability of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 to be pathogenic on plants  depends on the Hrp (hypersensitive response and pathogenicity) type III protein secretion system and the effector proteins it translocates into plant cells. Through iterative application of experimental and computational techniques, the DC3000 effector inventory has been substantially enlarged. Five homologs of known avirulence (Avr) proteins and five effector candidates, encoded by genes with putative Hrp promoters and signatures of horizontal acquisition, were demonstrated to be secreted in culture and/or translocated into Arabidopsis in a Hrp-dependent manner. These 10 Hrp-dependent outer proteins (Hops) were designated HopPtoC (AvrPpiC2 homolog), HopPtoD1 and HopPtoD2 (AvrPphD homologs), HopPtoK (AvrRps4 homolog), HopPtoJ (AvrXv3 homolog), HopPtoE, HopPtoG, HopPtoH, HopPtoI, and HopPtoS1 (an ADP-ribosyltransferase homolog). Analysis of the enlarged collection of proteins traveling the Hrp pathway in P. syringae revealed an export-associated pattern of equivalent solvent-exposed amino acids in the N-terminal five positions, a lack of Asp or Glu residues in the first 12 positions, and amphipathicity in the first 50 positions. These characteristics were used to search the unfinished DC3000 genome, yielding 32 additional candidate effector genes that predicted proteins with Hrp export signals and that also possessed signatures of horizontal acquisition. Among these were genes encoding additional ADP-ribosyltransferases, a homolog of SrfC (a candidate effector in Salmonella enterica), a catalase, and a glucokinase. One ADP-ribosyltransferase and the SrfC homolog were tested and shown to be secreted in a Hrp-dependent manner. These proteins, designated HopPtoS2 and HopPtoL, respectively, bring the DC3000 Hrp-secreted protein inventory to 22.
TI  - Identification of a copper-responsive two-component system on the chromosome of Escherichia coli K-12.
AB  - Using a genetic screen we have identified two chromosomal genes, cusRS (ylcA ybcZ), from Escherichia coli K-12 that encode a two-component, signal transduction system that is responsive to copper ions. This regulatory system is required for copper-induced expression of pcoE, a plasmid-borne gene from the E. coli copper resistance operon pco. The closest homologs of CusR and CusS are plasmid-borne two-component systems that are also involved in metal responsive gene regulation: PcoR and PcoS from the pco operon of E. coli; CopR and CopS from the cop operon, which provides copper resistance to Pseudomonas syringae; and SilR and SilS from the sil locus, which provides silver ion resistance to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. The genes cusRS are also required for the copper-dependent expression of at least one chromosomal gene, designated cusC (ylcB), which is allelic to the recently identified virulence gene ibeB in E. coli K1. The cus locus may comprise a copper ion efflux system, because the expression of cusC is induced by high concentrations of copper ions. Furthermore, the translation products of cusC and additional downstream genes are homologous to known metal ion antiporters.
TI  - Surface-displayed viral antigens on Salmonella carrier vaccine.
AB  - We have developed a recombinant live oral vaccine using the ice-nucleation protein (Inp) from Pseudomonas syringae to display viral antigens on the surface of Salmonella spp. Fusion proteins containing viral antigens were expressed in the oral vaccine strain, Salmonella typhi Ty21a. Surface localization was verified by immunoblotting and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The immunogenicity of surface-displayed viral antigens on the recombinant live vaccine strain was assessed in mice inoculated intranasally and intraperitoneally. Inoculation resulted in significantly higher serum antibody level than those induced by viral antigens expressed intracellularly. Thus, this multivalent mucosal live vaccine may provide an effective means for inducing mucosal or systemic immune responses against multiple viral antigens.
TI  - Flagellar genes from Rhodobacter sphaeroides are homologous to genes of the fliF  operon of Salmonella typhimurium and to the type-III secretion system.
AB  - A flagellar region of the genome of Rhodobacter sphaeroides was cloned and sequenced. Three ORFs were identified and arranged in the same order as fliH, fliI and fliJ of Salmonella typhimurium (St). ORF2 is highly similar to FliI from St (49% similarity) showing Walker's A and B motifs. Similar scores were found with proteins of the type-III secretion system of virulence factors. ORF3 shows 16.4 and 11.1% similarity to FliJ from St and Bacillus subtilis, respectively. This work also shows that ORF3 is similar to HrpJ5 from Pseudomonas syringae (19.2% similarity). It was found that ORF2 and ORF3 start immediately downstream from the adjacent coding region, suggesting a single transcriptional unit.
TI  - Phaseolotoxin transport in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium via the oligopeptide permease.
AB  - Phaseolotoxin [(N delta-phosphosulfamyl)ornithylalanylhomoarginine], a phytotoxic tripeptide produced by Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola that inhibits ornithine carbamoyltransferase, is transported into Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium via the oligopeptide transport system (Opp). Mutants defective in oligopeptide permease (Opp-) were resistant to phaseolotoxin. Spontaneous phaseolotoxin-resistant mutants (Toxr) lacked the Opp function as evidenced by their cross-resistance to triornithine and failure to utilize glycylhistidylglycine as a source of histidine. Growth inhibition by phaseolotoxin was prevented by peptides known to be transported via the Opp system and by treatment of the toxin with L-aminopeptidase. In both E. coli and S. typhimurium, Toxr mutations were cotransducible with trp, suggesting that the opp locus occupies similar positions in genetic maps of these bacteria.
