TI  == the distribution of pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns among canine surgical wound infections in sweden in relation to different risk factors.
AB  == background: surgical site infection (ssi) is a common nosocomial infection in dogs and a growing concern in veterinary hospitals as an increase in multidrug-resistant pathogens is reported. despite the need for rational and prudent antimicrobial use, few peer-reviewed and published veterinary studies have investigated the pathogenic growth including susceptibility patterns of the  isolated pathogens in canine ssis. the first objective of the present study was to estimate the distribution of bacterial pathogens in dogs with ssi and to investigate whether this was influenced by type of surgical procedure (clean, clean-contaminated, contaminated or dirty), duration of hospitalization, wound classification and depth of the infection, or antimicrobial treatment. the second objective was to assess susceptibility patterns to clinically relevant antimicrobials. during three years, four animal referral hospitals and three small animal clinics submitted bacterial swabs from canine ssis for culture and susceptibility, together with a questionnaire completed by the attending clinician. results: approximately two thirds of the in total 194 isolates were staphylococci. staphylococcus pseudintermedius was the most prevalent finding (46%) followed by beta haemolytic streptococcus spp. (24%). no associations between distribution of the isolated pathogens and classification of the surgical procedure, duration of hospitalization or depth of the ssi were shown, with the exception of escherichia coli isolates being significantly more often found in deep wound infections than in superficial skin infections. overall the possibilities of finding first generations antimicrobials to treat the ssis included in the study were favorable, as the isolated pathogens were mostly without acquired antimicrobial resistance and multidrug resistance was uncommon.  there were only three cases of methicillin-resistant s. pseudintermedius-infections (one percent of all isolates), one case of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing e. coli-infection, and no methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections. conclusions: none of the  investigated factors were shown to influence the distribution of bacterial pathogens. the majority of ssis were caused by staphylococci, and s. pseudintermedius was the most prevalent pathogen. based on the study results, use of first-line antimicrobials prior to receiving culture and susceptibility results is a rational empirical antimicrobial therapy for the studied dog population.

TI  == staphylococcus pseudintermedius for camp-test.
AB  == camp test reliably detects listeria monocytogenes (lm) and streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus, gbs); it is traditionally performed streaking  the tested isolate perpendicularly to staphylococcus aureus (sa), provided that reference sa strains (that produce beta-hemolysin) are used. in a zone of beta-hemolysin activity, in fact, gbs and lm form typical arrow-shaped hemolytic  areas. while sa production of the toxin is strain-dependent, however, that of staphylococcus pseudintermedius (sp), a pet-owner colonizer and an emerging human pathogen, is constitutive, then observed in all clinical isolates. therefore, sp  may indeed represent a valid alternative to perform the assay.

TI  == [new insight into bacterial zoonotic pathogens posing health hazards to humans].
AB  == this article presents the problem of evolutionary changes of zoonotic pathogens responsible for human diseases. everyone is exposed to the risk of zoonotic infection, particularly employees having direct contact with animals, i.e. veterinarians, breeders, butchers and workers of animal products' processing industry. the article focuses on pathogens monitored by the european centre for disease prevention and control (ecdc), which has been collecting statistical data on zoonoses from all european union countries for 19 years and publishing collected data in annual epidemiological reports. currently, the most important 11 pathogens responsible for causing human zoonotic diseases are being monitored, of which seven are bacteria: salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium bovis, brucella spp., coxiella burnetti and verotoxin-producing e. coli (vtec)/shiga-like toxin producing e. coli (stec). as  particularly important are considered foodborne pathogens. the article also includes new emerging zoonotic bacteria, which are not currently monitored by ecdc but might pose a serious epidemiological problem in a foreseeable future: streptococcus iniae, s. suis, s. dysgalactiae and staphylococci: staphylococcus intermedius, s. pseudintermedius. those species have just crossed the animal-human interspecies barrier. the exact mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown, it is connected, however, with genetic variability, capability to survive in changing environment. these abilities derive from dna rearrangement and horizontal gene transfer between bacterial cells. substantial increase in the number of scientific publications on this subject, observed over the last few years, illustrates the importance of the problem.

TI  == identification and antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates from dogs with otitis externa in australia.
AB  == objective: to identify and quantify the five most frequently isolated significant bacterial microorganisms, and their antibiotic susceptibility, from bacterial cultures of samples taken from the ears of dogs with otitis externa. methods: bacterial culture and susceptibility testing data for ear swabs from dogs with presumed otitis externa were collated and evaluated. results: the five most frequently isolated microorganisms were: pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus pseudintermedius, proteus sp., beta-haemolytic streptococci and escherichia coli. susceptibility to gentamicin was very high for most isolates, whereas for polymyxin b, high levels of resistance were seen. beta-haemolytic streptococci had high levels of resistance to all of the antibiotics tested. conclusions: this study provides veterinarians with australian data to assist in cytological interpretation and initial empirical therapy of canine otitis externa.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from breeding dogs housed in kennels with differing neonatal mortality and use of antibiotics.
AB  == this work examines the antimicrobial resistance of potentially pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus pseudintermedius, streptococcus canis, escherichia coli) found in the vaginal tract in prepartum mammary secretions and postpartum milk of bitches housed in breeding kennels (n = 20; 92 bitches). the kennels were divided into three categories: no routine antimicrobial administration around parturition (category 1); routine administration of one antibiotic around parturition (category 2); routine administration of multiple antimicrobials around parturition (category 3). bacteriological cultures and antibiotic susceptibility  tests were performed on vaginal specimens, prepartum mammary secretions, and postpartum milk. stillbirths and neonatal deaths were recorded for each whelping  and analyzed as "within-litter stillbirths" and "within-litter neonatal deaths" according to kennel category, by pearson chi(2) test and the kruskal-wallis nonparametric test, respectively. the frequency of isolation and antimicrobial resistance of bacteria were analyzed according to kennel category by pearson chi(2) test. kennel category was not significantly associated with differing numbers of stillbirths or neonatal death events, nor was the frequency of isolation of potentially pathogenic bacteria in the three kennel categories significantly different. kennel category 3 had a significantly higher frequency of isolation of multiresistant gram-positive bacterial strains. our results show  that intense administration of antibiotics to breeding bitches does not effectively reduce neonatal mortality; on the contrary, it induces multiresistance in potentially pathogenic bacteria. breeders and veterinarians should be aware of the risk of selecting pathogenic bacteria by uncontrolled treatment in prepartum bitches.

TI  == the in vitro activity of 15 antimicrobial agents against bacterial isolates from  dogs.
AB  == the in vitro activity of 15 antimicrobial agents against clinical isolates of staphylococcus pseudintermedius, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pasteurella spp. and streptococcus canis from dogs was investigated. for staphylococcus spp., the highest frequency of resistance was observed for penicillin, followed by ampicillin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. the highest frequency of resistance in e. coli isolates was recorded for tetracycline and streptomycin. pasteurella spp. and s. canis had the highest resistance rate for tetracycline and chloramphenicol. most isolates showed full susceptibility to low-level resistance to colistin, florfenicol and fluoroquinolones. further studies using larger number of isolates from both healthy and diseased dogs would provide a broader picture of antimicrobial resistance at a national level and promote prudent use of antimicrobial agents in companion animals.

TI  == bactericidal properties of pradofloxacin against veterinary pathogens.
AB  == pradofloxacin is a new veterinary 8-cyano-fluoroquinolone developed for use against bacterial infections in dogs and cats involving both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the minimal bactericidal concentrations have been determined  against clinical isolates of staphylococcus pseudintermedius, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, streptococcus canis, proteus spp., fusobacterium spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella species. a subset of these species was selected, and the in vitro rate of kill by pradofloxacin was determined. for 27 of the 30 tested aerobic strains the pradofloxacin mbc was within two doubling dilutions of the mic. for the remaining strains, the mic and mbc were within three to four doubling dilutions. pradofloxacin also demonstrated bactericidal activity against all anaerobic strains, and the mbc was equal to the mic for four of the strains, within 1 doubling dilution for three strains, within 2 dilutions for a further 3 strains and within 3 dilutions for the remaining five strains. as pradofloxacin concentration was increased, a faster rate of killing was observed; bactericidal  effects were seen in all cases at concentrations </= 0.25 mug/ml. the bactericidal activity against the anaerobic strains was marked, of particular relevance was the complete absence of regrowth even at 48 h at concentrations as  low as 0.125 mug/ml. in conclusion, pradofloxacin exhibits clear bactericidal activity in terms of mbc and kill kinetics against aerobic and anaerobic clinical isolates from dogs and cats at concentrations that are greatly exceeded within the systemic circulation after administration of the recommended therapeutic doses to the target animals. it is expected that such a rapid rate of kill will play a significant role in clinical efficacy. these data demonstrate the complete and rapid killing of anaerobic bacteria by a veterinary 8-cyano-fluoroquinolone.

TI  == aerobic bacteria from mucous membranes, ear canals, and skin wounds of feral cats in grenada, and the antimicrobial drug susceptibility of major isolates.
AB  == in a 2-year period 54 feral cats were captured in grenada, west indies, and a total of 383 samples consisting of swabs from rectum, vagina, ears, eyes, mouth,  nose and wounds/abscesses, were cultured for aerobic bacteria and campylobacters. a total of 251 bacterial isolates were obtained, of which 205 were identified to  species level and 46 to genus level. a commercial bacterial identification system (api/biomerieux), was used for this purpose. the most common species was escherichia coli (n=60), followed by staphylococcus felis/simulans (40), s. hominis (16), s. haemolyticus (12), streptococcus canis (9), proteus mirabilis (8), pasteurella multocida (7), streptococcus mitis (7), staphylococcus xylosus (7), s. capitis (6), s. chromogenes (4), s. sciuri (3), s. auricularis (2), s. lentus (2), s. hyicus (2), streptococcus suis (2) and pseudomonas argentinensis (2). sixteen other isolates were identified to species level. a molecular method  using 16s rrna sequencing was used to confirm/identify 22 isolates. salmonella or campylobacters were not isolated from rectal swabs. e. coli and s. felis/simulans together constituted 50% of isolates from vagina. s. felis/simulans was the most  common species from culture positive ear and eye samples. p. multocida was isolated from 15% of mouth samples. coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates from nose and wound swabs. staphylococcus aureus, or s. intemedius/s. pseudintermedius were not isolated from any sample. antimicrobial drug resistance was minimal, most isolates being susceptible to all drugs tested  against, including tetracycline.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of a commercial ear antiseptic containing chlorhexidine and tris-edta.
AB  == minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of a commercial ear antiseptic containing chlorhexidine 0.15% and tris-edta (otodine) were determined by broth microdilution for 150 isolates representing the most common pathogens associated  with canine otitis. the microorganisms were classified into three groups according to their levels of susceptibility. the most susceptible group included  staphylococcus pseudintermedius, malassezia pachydermatis, streptococcus canis and corynebacterium auriscanis, which were generally killed by 1 : 64 dilution of the antiseptic product (mbc = 23/0.8 microg/ml of chlorhexidine/tris-edta). the most resistant organism was proteus mirabilis, which survived up to 1 : 8 dilution of the product (mbc = 375/12 microg/ml). escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus displayed intermediate mbcs ranging between  188/6 and 47/1.5 microg/ml. interestingly, s. pseudintermedius was more susceptible than s. aureus, and no significant difference was observed between meticillin-resistant and meticillin-susceptible isolates within each species, indicating that antiseptic use is unlikely to co-select for meticillin resistance. although the concentrations required for killing (mbcs) varied considerably with microorganism type, the combination of chlorhexidine 0.15% and  tris-edta was active against all the pathogens most commonly involved in canine otitis.

TI  == staphylococcus pseudintermedius necrotizing fasciitis in a dog.
AB  == staphylococcus pseudintermedius was implicated as the cause of rapidly progressive and fatal necrotizing fasciitis in a dog. the isolate was methicillin-susceptible and did not contain genes encoding the panton-valentine leukocidin. while streptococcus canis is typically considered to be the main cause of necrotizing fasciitis in dogs, staphylococci should also be considered.
