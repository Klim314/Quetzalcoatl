TI  - Phylogeny of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas spp. and related bacteria.
AB  - The phylogenetic structure of the bacteroides subgroup of the cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroides (CFB) phylum was examined by 16S rRNA sequence comparative analysis. Approximately 95% of the 16S rRNA sequence was determined for 36 representative strains of species of Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Porphyromonas and related species by a modified Sanger sequencing method. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from a corrected distance matrix by the neighbor-joining method, and the reliability of tree branching was established by bootstrap analysis. The bacteroides subgroup was divided primarily into three major phylogenetic clusters which contained most of the species examined. The first cluster, termed the prevotella cluster, was composed of 16 species of Prevotella, including P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, and the ruminal species P. ruminicola. Two oral species, P. zoogleoformans and P. heparinolytica, which had been recently placed in the genus Prevotella, did not fall within the prevotella cluster. These two species and six species of Bacteroides, including the type species B. fragilis, formed the second cluster, termed the bacteroides cluster. The third cluster, termed the porphyromonas cluster, was divided into two subclusters. The first contained Porphyromonas gingivalis, P. endodontalis, P. asaccharolytica, P. circumdentaria, P. salivosa, [Bacteroides] levii (the brackets around genus are used to indicate that the species does not belong to the genus by the sensu stricto definition), and [Bacteroides] macacae, and the second subcluster contained [Bacteroides] forsythus and [Bacteroides] distasonis. [Bacteroides] splanchnicus fell just outside the three major clusters but still belonged within the bacteroides subgroup. With few exceptions, the 16 S rRNA data were in overall agreement with previously proposed reclassifications of species of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas. Suggestions are made to accommodate those species which do not fit previous reclassification schemes.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Bacteroides and other genera of Gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  - A numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of Bacteroides, Polyphyromonas, Prevotella [not Prevotella (Labroue, 1976)] and Fusobacterium. Isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. Computation of similarity coefficients was followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. At the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) Bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) Fusobacterium mortiferum, F. necrogenes, F. necrophorum, F. nucleatum and F. varium; (3) B. caccae, B. distasonis, B. eggerthii, B. fragilis, B. merdae, B. ovatus, B stercoris, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformus and B. vulgatus; (4) B. splanchnicus; (5) Porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) B. bivius (Prevotella bivia); (7) B. disiens (P. disiens); (8) B. intermedius (P. intermedia);and (9) B. melaninogenicus (P. melaninogenica). Single isolates of B. ruminicola (P. ruminicola), B. denticola (P. denticola) and B. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.
TI  - Pathogenicity of encapsulated Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  - The pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus (BM) group and four clinical isolates of B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (SC) or intraperitoneal abscesses. Only 11 isolates of BM group and one B. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). When the other 23 isolates, however, were injected SC in combination with either Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. The Bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. Capsules also formed in Bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of K. pneumoniae or encapsulated Bacteroides sp. Once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of peritonsillar abscess in children.
AB  - Aspiration of peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) was aseptically performed in 16 children. Patients' median age was 10 years (range 6 to 17 years), and 12 were males. Unilateral abscess was present in all but one child. All aspirates were cultured for aerobes and anaerobes and yielded bacterial growth in all patients. Anaerobes were isolated in all patients; in 3 patients (19%), they were the only organism isolated, and in 13 (81%), they were mixed with aerobes. There were 91 anaerobic isolates (5.7 per specimen): 42 Bacteroides sp. (including 23 B. melaninogenicus, 5 B. oralis and 4 B. ruminicola ss. brevis); 18 anaerobic Gram-positive cocci (including 10 Peptostreptococcus sp., 4 Peptococcus sp. and 4 microaerophilic streptococci); 15 Fusobacterium sp.; and 3 Clostridium sp. There were 32 aerobic isolates (2.0 per specimen): 11 gamma-hemolytic streptococci, 8 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 4 Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, 4 Haemophilus sp. and 3 S. aureus. Beta-lactamase production was noted in 13 isolates recovered from 11 patients (68%). These were all isolates of S. aureus (3), 8 of 23 B. melaninogenicus (35%), and 2 of 5 B. oralis (40%). Our findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of peritonsillar abscesses in children, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in two thirds of the patients.
