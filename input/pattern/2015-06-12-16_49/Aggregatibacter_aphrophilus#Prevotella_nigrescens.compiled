TI  - Microbiota of deciduous endodontic infections analysed by MDA and Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the microbiota of endodontic infections in deciduous teeth by Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization after uniform amplification of DNA in samples by multiple displacement amplification (MDA). METHODOLOGY: Forty samples from the root canal system of deciduous teeth exhibiting pulp necrosis with or without radiographically detectable periradicular/interradicular bone resorption were collected and 32 were analysed, with three individuals contributing two samples; these were MDA-amplified and analysed by Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization for levels of 83 bacterial taxa. Two outcome measures were used: the percentage of teeth colonized by each species and the mean proportion of each bacterial taxon present across all samples. RESULTS: The mean amount of DNA in the samples prior to amplification was 5.2 (+/-4.7) ng and 6.1 (+/-2.3) mug after MDA. The mean number of species detected per sample was 19 (+/-4) (range: 3-66) to the nearest whole number. The most prevalent taxa were Prevotella intermedia (96.9%), Neisseria mucosa (65.6%), Prevotella nigrescens (56.2%) and Tannerella forsythia (56.2%). Aggregatibacter (Haemophilus) aphrophilus and Helicobacter pylori were not detected. P. intermedia (10%), Prevotella tannerae (7%) and Prevotella nigrescens (4.3%) presented the highest mean proportions of the target species averaged across the positive samples. CONCLUSION: Root canals of infected deciduous teeth had a diverse bacterial population. Prevotella sp. were commonly found with P. intermedia, Prevotella tannerae and Prevotella nigrescens amongst the most prominent species detected.
