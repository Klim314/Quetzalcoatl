TI  == isolation and identification of quercetin degrading bacteria from human fecal microbes.
AB  == quercetin has a wide range of biological properties. the gut microflora can often modulate its biological activity and their potential health effects. there still  is a lack of information about gut bacteria involving in this process. the strains of gut microbes from human feces that can transform quercetin were isolated and identified by in vitro fermentation. the results showed that escherichia coli, stretococcus lutetiensis, lactobacillus acidophilus, weissella  confusa, enterococcus gilvus, clostridium perfringens and bacteroides fragilis have the various ability of degrading quercetin. among them, c. perfringens and b. fragilis were discovered to have the strongest ability of degrading quercetin. additionally, quercetin can't inhibit the growth of c. perfringens. in conclusion, many species of gut microbiota can degrade quercetin, but their ability are different.

TI  == [identification of anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical specimens and determination of antibiotic susceptibilities].
AB  == routine isolation, identification and susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria present several difficulties leading to defects in the determination of  local susceptibility patterns which will guide empirical treatment protocols. this study was carried out to identify the anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical materials obtained from the suspected patients with anaerobic infection and to determine the antibiotic susceptibilities against several antibiotics. one hundred clinical specimens (36 blood, 31 abscess, 12 peritoneal  fluid, 7 joint fluid, 7 pleural fluid, 3 biopsies, 3 cerebrospinal fluids and 1 surgical wound) that were examined in our laboratory during march 20-october 30 2007, were included in the study. the specimens were collected and transported under anaerobic conditions and inoculated to conventional aerobic media and to wilkins chalgren agar, schaedler agar and chopped-meat broth for anaerobic isolation. isolated anaerobic bacteria were identified with api 20a panels (bio-merieux, france) via conventional methods and by the help of an-ident discs  (oxoid, england). penicillin g, clindamycin, cefoxitin, metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem susceptibility tests were performed with e-  test method. twenty two anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 14 clinical specimens; 7 of the specimens yielding the growth of more than one type of anaerobic bacteria and 8 specimens yielding both anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial (4 escherichia coli and 4 enterococcus spp.) growth. anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 89 abscess and in 6 peritoneal fluid specimens. the distribution of the anaerobic bacteria identified among these specimens were as follows: bacteroides fragilis (n = 6), bacteroides spp. other than b.fragilis (n = 4), clostridium spp. (n = 2), fusobacterium necrophorum/nucleatum (n = 1), prevotella intermedia/disiens (n = 1), peptococcus niger (n = 2), peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 5), and lactobacillus acidophilus/lenseii (n = 1). beta-lactamase activity was detected only in 2 of the 6 b. fragilis isolates. all of the isolates were susceptible to imipenem and  piperacillin/tazobactam. the highest rate of resistance was detected against penicillin g (9/22; 41%). while anaerobic gram-positive cocci (n = 7) were found  to be sensitive to all antibiotics, the rate of resistance among anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were 75% (9/12) to penicillin, 33.3% (4/12) to clindamycin, 8.3% (1/12) to metronidazole. among anaerobic gram-positive bacilli (n = 3), 2 were resistant to metronidazole, one to clindamycin and one to cefoxitin. the results of this first anaerobic antimicrobial susceptibility testing study performed at konya area in turkey revealed that penicillin was not appropriate in empirical treatment of anaerobic infections, clindamycin susceptibility should be tested before use, metronidazole and cefoxitin could be used in empirical treatment and imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam should be saved for the treatment of complicated infections and infections caused by resistant bacteria.

TI  == molecular studies of fecal anaerobic commensal bacteria in acute diarrhea in children.
AB  == background and objective: the commensal bacterial flora of the colon may undergo  changes during diarrhea, owing to colonization of the intestine by pathogens and  to rapid intestinal transit. this study used molecular methods to determine changes in the composition of selected commensal anaerobic bacteria during and after acute diarrhea in children. materials and methods: fecal samples were obtained from 46 children with acute diarrhea in a rural community during an episode of acute diarrhea, immediately after recovery from diarrhea, and 3 months after recovery. dna was extracted and quantitative polymerase chain reaction using sybr green and genus- and species-specific primers targeting 16s rdna were  undertaken to quantitate the following groups of bacteria: bifidobacterium spp.,  bifidobacterium longum group, bacteroides-prevotella group, bacteroides fragilis, lactobacillus acidophilus group, faecalibacterium prauznitzii, and eubacterium rectale, relative to amplification of universal bacterial domain 16s rdna. results: bacteria belonging to the bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group, e  rectale, l acidophilus, and f prauznitzii groups were low during acute diarrhea compared with their levels after recovery from diarrhea. the pattern was similar  in rotavirus diarrhea and nonrotavirus diarrhea. administration of amylase-resistant maize starch as adjuvant therapy was associated with lower levels of f prauznitzii at the time of recovery but did not lead to other changes in the floral pattern. conclusions: specific classes of fecal bacteria are lower  during episodes of acute diarrhea in children than during periods of normal gastrointestinal health, suggesting specific alterations in the flora during diarrhea.

TI  == lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium lactis and lactobacillus f19 prevent antibiotic-associated ecological disturbances of bacteroides fragilis in the intestine.
AB  == objective: the objective of this study was to compare the effect of clindamycin on the intestinal microflora in subjects ingesting yogurt with added probiotic microorganisms with the microflora in subjects ingesting placebo yogurt. materials and methods: twenty-four healthy subjects were included in the study. all subjects received 150 mg clindamycin four times daily for 7 days and 250 ml yogurt twice daily for 14 days. faecal samples were collected before, during and  after administration of clindamycin. results: in the aerobic intestinal microflora, the numbers of enterococci increased after treatment in both groups,  whereas other gram-positive microorganisms decreased. in both groups, the numbers of escherichia coli also decreased, whereas there was a concomitant increase in numbers of other gram-negative bacilli. in the anaerobic microflora in subjects receiving yogurt with added microorganisms, the numbers of lactobacilli and bacteroides remained at the same levels throughout the study, whereas the numbers decreased in the placebo group. other anaerobic bacteria decreased in both groups. the minimum inhibitory concentration of clindamycin against strains of bacteroides increased in both groups during the study. conclusions: the probiotic microorganisms evaluated in this study prevented ecological disturbances in the numbers of intestinal bacteroides fragilis group species during clindamycin administration.

TI  == growth-inhibiting effects of seco-tanapartholides identified in artemisia princeps var. orientalis whole plant on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == aims: the present work aimed at isolating antibacterial constituents from the whole plant of artemisia princeps var. orientalis active towards nine human intestinal bacteria. methods and results: the growth-inhibiting activities of materials derived from the artemisia whole plant towards test bacteria were examined using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active constituents of the artemisia whole plant were characterized as the sesquiterpene lactones seco-tanapartholides a and b by spectroscopic analysis. in a test using  1 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b produced a clear inhibitory effect against clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus aureus.  these compounds did not affect the growth of test lactic acid-producing bacteria  (bifidobacterium adolescentis, bif. breve, lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. casei) and escherichia coli, whereas weak growth inhibition towards bif. bifidum  was observed. at 0.5 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b exhibited moderate growth inhibition towards cl. perfringens but weak growth inhibition towards bact. fragilis and staph. aureus. conclusions: inhibitory action of seco-tanapartholides a and b towards specific bacteria without any adverse effects on lactic acid-producing bacteria may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of a. princeps var. orientalis whole plant. significance and impact of the study: these naturally occurring artemisia whole plant-derived materials could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria such as clostridia.

TI  == growth inhibition of intestinal bacteria and mutagenicity of 2-, 3-, 4-aminobiphenyls, benzidine, and biphenyl.
AB  == 2-aminobiphenyl (2-abp), 3-aminobiphenyl (3-abp) and 4-aminobiphenyl (4-abp), but not benzidine (bz) and biphenyl (bp), were found to be inhibitory to the growth of human intestinal bacteria bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, b. bifidium atcc 11863, clostridium perfringens atcc 13124, escherichia coli atcc 25922, e. coli atcc 35218, enterobacter cloacae atcc 13047 and salmonella typhimurium ta98, ta100, yg1041 at 10-200 microg/ml in culture broth. bacteroides distasonis atcc 8503, b. fragilis atcc 25285, b. theataiotaomicron atcc 29741, c. paraputrificum  atcc 26780, c. clostridiiforme atcc 25537, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 and enterococcus faecium atcc 19434 were not inhibited by the above mentioned compounds in concentrations up to 200 microg/ml. the ames salmonella/microsome assay was employed to test the mutagenicity of the above-mentioned compounds using strains ta98 and ta100 in the presence and absence of aroclor 1254-induced  rat s9 mix. it was found that 4-abp was mutagenic to both ta98 and ta100, and bz  was mutagenic to ta98 in the presence of rat s9 mix. 2-aminobiphenyl, 3-abp, and  bp were not mutagenic to both strains tested. 2-aminobiphenyl and 3-abp are chemical isomers of 4-abp and are as strong as 4-abp in inhibiting the growth of  intestinal bacteria but not as mutagenic as 4-abp. evidence suggested that the mechanism of growth inhibition is not involved with the interaction of dna that causes mutations, but rather on the electron transport system of these organisms.

TI  == development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == a membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. the 16s rdna sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. digoxigenin (dig)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. hybridization signals were read by nbt/bcip color development. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. fragilis, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, r. bromii, r. callidus, r. albus, bifidobacterium  longum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, eubacterium biforme, e. aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus,escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. the result was also confirmed by  using specific pcr methods for these bacteria.

TI  == design and evaluation of oligonucleotide-microarray method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == an oligonucleotide-microarray method was developed for the detection of intestinal bacteria in fecal samples collected from human subjects. the 16s rdna  sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to glass slides. cyanine5 (cy5)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or bacterial dna using two universal primers and were hybridized to the oligo-microarray. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, clostridium leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, ruminococcus bromii, ruminococcus callidus, ruminococcus albus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium infantis, eubacterium biforme, eubacterium aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the oligo-microarray method developed in this study is a reliable method for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples.

TI  == growth-inhibiting effects of cinnamomum cassia bark-derived materials on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activity of cinnamomum cassia (blume) bark-derived materials toward five intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared with that of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as four commercially available compounds (cinnamyl alcohol, trans-cinnamic acid,  eugenol, and salicylaldehyde). the biologically active component of c. cassia bark was characterized as cinnamaldehyde by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. in a test using 1 and 0.5 mg/disks, cinnamaldehyde revealed potent inhibition against clostridium perfringensand bacteroides fragilis. at 1 and 0.5 mg/disk, growth of bifidobacterium bifidum was significantly inhibited, whereas weak or no inhibitory activity was obtained against bifidobacterium longum or lactobacillus  acidophilus. the inhibitory effect was much more pronounced in cl. perfringens, b. fragilis, and bi. bifidum, compared to bi. longum or l. acidophilus. salicylaldehyde exhibited moderate growth-inhibiting activity, but little or no inhibition was observed from treatments with cinnamyl alcohol, trans-cinnamic acid, and eugenol. in contrast, tetracycline and chloramphenicol significantly inhibited growth of all test bacteria as low as 0.01 mg/disk. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of c. cassia bark.

TI  == the effect of vaginal microbes on in vivo and in vitro expression of human papillomavirus 16 e6-e7 genes.
AB  == since other viruses can influence expression of human papillomavirus (hpv) 16 e6-e7 genes in vitro, this study addressed whether specific vaginal bacteria do so as well. the vaginal microflora of 18 women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin) or normal histology and hpv 16 infection, was evaluated by quantitative culture. expression of hpv 16 e6-e7 oncogenes was assessed in exfoliated cervical cells by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. hpv 16 expression was also quantitated in caski carcinoma cell line cocultured with bacteroides fragilis or lactobacillus acidophilus. isolation of lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.05) and expression of the e6*ii transcript (p = 0.03) were associated with low-grade cin or normal histology. however, changes in e6-e7 expression were not  associated independently with isolation of a specific microorganism. similarly, expression of hpv 16 e6-e7 oncogenes in vitro was unaltered in the presence of bacteria. these results suggest that vaginal microorganisms are unlikely to alter the natural history of hpv-associated cin by influencing hpv oncogene expression.

TI  == ecological and physiological studies on large intestinal bacteria in relation to  production of hydrolytic and reductive enzymes involved in formation of genotoxic metabolites.
AB  == several hydrolytic and reductive bacterial enzymes (beta-glucuronidase, gn; beta-glucosidase, gs; arylsulphatase, as; azoreductase, ar; nitroreductase, nr) involved in production of mutagenic or genotoxic metabolites were measured in human colonic contents. cell-associated as and extracellular gs were approximately twice as high in the distal colon compared with the proximal bowel, while ar changed little throughout the gut. measurements of these enzymes in faeces from seven healthy donors confirmed that the majority were cell-associated, and demonstrated high levels of inter-individual variability. nr decreased four-fold between the proximal and distal colon while extracellular gn  was reduced by 50%. most probable number (mpn) analysis on faeces obtained from six healthy donors showed that counts of intestinal bacteria producing gs and ar  were c. 10(10) and 10(11)/g, respectively, in all samples tested. numbers of gn-  and as-forming organisms were between two and three orders of magnitude lower. inter-individual carriage rates of bacterial populations synthesising nr were highly variable. screening of 20 pure cultures of intestinal bacteria, belonging  to six different genera, showed that bacteroides ovatus, in particular, synthesised large amounts of gs, whereas b. fragilis, b. vulgatus and bifidobacterium pseudolongum formed the highest cell-associated levels of gn. in  general, bifidobacteria and lactobacillus acidophilus did not produce significant amounts of ar. all five clostridia studied (clostridium bifermentans, c. septicum, c. perfringens, c. sporogenes and c. butyricum) produced nr and ar, as  did the bacteroides (b. fragilis, b. ovatus and b. vulgatus). escherichia coli and c. perfringens formed large amounts of nr. levels of as production were invariably low and few of the organisms screened synthesised this enzyme. in-vitro studies investigating the effect of intestinal transit time on enzyme production, in a three-stage (v1-v3) continuous culture model of the colon operated at system retention times (r) of either 31.1 or 68.4 h, showed that specific activities of gs were up to four-fold higher (v3) at r = 31.1 h. bacteriological analysis demonstrated that representative populations of colonic  micro-organisms were maintained in the fermentation system, and indicated that changes in gs activity were not related to numbers of the predominant anaerobic or facultative anaerobic species within the model, but were explainable on the basis of substrate-induced modulation of bacterial metabolism.

TI  == mechanism of inhibition of tannic acid and related compounds on the growth of intestinal bacteria.
AB  == tannic acid, propyl gallate and methyl gallate, but not gallic acid, were found to be inhibitory to the growth of intestinal bacteria bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285, clostridium clostridiiforme atcc 25537, c. perfringens atcc 13124, c. paraputrificum atcc 25780, escherichia coli atcc 25922, enterobacter cloacae atcc 13047, salmonella typhimurium ta98 and s. typhimurium yg1041 at 100-1000 microg/ml in culture broth. neither bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697 nor lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 was inhibited by any of the above compounds up to 500 microg/ml. tannic acid has a much greater relative binding efficiency to iron than propyl gallate, methyl gallate or gallic acid. the inhibitory effect of tannic acid to the growth of intestinal bacteria may be due to the strong iron binding capacity of tannic acid; whereas the effect of propyl gallate and methyl  gallate probably occurs by a different mechanism. the growth of e. coli was restored by the addition of iron to the medium after the precipitate caused by tannic acid was removed. neither b. infantis nor l. acidophilus require iron for  growth. this probably contributes to their resistance to tannic acid. because tannins are abundant in the human diet, tannins may affect the growth of some intestinal bacteria and thus may have an impact on human health.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == effect of intestinal bacteria on formation of azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci in the rat colon.
AB  == the effect of intestinal bacteria on formation of azoxymethane (aom)-induced aberrant crypt foci (acf) and dna adducts in the rat colon was investigated. male sprague-dawley rats were administered cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens for five weeks and given injections of aom at 15 mg/kg body weight at the first and second weeks. the number of acf five weeks after the start of the experiment was decreased in the rats treated with the cultures or culture supernatants of l. acidophilus and c. perfringens. the half-life of o6-methylguanine (o6-meg) in the l. acidophilus group was shorter than that in the gam broth group. the half-life of 7-methylguanine did not differ among the groups. these results suggest that the metabolite(s) of l. acidophilus and c. perfringens inhibit(s) the acf formation in rats treated with aom and that the inhibitory effect of l. acidophilus is due to the enhanced removal of o6-meg from the colon mucosal dna.

TI  == effect of intestinal bacteria on incidence of liver tumors in gnotobiotic c3h/he  male mice.
AB  == the effect of intestinal microflora on liver tumorigenesis was studied in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice monoassociated, diassociated, or polyassociated with the following strains of intestinal bacteria: escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium infantis, clostridium indolis, c. paraputrificum, c. perfringens, c. innocuum, c. nexile, c. ramosum, c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides multiacidus, bacteroides fragilis, veillonella alcalescens, v. parvula, and lactobacillus acidophilus. the incidence of liver tumors was higher in most of the gnotobiotes (67--100%) and conventionalized mice (82%) derived from the germfree mice than in the germfree mice (39%). the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with e. coli, s. faecalis, and c. paraputrificum was 2.9, which was significantly higher than that in the conventionalized animals (1.6). in contrast, the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with e. coli, s. faecalis, l. acidophilus, c. perfringens, and bacteroides fragilis (0.9) was not significantly different from  that in germfree animals (0.5). the present study demonstrated that the presence  of certain intestinal bacteria is related to liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice.
