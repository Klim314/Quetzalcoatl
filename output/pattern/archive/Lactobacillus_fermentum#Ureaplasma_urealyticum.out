ureaplasma urealyticum and mycoplasma hominis sensitivity to bacteriocins produced by two lactobacilli strains.
the purpose of the present study was to determine the inhibitory activities of two bacteriocins, produced by lactobacilli, against genital mycoplasmas. in this study, infections produced by genital mycoplasmas were studied; of these, 1.3% were caused by mycoplasma hominis, 10.7% by ureaplasma urealyticum and 5.6% by u. urealyticum + m. hominis. u. urealyticum was isolated from 75 out of 123 patients with genital mycoplasmas, while m. hominis was isolated from 9 patients (7.3%) and both u. urealyticum and m. hominis from 39 patients (31.7%). bacteriocins, l23 and l60, produced by lactobacillus fermentum and l. rhamnosus, respectively, appear to be two novel inhibitors of bacterial infection with potential antibacterial activity. both bacteriocins proved to be active against 100% of strains tested; mics of bacteriocin l23 ranged between 320 and 160 ua ml(-1) for 78% of the m. hominis strains and between 320 and 80 ua ml(-1) for 95% of the u. urealyticum strains. in addition, bacteriocin l60 was still active at 160 ua ml(-1) for a high percentage (56%) of m. hominis strains, and at 80 ua ml(-1) for 53% of the u. urealyticum strains. interestingly, these antimicrobial substances produced by lactobacilli showed an inhibitory activity against genital mycoplasmas even when diluted. altogether, our study indicates that the bacteriocins, l23 and l60, are good candidates for the treatment or prevention of genital infections in women.
