bioresorbable ureteral stents from natural origin polymers.
in this work, stents were produced from natural origin polysaccharides. alginate, gellan gum, and a blend of these with gelatin were used to produce hollow tube (stents) following a combination of templated gelation and critical point carbon dioxide drying. morphological analysis of the surface of the stents was carried out by scanning electron microscopy. indwelling time, encrustation, and stability of the stents in artificial urine solution was carried out up to 60 days of immersion. in vitro studies carried out with simulated urine demonstrated that the tubes present a high fluid uptake ability, about 1000%. despite this, the materials are able to maintain their shape and do not present an extensive swelling behavior. the bioresorption profile was observed to be highly dependent on the composition of the stent and it can be tuned. complete dissolution of the materials may occur between 14 and 60 days. additionally, no encrustation was observed within the tested timeframe. the ability to resist bacterial adherence was evaluated with gram-positive staphylococcus aureus and two gram-negatives escherichia coli dh5 alpha and klebsiella oxytoca. for k. oxytoca, no differences were observed in comparison with a commercial stent (biosoft((r)) duo, porges), although, for s. aureus all tested compositions had a higher inhibition of bacterial adhesion compared to the commercial stents. in case of e. coli, the addition of gelatin to the formulations reduced the bacterial adhesion in a highly significant manner compared to the commercial stents. the stents produced by the developed technology fulfill the requirements for ureteral stents and will contribute in the development of biocompatible and bioresorbable urinary stents.
impact of ph on activity of trimethoprim, fosfomycin, amikacin, colistin and ertapenem in human urine.
objective: although major impairment of activity at lower ph values has been reported for fluoroquinolones, acidification is a widely recommended practice for the prophylaxis and treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (utis). until now, there is little evidence for the influence of ph on the activity on other antimicrobial classes in urine. methods: bacterial growth curves of staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), klebsiella oxytoca (atcc 700324), proteus mirabilis (atcc 14153), escherichia coli (atcc 25922) and enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212) were performed in mueller-hinton broth and in pooled human urine with a ph of between 5.0 and 8.0. bacterial killing of trimethoprim, fosfomycin, amikacin, colistin and ertapenem against the five strains (where appropriate) was determined consecutively at concentrations equal to the mic. results: while no difference in the bacterial growth of e. coli, s. aureus, p. mirabilis and k. oxytoca was observed at different ph values, bacterial growth of e. faecalis was significantly reduced at low ph. acidification to ph 5 impaired the antimicrobial activity of all investigated antibiotics, i.e. the net effect of bacterial growth and killing resulted in increased colony-forming units/ml at the end of the experiment. conclusion: the present in vitro findings indicate that acidification of urine during the treatment of utis should be carefully considered. while growth curves of one strain supports the concept of therapeutic or prophylactic acidification during utis, the most common pathogen, e. coli, was not affected by low ph. independent of the investigated strain or antibiotic, ph values below 6 lead to a reduction of antimicrobial activity.
microbiological and toxicological effects of perla black bean (phaseolus vulgaris l.) extracts: in vitro and in vivo studies.
we investigated the microbiological and toxicological effects of three perla black bean extracts on the growth and culture of selected pathogenic microorganisms, the toxicity over vero cell lines and an in vivo rat model. three different solvents were used to obtain perla black bean extracts. all three perla black bean extracts were tested for antibacterial and antiparasitic activity and further analysed for intrinsic cytotoxicity (ic(50)). methanol perla black bean extract was used for acute toxicity test in rats, with the up-and-down doping method. all perla black bean extracts inhibited bacterial growth. pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and listeria monocytogenes showed inhibition, while escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes did not. acidified water and acetic acid perla black bean extract were tested in parasites. the best ic(50) was observed for giardia lamblia, while higher concentrations were active against entamoeba histolytica and trichomonas vaginalis. the vero cells toxicity levels (ic(50)) for methanol, acidified water and acetic acid perla black bean extract were [mean +/- s.d. (95% ci)]: 275 +/- 6.2 (267.9-282.0), 390 +/- 4.6 (384.8-395.2) and 209 +/- 3.39 (205.6-212.4) microg/ml, respectively. in vivo acute toxicity assays did not show changes in absolute organ weights, gross and histological examinations of selected tissues or functional tests. the acetic acid and methanol perla black bean extract proved to exhibit strong antibacterial activity and the acidified water perla black bean extract exerted parasiticidal effects against giardia lamblia, entamoeba hystolitica and trichomonas vaginalis. the three perla black bean extracts assayed over vero cells showed very low toxicity and the methanol perla black bean extract in vivo did not cause toxicity.
antibiotic associated diarrhoea: infectious causes.
nearly 25% of antibiotic associated diarrhoeas (aad) is caused by clostridium difficile, making it the commonest identified and treatable pathogen. other pathogens implicated infrequently include clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella oxytoca, candida spp. and salmonella spp. most mild cases of aad are due to non-infectious causes which include reduced break down of primary bile acids and decrease metabolism of carbohydrates, allergic or toxic effects of antibiotic on intestinal mucosa and pharmacological effect on gut motility. the antibiotics most frequently associated with c. difficile associated diarrhoea are clindamycin, cephalosporin, ampicillin and amoxicillin. clinical presentation may vary from mild diarrhoea to severe colitis and pseudomembranous colitis associated with high morbidity and mortality. the most sensitive and specific diagnostic test for c. difficile infection is tissue culture assay for cytotoxicity of toxin b. commercial elisa kits are available. though less sensitive, they are easy to perform and are rapid. withdrawal of precipitating antibiotic is all that is needed for control of mild to moderate cases. for severe cases of aad, oral metronidazole is the first line of treatment, and oral vancomycin is the second choice. probiotics have been used for recurrent cases.
in vitro and in vivo activities of lb10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
in vitro activity of lb10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. against gram-positive bacteria, lb10522 was most active among the compounds tested. it was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. lb10522 was highly effective against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested. ninety percent of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. these activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, lb10522 with a mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by staphylococcus aureus giorgio, streptococcus pneumoniae iii, pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e, escherichia coli 851e, proteus mirabilis 1315e, serratia marcescens 1826e, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus ac-54. lb10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as tem-3, tem-7, shv-1, fec-1, and p-99. lb10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in enterobacter cloacae 1194e, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. time-kill study showed that lb10522, at concentrations of two or four times the mic, had a rapid bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus 6538p, escherichia coli 851e, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e.
in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of ljc 10,627.
the in vitro activity of ljc 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. ljc 10,627 inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, hafnia alvei, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, proteus rettgeri, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. ljc 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera klebsiella, enterobacter, citrobacter, and serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than ljc 10,627 against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. ljc 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis strains. ljc 10,627 inhibited streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. bacteroides fragilis and other bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of ljc 10,627 per ml. serum (50%) did not affect the mics. ljc 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of bush types 2b, 2b', tem-1, tem-2, tem-3, tem-5, tem-7, tem-9, and shv-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of bush type 1; p-99; a morganella enzyme; or a citrobacter freundii enzyme. the bush type 2c and 2d enzymes oxa-1, oxa-2, pse-1, pse-2, and pse-4 did not hydrolyze ljc 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of staphylococcus aureus, moraxella spp., bacteroides fragilis, and proteus vulgaris. the beta-lactamase of xanthomonas hydrolyzed ljc 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
review of the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
cefprozil is a newer oral cephalosporin with a spectrum of activity against organisms that include gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. a review of published data shows that cefprozil is active (susceptibility, less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml; moderate susceptibility, 16 micrograms/ml; resistance, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) against gram-positive species such as streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, and listeria monocytogenes; it may have marginal activity against some enterococci. among the gram-negative species, cefprozil has activity against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. for anaerobic species, cefprozil has activity against clostridial species, including clostridium difficile, peptostreptococci, and possibly bacteroides melaninogenicus and eubacterium. the activity of cefprozil is generally greater than that of cephalexin and generally similar to that of cefaclor. in these reports, cefprozil showed more in vitro activity than cephalexin and cefaclor against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci, beta-lactamase-positive methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and c. difficile, although the clinical significance of some of these differences has yet to be studied.
in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
the in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a c-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. cefquinome inhibited members of the enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, salmonella shigella, proteus mirabilis, morganella, and providencia. although most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) greater than 16 micrograms/ml]. serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. the majority of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. most enterococci had cefquinome mics of 4-8 micrograms/ml. cefquinome was extremely active against group-a streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae with mics less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. it inhibited some enterobacter and citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of klebsiella, branhamella, and pseudomonas, but it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-5, and tem-9. its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) for most species except for enterobacter were within a dilution of mics.
interpretive criteria of antimicrobial disk susceptibility tests with flomoxef.
320 recently isolated pathogens, 20 strains from each of 16 species, were investigated using mueller-hinton agar and din as well as nccls standards. the geometric mean of the agar dilution mics of flomoxef were 0.44 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, 0.05 mg/l (klebsiella oxytoca) to 12.6 mg/l (enterobacter spp.) for enterobacteriaceae, 33.1 mg/l for acinetobacter anitratus, 64 mg/l for enterococcus faecalis, and more than 256 mg/l for pseudomonas aeruginosa. for disk susceptibility testing of flomoxef a 30 micrograms disk loading and the following interpretation of inhibition zones using the din method were recommended: resistant-up to 22 mm (corresponding to mics of 8 mg/l or more), moderately susceptible-23 to 29 mm (corresponding to mics from 1 to 4 mg/l), and susceptible-30 mm or more (corresponding to mics of 0.5 mg/l or less). the respective values for the nccls method using the american high mic breakpoints are: resistant--up to 14 mm (corresponding to mics of 32 mg/l or more), moderately susceptible--15 to 17 mm (corresponding to mics of 16 mg/l), and susceptible--18 mm or more (corresponding to mics of 8 mg/l or less).
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
we investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. ipm had significantly high activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, providencia stuartii and pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. in a comparative study on activities of ipm against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, p. mirabilis or a. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among staphylococcus aureus, cns, s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa.
in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new carbapenem, sm-7338.
sm-7338, a new carbapenem, inhibited most members of the family enterobacteriaceae at mics of 0.015 to 0.25 microgram/ml, including klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus vulgaris isolates resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, and gentamicin. it was two- to eightfold more active than imipenem, but it inhibited pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1 to 8 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the activity of imipenem. haemophilus, neisseria, and branhamella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml, which was superior to the activity of imipenem. sm-7338 inhibited staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at 0.25 microgram/ml, but for methicillin-resistant isolates mics were 4 to 16 micrograms/ml. group a, b, and c streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.03 microgram/ml. bacteroides species, including clindamycin-resistant isolates, were inhibited by 0.25 microgram/ml. there was no major inoculum size effect, and the mbcs were within a dilution of the mics. sm-7338 was more active than imipenem at an acid ph under anaerobic conditions. plasmid beta-lactamases of tem-1, tem-2, tem-3, tem-5, shv-1, shv-2, pse-1, pse-2, pse-3, oxa-2, oxa-3, oxa-4, oxa-5, and oxa-7; staphylococcus aureus enzymes; and the chromosomal beta-lactamases p-99 and k-1; morganella species; and proteus vulgaris did not hydrolyze sm-7338. the repeated transfer of organisms increased the mics of sm-7338, as it did the mics of imipenem.
comparative in vitro susceptibilities of 504 bacteremic isolates to ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid and other antimicrobial agents.
a total of 504 clinical bacteremic isolates were tested for susceptibility to ticarcillin-clavulanic acid and 12 other antibiotics. ticarcillin-clavulanic acid showed superior antibacterial activity compared to penicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, ticarcillin, gentamicin, and amikacin against bacteremic isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. however, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid's activity was inferior to that of vancomycin against methicillin-resistant isolates of s. aureus and s. epidermidis. for escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, and lactose nonfermenting aerobic gram-negative bacilli, the activity of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid surpassed that of mezlocillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin. of the antimicrobial agents tested, ticarcillin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, and amikacin were the most active antibiotics against pseudomonas aeruginosa.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-807, a new oral cephalosporin.
cs-807 is a new oral prodrug of r-3746, a cephalosporin derivative, with potent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the susceptibility of about 1,200 clinical isolates to r-3746 was determined by the agar dilution method. ninety percent or more of pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, indole-positive and indole-negative proteus spp., providencia rettgeri, and haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations ranging less than or equal to 0.01 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. furthermore, at a concentration of 3.13 micrograms/ml, 50% or more of staphylococcus epidermidis, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens strains were also inhibited. pseudomonas aeruginosa and xanthomonas maltophilia were resistant to r-3746. the activity of r-3746 was scarcely influenced by several growth conditions. r-3746 was highly resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases derived from various species of bacteria. killing-curve studies demonstrated bactericidal activity of r-3746 at concentrations above the mic. r-3746 showed high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 1, 3, and 4 of staphylococcus aureus and 1a, 1bs, and 3 of escherichia coli. systemic infections in mice caused by various pathogens, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, responded well to therapy with oral doses of cs-807.
in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new difluoro oxacephem, 6315-s.
6315-s, a novel difluoromethyl thioacetamido oxacephem, had in vitro activity comparable to that of cefotaxime and moxalactam against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, salmonella spp., and shigella spp., inhibiting 90% at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. it inhibited piperacillin- and cefoperazone-resistant isolates in these species. 6315-s did not inhibit cefotaxime- or moxalactam-resistant citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, or enterobacter cloacae (mics for 90% of the strains tested were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml). proteus vulgaris resistant to cefotaxime was inhibited. pseudomonas species and acinetobacter species were resistant (mics greater than 64 micrograms/ml). mics for 90% of the staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis isolates were 4 micrograms/ml. 6315-s was highly active against anaerobic species of clostridium, fusobacterium, bacteroides, and peptostreptococci and was superior to other agents against these organisms. 6315-s was not hydrolyzed by the major plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it induced chromosomal beta-lactamases in enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
in vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to that of quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
pefloxacin is a new methyl-4-piperazinyl quinolone. it had mic90 values of less than 0.01 to 0.8 micrograms/ml for the majority of escherichia coli, klebsiella, oxytoca, citrobacter, providencia, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, morganella and proteus mirabilis. it inhibited ampicillin, cephalexin and nalidixic acid resistant isolates of these species. against pseudomonas the pefloxacin mic90 was 3.1 micrograms/ml. staphylococcus aureus had a mic50 of 0.4 micrograms/ml and a mic90 of 0.8 micrograms/ml and s. faecalis had a mic90 of 3.1 micrograms/ml. pefloxacin inhibited salmonella spp., salmonella typhi, shigella spp., yersinia, aeromonas, toxigenic e. coli at concentrations of less than 0.05 to 1.6 micrograms/ml, including ampicillin and trimethoprim resistant strains. there was a minimal difference in mic and mbc values in broth or serum, but major changes in mic and mbc values occurred in acid urine. increase in mic values occurred with repeated transfer in broth or urine.
