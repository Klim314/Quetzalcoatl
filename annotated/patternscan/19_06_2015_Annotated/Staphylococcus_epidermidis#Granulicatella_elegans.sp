TI  == granulicatella elegans causing periorbital infection during orthodontic treatment.
AB  == granulicatella elegans is a normal component of the oral flora and is an unusual  causative agent of infective endocarditis. a case of g. elegans periorbital infection of the eyelid after dental treatment is reported. a healthy 35-year-old man presented with painful swelling of the left upper eyelid. he was empirically  treated with oral amoxicillin for 1 week. he presented 3 months later with the same clinical features. g. elegans and staphylococcus epidermidis were identified in bacterial cultures from wound aspirates. probable relapse of periorbital infection was successfully treated with a 6-week course of oral amoxicillin. this is the first reported case of a non-bloodstream infection caused by g. elegans. clinicians should be aware of g. elegans as an unusual causative agent of periorbital infection. within the limitations of this case report, prolonged antibiotic therapy is recommended for a g. elegans periorbital infection to minimize the risk of relapse.
