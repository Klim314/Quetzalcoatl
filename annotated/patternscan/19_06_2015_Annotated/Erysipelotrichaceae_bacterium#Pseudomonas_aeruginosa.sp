TI  == effect of hypochlorous acid solution on the eradication and prevention of pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, serum biochemical variables, and cecum microbiota in rats.
AB  == in this study, hypochlorous acid solution, a weak acid, provided as drinking water to rats, was evaluated for its ability to eradicate and prevent pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, while monitoring its simultaneous effect on serum biochemical variables and microbiota in the rat cecum. the results suggest that the solution could not eliminate the bacteria in the experimentally infected rats; however, the administration of a 10-parts-per-million (ppm) hypochlorous acid solution as drinking water was effective in inhibiting horizontal spread of  p. aeruginosa infection among cage mates. additionally, exposure to hypochlorous  solution did not have any effect on serum biochemical variables of the rat including levels of total cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase (ast), alanine  aminotransferase (alt), alkaline phosphatase (alp), albumin, total bilirubin, lipase, amylase, urea nitrogen, total protein, calcium (ca), phosphorus (p), sodium (na), chlorine (cl), except for potassium (k) levels. the most frequently  isolated bacteria in the rat cecum included species belonging to bacteroidales, lactobacillus, clostridiales, erysipelotrichaceae, akkermansia, coriobacteriales, and firmicutes. the ratio of the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) peaks did not differ across rats administered with 5 and 10 ppm weak acid solution as compared to the control group for any of the bacteria,  except for erysipelotrichaceae and firmicutes, where the ratio of t-rflp peaks was higher in the 5 ppm group for erysipelotrichaceae and in the 10 ppm group for firmicutes than that in the control group (p<0.01). the results suggest that the  weak acid hypochlorous solution could not eradicate p. aeruginosa completely from rats. the solution was effective in preventing infection without affecting serum  biochemical variables; however, some of bacterial microbiota may have changed due to administration of the solution.
