TI  == molecular identification and quantification of lactic acid bacteria in traditional fermented dairy foods of russia.
AB  == russian traditional fermented dairy foods have been consumed for thousands of years. however, little research has focused on exploiting lactic acid bacteria (lab) resources and analyzing the lab composition of russian traditional fermented dairy foods. in the present study, we cultured lab isolated from fermented mare and cow milks, sour cream, and cheese collected from kalmykiya, buryats, and tuva regions of russia. seven lactobacillus species and the bifidobacterium genus were quantified by quantitative pcr. the lab counts in these samples ranged from 3.18 to 9.77 log cfu/ml (or per gram). in total, 599 lab strains were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. the identified lab belonged to 7 genera and 30 species by 16s  rrna and mure gene sequencing and multiplex pcr assay. the predominant lab isolates were lactobacillus helveticus (176 strains) and lactobacillus plantarum  (63 strains), which represented 39.9% of all isolates. the quantitative pcr results revealed that counts of 7 lactobacilli species and bifidobacterium spp. of 30 fermented cow milk samples ranged from 1.19 +/- 0.34 (lactobacillus helveticus in tuva) to 8.09 +/- 0.71 (lactobacillus acidophilus in kalmykiya) log cfu/ml of fermented cow milk (mean +/- standard error). the numbers of bifidobacterium spp., lb. plantarum, lb. helveticus, and lb. acidophilus revealed no significant difference between the 3 regions; nevertheless, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus sakei, and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus exhibited different degrees of variation across 3 regions. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of russia have complex compositions of lab species. the diversity of lab might be related to the type of fermented dairy product, geographical origin, and manufacturing process.

TI  == proteolytic and ace-inhibitory activities of probiotic yogurt containing non-viable bacteria as affected by different levels of fat, inulin and starter culture.
AB  == in this study, the effects of fat (0.5 %, 3.2 % and 5.0 %), inulin (0.0 and 1.0 %) and starter culture (0.0 %, 0.5 %, 1.0 % and 1.5 %) on the angiotensin converting enzyme (ace)-inhibitory activity of probiotic yogurt containing non-viable bacteria were assessed. proteolytic activities of bacteria were also investigated. yogurts were prepared either using a sole yogurt commercial culture including streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subs. bulgaricus or bifidobacterium animalis bb-12 and lactobacillus acidophilus la5 in addition to yogurt culture. relative degrees of proteolysis were found to be considerably higher in yogurt samples than uht milk as the control. both regular  and probiotic yogurts showed considerable ace-inhibitory activities. results showed that degree of proteolysis was not influenced by different fat contents, while was increased by high concentration of starter culture (1.5 % w/w) and reduced by inulin (1 % w/w). ace-inhibitory activities of yogurt were also negatively affected by the presence of inulin and high levels of fat (5 % w/w). moreover, yogurt containing probiotic bacteria showed higher inhibitory against ace in comparison to the yogurt prepared with non-probiotic strains.

TI  == plant extract enhances the viability of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus acidophilus in probiotic nonfat yogurt.
AB  == a commercial plant extract (prepared from olive, garlic, onion and citrus extracts with sodium acetate (sa) as a carrier) was evaluated to extend the viability of yogurt starter and probiotic bacteria as a means to enhance the shelf life of live and active culture, probiotic nonfat yogurt. yogurts prepared  from three different formulas (0.5* plant extract, 0.25* sa, or no supplement) and cultures (yogurt starter plus bifidobacterium animalis,lactobacillus acidophilus, or both probiotics) were assessed weekly during 29 days of storage at 5 degrees c. supplemented yogurt mixes had greater buffering capacities than non-supplemented yogurt mixes. at the end of storage, lactobacillus bulgaricus and l. acidophilus counts in supplemented yogurts were greater compared with non-supplemented yogurts. supplementation did not affect streptococcus thermophilus and b. animalis counts. hence the greater buffering capacity of yogurt containing plant extract could enhance the longevity of the probiotics, l. bulgaricus and l. acidophilus, during storage.

TI  == local probiotic therapy for vaginal candida albicans infections.
AB  == the high rate of vaginal candida albicans recurrence is attributed to azole resistance rates as high as 15 %. the aim of this study was to determine the clinical and microbiological efficacy of standard azole therapy for treatment of  vaginal c. albicans infection alone and in combination with local probiotic as well as the effects on vaginal microbiota. this study included 436 women with vaginal candidiasis randomly assigned to two treatment groups. the first group, with 207 patients (12 dropouts), was administered 150 mg fluconazole and a single vaginal globule of fenticonazole (600 mg) on the same day. the second group of 209 patients (8 dropouts) followed the same treatment schedule; however, ten applications of a vaginal probiotic containing lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus, and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus were  also administered beginning the fifth day after azole treatment. microbiological  analysis of the therapy efficacy in the first treatment group showed c. albicans  resistance in over 30 % of patients. clinical complaints persisted after treatment administration in 79.7 % (n = 165) of women in this group. clinical complaints in the second group decreased to 31.1 % (n = 65) and microbiological efficacy also improved among investigated parameters, from 93.7 % (n = 193) to 95.2 % (n = 198). the local application of probiotics after administration of combined azoles for treatment of vaginal c. albicans infections increases therapy efficacy and could prevent relapse.

TI  == cell growth and proteolytic activity of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus  helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus in milk as affected by supplementation with peptide fractions.
AB  == the present investigation examined the effects of supplementation of milk peptide fractions produced by enzymatic hydrolysis on the fermentation of reconstituted skim milk (rsm). changes in ph, cell growth, proteolytic activity, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace)-inhibitory activity were monitored during fermentation of rsm by pure cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus  helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus. the study showed that supplementation with peptide fractions of different molecular weights did not significantly affect the bacterial growth in  rsm. all bacteria showed an increased proteolytic activity in rsm supplemented with large peptides (>10 kda), and l. helveticus in general exhibited the highest proteolytic activity among the bacteria studied. the ace-inhibitory activity was  observed to be the maximum in rsm supplemented with larger peptides (>10 kda) for all bacteria. the results suggest that proteolysis by bacteria leads to increased production of ace-inhibitory peptides compared to the supplemented peptides produced by enzymatic hydrolysis.

TI  == co-culture fermentation of peanut-soy milk for the development of a novel functional beverage.
AB  == most of the commercial probiotic products are dairy-based, and the development of non-dairy probiotic products could be an alternative for new functional products. the peanut-soy milk (psm(1)) was inoculated with six different lactic acid bacteria (lab), including probiotic strains and yeasts and fermentation was accomplished for 24h at 37 degrees c and afterwards, another 24h at +/-4 degrees  c. the pediococcus acidilactici (ufla bffcx 27.1), lactococcus lactis (cct 0360), lactobacillus rhamnosus (lr 32) probiotic lab, and the lactobacillus delbrueckii  subsp. bulgaricus (lb 340) yogurt starter culture reached cell concentrations of  about 8.3log cfu/ml during fermentation. however, these strains were not able to  acidify the substrate when inoculated as pure culture. the lactobacillus acidophilus (laca 4) probiotic produced significant amounts of lactic acid (3.35  g/l) and rapidly lowered the ph (4.6). saccharomyces cerevisiae (ufla yffbm 18.03) did not completely consume the available sugars in psm and consequently produced low amounts of ethanol (0.24 g/l). in pure culture, s. cerevisiae (ufla  yffbm 18.03), l. rhamnosus (lr 32), l. acidophilus (laca 4), and p. acidilactici  (ufla bffcx 27.1) promoted the increase of total amino acids (48.02%, 47.32%, 46.21% and, 44.07%, respectively). however, when in co-cultured, the strains consumed the free amino acids favoring their growth, and reaching the population  of 8log cfu/ml in psm. lactic acid production increased, and 12 h was required to reach a ph value of 4.3. in general, the strains were more efficient in the use of available carbohydrates and release of metabolites in co-cultured than in single culture fermentations. an average of 58% and 78% of available carbohydrates was consumed when single and co-cultures were evaluated, respectively. higher lactic acid contents were found in a binary culture of p. acidilactici (ufla bffcx 27.1) and l. acidophilus (laca 4), and by co-culture of  p. acidilactici (ufla bffcx 27.1), l. acidophilus (laca 4) and s. cerevisiae (ufla yffbm 18.03) (9.03 and 8.51 g/l, respectively). the final content of ethanol was 0.03% (v/v) or less, which classified the final beverage as non-alcoholic.

TI  == probiotic viability and storage stability of yogurts and fermented milks prepared with several mixtures of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == currently, the food industry wants to expand the range of probiotic yogurts but each probiotic bacteria offers different and specific health benefits. little information exists on the influence of probiotic strains on physicochemical properties and sensory characteristics of yogurts and fermented milks. six probiotic yogurts or fermented milks and 1 control yogurt were prepared, and we evaluated several physicochemical properties (ph, titratable acidity, texture, color, and syneresis), microbial viability of starter cultures (lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus) and probiotics (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus reuteri) during fermentation and storage (35 d at 5 degrees c), as well as sensory preference among them. decreases in ph (0.17 to 0.50 units) and increases in titratable acidity (0.09 to 0.29%) were observed during storage. only the yogurt  with s. thermophilus, l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and l. reuteri differed in  firmness. no differences in adhesiveness were determined among the tested yogurts, fermented milks, and the control. syneresis was in the range of 45 to 58%. no changes in color during storage were observed and no color differences were detected among the evaluated fermented milk products. counts of s. thermophilus decreased from 1.8 to 3.5 log during storage. counts of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus also decreased in probiotic yogurts and varied from 30 to 50% of initial population. probiotic bacteria also lost viability throughout storage, although the 3 probiotic fermented milks maintained counts >/= 10(7)cfu/ml for 3 wk. probiotic bacteria had variable viability in yogurts, maintaining counts of l. acidophilus >/= 10(7) cfu/ml for 35 d, of l. casei for 7d, and of l. reuteri for 14 d. we found no significant sensory preference among  the 6 probiotic yogurts and fermented milks or the control. however, the yogurt and fermented milk made with l. casei were better accepted. this study presents relevant information on physicochemical, sensory, and microbial properties of probiotic yogurts and fermented milks, which could guide the dairy industry in developing new probiotic products.

TI  == characterization of pmc11, a plasmid with dual origins of replication isolated from lactobacillus casei mcj and construction of shuttle vectors with each replicon.
AB  == many lactic acid bacteria carry different plasmids, particularly those that replicate via a theta mechanism. here we describe lactobacillus casei mcj(cctcc ab20130356), a new isolate that contains pmc11, carrying two distinct theta-type  replicons. each replicon contained an iteron in the origin of replication (oriv1  or oriv2) and a gene coding for the replicase (repa_1 or repb_1), both of which are essential for plasmid replication. escherichia coli/lactobacillus shuttle vectors were constructed with each replicon, yielding pel5.7 and pel5.6 that are  based on oriv2 and oriv1 replicons, respectively. these plasmids showed distinct  properties: pel5.7 was capable of replicating in l. casei mcjdelta1 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactic lbch-1 but failed to do so in two other tested lactobacilli strains whereas pel5.6 replicated in three different strains, including l. casei mcjdelta1, l. casei nj, lactobacillus paracasei lpc-37 and l.  delbrueckii subsp. lactic lbch-1. plasmid stability was studied: pel5.6 and pel5.7 were very stably maintained in l. casei, as the loss rate was lower than 1 % per generation. pel5.7 was also stable in l. delbrueckii subsp. lactic lbch-1 with the loss rate estimated to be 3 %. these vectors were employed to express a  green fluorescent protein (gfp) using the promoter of s-layer protein slpa from lactobacillus acidophilus. and a growth-phase regulated expression of gfp was observed in different strains. in conclusion, these shuttle vectors provide efficient genetic tools for dna cloning and heterologous gene expression in lactobacilli.

TI  == antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties of biosurfactant produced by lactobacilli isolates, biofilm formation and aggregation ability.
AB  == this study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties of biosurfactant extracted from ten lactobacilli species isolated from egyptian dairy products. the produced biosurfactants showed distinct antimicrobial and anti-adhesive activities against several pathogenic microorganisms. furthermore,  lactobacilli isolates were studied for biofilm formation and lactic acid production in different growth media. all lactobacilli isolates produced biofilm  on polystyrene surface in all media tested to different degrees. l. acidophilus showed the highest biofilm formation in rogosa medium. however, the highest lactic acid production was recorded by l. brevis (39.63 g/l), followed by l. reuteri (33.32 g/l) in mrs medium. evaluation based on in vitro studies including auto-aggregation and co-aggregation with three pathogenic bacterial strains was further analyzed. all lactobacilli isolates tested were able to auto-aggregate (ranging from 51.12% to 78.17% assessed at 5 h of incubation). the lactobacilli isolates co-aggregate with the tested bacterial strains to different degrees; among them l. delbrueckii showed the highest scores of co-aggregation with candida albicans atc70014, reaching 59.37%. the aggregation ability exhibited by  the isolated lactobacilli, together with the antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties observed for their biosurfactants, opens future prospects for their use against microorganisms responsible for diseases and infections and as effective probiotic strains.

TI  == probiotic therapy: a promising strategy for the control of canine hookworm.
AB  == canis familiaris is a domestic animal which plays an important role as a pet; however, it is very likely to develop diseases characterized by high morbidity and mortality. in this sense, there are some ancylostomatidae species that can lead to anemia, weight loss, and abdominal pain. therefore, the treatment with allopathic drugs is essential for eliminating the parasitism. however, the increasing occurrence of resistance to allopathic treatments stimulates the search for new therapeutic inputs, among which the probiotics stand out and are able to positively alter the intestinal microbiota and exert immunomodulatory effect. therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the applicability of using species of lactobacillus (l. acidophilus atcc 4536, l. plantarum atcc 8014, and l. delbrueckii ufv h2b20) to control canine ancylostomiasis. a probiotic preparation containing 1 x 10(6) cfu of each strain was administered to 10 naturally infected animals, on alternate days for 28 days. it was observed that the treatment with the probiotic preparation led to a significant reduction in epg of feces (88.83%/ p < 0.05), as well as an increase in leukocyte and lymphocyte counts, highlighting the potential use of lactobacillus species in the control of canine ancylostomiasis.

TI  == peptidoglycan hydrolases as species-specific markers to differentiate lactobacillus helveticus from lactobacillus gallinarum and other closely related  homofermentative lactobacilli.
AB  == we propose a new method that allows accurate discrimination of lactobacillus helveticus from other closely related homofermentative lactobacilli, especially lactobacillus gallinarum. this method is based on the amplification by pcr of two peptidoglycan hydrolytic genes, lhv_0190 and lhv_0191. these genes are ubiquitous and show high homology at the intra-species level. the pcr method gave two specific pcr products, of 542 and 747 bp, for 25 l. helveticus strains coming from various sources. for l. gallinarum, two amplicons were obtained, the specific 542 bp amplicon and another one with a size greater than 1,500 bp. no specific pcr products were obtained for 12 other closely related species of lactobacilli, including the l. acidophilus complex, l. delbrueckii, and l. ultunensis. the developed pcr method provided rapid, precise, and easy identification of l. helveticus. moreover, it enabled differentiation between the two closely phylogenetically related species l. helveticus and l. gallinarum.

TI  == [identification of lactic acid bacteria in commercial yogurt and their antibiotic resistance].
AB  == objective: to identify lactic acid bacteria (lab) in commercial yogurts and investigate their antibiotic resistance. methods: labs were cultured from 5 yogurt brands and the isolates were identified at the species level by 16s rrna sequence. genotyping was performed by repetitive extragenic palindromic pcr (rep-pcr). the sensitivity to 7 antibiotics was tested for all lab isolates by kirby-bauer paper diffusion (k-b method). meanwhile, 9 antibiotic resistance genes (args), including erythromycin resistance genes (erma and ermb) and tetracycline resistance genes (tetm, tetk, tets, tetq, teto, tetl and tetw), were detected by pcr amplification in the identified lab isolates. the pcr products were confirmed by sequencing. results: total 100 labs were isolated, including 23 lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, 26 lactobacillus casei, 30 streptococcus thermophilus, 5 lactobacillus acidophilus, 6 lactobacillus plantarum, and 10 lactobacillus paracasei. the drug susceptibility test shows that all 100 isolates were resistant to gentamicin and streptomycin, 42 isolates  were resistant to vancomycin, and on the contrary all were sensitive to cefalexin, erythromycin, tetracycline and oxytetracycline. moreover, 5 args were  found in the 28 sequencing confirmed isolates, ermb gene was detected in 8 isolates, tet k in 4 isolates, tetl in 2 isolates, tetm in 4 isolates, teto in 2  isolates. erm a, tet s, tet q and tet w genes were not detected in the isolates.  antibiotic resistance genes were found in 53.57% (15/28) sequenced isolates, 2 -3 antibiotic resistance genes were detected in 4 isolates of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. conclusions: some labs were not labeled in commercial yogurt products. antibiotic resistance genes tend to be found in the starter culture of  l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus. all the lab isolates were sensitive to erythromycin and tetracycline, even though some carried erythromycin and/or tetracycline resistance genes. we proved again that lab could carry antibiotic resistance gene(s) though it is sensitive to antibiotics.

TI  == the influences of fish infusion broth on the biogenic amines formation by lactic  acid bacteria.
AB  == the influences of fish infusion decarboxylase broth (idb) on biogenic amines (ba) formation by lactic acid bacteria (lab) were investigated. ba productions by single lab strains were tested in five different fish (anchovy, mackerel, white shark, sardine and gilthead seabream) idb. the result of the study showed that significant differences in ammonia (amn) and ba production were observed among the lab strains in fish idb (p < 0.05). the highest amn and tma production by lab strains were observed for white shark idb. the all tested bacteria had decarboxylation activity in fish idb. the uppermost accumulated amines by lab strains were tyramine (tym), dopamine, serotonin and spermidine. the maximum histamine production was observed in sardine (101.69 mg/l) and mackerel (100.84 mg/l) idb by leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris and pediococcus acidophilus, respectively. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and pediococcus acidophilus had a high tym producing capability (2943 mg/l and 1157 mg/l) in sardine idb.

TI  == evaluation of probiotic survivability in yogurt exposed to cold chain interruption.
AB  == in this research, the survival of probiotic microorganisms in yogurts stored at room temperature (cold chain interruption conditions) was studied. milk inoculated with yogurt bacteria (mixed culture of streptococcus thermophilus and  lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus) and a single probiotic culture (l. acidophilus la-5 or bifidobacterium lactis bb- 12 or l. rhamnosus hn001 or l. paracasei lpc-37) were incubated till ph of 4.5 was reached. probiotic yogurts were stored at two different temperatures including cold (control) and room temperatures (5 and 20 degrees c, respectively). changes in ph decrease, titratable acidity increase and redox potential increase as well as the viability of probiotics per 6 h intervals during an assumptive interrupted cold storage (24 h) were monitored. the survival of probiotics was strongly dependent on the storage temperature and remarkable viability loss occurred in room temperature compared to refrigerated storage. in addition, the survivability was dependent on probiotic strain. among our experimental strains, b. lactis bb-12 showed the less resistance to be stored at 20 degrees c (24 h) and referring to the recommended minimum numbers of 10(7) cfu ml(-) (1), l. rhamnosus hn001 was the most suitable  probiotic strain to be used in probiotic yogurts especially in countries having high possibility of cold chain interruption during storage.

TI  == species-specific quantification of probiotic lactobacilli in yoghurt by quantitative real-time pcr.
AB  == aims: lactobacilli strains with probiotic effects have been widely used in dairy  products such as yoghurts as well as in food additives and pharmaceuticals. despite their successful commercial application, the current species identification and quantification methods of the genus lactobacillus are time-consuming and labour-intensive. methods and results: to fulfil the requirements of a robust quality management, we have developed a quantitative real-time pcr assay based on the heat shock protein 60 gene (hsp60) for accurate  identification and quantification of five commercially important lactobacillus species. the developed assay allows an unambiguous species-specific detection of  the species lact. acidophilus, lact. brevis, lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lact. helveticus and lact. reuteri from bacterial cultures as well as directly from dairy products for instance yoghurt. conclusions: with the assay, we were able to specifically detect lactobacilli strains down to 10(5) cfu ml(-1) directly from yoghurt, which is a sufficient detection limit as commercial products usually contain 10(6) -10(12) cfu ml(-1) of probiotic strains. significance and impact of the study: the real-time pcr assay developed here might become a convenient tool enabling an accurate, fast and sensitive detection of probiotic lactobacilli commercially used in food.

TI  == diversity in proteinase specificity of thermophilic lactobacilli as revealed by hydrolysis of dairy and vegetable proteins.
AB  == ability of industrially relevant species of thermophilic lactobacilli strains to  hydrolyze proteins from animal (caseins and beta-lactoglobulin) and vegetable (soybean and wheat) sources, as well as influence of peptide content of growth medium on cell envelope-associated proteinase (cep) activity, was evaluated. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis (crl 581 and 654), l. delbrueckii subsp.  bulgaricus (crl 454 and 656), lactobacillus acidophilus (crl 636 and 1063), and lactobacillus helveticus (crl 1062 and 1177) were grown in a chemically defined medium supplemented or not with 1 % casitone. all strains hydrolyzed mainly beta-casein, while degradation of alphas-caseins was strain dependent. contrariwise, kappa-casein was poorly degraded by the studied lactobacilli. beta-lactoglobulin was mainly hydrolyzed by crl 656, crl 636, and crl 1062 strains. the l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis strains, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus crl 656, and l. helveticus crl 1177 degraded gliadins in high extent,  while the l. acidophilus and l. helveticus strains highly hydrolyzed soy proteins. proteinase production was inhibited by casitone, the most affected being the l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis species. this study highlights the importance of proteolytic diversity of lactobacilli for rational strain selection when formulating hydrolyzed dairy or vegetable food products.

AB  == inflammation plays an important role in triggering fibrosis of cardiovascular disease and hypertension. gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) has hypotensive effect;  gaba concentration could be enhanced in milk fermented with lactic acid bacteria  (lab). this study evaluated the effect of probiotic-fermented purple sweet potato yogurt (pspy) on the toll-like receptor 4 (tlr-4)-related inflammatory components, and on fibrosis in the heart of spontaneously hypertensive rat (shr). tlr4-related pathway and fibrosis-associated proteins tgfbeta and fgf2 were significantly increased in shr hearts, but were highly suppressed in 10% pspy-fed rats. microscopic examination with masson trichrome staining of left ventricle further demonstrated that 10% and 100% pspy both significantly reduced interstitial fibrosis in shr hearts. these findings indicated that oral administration of 10% probiotic-fermented pspy was strong enough to lower cardiac fibrosis in shr rats through the suppression of tlr-4-related inflammatory pathway. therefore, pspy may be included in diets to help prevent cardiac fibrosis in patients with hypertension.

TI  == a mild pulsed electric field condition that improves acid tolerance, growth, and  protease activity of lactobacillus acidophilus la-k and lactobacillus delbrueckii subspecies bulgaricus lb-12.
AB  == pulsed electric field (pef) processing involves the application of pulses of voltage for less than 1 s to fluid products placed between 2 electrodes. the effect of mild pef on beneficial characteristics of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus is not clearly understood. the objective of this study was to determine the influence of mild pef conditions on acid tolerance, growth, and protease activity of lb. acidophilus la-k and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus lb-12. a pilot plant pef system (osu-4m; the ohio state university, columbus) was used. the pef  treatments were positive square unipolar pulse width of 3 micros, pulse period of 0.5s, electric field strength of 1 kv/cm, delay time of 20 micros, flow rate of 60 ml/min, and 40.5 degrees c pef treatment temperature. both lb. acidophilus la-k and lb. bulgaricus lb-12 subjected to mild pef conditions were acid tolerant until the end of the 120 min of incubation, unlike the lb. bulgaricus control, which was not acid tolerant after 30 min. the mild pef-treated lb. acidophilus la-k and lb. bulgaricus lb-12 reached the logarithmic phase of growth an hour earlier than the control. mild pef conditions studied significantly improved acid tolerance, exponential growth, and protease activity of both lb. acidophilus la-k and lb. bulgaricus lb-12 compared with the control. the mild pef conditions studied can be recommended for pretreating cultures to enhance these desirable attributes.

TI  == prospective, randomized, open-label trial comparing the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of an acne treatment regimen with and without a probiotic supplement and minocycline in subjects with mild to moderate acne.
AB  == background: systemic antibiotics are an effective treatment for acne vulgaris. however, intolerable side effects may invariably occur. objective: to determine whether probiotics reduce the side effects imparted by systemic antibiotics while working synergistically with the latter in treating inflammatory acne. methods: forty-five 18- to 35-year-old females were randomly assigned to one of three arms in this prospective, open-label study. group a received probiotic supplementation, whereas group b received only minocycline. group c was treated with both probiotic and minocycline. clinical and subjective assessments were completed at baseline and during the 2-, 4-, 8-, and 12-week follow-up visits. results: all patients demonstrated a significant improvement in total lesion count 4 weeks after treatment initiation (p < .001), with continued improvement seen with each subsequent follow-up visit (p < .01). at the 8- and 12-week follow-up visits, group c had a significant decrease in total lesion count versus groups a (p < .001) and b (p < .01). two patients (13%) from group b failed to complete the study secondary to vaginal candidiasis. conclusion: probiotics may be considered a therapeutic option or adjunct for acne vulgaris by providing a synergistic antiinflammatory effect with systemic antibiotics while also reducing potential adverse events secondary to chronic antibiotic use.

TI  == distribution dynamics of recombinant lactobacillus in the gastrointestinal tract  of neonatal rats.
AB  == one approach to deliver therapeutic agents, especially proteins, to the gastro-intestinal (gi) tract is to use commensal bacteria as a carrier. genus lactobacillus is an attractive candidate for use in this approach. however, a system for expressing exogenous proteins at a high level has been lacking in lactobacillus. moreover, it will be necessary to introduce the recombinant lactobacillus into the gi tract, ideally by oral administration. whether orally administered lactobacillus can reach and reside in the gi tract has not been explored in neonates. in this study, we have examined these issues in neonatal rats. to achieve a high level of protein expression in lactobacillus, we tested the impact of three promoters and two backbones on protein expression levels using mrfp1, a red fluorescent protein, as a reporter. we found that a combination of an l-lactate dehydrogenase (ldhl) promoter of lactobacillus sakei  with a backbone from plem415 yielded the highest level of reporter expression. when this construct was used to transform lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii and lactobacillus acidophilus, high levels of mrfp1 were detected in  all these species and colonies of transformed lactobacillus appeared pink under visible light. to test whether orally administered lactobacillus can be retained  in the gi tract of neonates, we fed the recombinant lactobacillus casei to neonatal rats. we found that about 3% of the bacteria were retained in the gi tract of the rats at 24 h after oral feeding with more recombinant lactobacillus  in the stomach and small intestine than in the cecum and colon. no mortality was  observed throughout this study with lactobacillus. in contrast, all neonatal rats died within 24 hours after fed with transformed e. coli. taken together, our results indicate that lactobacillus has the potential to be used as a vehicle for the delivery of therapeutic agents to neonates.

TI  == metabolism of biodiesel-derived glycerol in probiotic lactobacillus strains.
AB  == three probiotic lactobacillus strains, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus delbrueckii, were tested for their ability to assimilate and metabolize glycerol. biodiesel-derived glycerol was used as the main carbon and energy source in batch microaerobic growth. here, we show that the tested strains were able to assimilate glycerol, consuming between 38 and 48  % in approximately 24 h. l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii showed a similar growth, higher than l. plantarum. the highest biomass reached was 2.11 g l(-)(1)  for l. acidophilus, with a cell mass yield (y (x/s)) of 0.37 g g(-)(1). l. delbrueckii and l. plantarum reached a biomass of 2.06 and 1.36 g l(-)(1). all strains catabolize glycerol mainly through glycerol kinase (ec 2.7.1.30). for these lactobacillus species, kinetic parameters for glycerol kinase showed michaelis-menten constant (k(m)) ranging from 1.2 to 3.8 mm. the specific activities for glycerol kinase in these strains were in the range of 0.18 to 0.58 u mg protein(-)(1), with l. acidophilus atcc 4356 showing the maximum specific activity after 24 h of cultivation. glycerol dehydrogenase activity was also detected in all strains studied but only for the reduction of glyceraldehyde with nadph (k(m) for dl-glyceraldehyde ranging from 12.8 to 32.3 mm). this enzyme shows a very low oxidative activity with glycerol and nadp+ and, most likely, under physiological conditions, the oxidative reaction does not occur, supporting the assumption that the main metabolic flux concerning glycerol metabolism is through the glycerol kinase pathway.

TI  == comparative study of the protective capacity against salmonella infection between probiotic and nonprobiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == aims: to investigate the immunoprotective ability of three lactobacilli strains against salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium in a mouse model. to identify the probiotic properties involved in the protection against infection caused by this  pathogen. methods and results: the immunomodulatory effect of three different lactobacilli strains: lactobacillus (lact.) casei crl 431 (probiotic bacterium),  lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus crl 423 (lact. bulgaricus) and lact.acidophilus crl 730 was compared using a mouse model of salmonella infection. lactobacillus casei continuous administration improved animal survival, diminished pathogen spreading outside the intestine, attenuated the intestinal inflammation, modulated cytokine profile previous and postinfection and increased the expression and secretion of iga in the gut. additionally, the administration of this lactobacilli increased peritoneal, peyer's patches and spleen macrophages' phagocytic activity in healthy mice and monocyte chemotactic  protein (mcp-1) released by intestinal epithelial cells in an in vitro assay. although lact. acidophilus increased the number of iga-secreting cells previous and postinfection, and lact. bulgaricus increased mcp-1 released by intestinal epithelial cells and the phagocytic activity of macrophages, these effects alone  were not enough to confer protection against salmonella typhimurium infection in  mouse. conclusions: probiotic strain lact. casei crl 431 was the one that induced protection against salmonella, by increasing the intestinal barrier function and  by decreasing the local inflammatory response. significance and impact of the study: salmonella spp. constitutes an important agent of foodborne diseases in the world. not all lactobacilli, even with some immunostimulating properties at gut level, can protect against salmonella infection. lactobacillus casei crl 431, a probiotic bacterium, could be useful as an oral mucosal adjuvant of the immune  system to improve gut health, especially in the prevention or amelioration of salmonella infections. we demonstrated that there is not a unique mechanism by which this protective effect was exerted.

TI  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of metabolites from lactobacillus strains on candida species implicated in candida vaginitis.
AB  == background: research from developing countries, such as nigeria, on lactobacillus species in the female urogenital tract and their role as a barrier to vaginal infection is limited. therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the clinical biotherapeutic potential of indigenous lactobacillus species. methods: antimicrobial metabolites production were characterised using simple and easily reproducible qualitative and quantitative methods. the in vitro inhibitory effect of lactobacillus antimicrobials on vulvovaginal candidiasis-associated candida species was investigated using modified agar spot and agar well-diffusion methods. results: the maximum levels of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and diacetyl from 20 vaginal lactobacillus strains from diseased subjects were 1.46 mg/l, 1.36 mmol/l, and 1.72 mg/l respectively. from the 4 healthy subjects, the maximum level of lactic acid was 1.08 mg/l; hydrogen peroxide, 1.36 mmol/l; and diacetyl, 0.86 mg/l. the maximum productions of these substances occurred between 72 and 120 hours of incubation. the in vitro antagonistic activities of vaginal l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. casei, l. delbrueckii,  and l. jensenii from diseased subjects inhibited a maximum of 5.71% of the 35 candida species tested, while vaginal l. acidophilus and l. plantarum from healthy subjects inhibited between 57.1% and 68.6% of candida species in vitro. conclusion: antimicrobial-producing lactobacilli can be considered as adjunct biotherapeutic candidates for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis.

TI  == diversity in growth and protein degradation by dairy relevant lactic acid bacteria species in reconstituted whey.
AB  == the high nutritional value of whey makes it an interesting substrate for the development of fermented foods. the aim of this work was to evaluate the growth and proteolytic activity of sixty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria in whey to further formulate a starter culture for the development of fermented whey-based beverages. fermentations were performed at 37 degrees c for 24 h in 10 and 16% (w/v) reconstituted whey powder. cultivable populations, ph, and proteolytic activity (o-phthaldialdehyde test) were determined at 6 and 24 h incubation. hydrolysis of whey proteins was analysed by tricine sds-page. a principal component analysis (pca) was applied to evaluate the behaviour of strains. forty-six percent of the strains grew between 1 and 2 deltalog cfu/ml while 19% grew less than 0.9 deltalog cfu/ml in both reconstituted whey solutions. regarding the proteolytic activity, most of the lactobacilli released amino acids and small peptides during the first 6 h incubation while streptococci consumed the amino acids initially present in whey to sustain growth. whey proteins were degraded by the studied strains although to different extents. special attention  was paid to the main allergenic whey protein, beta-lactoglobulin, which was degraded the most by lactobacillus acidophilus crl 636 and lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus crl 656. the strain variability observed and the pca applied in this study allowed selecting appropriate strains able to improve the nutritional characteristics (through amino group release and protein degradation) and storage (decrease in ph) of whey.

TI  == discrimination of the lactobacillus acidophilus group using sequencing, species-specific pcr and snapshot mini-sequencing technology based on the reca gene.
AB  == background: to clearly identify specific species and subspecies of the lactobacillus acidophilus group using phenotypic and genotypic (16s rdna sequence analysis) techniques alone is difficult. the aim of this study was to use the reca gene for species discrimination in the l. acidophilus group, as well as to develop a species-specific primer and single nucleotide polymorphism primer based on the reca gene sequence for species and subspecies identification. results: the average sequence similarity for the reca gene among type strains was 80.0%, and most members of the l. acidophilus group could be clearly distinguished. the species-specific primer was designed according to the reca gene sequencing, which was employed for polymerase chain reaction with the template dna of lactobacillus strains. a single 231-bp species-specific band was found only in l. delbrueckii.  a snapshot mini-sequencing assay using reca as a target gene was also developed.  the specificity of the mini-sequencing assay was evaluated using 31 strains of l. delbrueckii species and was able to unambiguously discriminate strains belonging  to the subspecies l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. conclusion: the phylogenetic  relationships of most strains in the l. acidophilus group can be resolved using reca gene sequencing, and a novel method to identify the species and subspecies of the l. delbrueckii and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was developed by species-specific polymerase chain reaction combined with snapshot mini-sequencing.

TI  == effects of probiotics and antibiotics on the intestinal homeostasis in a computer controlled model of the large intestine.
AB  == background: antibiotic associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection are frequent complications of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. probiotic bacteria are used as therapeutic and preventive agents in these disorders, but the exact functional mechanisms and the mode of action are poorly understood. the effects of clindamycin and the probiotic mixture vsl#3 (containing the 8 bacterial strains streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) consecutively or in combination were investigated and compared to controls without therapy using a standardized human fecal microbiota in a computer-controlled in vitro model of large intestine. microbial metabolites (short chain fatty acids, lactate, branched chain fatty acids, and ammonia) and the intestinal microbiota were analyzed. results: compared to controls and combination therapy, short chain fatty acids and lactate, but also ammonia and branched chain fatty acids, were increased under probiotic therapy. the metabolic pattern under combined therapy with antibiotics and probiotics had the most beneficial and consistent effect on intestinal metabolic profiles. the intestinal microbiota showed a decrease in several indigenous bacterial groups under antibiotic therapy, there was no significant recovery of these groups when the antibiotic therapy was followed by administration of probiotics. simultaneous application of anti- and probiotics had a stabilizing effect on the intestinal microbiota with increased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. conclusions: administration of vsl#3 parallel with the clindamycin therapy had a beneficial and stabilizing effect on the intestinal metabolic homeostasis by decreasing toxic metabolites and protecting the endogenic microbiota from destruction. probiotics could be a reasonable strategy in prevention of antibiotic associated  disturbances of the intestinal homeostasis and disorders.

TI  == genes involved in lactose catabolism and organic acid production during growth of lactobacillus delbrueckii ufv h2b20 in skimmed milk.
AB  == there are three main reasons for using lactic acid bacteria (lab) as starter cultures in industrial food fermentation processes: food preservation due to lactic acid production; flavour formation due to a range of organic molecules derived from sugar, lipid and protein catabolism; and probiotic properties attributed to some strains of lab, mainly of lactobacilli. the aim of this study  was to identify some genes involved in lactose metabolism of the probiotic lactobacillus delbrueckii ufv h2b20, and analyse its organic acid production during growth in skimmed milk. the following genes were identified, encoding the  respective enzymes: ldh - lactate dehydrogenase, adhe - ldb1707 acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, and ccpa-pepr1 - catabolite control protein a. it was observed that l. delbrueckii ufv h2b20 cultivated in different media has the unexpected ability to catabolyse galactose, and to produce high amounts of succinic acid, which was absent in the beginning, raising doubts about the subspecies in question. the phylogenetic analyses showed that this strain can be compared physiologically to l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, which are able to degrade lactose and can grow in milk. l. delbrueckii ufv h2b20 sequences have grouped with l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus atcc 11842 and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus atcc baa-365, strengthening the classification of this probiotic strain in the ncfm group proposed by a previous  study. additionally, l. delbrueckii ufv h2b20 presented an evolutionary pattern closer to that of probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, corroborating the suggestion that this strain might be considered as a new and unusual subspecies among l. delbrueckii subspecies, the first one identified as a probiotic. in addition, its unusual ability to metabolise galactose, which was significantly consumed in the fermentation medium, might be exploited to produce low-browning probiotic mozzarella cheeses, a desirable property for pizza cheeses.

AB  == in this study, individual selected lactic acid bacteria strains lactobacillus acidophilus (la), l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis (ldl), and l. gasseri (lga) were grown in chingshey purple sweet potato (cpsp) substrate/media. cpsp is rich in anthocyanin, which possesses antioxidant activity and in vitro cell assay. the antioxidant ability and functional properties of the fermented milk were examined. high-performance liquid chromatographic (hplc) method was used to analyze the free amino acid, organic acids, and anthocyanin content. total phenolic compounds, scavenging effects of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picyl-hydrazyl (dpph) radicals, and scavenging effects of superoxide anion radicals were determined to  evaluate the antioxidant ability of the samples. the cell proliferation of the fermented psp milk was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethyldiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (mtt) assay. the result indicated that the antioxidant ability of the fermented cpsp milk through la, ldl, and lga strains was significantly higher than cpsp. the main anthocyanins present in the samples are  cyanidin and delphinidin. mtt assay has revealed that incubation with both psp and fermented cpsp milk prevented the cell death of macrophage-like raw264.7 cells. the potential health benefit of fermented psp milk through la, ldl, and lga strains makes the further application of cpsp in health food highly worthwhile. practical application: (1) in our study, we have employed the gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), organic acid contents, total phenol content, anthocyanins content, dpph, oxygen radical absorbance capacity, superoxide dismutase activity assay, and cytotoxicity assay to assess the functional properties of fermented cpsp milk by different lactic acid bacteria. (2) our results have revealed that the fermented cpsp milk samples possess high gaba concentrations, organic acid contents, anthocyanins contents, and antioxidant activity. this will provide potential opportunity to develop different functional food products from fermented cpsp milk. (3) the potential health benefit of fermented cpsp milk makes the further application of cpsp in health food highly worthwhile.

AB  == five lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains belonging to species lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and streptococcus thermophilus were tested for their susceptibility to 27 antibiotics. the minimum  inhibitory concentrations of each antimicrobial were determined using a microdilution test. among the strains a high susceptibility was detected for most of the cell-wall synthesis inhibitors (penicillins, cefoxitin and vancomycin) and resistance toward inhibitors of dna synthesis (trimethoprim/sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones). generally, the lactobacillus strains were inhibited by antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, erythromycin and tetracycline at breakpoint  levels lower or equal to the levels defined by the european food safety authority. despite the very similar profile of s. thermophilus lc201 to lactobacilli, the detection of resistance toward erythromycin necessitates the performance of additional tests in order to prove the absence of transferable resistance genes.

AB  == yoghurt is increasingly being used as a carrier of probiotic bacteria for their potential health benefits. to meet with a recommended level of >/=10(6) viable cells/g of a product, assessment of viability of probiotic bacteria in market preparations is crucial. this requires a working method for selective enumeration of these probiotic bacteria and lactic acid bacteria in yoghurt such as streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lb. acidophilus, lb. casei and bifidobacterium. this chapter presents an overview of  media that could be used for differential and selective enumerations of yoghurt bacteria. de man rogosa sharpe agar containing fructose (mrsf), mrs agar ph 5.2 (mrs 5.2), reinforced clostridial prussian blue agar at ph 5.0 (rcpb 5.0) or reinforced clostridial agar at ph 5.3 (rca 5.3) are suitable for enumeration of lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus when the incubation is carried out at 45 degrees c for 72h. s. thermophilus (st) agar and m17 are recommended for selective enumeration of s. thermophilus. selective enumeration of lb. acidophilus in mixed culture could be made in rogosa agar added with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside (x-glu) or mrs containing maltose (mrsm) and incubation in a 20% co2 atmosphere. lb. casei could be selectively enumerated on specially formulated lb. casei (lc) agar from products  containing yoghurt starter bacteria (s. thermophilus and lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), lb. acidophilus, bifidobacterium spp. and lb. casei. bifidobacterium could be enumerated on mrs agar supplemented with nalidixic acid, paromomycin, neomycin sulphate and lithium chloride (mrs-npnl) under anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees c for 72h.

TI  == some low homogenization pressures improve certain probiotic characteristics of yogurt culture bacteria and lactobacillus acidophilus la-k.
AB  == lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, and lactobacillus acidophilus are dairy cultures widely used in the manufacture of cultured dairy products. commonly used homogenization pressures in the dairy industry are 13.80 mpa or less. it is not known whether low homogenization pressures can stimulate bacteria to improve their probiotic characteristics. objectives were to determine the effect of homogenization at 0,  3.45, 6.90, 10.34, and 13.80 mpa on acid tolerance, bile tolerance, protease activity, and growth of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus lb-12, s. salivarius ssp.  thermophilus st-m5, and l. acidophilus la-k. the cultures were individually inoculated in cool autoclaved skim milk (4 degrees c) and homogenized for 5 continuous passes. growth and bile tolerance of samples were determined hourly for 10h of incubation. acid tolerance was determined every 20 min for 120 min of  incubation. protease activity was determined at 0, 12, and 24h of incubation. all homogenization pressures studied improved acid tolerance of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus lb-12 but had no beneficial effect on protease activity and had negative effects on growth and bile tolerance. a pressure of 6.90 mpa improved acid tolerance, bile tolerance, and protease activity of s. salivarius ssp. thermophilus st-m5, but none of the homogenization pressures studied had an effect on its growth. homogenization pressures of 13.80 and 6.90 mpa improved acid tolerance and bile tolerance, respectively, of l. acidophilus la-k but had no effect on protease activity and its growth. some low homogenization pressures  positively influenced some characteristics of yogurt culture bacteria and l. acidophilus la-k. culture pretreatment with some low homogenization pressures can be recommended for improvement of certain probiotic characteristics.

TI  == effect of kynurenic acid on the viability of probiotics in vitro.
AB  == probiotics are bacteria that are commercially available as dietary supplements. one of the important properties of probiotics is their ability to survive in the  intestine. recent evidence has identified kynurenic acid (kyna) as a bactericidal constituent of intestinal fluid. these data led us to study the influence of kyna on the viability of selected probiotics. we found that kyna supported the growth  of bacteria in the probiotics acidolac (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium) and lakcid forte (lactobacillus rhamnosus) or retarded the growth of bacteria from the acidolac, biogaia (lactobacillus reuteri protectis),  dicoflor (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg), lacium (lactobacillus plantarum) and trilac (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis) probiotics depending on its concentration. kyna did not affect the viability of bacteria from the probiotic linex (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12). our results suggest a potential role of kyna in the regulation of bacterial growth in the digestive system.

TI  == lactobacillus gigeriorum sp. nov., isolated from chicken crop.
AB  == in the early 1980s, a facultatively anaerobic, non-motile, short rod, designated  202(t), was isolated from a chicken crop and identified as a homofermentative lactic acid bacterium. phylogenetic analysis based on the 16s rrna gene sequence  revealed that the strain was affiliated with the genus lactobacillus, clustering  within the lactobacillus acidophilus-delbrueckii group. in this analysis, strain  202(t) appeared to be most closely related to the type strains of lactobacillus intestinalis and lactobacillus amylolyticus, with gene sequence similarities of 96.1 and 96.2 %, respectively. strain 202(t) was found to differ from these two species, however, when investigated by multilocus sequence analysis, and it also  differed in terms of some of its metabolic properties. on the basis of these observations, strain 202(t) is considered to represent a novel species in the genus lactobacillus, for which the name lactobacillus gigeriorum sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is 202(t) ( = crbip 24.85(t) = dsm 23908(t)).

TI  == [species composition and antibiotic resistance of lactobacillus in infants].
AB  == aim: to study species composition and antibiotic resistance of indigenous bacteria from lactobacillus genus in infants. materials and methods: twenty-six strains of lactobacilli isolated from feces of infants living in kazan. species membership of lactobacilli was determined using pcr with primers for identification of 7 species of lactobacilli: l. acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. paracasei, and l. zeae. susceptibility to antibiotics was determined by indicator paper discs method. results. in breastfed infants l. fermentum and l. rhamnosus dominated, whereas in artificially fed infants colonization with l. casei and l. paracasei was characteristic. l.acidophilus, l. plantarum, and l. zeae were not detected in infants. in 6 cases isolates could be identified only to genus characteristic. lactobacilli were polyresistant and had from 8 to 15 markers of resistance. all strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, ceftriaxone, nitroxoline, metronidazole, furazolidone, and 95% of strains were resistant to vancomycin. in  60-70% of cases lactobacilli were susceptible to penicillin, linezolid, erythromycin and lyncomycin. conclusion: regional features of species composition and antibiotic resistance of lactobacilli in infants depending on type of feeding were revealed.

TI  == impact of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 and, lactobacillus acidophilus la-5-containing yoghurt, on fecal bacterial counts of healthy adults.
AB  == this randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, parallel dose-response study investigated the impact of 4-week commercial yoghurt consumption supplemented with bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (bb-12) and lactobacillus acidophilus (la-5) on fecal bacterial counts of healthy adults. fifty-eight volunteers were randomly assigned to three different groups: 1. placebo (no probiotic, no starter and no green tea extract); 2. yoptimal (10(9)cfu/100g of bb-12 and la-5 and 40mg  of green tea extract) and 3. yoptimal-10 (10(10)cfu/100g of bb-12, 10(9)cfu/100g  of la-5 and 40mg of green tea extract). these yoghurt products also contained lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (10(7)cfu/100g) and streptococcus thermophilus (10(10)cfu/100g). the quantitative pcr (qpcr) results showed that there were significant increases (p=0.02) in bifidobacteria counts with the yoptimal treatment as compared to baseline. the fecal numbers of b. animalis subsp. lactis and la-5 significantly increased in the two probiotic treatments compared to the placebo treatment. viable counts of fecal lactobacilli were significantly higher (p=0.05) and those of enterococci were significantly lower (p=0.04) after the intervention when compared to placebo. no significant difference was observed between treatments in volunteers' weight, waist girth, blood pressure, fasting plasma triglyceride and hdl-c concentrations, as well as  cholesterol/hdl-cholesterol ratio. however, a significant increase in plasma cholesterol levels was observed in the placebo group (p=0.0018) but the levels remained stable in the two probiotic yoghurt groups. these results show that probiotic strains supplemented in the form of yoghurt remain active during gut transit and are associated with an increase in beneficial bacteria and a reduction in potentially pathogenic bacteria. this trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as nct00730626.

TI  == beneficial effects of a synbiotic supplement on self-perceived gastrointestinal well-being and immunoinflammatory status of healthy adults.
AB  == the use of synbiotics as health promoters is still poorly defined, and human intervention studies are scarce. this study was designed to evaluate the effects  of a commercialized synbiotic product containing lactobacillus acidophilus la5, bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus, and fructooligosaccharides on the self-reported gastrointestinal well-being and the immunoinflammatory status of healthy human subjects. in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 20 women and 16 men (25-45 years old) received either three tablets per day of the synbiotic product (2.4 x 10(9) colony-forming units/day) or placebo during 6 weeks. gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habits were evaluated through a self-administered questionnaire. in those subjects suffering from any kind of digestive disturbance (mild dyspepsia,  flatulence, postprandial bloating, constipation, etc.), improvements in symptoms  after product consumption were also evaluated. blood lymphocyte subsets, phagocytic activity, serum c-reactive protein, ceruloplasmin, and adhesion molecules concentrations were analyzed prior and after treatment. a significant improvement in overall self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habit was found in the synbiotic group. a marginal effect of treatment (analysis of variance p = .050) was observed with l-selectin, which showed a significant decrease in the synbiotic group (p = .019). in addition, basal l-selectin levels  correlated with final intercellular adhesion molecule (icam)-1 levels (r = 0.468; p = .050), and basal icam-1 levels tended to correlate negatively with final l-selectin concentration (r = -0.457; p = .056). none of these correlations was found in the placebo group. the rest of the immunological parameters studied were not modified by the intervention. in conclusion, consumption of the synbiotic product improves self-perceived bowel habits and might facilitate a better profile of adhesion molecules in healthy adults.

TI  == effects of yogurt starter cultures on the survival of lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == recognized to confer health benefits to consumers, probiotics such as lactobacillus acidophilus are commonly incorporated into fermented dairy products worldwide; among which yogurt is a popular delivery vehicle. to materialize most  of the putative health benefits associated with probiotics, an adequate amount of viable cells must be delivered at the time of consumption. however, the loss in their viabilities during refrigerated storage has been demonstrated previously. this study focused on the effects of yogurt starter cultures on the survival of five strains of l. acidophilus, with emphases on low ph and acid production. differential survival behavior between l. acidophilus strains was further analyzed. to this end, viable cell counts of l. acidophilus were determined weekly during 4 degrees c storage in various types of yogurts made with streptococcus thermophilus alone, l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus alone, both species of the starter cultures, or glucono-delta-lactone (gdl). all yogurt types, except for pasteurized yogurts, were co-fermented with l. acidophilus. yogurt filtrate was analyzed for the presence of any inhibitory substance and for the amount of hydrogen peroxide. multiplication of l. acidophilus was not affected by the starter cultures as all strains reached high level on day 0 of the storage period. throughout the 28-day storage period, cell counts of l. acidophilus pim703 and sbt2062 remained steady (~6 x 10(7)cfu/g) in yogurts made  with both starter cultures, whereas those of atcc 700396 and ncfm were reduced by a maximum of 3 and 4.6 logs, respectively. when starter cultures were replaced by gdl, all strains survived well, suggesting that a low ph was not a critical factor dictating their survival. in addition, the filtrate collected from yogurts made with starter cultures appeared to have higher inhibitory activities against  l. acidophilus than that made with gdl. the presence of viable starter cultures was necessary to adversely affect the survival of some strains, as pasteurized yogurts had no effect on their survival. in particular, the inhibitory effect exerted by l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus on l. acidophilus ncfm was highly pronounced than by s. thermophilus, nevertheless, the same effect was not observed on sbt2062. the inhibition against stationary-phase ncfm cells might be  caused by the elevated level of hydrogen peroxide produced by l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. delineating factors driving the differences in survival trait among probiotic strains will lead to a more efficacious delivery of health benefits in  fermented dairy products through targeted technological interventions.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == enhancing the biotransformation of isoflavones in soymilk supplemented with lactose using probiotic bacteria during extended fermentation.
AB  == soymilk (sm) lacks lactose; hence supplementation of sm with lactose is likely to enhance the growth of probiotic bacteria and biotransformation of isoflavone glycosides to isoflavone aglycones. in this study, 11 strains of probiotic bacteria including lactobacillus rhamnosus, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, howaru l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium lactis type bi-07, b. longum, howaru b. bifidum, and b lactis type bi-04 were inoculated individually or as mixed cultures into sm and soymilk  supplemented with lactose (sml). a total of 2% of lactose was added to 1 l of sm  with the aim of improving the growth of probiotic organisms and promoting the biotransformation of isoflavone isomers to bioactive isoflavone aglycomes. samples of sm were incubated at 37 degrees c and 10 ml aliquots of sm were taken  at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h to monitor the growth of probiotic bacteria and changes in isoflavone contents using high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). results  indicated that sml fermented with probiotics had higher viable counts by >2.4 log cfu/ml than that in sm at the end of the 72 h fermentation period. mixed cultures grew at different rates and in general lactobacilius spp. had >1.02 log cfu/ml more cells than bifidobacterium spp. at the end of the fermentation period. the total aglycone content in sm at 72 h of fermentation was 0.924 mg/100 ml, whereas that in sml was 1.623 mg/100 ml. addition of lactose not only improved the growth of probiotic bacteria in sm but also enhanced the biotransformation of isoflavone glucosides to the more bioactive isoflavone aglycones. mixed cultures did not improve the biotransformation of bioactive isoflavones when compared to single cultures.

TI  == functional fermented whey-based beverage using lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == whey protein concentrate (wpc) is employed as functional food ingredient because  of its nutritional value and emulsifying properties. however, the major whey protein beta-lactoglobulin (blg) is the main cause of milk allergy. the aim of this study was to formulate a fermented whey beverage using selected lactic acid  bacteria and wpc35 (wpc containing 35% of proteins) to obtain a fermented product with low lactose and blg contents and high essential amino acid concentration. cell viability, lactose consumption, lactic acid production, proteolytic activity, amino acid release and blg degradation by the selected strains lactobacillus acidophilus crl 636, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus crl 656 and streptococcus thermophilus crl 804, as single or mixed (slab) cultures were evaluated in wpc35 (10%, w/v) incubated at 37 degrees c for 24h. then, the fermented wpc35 was mixed with peach juice and calcium lactate (2%, w/v) and stored at 10 degrees c for 28 days. during fermentation, single cultures grew 1.7-3.1 log cfu/ml and produced 25.1-95.0 mmol/l of lactic acid as consequence of lactose consumption (14.0-41.8 mmol/l) after 12h fermentation. l.  delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus crl 656 was the most proteolytic strain (626 microg/ml leu) and released the branched-chain essential amino acids leu (16 microg/ml), ile (27 microg/ml) and val (43 microg/ml). all strains were able to degrade blg in a range of 41-85% after 12h incubation. the starter culture slab grew 3.0 log cfu/ml, showed marked ph reduction, produced 122.0 mmol/l of lactic  acid, displayed high proteolytic activity (484 microg/ml leu) releasing leu (13 microg/ml), ile (18 microg/ml) and val (35 microg/ml), and hydrolyzed 92% of blg. the addition of calcium lactate to wpc35 maintained the drink ph stable during shelf life; no contamination was detected during this period. after 28 days, a decrease in cell viability of all strains was observed being more pronounced for  l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus crl 656 and l. acidophilus crl 636 (2.3 and 1.9  log cfu/ml, respectively). the results showed that wpc fermentation by rationally selected lactic acid bacteria might be used for developing functional beverages with improved characteristics such as reduced blg content and increased branched-chain essential amino acids.

TI  == lactobacillus taiwanensis sp. nov., isolated from silage.
AB  == strain firdi 006t, isolated from silage cattle feed, was characterized by using phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. the strain was a homofermentative lactic acid bacterium; the cells stained gram-positive and were catalase-negative, non-motile, facultatively anaerobic rods. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed that the strain belongs phylogenetically to the genus  lactobacillus and can be placed within the lactobacillus acidophilus-delbrueckii  group. lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus johnsonii were the most closely related species, with 16s rrna gene sequence similarities of 99.53 and 99.46% to  the respective type strains. low gyrb gene sequence similarities (<90%) and low dna-dna reassociation values (<45%) were obtained between the strain and the phylogenetically closest neighbours. based on phenotypic and genetic evidence, the strain is considered to represent a novel species, for which the name lactobacillus taiwanensis sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is firdi 006t (=bcrc 17755t =dsm 21401t).

TI  == lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 increases lactacin b production when it senses live target bacteria.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 is a probiotic strain used in dairy products. production of bacteriocin by l. acidophilus la-5 was achieved when it was grown in co-cultures with the yogurt starter species streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. however, bacteriocin induction was not observed when heat-killed cells were used as inducers. this study demonstrates that l. acidophilus la-5 produces lactacin b and that the bacteriocin expression is controlled by an auto-induction mechanism involving the secreted peptide ip_1800. the transcript level of the lactacin b gene cluster expression was investigated in co-cultures between l. acidophilus la-5 and s. thermophilus sty-31 and a remarkable increase of the bacteriocin structural gene  (lbab) transcription was observed. however, lbab was transcribed constitutively in uninduced l. acidophilus la-5 cells, but the levels of the secreted bacteriocin were not enough to be detected by the agar diffusion assay. a new method for bacteriocin detection was formulated based on the monitoring on real time of lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei growth in presence of the supernatant and the cell wall extracts of pure and induced l. acidophilus la-5. these results showed that part of lactacin b secreted remains adhered to cell envelope.

TI  == volatile sulfur compounds produced by probiotic bacteria in the presence of cysteine or methionine.
AB  == aims: to investigate the abilities of various probiotic bacteria to produce volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) relevant to food flavour and aroma. methods and  results: probiotic strains (lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus plantarum 299v, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus reuteri atcc55730 and l. reuteri br11), lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc4797, l. plantarum atcc14917 and  lactococcus lactis mg1363 were incubated with either cysteine or methionine. volatile compounds were captured, identified and quantified using a sensitive solid-phase microextraction (spme) technique combined with gas chromatography coupled to a pulsed flame photometric detector (spme/gc/pfpd). several vscs were  identified including h(2)s, methanethiol, dimethyldisulfide and dimethyltrisulfide. the vsc profiles varied substantially for different strains of l. plantarum and l. reuteri and it was found that l. reuteri atcc55730 and l.  lactis mg1363 produced the lowest levels of vscs (p < 0.05). levels of vscs generated by bacteria were found to be equivalent to, or higher than, that found  in commercial cheeses. conclusions: several probiotic strains are able to generate considerable levels of vscs and substantial variations in vsc generating potential exists between different strains from the same species. significance and importance of the study: this study demonstrates that probiotic bacteria are  able to efficiently generate important flavour and aroma compounds and therefore  has implications for the development of probiotic containing foods.

TI  == development and use of tuf gene-based primers for the multiplex pcr detection of  lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei group, lactobacillus delbrueckii,  and bifidobacterium longum in commercial dairy products.
AB  == pcr primers specific for the detection of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei group, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and bifidobacterium longum  were designed based on the elongation factor tu gene (tuf). the specificity of these four primer sets were confirmed by pcr with 88 bacterial strains of lactobacillus, enterococcus, bifidobacterium, and other bacterial species. results indicated that these primer sets generated predicted pcr products of 397, 230, 202, and 161 bp for l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii, l. casei group, and b. longum, respectively. bacterial species other than the target organisms tested did not generate false-positive results. when these four primer sets were combined for the simultaneous detection of the lactic acid bacteria (lab) in fermented milk products including yogurt, the lab species listed on the labels of these products could be identified without the preenrichment step. the identification limit for each lab strain with this multiplex pcr method was n x 10(3) cfu/ml in milk samples. the results of our multiplex pcr method were confirmed by pcr assay using primers based on the 16s rdna or the 16s-23s intergenic spacer region and by biochemical tests using the api 50 chl kit. when  this multiplex pcr method was used with the determination of counts of total viable lab and bifidobacteria, the quality of commercial fermented milk products  could be assured.

TI  == modeling bacterial contamination of fuel ethanol fermentation.
AB  == the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria may limit the effectiveness of antibiotics to treat bacterial contamination in fuel ethanol plants, and therefore, new antibacterial intervention methods and tools to test their application are needed. using shake-flask cultures of saccharomyces cerevisiae grown on saccharified corn mash and strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a dry-grind ethanol facility, a simple model to simulate bacterial contamination  and infection was developed. challenging the model with 10(8) cfu/ml lactobacillus fermentum decreased ethanol yield by 27% and increased residual glucose from 6.2 to 45.5 g/l. the magnitude of the effect was proportional to the initial bacterial load, with 10(5) cfu/ml l. fermentum still producing an 8% decrease in ethanol and a 3.2-fold increase in residual glucose. infection was also dependent on the bacterial species used to challenge the fermentation, as neither l. delbrueckii atcc 4797 nor l. amylovorus 0315-7b produced a significant decrease in ethanol when inoculated at a density of 10(8) cfu/ml. in the shake-flask model, treatment with 2 microg/ml virginiamycin mitigated the infection when challenged with a susceptible strain of l. fermentum (mic for virginiamycin < or =2 ppm), but treatment was ineffective at treating infection by a resistant strain of l. fermentum (mic = 16 ppm). the model may find application in developing new antibacterial agents and management practices for use in controlling contamination in the fuel ethanol industry.

TI  == prediction of surface exposed proteins in streptococcus pyogenes, with a potential application to other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the in silico prediction of bacterial surface exposed proteins is of growing interest for the rational development of vaccines and in the study of bacteria-host relationships, whether pathogenic or host beneficial. this interest is driven by the increase in the use of dna sequencing as a major tool in the early characterization of pathogenic bacteria and, more recently, even of complex ecosystems at the host-environment interface in metagenomics approaches. current  protein localization protocols are not suited to this prediction task as they ignore the potential surface exposition of many membrane-associated proteins. therefore, we developed a new flow scheme, surfg+, for the processing of protein  sequence data with the particular aim of identification of potentially surface exposed (pse) proteins from gram-positive bacteria, which was validated for streptococcus pyogenes. the results of an exploratory case study on closely related lactobacilli of the acidophilus group suggest that the yogurt bacterium lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (l. bulgaricus) dedicates a relatively  important fraction of its coding capacity to secreted proteins, while the probiotic gastrointestinal (gi) tract bacteria l. johnsonii and l. gasseri appear to encode a larger variety of pse proteins, that may play a role in the interaction with the host.

TI  == diversity and dynamics of lactobacilli populations during ripening of rdo camembert cheese.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of lactobacillus populations in traditional raw milk camembert cheese were monitored throughout the manufacturing process in 3 dairies. culture-dependent analysis was carried out on isolates grown on acidified de man - rogosa - sharpe agar and lactobacillus anaerobic de man rogosa sharpe agar supplemented with vancomycin and bromocresol green media. the isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction - temperature gradient gel  electrophoresis (pcr-tgge) and (or) species-specific pcr and (or) sequencing, and lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum isolates were characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). milk and cheese were subjected to culture-independent analysis by pcr-tgge. presumed lactobacilli were detected by  plate counts throughout the ripening process. however, molecular analysis of total dna and dna of isolates failed to detect lactobacillus spp. in certain cases. the dominant species in the 3 dairies was l. paracasei. pfge analysis revealed 21 different profiles among 39 l. paracasei isolates. lactobacillus plantarum was the second most isolated species, but it occurred nearly exclusively in one dairy. the other species isolated were lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, a lactobacillus psittaci/delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus/gallinarum/crispatus group, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus kefiri, and lactobacillus perolens. lactobacilli diversity  at the strain level was high. dynamics varied among dairies, and each cheese exhibited a specific picture of species and strains.

TI  == whey fermentation by thermophilic lactic acid bacteria: evolution of carbohydrates and protein content.
AB  == whey, a by-product of the cheese industry usually disposed as waste, is a source  of biological and functional valuable proteins. the aim of this work was to evaluate the potentiality of three lactic acid bacteria strains to design a starter culture for developing functional whey-based drinks. fermentations were performed at 37 and 42 degrees c for 24h in reconstituted whey powder (rw). carbohydrates, organic acids and amino acids concentrations during fermentation were evaluated by rp-hplc. proteolytic activity was measured by the o-phthaldialdehyde test and hydrolysis of whey proteins was analyzed by tricine sds-page. the studied strains grew well (2-3log cfu/ml) independently of the temperature used. streptococcus thermophilus crl 804 consumed 12% of the initial  lactose concentration and produced the highest amount of lactic acid (45 mmol/l)  at 24h. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus crl 454 was the most proteolytic (91 microg leu/ml) strain and released the branched chain amino acids leu and val. in contrast, lactobacillus acidophilus crl 636 and s. thermophilus crl 804 consumed most of the amino acids present in whey. the studied strains were able to degrade the major whey proteins, alpha-lactalbumin being degraded in a greater extent (2.2-3.4-fold) than beta-lactoglobulin. two starter cultures were evaluated for their metabolic and proteolytic activities in rw. both cultures acidified and reduced the lactose content in whey in a greater extent than the strains alone. the amino acid release was higher (86 microg/ml) for the  starter slb (strains crl 804+crl 454) than for sla (strains crl 804+crl 636, 37 microg/ml). regarding alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin degradation, no differences were observed as compared to the values obtained with the single cultures. the starter culture slb showed high potential to be used for developing fermented whey-based beverages.

AB  == this study was conducted to examine the growth, proteolytic profiles as well as angiotensin-i converting enzyme (ace) and alpha-glucosidase (alpha-glu) inhibitory potentials of selected strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab). two strains each of yogurt bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus-1275 and 285, and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus-1092 and 1368), and probiotics (l. acidophilus-4461 and 33200, and l. casei-2607 and 15286, and 1 strain of bifidobacterium longum 5022), were cultivated in reconstituted skim milk (rsm) at 37 degrees c and their proteolytic profiles and ace as well as alpha-glu inhibitory activities were determined. among all the strains of lactic acid bacteria studied, yogurt bacteria grew very well, with the exception of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 1368 which showed a slower growth during the initial  3 h of incubation. the growth pattern corresponded well with the decrease in ph for the organisms. all the organisms showed an increase in proteolysis with time. the variations in proteolytic capabilities translated into corresponding variations in ace inhibitory potential of these organisms. bifidobacterium longum 5022 showed the highest ace inhibitory potential followed by l. delbrueckii ssp.  bulgaricus 1368, l. casei 15286, s. thermophilus 1275, and l. acidophilus 4461. organisms with high intracellular enzymatic activities grew well. also, aminopeptidases of strains of l. acidophilus 4461 and s. thermophilus 1275 that could better utilize proline containing substrates showed enhanced ace inhibitory potential. lactic acid bacteria possessed the ability to inhibit alpha-glu activity, which endowed them an antidiabetic property as well.

TI  == extensive horizontal transfer of core genome genes between two lactobacillus species found in the gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == background: while genes that are conserved between related bacterial species are  usually thought to have evolved along with the species, phylogenetic trees reconstructed for individual genes may contradict this picture and indicate horizontal gene transfer. individual trees are often not resolved with high confidence, however, and in that case alternative trees are generally not considered as contradicting the species tree, although not confirming it either.  here we conduct an in-depth analysis of 401 protein phylogenetic trees inferred with varying levels of confidence for three lactobacilli from the acidophilus complex. at present the relationship between these bacteria, isolated from environments as diverse as the gastrointestinal tract (lactobacillus acidophilus  and lactobacillus johnsonii) and yogurt (lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus), is ambiguous due to contradictory phenotypical and 16s rrna based classifications. results: among the 401 phylogenetic trees, those that could be reconstructed with high confidence support the 16s-rrna tree or one alternative topology in an astonishing 3:2 ratio, while the third possible topology is practically absent. lowering the confidence threshold for trees to be taken into  consideration does not significantly affect this ratio, and therefore suggests that gene transfer may have affected as much as 40% of the core genome genes. gene function bias suggests that the 16s rrna phylogeny of the acidophilus complex, which indicates that l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus are the closest related of these three species, is correct. a novel approach of comparison of interspecies protein divergence data employed in this study allowed to determine that gene transfer most likely took place between the lineages of the two species found in the gastrointestinal tract. conclusion: this case-study  reports an unprecedented level of phylogenetic incongruence, presumably resulting from extensive horizontal gene transfer. the data give a first indication of the  large extent of gene transfer that may take place in the gastrointestinal tract and its accumulated effect. for future studies, our results should encourage a careful weighing of data on phylogenetic tree topology, confidence and distribution to conclude on the absence or presence and extent of horizontal gene transfer.

TI  == production of yoghurt with mild taste by a lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus mutant with altered proteolytic properties.
AB  == in this communication, we describe the isolation of a lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 92063 mutant strain named ph-p11, which differed from the parent strain by low proteolytic activity and altered regulation of expression of lacz in the presence of glucose or lactose. in the presence of lactose, beta-galactosidase activity was approximately twice as high in ph-p11 than in the wild type. ph-p11 exhibited protosymbiosis together with streptococcus thermophilus. yoghurt produced with ph-p11 was characterized by low acidity and little post-acidification during storage. the organoleptic properties (absence of bitterness and other off-flavors, weak sourness, and clear yoghurt taste) were those of a typical "yoghurt mild". this mild flavor was achieved at rather high cell counts of lactobacilli even at the end of shelf-life. high cell counts in conjunction with high beta-galactosidase activity make ph-p11 an interesting strain for application in yoghurt especially designed for consumers with lactose  malabsorption. in contrast to "yoghurt mild", which is predominantly produced with lactobacillus acidophilus together with streptococcus thermophilus, the product obtained by fermentation with ph-p11 and streptococcus thermophilus concurs with international standards for yoghurt. during frequent sub-culturing,  strain ph-p11, which is supposed to differ from the wild type by one or a few so-far-not-characterized mutations, showed sufficient stability for application in industrial production.

AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus dsm 20079 is the producer of a novel bacteriocin termed acidocin d20079. in this paper, mode of action using three various concentrations of acidocin d20079 (2,048, 128 and 11.3 au/ml) was determined against an indicator strain l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis dsm 20076. these concentrations all led to marked decreases in both the number of viable cells and in optical density, indicating that the activity of the acidocin d20079 was bactericidal with concomitant cell lysis. moreover, the probiotic potential of l. acidophilus  dsm 20079 was analyzed for its ability to survive and retain viability at conditions (acid and bile concentrations) mimicking the gastrointestinal (gi) tract, under which it survived exposure to ph 2.0 with a 1.2 log cycle reduction  in viability and where 45% of the original population survived in a medium containing 0.3% bile for 3 h.

TI  == combined effect of different lactic acid bacteria strains on the mode of cytokines pattern expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
AB  == the balance between immunogenic and tolerogenic activities in human immune system strongly depends on microflora-induced pro-and anti-inflammatory activities. lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important components of microflora. the interactions of the different strains of lab and the cells of immune system are largely unknown. to assess if lab strains composition would have an effect on the cellular responses profile (proliferation, cytokines synthesis) peripheral blood  mononuclear cells (pbmc) model system was used. pbmc were induced by three different strains of lab: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium bifidum. tested strains were mixed together, in  combinations with each other (pairs) or alone. both, the lab mixture as well as the pairs and the single lab strains induced low lymphocyte proliferation (about  10% of cona-induced response). however, the single lab strains and their combinations were quite different cytokines inducers. first, l. acidophilus was much stronger ifn-gamma inducer than the lab mixture, being a few times higher il-12 stimulator than l. bulgaricus and b. bifidum. second, l. bulgaricus and b.  bifidum suppressed l.acidophilus-induced ifn-gamma synthesis to the level equal to that induced by the lab mixture, limiting il-12 production by about 30% and 70%, respectively. third, the lab strains were good il-10 and tnf-alpha inducers, irrespectively of their combinations used. we conclude that lab strains' pro or anti-inflammatory potentials are at least in part dependent on their composition. low lab mixture-induced il-12 and ifn-gamma production and relatively high il-10  and tnf-alpha expression may represent cellular activities normally induced in vivo by a combined action of bacterial antigens. their presence is important to limit pro-inflammatory reactions (via il-10) and to provide protection against infections (via tnf-alpha).

TI  == antibiotic resistance of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacterium spp. isolated from dairy and pharmaceutical products.
AB  == the outlines of antibiotic resistance of some probiotic microorganisms were studied. this study was conducted with the double purpose of verifying their ability to survive if they are taken simultaneously with an antibiotic therapy and to increase the selective properties of suitable media for the isolation of samples containing mixed bacterial populations. we isolated from commercial dairy and pharmaceutical products, 34 strains declared as probiotics, belonging to the  genera bifidobacterium and lactobacillus, and 21 strains of starter culture bacteria. all the microorganisms have been compared by electrophoresis of the soluble proteins for the purpose of identifying them. a multiplex-pcr with genus- and species-specific primers was used to detect for bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis presence. all bifidobacteria were b. animalis subsp. lactis except  one bifidobacterium longum. sometimes the identification showed that the used strain was not the one indicated on the label. the lactobacilli were lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. the streptococci were all streptococcus thermophilus. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of 24 common antibiotic substances has been valued by the broth microdilution method. all tested strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, clindamycin, dicloxacillin, erytromycin, novobiocin, penicillin g, rifampicin (mic(90) ranging from 0.01 to 4 microg/ml);  resistant to aztreonam, cycloserin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, polymyxin b and spectinomycin (mic(90) ranging from 64 to >1000 microg/ml). the susceptibility to cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, lincomycin, metronidazole, neomycin, paromomycin, streptomycin, tetracycline and vancomycin was variable and depending on the species.

TI  == similarity and differences in the lactobacillus acidophilus group identified by polyphasic analysis and comparative genomics.
AB  == a set of lactobacilli were investigated by polyphasic analysis. multilocus sequence analysis, dna typing, microarray analysis, and in silico whole-genome alignments provided a remarkably consistent pattern of similarity within the lactobacillus acidophilus complex. on microarray analysis, 17 and 5% of the genes from lactobacillus johnsonii strain ncc533 represented variable and strain-specific genes, respectively, when tested against four independent isolates of l. johnsonii. when projected on the ncc533 genome map, about 10 large clusters of variable genes were identified, and they were enriched around the terminus of replication. a quarter of the variable genes and two-thirds of the strain-specific genes were associated with mobile dna. signatures for horizontal  gene transfer and modular evolution were found in prophages and in dna from the exopolysaccharide biosynthesis cluster. on microarray hybridizations, lactobacillus gasseri strains showed a shift to significantly lower fluorescence  intensities than the l. johnsonii test strains, and only genes encoding very conserved cellular functions from l. acidophilus hybridized to the l. johnsonii array. in-silico comparative genomics showed extensive protein sequence similarity and genome synteny of l. johnsonii with l. gasseri, l. acidophilus, and lactobacillus delbrueckii; moderate synteny with lactobacillus casei; and scattered x-type sharing of protein sequence identity with the other sequenced lactobacilli. the observation of a stepwise decrease in similarity between the members of the l. acidophilus group suggests a strong element of vertical evolution in a natural phylogenetic group. modern whole-genome-based techniques are thus a useful adjunct to the clarification of taxonomical relationships in problematic bacterial groups.

TI  == the in vitro effect of hydrogen peroxide on vaginal microbial communities.
AB  == this study presents a series of experiments carried out in order to elucidate the role of h2o2 in antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli. vaginal swabs were collected from 60 premenopausal women and checked for ph and nugent score, and lactobacillus species were cultured, phenotyped and genotyped. the main outcome measures involved: (1) species of vaginal lactobacilli most effective in liberating h2o2, (2) minimal microbicidal concentrations of added h2o2, (3) kinetics of h2o2 liberation in relation to oxygen tension, (4) antimicrobial activity of pure h2o2 versus one produced by selected vaginal lactobacilli and the total activity of their culture supernatants. results showed that h2o2 was liberated especially by: lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus johnsonii and l. gasseri. hydrogen peroxide reached concentrations from 0.05 to 1.0 mm, which under intensive aeration increased even up to 1.8 mm. microorganisms related to vaginal pathologies show varied resistance to the action of pure h2o2. most potent inhibitory activity against bacteria and yeasts was presented by lactobacillus culture supernate producing h2o2, followed by the nonproducing strain and pure h2o2. to conclude - the antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli is a summation of  various inhibitory mechanisms in which h2o2 plays some but not a crucial role, in addition to other substances.

AB  == vsl#3 (vsl#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve and b. infantis) and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. data from noncomparative trials suggest that vsl#3 has clinical potential in the treatment  of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. in addition, a randomised, open-label, multicentre trial showed that vsl#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown vsl#3 is effective in preventing the onset  of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. treatment guidelines from the us and the uk include vsl#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. in general, vsl#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of vsl#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

AB  == the microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the rep. of congo) and degue (a millet dough from burkina faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using ttge to separate the amplified target v3 region of the 16s rrna gene from total microbial community, followed by dna sequencing and homology search. three different extraction methods were used. guanidium thiocyanate-based dna extraction provided better performance regarding  purity and dna yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of dna bands by ttge in poto poto. by contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the dna extraction method largely depends on the food composition. sequencing of dna bands from ttge gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of lactobacillus gasseri, enterococcus sp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, bacillus sp., lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus casei. the following bacteria were identified in degue: l. gasseri, enterococcus sp., e. coli, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, and l. casei.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr analysis of fecal lactobacillus species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  == the developing intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants is considered to play  an important role in the priming of the infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. generally, bifidobacterium and lactobacillus predominate the microbiota of breast-fed infants. in intervention trials it has been shown that lactobacilli can exert beneficial effects on, for example, diarrhea and atopy. however, the lactobacillus species distribution in breast-fed or formula-fed infants has not yet been determined in great detail. for accurate enumeration of different lactobacilli, duplex 5' nuclease assays, targeted on rrna intergenic spacer regions, were developed for lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the  designed and validated assays were used to determine the amounts of different lactobacillus species in fecal samples of infants receiving a standard formula (sf) or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides in a 9:1 ratio (osf). a breast-fed group (bf) was studied in parallel as a reference. during the 6-week intervention period a significant increase was shown in total percentage of fecal lactobacilli in the bf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.1% +/- 1.5%) and the osf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.4% +/- 1.4%). the lactobacillus species distribution in the osf group was comparable to breast-fed  infants, with relatively high levels of l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, and l. casei. the sf-fed infants, on the other hand, contained more l. delbrueckii and less l. paracasei compared to breast-fed infants and osf-fed infants. an infant milk formula containing a specific mixture of prebiotics is able to induce a microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of bf infants.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from the vagina: identification, hydrogen peroxide production and nonoxynol-9 resistance.
AB  == background: lactic acid production is considered to be the major protection mechanism of lactobacilli against vaginal infections due to genital pathogens. some species of lactobacillus are also hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) producers. nonoxynol-9 (n-9) is a nonionic detergent and is the active component of many spermicidal preparations. it immobilizes sperm by disrupting the cell membrane and is believed to act similarly on a number of bacteria and viruses. it is known that n-9 inhibits lactobacilli in vitro at concentrations of 0.1% to 1%. purpose: the present study was conducted to identify the species of lactobacillus isolated from vaginal fluids of reproductive-age women and to characterize the h(2)o(2)-producing and n-9-resistant strains in an argentine population. results: we identified lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. gasseri, l. jensenii, l. casei subsp. casei, l. brevis and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii as the most frequent species. in this argentine, south american population, 62% of women had h(2)o(2)-producing vaginal lactobacilli. we found a high number of sensitive  strains. sixty-two h(2)o(2)-producer strains were detected, 50 (80.6%) strains were sensitive to n-9 and 12 (19.4%) strains were resistant to the inhibitory effect of n-9. discussion: the vaginal microecologic findings are comparable to those found in other populations and suggest that (1) vaginal microecologic conditions are likely to be similar among argentine women as in other countries,  and (2) n-9 may have deleterious effects as in other populations.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth  indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised  rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g  after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal.  it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

AB  == growing frequency of therapeutical failures of vulvovaginal candidiasis, resulting from resistance of certain species of candida to imidazole agents, raises interest in the use of probiotics from lactobacillus genera as prophylaxis. unfortunately, little is known about inhibitory mechanisms of lactobacillus on candida. the aim of this study was to compare the activity of selected lactobacillus species, representing the physiological vaginal flora, against candida as well as investigation whether their inhibitory activity against candida is related strictly to hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid production. 125 strains from vaginal smears of healthy women were classified by making use of phenotypic and genotypic methods. the majority of strains belonged  to l. acidophilus: l. acidophilus sensu stricto, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l.  johnsonii as well as l. fermentum and l. plantarum species. culture supernatants  of selected 25 strains representing the isolated species were examined for their  inhibitory activity against the growth of candida albicans and c. glabrata. the results showed that the strongest and the fastest activity against c. albicans was demonstrated by l. delbrueckii strains, producing the largest quantities of hydrogen peroxide. on the other hand, extended activity, demonstrable after 24 hours, was shown by non-h2o2 producing l. plantarum supernatants. growth of c. glabrata was not inhibited by any of the examined strains of lactobacillus. comparison of activity of live active cultures of lactobacillus strains and their mixtures with this of pure h2o2 and lactic acid has shown that pure chemical compounds were less active than the cultures. this suggests that mixtures of lactobacillus strains are in cooperation with each other using many different metabolites.

AB  == lactobacillus colonisation was examined in 112 swedish infants. faecal samples obtained at 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks and at 6, 12 and 18 months of age were cultivated quantitatively on rogosa agar. lactobacilli were speciated by pcr and typed to the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd). lactobacilli reached a peak at 6 months when 45% of the infants were colonised. l. rhamnosus and l. gasseri were the most common species in this period. colonisation by lactobacilli in general (p < 0.01) and l. rhamnosus in particular (p < 0.05) was  more common in breast-fed than in weaned infants at 6 months of age. lactobacillus isolation reached a nadir of 17% by 12 months (p < 0.0001), but increased to 31% by 18 months of age p < 0.05). the food-related species l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii dominated in this second phase. a single strain persisted for at least 3 weeks in 17% of the infants during the first 6 months, most commonly l. rhamnosus. lactobacillus population counts in colonised infants increased from 10(6.4) cfu/g at 1 week to  10(8.8) cfu/g at 6 months, and then dropped to 10(5.4) cfu/g faeces at 12 months  of age. lactobacillus colonisation was not significantly related to delivery mode, or to presence of siblings or pets in the household. our results suggest that certain lactobacillus species, especially l. rhamnosus, thrive in the intestinal flora of breast-fed infants. after weaning they are replaced by other  lactobacillus species of types found in food.

AB  == lactobin a and amylovorin l471 are two bacteriocins produced by the phenotypically different strains lactobacillus amylovorus lmg p-13139 and l. amylovorus dce 471, respectively. a 110-bp pcr fragment of the structural gene of lactobin a was obtained from total genomic dna of l. amylovorus lmg p-13139, which was used as a probe to isolate a 3.6-kb hindiii chromosomal fragment for sequencing. pcr amplification revealed that both the structural genes of both the bacteriocins lactobin a and amylovorin l471 were identical. these bacteriocins will be further referred to as amylovorin l. amylovorin l can be defined as a small, strongly hydrophobic, antibacterial peptide consisting of 50 amino acids.  it is synthesized as a precursor peptide of 65 amino acids processed at a characteristic double-glycine proteolytic cleavage site. amylovorin l hence belongs to the class ii bacteriocins. it has a narrow inhibitory spectrum, being  most active towards lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus lmg 6901(t). among 38 strains of the lactobacillus acidophilus dna homology group, another 6 l. amylovorus strains were also inhibitory towards the l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus lmg 6901(t) strain. the lactobin a or amylovorin l471 structural genes could be detected in the genomes of three of these l. amylovorus strains, but only after extensive pcr amplification, indicating that the inhibitory substances were slightly different. the bacteriocins were characterized as small (approximately 4800 da), heat-stable peptides that were active in a wide ph range (2.2-8.0). finally, preliminary experiments indicated that the production of amylovorin l by l. amylovorus dce 471 took place during a natural rye fermentation, indicating its potential importance in the development of a functional (probiotic) starter culture for cereal fermentations.

TI  == lactobacillus kitasatonis sp. nov., from chicken intestine.
AB  == four strains isolated from chicken small intestine and strains jcm 1038 and jcm 1039 (designated as lactobacillus acidophilus) were characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. they were gram-positive, catalase-negative, facultatively anaerobic rods that did not produce gas from glucose. these strains had similar phenotypic characteristics and exhibited intergroup dna relatedness values of >77 %, indicating that they comprised a single species. the 16s rrna gene sequence of a representative strain, jcm 1039(t) (designated as type strain  in this study), was determined and aligned with those of other lactobacillus species. jcm 1039(t) was placed in the lactobacillus delbrueckii cluster of the genus lactobacillus on the basis of phylogenetic analysis and formed an independent cluster that was distinct from its closest neighbours, lactobacillus  amylovorus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gallinarum, l. acidophilus and lactobacillus helveticus. results of dna-dna hybridization experiments and whole-cell protein profiles clearly indicated that these strains represent a novel lactobacillus species, for which the name lactobacillus kitasatonis sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain of this species is jcm 1039(t).

TI  == selective enumeration of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacteria, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and propionibacteria.
AB  == nineteen bacteriological media were evaluated to assess their suitability to selectively enumerate lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacteria, and propionibacteria. bacteriological media evaluated included streptococcus thermophilus agar, ph modified mrs agar, mrs-vancomycine agar, mrs-bile agar, mrs-nacl agar, mrs-lithium chloride agar, mrs-nnlp (nalidixic acid, neomycin sulfate, lithium chloride and paramomycine sulfate) agar, reinforced clostridial agar, sugar-based (such as maltose, galactose, sorbitol, manitol, esculin) media, sodium lactate agar, arabinose agar, raffinose agar, xylose agar, and l. casei agar. incubations were carried out under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at 27, 30, 37, 43, and 45 degrees c for 24, 72 h, and 7 to 9 d. s. thermophilus agar and aerobic incubation at 37 degrees c for 24 h were suitable for s. thermophilus. l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus could be enumerated using mrs agar (ph 4.58 or ph 5.20) and under anaerobic incubation at 45 degrees c for 72 h. mrs-vancomycine agar and anaerobic incubation at 43 degrees c for 72 h were suitable to enumerate l. rhamnosus. mrs-vancomycine agar and anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees c for 72 h were selective for l. casei. to estimate the counts of l. casei by subtraction method, counts of l. rhamnosus on mrs-vancomycine agar at 43 degrees c for 72 h under anaerobic incubation could be subtracted from total counts of l. casei and l. rhamnosus enumerated on mrs-vancomycine agar at 37 degrees c for 72 h under anaerobic incubation. l. acidophilus could be enumerated using mrs-agar at 43 degrees c for 72 h or basal agar-maltose agar at 43 degrees c for 72 h or ba-sorbitol agar at 37 degrees c for 72 h, under anaerobic incubation. bifidobacteria could be enumerated on mrs-nnlp agar under anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees c for 72 h. propionibacteria could be enumerated on sodium lactate agar under anaerobic incubation at 30 degrees c for 7 to 9 d. a subtraction method was most suitable for counting propionibacteria in the presence of other lactic acid bacteria from a product. for this method, counts of lactic bacteria at d 3 on sodium lactate agar under anaerobic incubation at 30 degrees c were subtracted from counts at d 7 of lactic bacteria and propionibacteria.

TI  == [evaluation of the activity of probiotic cultures over listeria monocytogenes during the production and storage of yogurt].
AB  == the effect of probiotic cultures over listeria monocytogenes during the production and storage of yogurt was evaluated. a yogurt mixture (10.6% non-fat solid liquids, 3% fat and 0.3% gelatin) was prepared, homogenized and pasteurized. yogurt was inoculated with 0, 10(2), 10(4) and 10(6) cfu/ml of l. monocytogenes and 0.02% of traditional lactic culture yc 180 (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus) and probiotic culture aby-1 (bifidobacterium longum, b. bifidum, b, infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus y lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus). it was incubated for 3 h at 43 degrees c until ph reached an approximate value of 4.8, followed by refrigeration at 5 degrees c for 21 days. during fermentation, samples were taken every hour, and during storage every 3 days, analyzing ph and  lactic, bifidobacteria and pathogen count for each time. it was demonstrated that there was no significant simple effect for the type of culture used (aby-1 and yc 180) (p = 0.684) over the amount of l. monocytogenes present in yogurt during the fermentation and storage periods. the presence of bifidobacteria in the aby-1 culture did not present a significant effect over l. monocytogenes. neither the effect of time presented a significant effect over l. monocytogenes (p = 0.448).  in this case, the aby-1 and yc 180 cultures present a bacteriostatic effect over  the pathogen. the probiotic cultures had a bacteriostatic but not bactericidal effect over l. monocytogenes. this is not related to the protective effect of these cultures in bowel, since in-vivo conditions favor the production of antimicrobial substances, such as bacteriocins that act over pathogens.

TI  == the effect of temperature and ph on the growth of lactic acid bacteria: a ph-auxostat study.
AB  == the growth of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus paracasei was studied in a ph-auxostat. the computer-controlled smooth change of ph or temperature was used to study the effect of ph and temperature on the culture characteristics (specific growth rate mu growth yield y(atp) and specific lactate production rate q(atp)). the behaviour of mu and q(atp) with an increase of temperature suggested that atp production capacity was an important factor in determining the maximum growth rate of lactic acid bacteria (lab). the decrease of y(atp) with increase of temperature resulted in the decrease of specific growth rate while q(atp) remained constant or even increased. with the decrease of ph, decrease of both y(atp) and q(atp) was observed. s. thermophilus st20 having the highest maximum specific growth rate of 2.2 h(-1) at 44 degrees c was the most acid sensitive strain. the l. paracasei e1h3 having the lowest mu(max) was the most tolerant strain to ph change. the behaviour of mixed culture of l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus in milk in a ph-auxostat with ph-decrease was in agreement with the  pure culture experiments of the same species. the study showed that ph-auxostat with smooth controlled change of ph and temperature is an effective method for determination of technological characteristics and comparative physiological study of lab.

TI  == influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  == intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. the stimulus of the mucosal immunity is  not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. in previous works we have demonstrated that some lactic acid bacteria (lab), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis on the iga secreting cells associated to bronchus. as shown before, oral immunostimulation with lab induced an increase of the iga* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. in this study it is also showed that the lab assayed, with exception of l. acidophilus, were able to enhance iga+ cells at bronchial level,  being also this effect dose dependent. the increment induced by some lab in the number of iga+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be  very important to prevent bronchus diseases.

TI  == three new insertion sequence elements isldl2, isldl3, and isldl4 in lactobacillus delbrueckii: isolation, molecular characterization, and potential use for strain  identification.
AB  == a group of new insertion sequence (is) elements, isldl2, isldl3, and isldl4, from lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis atcc 15808 was isolated, characterized, and used for strain identification together with isldl1, recently characterized as an l. delbrueckii is element belonging to the isl3 family. isldl2 was 1367 bp  in size and had a 24 bp ir and an 8 bp dr. the single orf of isldl2 encoded a protein of 392 aa similar to transposases of the is256 family. isldl3 had a single orf encoding a protein of 343 aa similar to transposases of the is30 family. finally, isldl4 had a single orf encoding a protein of 406 aa and displayed homology to the transposases of the is110 family. isldl4 was only slight different from isl4 (accession no. ay040213). isldl1, isldl2, and isldl4 were present in all of the 10 l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis and subsp. delbrueckii strains tested, as well as in three of the 11 l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains tested. isldl3 was present only in four closely related strains of l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis. these is elements were not observed in lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, or lactobacillus  plantarum. a cluster of is elements, isldl1, isldl2, isldl3, isldl4, and isl6, was observed in l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis strain atcc 15808. within this cluster, isldl4 was inserted into isldl1 between the left ir and the start codon  of orf455, encoding a putative transposase. most of the integration sites of the  is elements were strain-specific. we have observed that is elements can migrate from one strain to another as integral parts of bacterial dna by using phage ll-h as a vehicle. we demonstrate for the first time that inverse pcr and vectorette pcr methods with primers based on sequences of the is elements could be used for  identification of l. delbrueckii strains.

TI  == intestinal pathway of internalisation of lactic acid bacteria and gut mucosal immunostimulation.
AB  == the induction of the gut mucosal immune response is dependent on the antigen interacting with the m cells of peyer's patches and with the immune cells associated with this lymphoid organ. in previous studies we showed that the mucosal immunostimulation by lab varied depending upon the strain being studied.  some of them increased the inflammatory immune response and others enhanced the level of secretory antibody (s-iga). our aim was to determine the pathway of the  internalisation of lab strains in the intestine, to provide a basis for understing the different behaviour exhibited by them. the presence of lab on peyer's patches or in the immune cells associated with the villi of small intestine was determined using fluorescein-labelled bacteria and by transmission  electron microscopy. mice were dosed orally by intubation, with 10<sup>1</sup> cells of labelled single strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus. for electron microscopy studies unlabelled bacteria were used. histological preparations of the small and large intestine were performed 1 hour  after administration of the bacteria. fluorescent bacteria of l. casei and s. thermophilus were found only in peyer's patches while l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and l. acidophilus were observed in peyer's patches and in the small intestine. l. acidophilus was also found in the large intestine. we confirmed these findings by electron microscopy. we determined that for l. casei the pathway of internalisation was via the m and fae cells of peyer's patches, while  for s. thermophilus, l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus the interaction with the immune cells of peyer's patches was through the follicle associated epithelium (fae). l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and l. acidophilus also interacted with the epithelial cells of the small intestine and l. acidophilus with epithelial cells of the large intestine. these results suggest that the different effects of lab on the mucosal immunostimulation, are related to the different pathways of gut internalisation used to take contact with the immune cells associated with the lamina propria intestinal.

TI  == interactions of lactic acid bacteria with human intestinal epithelial cells: effects on cytokine production.
AB  == as a participant in the mucosal immune response, the intestinal epithelial cell must respond to a variety of stimuli, including lactic acid bacteria (lab) consumed in the diet. the objective of this study was to compare the abilities of several strains of lab to modulate cytokine secretion by human intestinal epithelial cell (iec) line ht-29. certain strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and lactobacillus acidophilus suppressed the production of the chemokine rantes by stimulated ht-29 iec, although the magnitude of this suppression varied depending on the nature of the bacterial growth medium. similarly, specific strains showed growth condition-dependent suppression of ht-29 interleukin-8 (il-8) production. strain-dependent effects were also seen for the suppression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta) production. the binding of several of  these bacterial strains to the ht-29 cell line was also examined. different strains were found to have differing abilities to interact with iec, with l. rhamnosus r0011 being the strain that generally had the most extensive effects on ht-29 cytokine production and also bound to ht-29 iec most effectively. modulation of iec cytokine production has the potential to profoundly affect the  mucosal microenvironment, influencing the immune response to pathogens and other  ingested antigens.

TI  == interaction of lactic acid bacteria with the gut immune system.
AB  == health claims of lactic acid bacteria (lab) used in functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations are based on the capacity of these microorganisms to  stimulate the host immune system. in this study, the antigenic effect of lab (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus) on the gut immune system of balb/c mice was evaluated. a dose-dependent increase of the bcl2 protein was observed with all lab assayed. furthermore, the analysis of cytokine-producing cells in the lamina propria of gut showed that tnfalpha and infgamma values, determined in macrophages cultured from peyer patches, were enhanced for all the lab assayed. an important increase of interleukins il-10 and il-4 was observed mainly in mice  fed with lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus or lactobacillus casei, while  a significant induction of il-2 and il-12 was only observed with l. acidophilus (p<0.01). these effects were dose dependent. the role of produced cytokines in the balance th1/th2 was determined by a systemic antibody response against parenterally injected ovoalbumin. l. casei, l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and l. acidophilus enhanced the igg1 response favouring th2 balance, while l. acidophilus also increased the igg2a response inducing th1 balance. s. thermophilus did not influence the balance th1/th2. our studies showed that lactic acid bacteria induce distinct mucosal cytokine profiles showing different  adjuvant capacity among them. thus, selection of probiotic strain with immunological properties must be well defined to influence cytokine expression that favour the claimed immune response.

TI  == surface characteristics of lactobacilli isolated from human vagina.
AB  == in the present paper, the taxonomic classification of 134 lactobacilli isolates from vaginal samples of 200 women of tucuman, argentina, is reported. they were clustered in three metabolic groups of the genus lactobacillus, most belonging to the obligately homofermentative group (56%), mainly represented by lactobacillus  delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii and l. acidophilus. in the facultatively heterofermentative group (24%), the dominant species were l. paracasei subsp. paracasei and l. agilis, and in the obligately heterofermentative group (20%), l. brevis was the dominant species. all strains were studied for surface characteristics and adhesion-predicting properties. a correlation between the methods employed for hydrophobicity testing of the different isolates (microbial  adhesion to hydrocarbons and salt aggregation test) is reported. most strains were highly hydrophobic. their hemagglutination capability with human erythrocytes was also tested, which was positive only for a few strains. some isolates were self-aggregating. from our results, strains that shared the properties assayed were selected for further testing of some other desirable characteristics, such as antagonistic substance production, adhesion to biological substrates, and appropriate technological properties, to suggest the elaboration of a probiotic for the vaginal tract.

TI  == cloning and expression analysis of the 28 kda protein from lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis atcc 4797 hypothesized to influence lactacin b production.
AB  == aims: a cell wall-associated lactacin b inducer protein (ip) was purified from lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis atcc 4797 (lact. lactis) by chromatofocusing and gel filtration hplc (barefoot et al. 1994). methods and results: n-terminal sequence of the purified ip was used to design an oligonucleotide (24-mer) for gene identification by southern and colony hybridizations. southern hybridization on lact. lactis chromosomal dna digested with ecori and psti produced a single 4-5 kbp dna fragment. colony hybridizations with 6250 clones produced four positive recombinants for the proposed ip. sequence of the dna isolated from ru43e9 revealed a 4623 bp dna fragment containing three open reading frames (orf) potentially encoding enzymes that function in glycolysis. one orf, coding for an active triosephosphate isomerase (tpi), showed 98% homology to the n-terminal domain of the hplc purified ip. pcr  primers were designed to amplify the orf encoding the proposed ip for subcloning, protein expression, purification and bacteriocin enhancing assays on pure cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus n2. conclusions: the regions flanking the tpi gene (data not shown) were also sequenced and it is concluded that the proposed ip reported by barefoot et al. (1994) is located on an operon containing several glycolytic enzymes that function in glycolysis. significance and impact of the study: the findings of this study do not support previously published research (barefoot et al. 1994) hypothesizing that a purified ip from lact. lactis, homologous to a bacillus stearothermophilus tpi, is capable of enhancing  bacteriocin synthesis in lact. acidophilus n2.

TI  == evolution of the lactic acid bacterial community during malt whisky fermentation: a polyphasic study.
AB  == the development of the lactic acid bacterial community in a commercial malt whisky fermentation occurred in three broad phases. initially, bacteria were inhibited by strong yeast growth. fluorescence microscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed, in this early stage, both cocci and rods that were at least partly derived from the wort and yeast but also stemmed from the distillery plant. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of partial 16s rrna genes and sequence analysis revealed cocci related to streptococcus thermophilus or saccharococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus brevis, and lactobacillus fermentum. the middle phase began 35 to 40 h after yeast inoculation and was characterized by exponential growth of lactobacilli and residual yeast metabolism. lactobacillus casei or lactobacillus paracasei, l. fermentum, and lactobacillus ferintoshensis were detected in samples of fermenting wort examined by dgge during this stage. bacterial growth was accompanied by the accumulation of acetic and lactic acids and the metabolism of  residual maltooligosaccharides. by 70 h, two new pcr bands were detected on dgge  gels, and the associated bacteria were largely responsible for the final phase of the fermentation. the bacteria were phylogenetically related to lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii, and strains similar to the former had  previously been recovered from malt whisky fermentations in japan. these were probably obligately homofermentative bacteria, required malt wort for growth, and could not be cultured on normal laboratory media, such as mrs. their metabolism during the last 20 to 30 h of fermentation was associated with yeast death and autolysis and further accumulation of lactate but no additional acetate.

AB  == the microflora of 25 wheat sourdoughs from the apulia region, southern italy, was characterized. the sourdoughs were mainly produced from triticum durum wheat. the number of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts ranged from ca. log 7.5 to log 9.3 colony forming units (cfu)/g and from log 5.5 to log 8.4 cfu/g, respectively. about 38% of the 317 isolates of lactic acid bacteria were identified by conventional physiological and biochemical tests. phenotypic identification was confirmed by 16s rdna and 16s/23s rrna spacer region pcr. overall, 30% of the isolates were identified as lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, 20% as lb. alimentarius, 14% as lb. brevis, 12% as leuconostoc citreum, 7% as lb. plantarum, 6% as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 4% as lb. fermentum and lb. acidophilus,  2% as weissella confusa and 1% as lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. some of these species have not been previously isolated from sourdoughs. since bakers yeast is widely used in sourdough production, saccharomyces cerevisiae was largely found. the phenotypical relationships within the main lactic acid bacteria identified were established by using cluster analysis. a microbial map of the 25 sourdoughs was plotted showing characteristic associations among lactic acid bacteria and differences in the lactic acid bacteria species which were mainly due to the species of wheat flour, use of bakers yeast and type of bread.

TI  == gut mucosal immunostimulation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. the interaction of lab with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the lab. we studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of lab such as lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. plantarum, lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus. we determined if the lab assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. we demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of iga producing cells associated to the lamina  propria of small intestine. this effect was dose dependent. the increase in iga+  producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the cd4+ t cell number, indicating that some lab assayed only induced clonal expansion of b cells triggered to produce iga. most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. cd8+ t cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of l. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. this fact would mean that lab are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. we demonstrated the importance in the selection of lab to be used as gut mucosal  adjuvant. the different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune  response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the lab can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. the immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.

AB  == lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus helveticus, l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and l. casei related taxa which are widely used as starter or probiotic cultures can be identified by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). the genetic discrimination of the related species belonging to  these groups was first obtained by pcr amplifications by using group-specific or  species-specific 16s rdna primers. the numerical analysis of the ardra patterns obtained by using cfoi, hinfi, tru9i, and scrfi was an efficient typing tool for  identification of species of the l. acidophilus and l. casei complex. ardra by using cfoi was a reliable method for differentiation of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis. finally, strains atcc 393 and atcc 15820 exhibited unique ardra patterns with cfoi and tru9i restriction enzymes as  compared with the other strains of l. casei, l. paracasei, and l. rhamnosus.

TI  == a rapid procedure for isolating chromosomal dna from lactobacillus species and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == this study describes a rapid procedure for the isolation of genomic dna from various gram-positive bacteria. species tested included lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis atcc 4797, lact. acidophilus n2, staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, propionibacterium jensenii p126, bacillus pumilus and enterococcus faecalis. our technique for chromosomal dna isolation circumvents the need for phenol-chloroform extractions and caesium chloride gradients. isolated dna is consistently greater than 25 kb in size and can be used directly for subcloning,  polymerase chain reaction amplification, restriction digestions and library construction.

TI  == characterization of cell envelope-associated proteinases of thermophilic lactobacilli.
AB  == the proteolytic activities of two natural isolates of thermophilic lactobacilli,  lactobacillus acidophilus bgra43 and lact. delbrueckii bgpf1, and lact. acidophilus ch2 (chr. hansen's strain) and lact. acidophilus v74 (visby's strain), were compared. results revealed that optimal ph for all four proteinases is 6.5, whereas temperature optimum varied among proteinases. determination of caseinolytic activity done under optimal conditions for each strain revealed that the ch2 and v74 proteinases completely hydrolysed both alphas1-casein and beta-casein, showing very low activity towards kappa-casein. the bgpf1 proteinase completely hydrolysed only beta-casein. the bgra43 proteinase completely hydrolysed all three casein fractions. the proteolytic activities of whole cells  were inhibited by serine proteinase inhibitors, suggesting that all four strains  produce serine proteinases. dna-dna hybridization and pcr analysis showed that bgpf1 contains the prtb-like proteinase gene. characterized thermophilic strains  bgpf1 and bgra43 were successfully used as starter cultures for production of yoghurt and acidophilus milk, respectively.

TI  == rapid identification of 11 human intestinal lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr assays using group- and species-specific primers derived from the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna.
AB  == rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex pcr was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex pcr assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna  gene of members of the genus lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). the established two-step multiplex pcr assays were applied  to the identification of 84 lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the pcr results were consistent with the results from the dna-dna hybridization assay. these results suggest that the multiplex pcr system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.

TI  == characterisation and selection of a lactobacillus species to re-colonise the vagina of women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == this paper reports the results of characterising and selecting a strain of lactobacillus for potential use as a probiotic in regenerating the vaginal flora  of women with recurrent episodes of bacterial vaginosis (bv). bv is a condition characterised by a depletion of vaginal lactobacilli accompanied by an overgrowth of a mixed vaginal flora of aerobic, anaerobic and micro-aerophilic species in very large numbers. bv has been associated with various gynaecological and obstetric complications and has an extremely high recurrence rate, due in part to the failure to establish a normal vaginal flora after antimicrobial therapy. a total of 60 vaginal isolates of lactobacilli was assessed for characteristics considered important for vaginal re-colonisation. the characteristics studied were the in-vitro inhibitory activity of the lactobacilli against bacterial species isolated from women with recurrent bv, acid production after growth of the lactobacilli in liquid culture, production of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) and adhesiveness of the lactobacilli to exfoliated vaginal epithelial cells (vec). four strains of lactobacilli, l. acidophilus (61701 and 61880), l. crispatus (55730) and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii (65407), demonstrated the greatest  inhibitory activity against the bv-associated bacterial species. two of these isolates (55730 and 61880) produced h2o2. all four isolates produced a highly acidic environment after growth in liquid medium (ph <4). only one of these (strain 61701) was strongly adherent to vec (>100 bacteria/vec). a further isolate (l. acidophilus 48101) did not demonstrate maximum inhibitory activity against bv-associated bacteria, but was found to be a strong producer of h2o2 and was also highly adherent to vec. isolates 61701 and 48101 could be candidates for use as probiotics for vaginal re-colonisation.

TI  == fatty acid composition and freeze-thaw resistance in lactobacilli.
AB  == the fatty acid composition and freeze-thaw resistance of eight strains of thermophilic lactobacilli were studied. seven of these contained the same polar and neutral lipids, the five major components making up 90% of the cellular fatty acid pool being 14:0, 16:0, 16:1, 18:1 and c19 cyclopropane (cyc19:0). strain comparison by means of cluster analysis based on the fatty acid ratios using the  overlap coefficient revealed two well defined clusters. one was formed by three strains of species lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, the other included five strains of the species lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lb. acidophilus and lb. helveticus. resistance of  strains with a high content of unsaturated fatty acids (66-70%) decreased with increasing cyc19:0 concentrations. in contrast, in strains with a low concentration of unsaturated fatty acids (42-49%), increasing cyc19:0 levels were associated with increased freeze-thaw resistance.

TI  == probiotic culture survival and implications in fermented frozen yogurt characteristics.
AB  == low-fat ice cream mix was fermented with probiotic-supplemented and traditional starter culture systems and evaluated for culture survival, composition, and sensory characteristics of frozen product. fermentations were stopped when the titratable acidity reached 0.15% greater than the initial titratable acidity (end point 1) or when the ph reached 5.6 (end point 2). mix was frozen and stored for  11 wk at -20 degrees c. the traditional yogurt culture system contained the strains streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii  ssp. bulgaricus. the probiotic-supplemented system contained the traditional cultures as well as bifidobacterium longum and lactobacillus acidophilus. we compared recovery of bifodobacterium by three methods, a repair-detection system  with roll-tubes and plates on modified bifid glucose medium and plates with maltose + galactose reinforced clostridial medium. culture bacteria in both systems did not decrease in the yogurt during frozen storage. the roll-tube method with modified bifid glucose agar and repair detection system provided at least one-half log10 cfu/ml higher recovery of b. longum compared with recoveries using modified bifid glucose agar or maltose + galactose reinforced clostridial agar on petri plates. no change in concentrations of lactose or protein for products fermented with either culture system occurred during storage. acid flavor was more intense when product was fermented to ph 5.6, but yogurt flavor was not intensified. the presence of probiotic bacteria in the supplemented system seemed to cause no differences in protein and lactose concentration and sensory characteristics.

AB  == unheated and heat-treated homogenates were separately prepared from candidate probiotic bacteria, including lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus. we compared the phytohemagglutinin-induced proliferation of mononuclear cells in the presence of homogenates and in the presence of a control containing no homogenate by assessing thymidine incorporation in cell cultures. all homogenates suppressed proliferation, whether the enzymatic activity was inactivated or not inactivated by heating. when the proliferation assays were repeated with cytoplasmic and cell wall extracts derived from the homogenate of l. rhamnosus gg, the cytoplasmic extract but not the cell wall extract was suppressive. these findings indicate that candidate probiotic bacteria possess a heat-stable antiproliferative component(s). these bacteria may be used to generate microbiologically nonviable yet immunologically  active probiotic food products that are easier to store and have a longer shelf life.

TI  == antagonistic activity of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus species from ogi,  an indigenous fermented food.
AB  == seven lactobacillus species each with one or more strains were isolated from various fermented cereal gruel's (ogi). they were identified as l. plantarum (3 strains), l. delbrueckii (1 strain), l. brevis (2 strains), l. reuteri (2 strains), l. casei (1 strain), l. fermentum (1 strain) and l. acidophilus (1 strain). bacteriocin production was observed in cell-free supernatants of 8 of these strains with l. fermentum, l. delbrueckii and l. reuteri strains (white maize ogi) being negative. the bacteriocin produced by the eight strains inhibited the growth of various target organisms with the inhibition strongly noticed using enterococcus faecalis as indicator. while catalase treatment, ph changes and heat treatment up to 80 degrees c had no effect on the activity of bacteriocin from these isolates, treatment with trypsin and proteinase k resulted in complete loss of inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins. a reduction in the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins was also found to occur with increasing concentrations of glucose or peptone in the cultivation medium.

TI  == study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. antigens administered orally can interact with m cells of peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. we have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance  the gut inflammatory immune response. the aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. we studied iga+ and igm+ b cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and cd4+ t cells and iga anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by  oral administration of lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lb.  acidophilus, lb. plantarum, lb. rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus  salivarius ssp. thermophilus. the increase in the iga+ b cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the iga cycle by interaction with m cells from peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. the igm+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from igm+ to iga+. the increase in the cd4+ cells suggests interaction of peyer's patches and  enhancement of the b- and t-cell migration. the anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. we demonstrated that lb. casei and lb. plantarum were able to interact with peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in iga-, cd4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase  in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. although lb. rhamnosus and strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. lactococcus lactis and lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of iga+ cells entering the iga cycle but not cd4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated b lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. we did not determine specific antibodies against lc. lactis or lb. bulgaricus.

TI  == 16s-23s and 23s-5s intergenic spacer regions of lactobacilli: nucleotide sequence, secondary structure and comparative analysis.
AB  == lactobacilli have been used as industrial starters for a long time, but in several cases their identification was, and still is, neither easy nor reliable.  the aim of the present work was to examine whether the intergenic spacer regions  could be of value in the identification of lactobacillus species. for that purpose, the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to amplify 16s-23s and 23s-5s spacer regions of lactobacillus (l.) acidophilus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. helveticus and l. curvatus. the pcr products were directly sequenced, and two forms of ribosomal rna (rrn) operons were identified  in each species studied: one with tandem trna(ile)/trna(ala) genes and the other  one without trna genes. our study revealed that the rrn operons of lactobacillus  species studied comprise the genes of 16s, 23s and 5s rrna, in that order. only the trna genes and the rrna processing stems are highly conserved in spacer regions of lactobacilli. the divergence between the lactobacilli spacer region sequences arises from insertions and deletions of short sequences. these sequences could be interesting candidates for the development of species-specific probes. theoretical rna/rna secondary structure models of the interaction between the two spacer region sequences were constructed. in conclusion, the two spacer region sequences may prove to be a useful alternative to 16s and 23s rdna sequencing for designing species-specific probes and for establishing phylogenetic relationships between closely related species such as l. curvatus and l. casei or l. acidophilus and l. helveticus.

AB  == the ability of acidocin ch5, a bacteriocin from lactobacillus acidophilus ch5 in  the form of neutralized and heated supernatant, to prevent the growth of the indicator lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis lti 30 alone or together with other antimicrobials was investigated. the inhibitory activity of acidocin ch5 was higher in mrs broth than in reconstituted skim milk (rsm). in mrs broth and rsm, 1.92 and 32 au acidocin ch5/ml, respectively, caused 97 and 89% inhibition of the indicator lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis lti 30. the presence of  5 and 10% milk fat in rsm decreased the inhibitory activity of acidocin ch5 to 20 and 11%, respectively. the inhibitory activity of acidocin ch5 was also reduced in the presence of nacl, nano3 and lysozyme. in rsm the inhibition was weaker with both acidocin ch5 and nacl added compared with nacl alone. in mrs broth the  inhibition was stronger with both acidocin ch5 and nacl added compared with nacl  alone. the inhibition of the indicator lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis lti 30 was stronger with both nano3 and acidocin ch5 in mrs broth (but not in rsm) than with only nano3 present, but the strongest level was obtained with acidocin ch5 alone. addition of acidocin ch5 and more than 30 mg/ml lysozyme to mrs broth increased the level of inhibition above the level obtained by acidocin  ch5 alone. the indicator lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis lti 30 was also  sensitive to nacl, nano3 and lysozyme in both mrs broth and rsm.

TI  == electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases, a new tool for bacterial species identification: application to 10 lactobacillus species.
AB  == lactobacilli have been used as industrial starters for a long time, but in many cases their phenotypic identification is still neither easy nor reliable. previously we observed that the cell wall peptidoglycan hydrolases of lactobacillus helveticus were highly conserved enzymes; the aim of the present work was to determine whether peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns obtained by renaturing sds-page could be of interest in the identification of lactobacilli species. for that purpose, the peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns of 94 strains of  lactobacilli belonging to 10 different species were determined; most of the species studied are used either in dairy, meat, bakery or vegetable fermentations: l. helveticus, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii, l. brevis, l. fermentum, l. jensenii, l. plantarum, l. sake, l. curvatus and l. reuteri. within a species, the strains exhibited highly similar patterns: the apparent molecular  weights of the lytic bands were identical, with only slight variations of intensity. moreover, each species, including phylogenetically close species such  as l. sake and l. curvatus, or l. acidophilus and l. helveticus, gave a different pattern. interestingly, the closer the species were phylogenetically, the more related were their patterns. the sensitivity of the method was checked using various quantities of l. acidophilus cells: a peptidoglycan hydrolase extract of  5 x 10(6) cells was sufficient to obtain an informative pattern, as was a single  colony. finally, the method was also successfully applied to distinguish two carnobacterium species. in conclusion, the electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases is proposed as a new tool for lactobacilli identification: it is rapid, sensitive and effective even for phylogenetically close species. furthermore, this work provides the first evidence of the potential overall taxonomic value of bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases.

TI  == the presence of two s-layer-protein-encoding genes is conserved among species related to lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == previously we have shown that the type strain of lactobacillus acidophilus possesses two s-protein-encoding genes, one of which is silent, on a chromosomal  segment of 6 kb. the s-protein-encoding gene in the expression site can be exchanged for the silent s-protein-encoding gene by inversion of this slp segment. in this study the presence of s-protein and corresponding s-protein-encoding genes of strains belonging to species that are closely related to l. acidophilus was determined. all strains investigated were identified by numerical comparison of highly standardized one-dimensional sds-page whole-cellular-protein patterns. western blot and southern blot methods were used to identify the presence of, and homology between, s-proteins and s-protein-encoding genes. from these analyses we conclude that strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. amylovorus and l. gallinarum possess an s-layer and contain two slp genes. strains of l. helveticus possess an s-layer but have only  one intact slp gene. strains of l. gasseri, l. johnsonii and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus have neither an s-layer nor s-protein-encoding genes hybridizing with probes derived from the l. acidophilus slpa or slpb region. the  presence of a highly conserved 5' region in the slp genes of strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. amylovorus and l. gallinarum suggests that s-layer  variation is a common feature for strains of these species.

AB  == oral administration of lactobacilli evokes mucosal and systemic immune responses  against epitopes associated with these organisms (gerritse et al., 1990, 1991). the adjuvant function of different lactobacillus species was investigated under the conditions of intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection or oral administration. after  i.p. injection of trinitrophenylated chicken gamma-globulin, high dth responses were observed with lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus plantarum, but low responses with lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. in different experimental model systems l. casei and l. plantarum consistently showed significant adjuvanticity. a series of expression and expression-secretion vectors containing the strong constitutive promoter of the l. casei l-ldh gene or the regulatable promoter of the lactobacillus amylovorus amy gene (pouwels and leer, 1995) was used for the intracellular, extracellular and surface-bound expression of an influenza virus antigenic determinant fused to escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase. intracellular expression of the fusion protein amounted to 1-2% of total soluble protein. lactobacilli synthesizing the  fusion protein intracellularly evoked an oral immune response after subcutaneous  priming.

TI  == comparison of proteolytic activities in various lactobacilli.
AB  == a total of 169 lactobacillus strains from 12 species (lb. acidophilus, lb. brevis, lb. buchneri, lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lb. fermentum, lb. helveticus, lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, lb. plantarum and lb. rhamnosus), isolated from raw milk and various milk products, and 9 lactococcus lactis strains were evaluated for peptidase activities with five chromogenic substrates  and a tryptic digest of casein. within each species, the peptidase activity of the cell-free extracts of the strains varied. furthermore, differences were observed between the lactobacillus species and lc. lactis. lb. helveticus had by  far the highest hydrolysing activities towards all substrates, indicating the presence of powerful aminopeptidases, x-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidases and proline iminopeptidases. lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus possessed high hydrolysing activities towards substrates containing proline, alanyl-prolyl-p-nitroanilide and prolyl-p-nitroanilide. on the other hand, lb. fermentum and lb. brevis could be considered as weakly proteolytic species. a more detailed study with highly proteolytic lactobacillus strains indicated that  at least three different proteinases or endopeptidases were present. compared with lc. lactis, the lactobacillus strains had a much lower hydrolytic action on  glutamyl-glutamic acid, suggesting that glutamyl aminopeptidase was absent in lactobacilli.

TI  == genetic and biochemical characterization of the lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.  lactis bacteriophage ll-h lysin.
AB  == ll-h, a virulent phage of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, produces a peptidoglycan-degrading enzyme, mur, that is effective on l. delbrueckii, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, and pediococcus damnosus cell walls. in this study, the ll-h gene mur was cloned into escherichia coli, its nucleotide sequence was determined, and the enzyme produced in e. coli was purified and biochemically characterized. mur was purified 112-fold by means of ammonium sulfate precipitation and cation-exchange chromatography. the cell wall-hydrolyzing activity was found to be associated with a 34-kda protein. the c-terminal domain of mur is not essential for catalytic activity since it can be  removed without destroying the lytic activity. the n-terminal sequence of the purified lysin was identical to that deduced from the nucleotide sequence, but the first methionine is absent from the mature protein. the n-terminal part of this 297-amino-acid protein had homology with several chalaropsis-type lysozymes. reduction of purified and mur-digested l. delbrueckii cell wall material with labeled nab3h4 indicated that the enzyme is a muramidase. the temperature optimum of purified mur is between 30 and 40 degrees c, and the ph optimum is around 5.0. the ll-h lysin mur is stable at temperatures below 60 degrees c.

TI  == genetic analysis of acidocin b, a novel bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == the genes encoding the production of acidocin b, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus strain m46 which is active against listeria monocytogenes, clostridium sporogenes, brochothrix thermosphacta, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, but inactive against most other lactobacillus species, were previously localized on a 4 kb xbai-hindiii fragment of plasmid pcv461. in the present work, dna sequence analysis revealed the presence of three consecutive orfs, which potentially code  for hydrophobic peptides composed of 60, 91 and 114 amino acids, respectively, and a fourth orf of opposite polarity which could potentially encode a peptide of 59 amino acids. the middle orf (orf-2; acdb) was identified as the gene encoding  acidocin b by comparing the amino acid composition of highly purified acidocin b  with the deduced amino acid sequence of orf-2. our results suggest that acidocin  b is synthesized as a precursor which is processed at a site which conforms to the ' -3, -1' rules of von heijne to yield active acidocin b (59 amino acids). the presence of an immunity-protein-encoding gene on the 4 kb xbai-bamhi fragment was deduced from the capacity of a plasmid vector harbouring this fragment to confer immunity upon transformation of l. fermentum nck127. one of the three non-assigned orfs may encode this immunity protein.

TI  == factors involved in adherence of lactobacilli to human caco-2 cells.
AB  == a quantitative assay performed with bacterial cells labelled with [3h]thymidine was used to investigate factors involved in the adherence of human isolates lactobacillus acidophilus bg2fo4 and ncfm/n2 and lactobacillus gasseri adh to human caco-2 intestinal cells. for all three strains, adherence was concentration dependent, greater at acidic ph values, and significantly greater than adherence  of a control dairy isolate, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 1489. adherence of l. acidophilus bg2fo4 and ncfm/n2 was decreased by protease treatment of the bacterial cells, whereas adherence of l. gasseri adh either was  not affected or was enhanced by protease treatment. putative surface layer proteins were identified on l. acidophilus bg2fo4 and ncfm/n2 cells but were not  involved in adherence. periodate oxidation of bacterial cell surface carbohydrates significantly reduced adherence of l. gasseri adh, moderately reduced adherence of l. acidophilus bg2fo4, and had no effect on adherence of l.  acidophilus ncfm/n2. these results indicate that lactobacillus species adhere to  human intestinal cells via mechanisms which involve different combinations of carbohydrate and protein factors on the bacterial cell surface. the involvement of a secreted bridging protein, which has been proposed as the primary mediator of adherence of l. acidophilus bg2fo4 in spent culture supernatant (m.-h. coconnier, t. r. klaenhammer, s. kerneis, m.-f. bernet, and a. l. servin, appl. environ. microbiol. 58:2034-2039, 1992), was not confirmed in this study. rather, a ph effect on caco-2 cells contributed significantly to the adherence of this strain in spent culture supernatant.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == antimutagenicity of fermented milk.
AB  == reconstituted nonfat dry milk was fermented by lactobacillus helveticus ch65, lactobacillus acidophilus bg2fo4, streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus ch3, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191r, and by a mixture of the latter two organisms. the fermented milks were then freeze-dried, extracted in acetone,  dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, and assayed for antimutagenicity in the ames test (salmonella typhimurium ta 100) against n-methyl, n'-nitro, n-nitroso-guanidine,  and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl. dose-dependent activity was significant against both mutagens in all extracts. maximal inhibitory activity against 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl and n-methyl, n'-nitro, n-nitroso-guanidine was 2-  and 2.7-fold greater, respectively, than that exhibited by extracts of unfermented milk. extracts of milk fermented by l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191r were examined further. compounds that were responsible for activity against  both mutagens were less soluble in aqueous solutions than in dimethylsulfoxide. adjustment of milk fermented by l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191r to ph 3, 7.6, or 13 prior to freeze-drying and acetone extraction did not significantly alter the activity specific for 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl. in contrast, compounds with activity specific for n-methyl, n'-nitro, n-nitrosoguanidine were less extractable at ph 7.6. the weak antimutagenicity of unfermented milk was not increased by addition of 2% l-lactic acid.

TI  == identification and purification of a protein that induces production of the lactobacillus acidophilus bacteriocin lactacin b.
AB  == lactacin b is a heat-stable bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus n2  that is active against closely related lactobacilli, including lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis (formerly lactobacillus leichmannii) atcc 4797. pure producer cultures propagated in mrs broth (initial ph 6.5) contain no lactacin b; it is detected only in cultures maintained at ph 5.0 to 6.0 and produced optimally at ph 6.0 s. f. barefoot and t. r. klaenhammer, antimicrob. agents chemother. 26:328-334, 1984). associative growth of producer and indicator, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis atcc 4797, resulted in production of an inhibitor identical to lactacin b. associative growth increased lactacin b production from  nondetectable levels (< 100 activity units [au]/ml) to between 3,200 and 6,400 au/ml in mrs broth (initial ph 6.5) and resulted in early but equal production of lactacin b (approximately 25,600 au/ml) in broth maintained at ph 6.0. indicator  cells, but not spent culture filtrates, induced lactacin b production. indicator  cells disrupted by a french pressure cell yielded cell-free filtrates containing  inducing activity. chromatofocusing and gel filtration high-performance liquid chromatography of cell-free filtrates yielded a protein with a pi of 4.1 and a molecular size of approximately 58 kda that induced lactacin b production. analytical isoelectric focusing yielded a single protein band. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels contained a 28-kda protein suggesting a two-subunit structure. protein sequencing identified an n-terminal serine and 18 additional amino acids. to our knowledge, there are not previous descriptions of proteins that induce bacteriocin production in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of jejunal aspirates and faecal samples after oral administration of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == a double-blind placebo controlled investigation was carried out to study the effect of peroral colonization. human volunteers were given mixtures of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria. measurements were made over a 1 week treatment period and for another week after the end of the treatment. two different bacteriological preparations were used, one consisted of enterococcus faecium and bifidobacterium longum (a total of 6.4 x 10(8) cfu d-1); the other consisted of lactobacillus acidophilus, bif. bifidum, lact. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus (a total of 9 x 10(9) cfu d-1). together with a placebo preparation, they were given to 24 healthy controls (eight in each group). microbiological examinations of jejunal aspirates showed that viable counts of most species were below the detection limit. however, the test preparation containing ent. faecium and bif. longum significantly reduced the anaerobe: aerobe ratio in faeces by a factor of three during treatment (p = 0.03), and increased it by a factor of 30 during the following week (p < 0.02). this study shows that peroral administration of certain bacterial cultures may affect the distal intestinal microflora.

TI  == antibiosis revisited: bacteriocins produced by dairy starter cultures.
AB  == well before the existence of starter bacteria was recognized, their activities were instrumental in preserving dairy foods. during growth in fermented products, dairy starters, including lactobacilli, lactococci, leuconostocs, streptococci, and propionibacteria, produce inhibitory metabolites. inhibitors include broad-spectrum antagonists, organic acids, diacetyl, and hydrogen peroxide. some  starters also produce bacteriocins or bactericidal proteins active against species that usually are related closely to the producer culture. several bacteriocins have been biochemically and genetically characterized. evaluating properties of the lactobacillus acidophilus bacteriocin, lactacin b, led to a new purification protocol. purified lactacin b migrates in sds-page as a single 8100-da band with inhibitory activity after coomassie blue staining. production of lactacin b is enhanced by cultivation of the producer with the sensitive indicator, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis 4797; understanding this interaction may increase knowledge of production of bacteriocins in heterogeneous cultures. bacteriocins have been recently identified in dairy propionibacteria. jenseniin g, a bacteriocin produced by propionibacterium jensenii p126, has narrow activity; propionicin plg-1 produced by propionibacterium thoenii p127 inhibits propionibacteria, some fungi, campylobacter jejuni, and additional pathogens. better understanding of these antagonists may lead to targeted biocontrol of spoilage flora and foodborne pathogens.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of lactobacillus spp. associated with healthy and diseased mucosa of the human intestines.
AB  == two-hundred and fifty lactobacillus strains isolated from healthy and diseased mucosa of human intestines of 75 individuals and 49 reference strains were phenotypically classified using 49 unit characters. data were processed by the jaccard (sj) and simple matching (ssm) coefficients, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. seventeen major clusters were defined at the  76% sj-similarity level which approximately correspond to the ssm-level of 91%. seven clusters could be identified: lactobacillus plantarum (isolates recovered from 5% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus (17% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (5% of the patients), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (3% of the patients), lact. buchneri (4% of patients), lact. reuteri (4% of the patients) and lact. salivarius subsp. salivarius (9% of the patients). unassigned clusters 1 and 3 both contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains. cluster 1 included the type strains of lact. crispatus, lact. acidophilus, lact. jensenii and lact. gasseri, and cluster 3, the type strains of lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lact. agilis and lact. casei subsp. tolerans. clusters 1 and 3 were found in 15% and 25% of the patients, respectively. unassigned clusters 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. clusters 11, 12, 15 and 17 were made up of heterofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. phenotypical characteristics of the clusters are given. no obvious trends in species (cluster) composition between different intestinal locations could be noted. most clusters contained isolates from both diseased and healthy mucosa. exceptions were cluster 15 and cluster 17 which only included isolates from healthy mucosa, and cluster 11 which only included isolates from diseased mucosa. cluster 15 was isolated in 12% of the patients, and cluster 11 in 8%.

TI  == antigenotoxic properties of lactic acid bacteria in the s. typhimurium mutagenicity assay.
AB  == a high percentage of human tumors is reported to be related to dietary habits. one way to improve the nutritional impact is to increase the intake of protective factors, such as inhibitors of dna damage and other types of anticarcinogens. specific strains of lactic acid bacteria used to ferment milk are promising candidates that may be antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic. we have studied the antimutagenicity of 10 isolated strains of beneficial lactic acid bacteria. four  types of fermented milk products were also studied for their protective properties. the effect of these bacteria on the yield of revertants induced by nitrosated beef extract was investigated in the salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay. eight of 10 isolated lactobacillus strains reduced the yield  of his+ revertants almost back to the levels of the untreated controls. different fermented fresh yogurts containing viable bacteria (probably lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus or lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacteria) showed protective effects as well. the degree of  suppressing revertants was independent of the yogurt's fat content. in contrast,  yogurt products that had been heat treated were not inhibitory. the other fresh fermented milk products (e.g., buttermilk, kefir, and "dickmilch") were not antimutagenic in this study. the results imply that some bacteria used in milk processing have an antimutagenic potential and that this property is specific for the bacterial strain.

TI  == strains and species of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milks (yogurts): effect  on in vivo lactose digestion.
AB  == lactose in yogurt with live bacteria is better tolerated than lactose in other dairy foods, partly because of the activity of microbial beta-galactosidase (beta-gal), which digests lactose in vivo. to evaluate the ability of different strains and species of lactic acid bacteria to digest lactose in vivo, yogurts (containing mixtures of strains of streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus) and fermented milks (containing individual species of s thermophilus, l bulgaricus, l acidophilus, or bifidobacterium bifidus) that varied in microbial beta-gal activity were produced. selected products were fed to healthy people who cannot digest lactose, and breath hydrogen production was monitored. all yogurts dramatically and similarly improved lactose digestion, regardless of their total or specific beta-gal activity. the response to fermented milks varied from marginal improvement with b bifidus milk to nearly complete lactose digestion with l bulgaricus milk. the results suggest that total beta-gal was not the limiting factor in promoting lactose digestion, perhaps because of a limited rate of intracellular substrate transport.

AB  == the genus lactobacillus is mainly found in the intestinal tract of healthy humans and animals as well as in fermenting vegetables or plant materials, such as silage. it has a moderate diffusion in meat products and is rarely found in wines and beers. on the other hand, rod-shaped lactic-acid bacteria are largely used in the preparation of a variety of foods and feed products. as starter cultures, they are omnipresent in cheeses and dairy manufacturing. specific fermentation processes have been developed in order to encourage the growth of the desired species, some of which are fastidious organisms such as l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, l. helveticus and l. sanfrancisco. in addition, a promising and interesting perspective is the use of rod-shaped lactic-acid bacteria, primarily  l. acidophilus, l. reuteri and l. salivarius as probiotic starters to preserve the natural biological equilibrium of the intestinal tract.

TI  == betaine transport imparts osmotolerance on a strain of lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == unlike most lactobacillus acidophilus strains, a specific strain, l. acidophilus  ifo 3532, was found to grow in rich medium containing 1 m sodium acetate, kcl, or nacl. this strain could also grow with up to 1.8 m nacl or 3 m nonelectrolytes (fructose, xylose, or sorbitol) added. thus, this strain was tolerant to osmotic  pressures up to 2.8 osm. a search for an intracellular solute which conferred osmoprotection led to the identification of glycine betaine (betaine). betaine was accumulated to high concentrations in cells growing in mrs medium supplemented with 1 m kcl or nacl. uptake of [c]betaine by l. acidophilus 3532 cells suspended in buffer was stimulated by increasing the medium osmotic pressure with 1 m kcl or nacl. the accumulated betaine was not metabolized further; transport was relatively specific for betaine and was dependent on an energy source. other lactobacilli, more osmosensitive than strain 3532, including l. acidophilus strain e4356, l. bulgaricus 8144, and l. delbrueckii 9649, showed  lower betaine transport rates in response to an osmotic challenge than l. acidophilus 3532. experiments with chloramphenicol-treated l. acidophilus 3532 cells indicated that the transport system was not induced but appeared to be activated by an increase in osmotic pressure.

AB  == the effects of lactic acid bacterial fermentation on chemical and physical changes in aqueous extracts of cowpea (vigna unguiculata), peanut (arachis hypogea), soybean (glycine max), and sorghum (sorghum vulgare) were studied. the  bacteria investigated were lactobacillus helveticus, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus. organisms were inoculated individually into all of the seed extracts; l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus were also evaluated together as inocula for fermenting the legume extracts. during fermentation, bacterial population and changes in titratable acidity, ph, viscosity, and color were measured over a 72-h period at 37 degrees  c. maximum bacterial populations, titratable acidity, ph, and viscosity varied depending upon the type of extract and bacterial strain. the maximum population of each organism was influenced by fermentable carbohydrates, which, in turn, influenced acid production and change in ph. change in viscosity was correlated with the amount of protein and titratable acidity of products. color was affected by pasteurization treatment and fermentation as well as the source of extract. in the extracts inoculated simultaneously with l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus, a  synergistic effect resulted in increased bacterial populations, titratable acidity, and viscosity, and decreased ph in all the legume extracts when compared to the extracts fermented with either of these organisms individually. fermented  extracts offer potential as substitutes for cultured dairy products.
