TI  - Effect of Probiotic Containing Ice-cream on Salivary Mutans Streptococci (SMS) Levels in Children of 6-12 Years of Age: A Randomized Controlled Double Blind Study with Six-months Follow Up.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the caries risk based on the salivary levels of streptococcus mutans in children of 6-12 years of age group before and after consuming probiotic ice-cream containing Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A double blind, placebo controlled trial was carried out in 60 children aged between 6 to 12 years with zero decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT). They were randomly divided into two equal groups. Saliva sample were collected before the consumption of ice-cream and Streptococcus mutans count was calculated and recorded as baseline data. For the next seven days both the groups were given ice creams marked as A and B. Saliva samples were collected after ice-cream consumption at the end of study period and also after a washout period of 30 days and again after six months. Samples were inoculated and colonies were counted. RESULTS: On statistical evaluation by students paired t-test, probiotic ice-cream brought significant reduction in the Streptococcus mutans count after seven days of ice-cream ingestion (p<0.001) and also after 30 d of washout period (p<0.001). There was no significant reduction (p=0.076) by normal ice-cream consumption. After six months of the study period in both the groups the salivary levels of Streptococcus mutans was similar to the baseline. CONCLUSION: Probiotic ice-cream containing Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 can cause reduction in caries causative organism. The dosage of the probiotic organisms for the long term or synergetic effect on the oral health are still needed to be explored.
TI  - The inhibitory effect of a fermented papaya preparation on growth, hydrophobicity, and acid production of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, and Lactobacillus acidophilus: its implications in oral health improvement of diabetics.
AB  - Fermented papaya preparation (FPP) is a "natural health product." The high incidence of dental caries, gingivitis, periodontitis, and oral microbial infection cases among patients with diabetes mellitus continues to prevail. The potential role of FPP against common oral microbiota (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, and Lactobacillus acidophilus) isolated from the human oral cavity was investigated using in vitro simulation models of dental plaque and caries. FPP showed an inhibitory effect against the growth (at 0.05 mg/mL: S. mutans: -6.9%; S. mitis: -4.47%, P < 0.05), acid production (at 0.05 mg/mL: S. mutans: +6.38%; L. acidophilus: +2.25%), and hydrophobicity (at 50 mg/mL: S. mutans: 1.01%, P < 0.01; S. mitis: 7.66%, P < 0.05) of tested microbiota. The results of this study suggest that low doses of FPP may be a suitable complement to good oral hygiene practice for the effective prevention of dental caries, plaque, and gingivitis. The functional application of FPP as a constituent of a balanced diet and active lifestyle can make a positive contribution to the oral health status and well-being of patients with diabetes.
TI  - Systematic screening of plant extracts from the Brazilian Pantanal with antimicrobial activity against bacteria with cariogenic relevance.
AB  - This study proposes a bioprospection methodology regarding the antimicrobial potential of plant extracts against bacteria with cariogenic relevance. Sixty extracts were obtained from ten plants--(1) Jatropha weddelliana, (2) Attalea phalerata, (3) Buchenavia tomentosa, (4) Croton doctoris, (5) Mouriri elliptica, (6) Mascagnia benthamiana, (7) Senna aculeata, (8) Unonopsis guatterioides, (9) Allagoptera leucocalyx and (10) Bactris glaucescens--using different extraction methods - (A) 70 degrees ethanol 72 h/25 degrees C, (B) water 5 min/100 degrees C, (C) water 1 h/55 degrees C, (D) water 72 h/25 degrees C, (E) hexane 72 h/25 degrees C and (F) 90 degrees ethanol 72 h/25 degrees C. The plants were screened for antibacterial activity at 50 mg/ml using the agar well diffusion test against Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC 19039, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, Streptococcus gordonii ATCC 10558, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35688, Streptococcus sanguinis ATCC 10556, Streptococcus sobrinus ATCC 33478 and Streptococcus mitis ATCC 9811. The active extracts were tested to determine their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), cytotoxicity and chemical characterization. Forty-seven extracts (78%) were active against at least one microorganism. Extract 4A demonstrated the lowest MIC and MBC for all microorganisms except S. gordonii and the extract at MIC concentration was non-cytotoxic. The concentrated extracts were slightly cytotoxic. Electrospray ionization with tandem mass spectrometry analyses demonstrated that the extract constituents coincided with the mass of the terpenoids and phenolics. Overall, the best results were obtained for extraction methods A, B and C. The present work proved the antimicrobial activity of several plants. Particularly, extracts from C. doctoris were the most active against bacteria involved in dental caries disease.
TI  - Adhesion forces and composition of planktonic and adhering oral microbiomes.
AB  - The oral microbiome consists of a planktonic microbiome residing in saliva and an adhering microbiome (the biofilm adhering to oral hard and soft tissues). Here we hypothesized that possible differences in microbial composition of the planktonic and adhering oral microbiome on teeth can be related to the forces by which different bacterial species are attracted to the tooth surface. The relative presence of 7 oral bacterial species in saliva and biofilm collected from 10 healthy human volunteers was determined twice in each volunteer by denaturing-gradient-gel electrophoresis. Analysis of both microbiomes showed complete separation of the planktonic from the adhering oral microbiome. Next, adhesion forces of corresponding bacterial strains with saliva-coated enamel surfaces were measured by atomic force microscopy. Species that were found predominantly in the adhering microbiome had significantly higher adhesion forces to saliva-coated enamel (-0.60 to -1.05 nN) than did species mostly present in the planktonic microbiome (-0.40 to -0.55 nN). It is concluded that differences in composition of the planktonic and the adhering oral microbiome are due to small differences in the forces by which strains adhere to saliva-coated enamel, providing an important step in understanding site- and material-specific differences in the composition of biofilms in the oral cavity.
TI  - In-vitro activity of saponins of bauhinia purpurea, madhuca longifolia, celastrus paniculatus and semecarpus anacardium on selected oral pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dental caries, periodontitis and other mucosal diseases are caused by  a complex community of microorganisms. This study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial properties of saponins of four important oil yielding medicinal plant extracts on selected oral pathogens that are involved in such diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Saponins were extracted from Bauhinia purpurea, Madhuca longifolia, Celastrus paniculatus and Semecarpus anacardium and purified. Antimicrobial properties of these saponins against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus aureus and Lactobacillus acidophilus were determined using well diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined as the lowest concentration of saponins inhibiting bacterial growth after 14 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. The bactericidal activity was evaluated using the viable cell count method. RESULTS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of Madhuca longifolia saponin on Streptococcus mutans MTCC 890, Streptococcus mitis and Staphylococcus aureus was 18.3 +/- 0.15/34.4 +/- 0.24 mug/ml, 19.0 +/- 0.05/32.2 +/- 0.0 mug/ml and 21.2 +/- 0.35/39.0 +/- 0.30 mug/ml, respectively and Bauhinia purpurea saponin on Streptococcus mutans MTCC 890, Staphylococcus aureus and Lactobacillus acidophilus was 26.4 +/- 0.20/43.0 +/- 0.40 mug/ml, 29.0 +/- 0.30/39.6 +/- 0.12 mug/ml and 20.2 +/- 0.05/36.8 +/- 0.23 mug/ml, respectively. CONCLUSION: The strong antimicrobial activity of Madhuca longifolia and Bauhinia purpurea may be due to the presence of complex triterpenoid saponins, oleanane type triterpenoid glycosides or atypical pentacyclic triterpenoid saponin. Hence, these extracted saponins may be used in food and oral products to prevent and control oral diseases.
TI  - Antibacterial and phytochemical studies on Calotropis gigantia (L.) R. Br. latex  against selected cariogenic bacteria.
AB  - In vitro antibacterial potential of the chloroform, ethyl acetate, hexane, methanol and aqueous extracts of Calotropis gigantia (L.) R. Br. was evaluated by using five cariogenic bacteria, Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus mutans. Agar well diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were used for this purpose. The chloroform extracted fraction of latex showed inhibitory effect against S. mutans and L. acidophilus with MIC value of 0.032 and 0.52 mg/mL, respectively. Qualitative investigation on structure elucidation of bioactive compound using IR, NMR and GC-MS techniques revealed the presence of methyl nonanoate, a saturated fatty acid.
TI  - Prunus mume extract exhibits antimicrobial activity against pathogenic oral bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Prunus mume is a common fruit in Asia, which has been used in traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, we focused on the antimicrobial properties of Prunus mume extract against oral pathogens related to dental caries and periodontal diseases. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 15 oral pathogens including Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, S. mitis, S. sanguinis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, P. gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Candida species were included in the study. Initially, agar diffusion assay was performed to screen the antimicrobial activities of Prunus mume extract. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were then determined for sensitive species. Effect of Prunus mume extract on human oral keratinocytes (HOK) viability was also tested. RESULT: In the agar diffusion assay, drug suspension of 2 g/mL was able to inhibit all the bacterial species tested, but not the fungal species. MIC and MBC range of Prunus mume extract against the oral bacteria was 0.15625-0.0003 g/mL and P. gingivalis being the most susceptible species. Prune extract did not cause any detrimental effect on HOK. CONCLUSION: Prunus mume extract may be a potential candidate for developing an oral antimicrobial agent to control or prevent dental diseases associated with oral pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of aloe vera tooth gel and two popular commercial toothpastes: an in vitro study.
AB  - Aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis Miller) has been suggested for a wide variety of ailments but its use in dentistry is limited. This article reviews the uses of the plant and describes an in vitro investigation that compared the antimicrobial effectiveness of aloe vera tooth gel with two popular, commercially available dentifrices. The preliminary results showed that aloe vera tooth gel and the toothpastes were equally effective against Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Aloe vera tooth gel demonstrated enhanced antibacterial effect against S. mitis.
TI  - Oral bacterial adhesion forces to biomaterial surfaces constituting the bracket-adhesive-enamel junction in orthodontic treatment.
AB  - Bacterial adhesion to biomaterial surfaces constituting the bracket-adhesive-enamel junction represents a growing problem in orthodontics, because bacteria can adversely affect treatment by causing demineralization of the enamel surface around the brackets. It is important to know the forces with which bacteria adhere to the surfaces of these junction materials, as the strength of these forces will determine how easy it will be to remove the bacteria. We compared the adhesion forces of five initially colonizing and four cariogenic strains of bacteria to an orthodontic adhesive, stainless steel, and enamel, with and without a salivary conditioning film. Adhesion forces were determined using atomic force microscopy and a bacterial probe. In the absence of a salivary conditioning film, the strongest bacterial adhesion forces occurred to the adhesive surface (-2.9 to -6.9 nN), while adhesion forces to the enamel surfaces were lowest (-0.8 to -2.7 nN). In the presence of a salivary conditioning film, adhesion forces were reduced strongly, to less than 1 nN, and the differences between the various materials were reduced. Generally, however, initial colonizers of dental hard surfaces presented stronger adhesion forces to the different materials (-4.7 and -0.6 nN in the absence and presence of a salivary conditioning film, respectively) than cariogenic strains (-1.8 and -0.5 nN).
TI  - The impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and who ate a diet available in the Stone Age. METHODS: Ten subjects living in an environment replicating the Stone Age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. Bleeding on probing (BOP), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (PD) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. Microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization methods. RESULTS: No subject had periodontitis. Mean BOP decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (P <0.001). Mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (P <0.001). PD at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; P <0.001). At week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (P <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including Bacteroides ureolyticus, Eikenella corrodens, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Staphylococcus aureus (two strains), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosis, and Streptococcus mitis. Bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (P <0.001) for 20 species, including Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and Streptococcus spp. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., Stone Age) does not include refined sugars. Although plaque levels increased, BOP and PD decreased. Subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.
TI  - Distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in five different intra-oral habitats in young children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the colonization patterns and composition of the oral microbiota can lead to a better understanding of disease initiation. AIM: The aim of this study was to examine the distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in samples from five different oral habitats in young Greek children. DESIGN: Ninety-three children 3-12 years old (mean + SD 7.9 +/- 2.5) (60.2% male, 39.8% female) participated and split into three different age groups: primary (3-6 years), early mixed (6-9 years), and mixed dentition (9-12 years). Samples for bacterial enumeration were taken from saliva, supragingival and subgingival plaque, tongue dorsum, and soft tissues from each child, and were further analysed using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: Mean counts and proportions of all the test bacteria differed significantly among sample locations. Cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all healthy children. Mean proportions of Streptococcus mutans isolated from soft tissue and Streptococcus sanguinis from soft tissue, subgingival and saliva samples increased significantly with age, whereas the opposite was seen for Lactobacillus acidophilus. CONCLUSIONS: Cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all young children. Soft tissues, saliva, and tongue were more often colonized by cariogenic streptococcal species than teeth. These surfaces may serve as reservoirs for oral pathogens, requiring attention during preventive interventions.
TI  - Correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult Sudanese.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult Sudanese. Whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 Sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). Levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. There were significantly ( P< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus salivarius, and Leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( P< or =0.01) lower percentages with Treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. The detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for Selenomonas sputigena, S. anginosus, Streptococcus sanguis, and S. salivarius and significantly lower for Porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( P< or =0.01). Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( P< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. This study indicates that the levels of P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and S. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and subgingival plaque.
TI  - Salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in Sudanese adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult Sudanese subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. The periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. Whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method using whole genomic DNA probes. RESULTS: A high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or = 105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. Between 12% and 16% of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, C. rectus and E. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, respectively. There were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. Presence of > or = 105 L. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). There were significantly higher levels of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, C. rectus, P. micros, V. parvula, S. mutans, S. anginosus, A. israelii, C. sputigena, and C. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, E. corrodens, L. acidophilus, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. oralis, and S. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. CONCLUSIONS: : The findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. This is the first report that the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.
TI  - Bacterial and fungal microleakage of AH26 and AH Plus root canal sealers.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the penetration of Candida albicans alone and a combination of bacteria through root canals filled with gutta-percha and one or other root canal sealers, AH26 and AH Plus. METHODOLOGY: Eighty teeth were randomly divided into two groups of 40 teeth each and obturated with gutta-percha using either AH26 or AH Plus sealer. A further 10 teeth served as negative controls and 10 as positive controls. The external surface of each root, except the apical 2 mm, was covered with two layers of nail varnish. The teeth were inserted into Eppendorf plastic tubes and suspended in glass bottles containing sterile Schaedler broth. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Prevotella melaninogenica and Lactobacillus acidophilus were placed in the access cavities of 20 teeth filled with AH26 and 20 with AH Plus. Candida albicans was placed in the access cavities of the other teeth. The culture medium with microorganisms was changed every 7 days. Every 72 h bacterial or fungal growth in the broth was tested up to a period of 90 days. RESULTS: Leakage in the experimental teeth occurred between 14 and 87 days. Leakage was present in 47% of all samples. From the samples with AH26, 45% leaked bacteria and 60% leaked fungi; whilst from the samples with AH Plus, 50% leaked bacteria and 55% fungi. There was no statistically significant difference in penetration of bacteria and fungi between the sealers. CONCLUSION: In this in vitro study, gutta-percha and the sealers AH26 and AH Plus allowed leakage of bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of 10% carbamide peroxide bleaching agents.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of three commercial 10% carbamide peroxide bleaching agents (Nite White, Karisma, and Opalescence) on Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus was examined. Chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. Test materials and control solution were inserted in wells punched on the surface of disk sensitivity agars seeded with bacteria. After incubation of 24 to 48 h, zones of inhibition were measured. All three of the test materials displayed greater inhibition than the control. The pH of the solutions did not effect the bacterial inhibition.
TI  - Enumeration of subgingival species on primary isolation plates using colony lifts.
AB  - This study evaluated the feasibility of using a colony lift method and DNA probes to enumerate bacterial species cultured on primary isolation plates. Fourteen digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal DNA probes representing 12 subgingival species were validated by hybridization with colony lifts prepared from 249 reference strains of 51 species grown on Trypticase soy agar plates supplemented with 5% sheep blood. Colonies of reference strains were lifted onto Nytran filters from plates and treated to lyse cells, remove cellular proteins, denature and fix microbial DNA to the filters. Positive reactions were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. Cross-reactions were not observed for 13/14 probes, but 2 strains of Streptococcus mitis reacted with the probe to Streptococcus sanguis II. Subgingival plaque samples were taken by means of a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of teeth present in each of 26 subjects with differing periodontal disease states. Samples were dispersed, diluted, plated and incubated anaerobically for 7 d at 35 degrees C. Colonies were lifted as described above. Filters were cut into sections and hybridized with the 14 digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes. The probes were used to enumerate the test species and the total number of isolates was determined in 711 plaque samples. The colony lift method and DNA probes provided a sensitive, economical and quantitative method for enumerating cultivable microbial species in subgingival plaque samples. In addition, the amplification provided by growing the organisms on agar plates facilitated determination of numbers of organisms in small plaque samples, such as those from healthy sites.
TI  - Microbiologic characteristics of Lactobacillus products used for colonization of  the vagina.
AB  - Lactobacilli have long been considered to be the protective flora in the vagina.  Women with vaginal infections have used various non-prescription products in an attempt to restore their normal vaginal flora. Products that contain lactobacilli include dairy products (yogurt, acidophilus milk) and commercially available Lactobacillus powders and tablets. Recently, Lactobacillus species that produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) have been associated with normal vaginal flora. In this study, we compared 16 non-prescription products containing lactobacilli for H2O2 production, purity, and identifiable contaminants. All 16 products contained lactobacilli, of which ten (62%) produced H2O2. At least one contaminant was detected in 11 of 16 (69%) of the products: Enterococcus faecium (ten), Clostridium sporogenes (one), Streptococcus mitis (one), and Pseudomonas species (one). Although all of the products tested contained lactobacilli, only four of the products contained Lactobacillus acidophilus. Most of the lactobacilli-containing products currently available either do not contain the Lactobacillus species advertised and/or contain other bacteria of questionable benefit. We conclude that commercially available products may not be appropriate for recolonization of the vagina.
TI  - [Bacteriological investigation of the cariogenic effects of sugar alcohols and sucrose].
AB  - Considerable evidence indicates that the disaccharide, sucrose is probably the major dietary factor in dental caries formation and much subsequent research has gone into the search for another sweetener to replace sucrose. Currently, there is much interest in the development of new sweeteners and the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols. The present study aimed to examine the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols (xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol) and sucrose on growth pattern and acid production of S. mutans, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. faecalis, S. viridans, L. casei and L. acidophilus in vitro by using Photo Electrical Colorimeter and pH meter. In conclusion the results in this study showed that out of sugar alcohols, xylitol is the only compound which, depending on its concentration, significantly did not affect the growth and acid production of all tested micro organisms.
