TI  - Introducing GUt low-density array (GULDA): a validated approach for qPCR-based intestinal microbial community analysis.
AB  - Alterations in the human gut microbiota caused, for example, by diet, functional  foods, antibiotics, or occurring as a function of age are now known to be of relevance for host health. Therefore, there is a strong need for methods to detect such alterations in a rapid and comprehensive manner. In the present study, we developed and validated a high-throughput real-time quantitative PCR-based analysis platform, termed 'GUt Low-Density Array' (GULDA). The platform was designed for simultaneous analysis of the change in the abundance of 31 different microbial 16S rRNA gene targets in fecal samples obtained from individuals at various points in time. The target genes represent important phyla, genera, species, or other taxonomic groups within the five predominant bacterial phyla of the gut, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia and also Euryarchaeota. To demonstrate the applicability of GULDA, analysis of fecal samples obtained from six healthy infants at both 9 and 18 months of age was performed and showed a significant increase over time of the relative abundance of bacteria belonging to Clostridial cluster IV (Clostridia leptum group) and Bifidobacterium bifidum and concurrent decrease in the abundance of Clostridium butyricum and a tendency for decrease in Enterobacteriaceae over the 9-month period.
TI  - Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. in fecal samples from breast-fed and bottle-fed infants with and without iron supplement.
AB  - Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. isolated from the feces of 23  neonates during the first 3 months of life were identified. Of the 23 neonates, 10 were breast fed, 6 received an infant formula with iron supplement (5 mg/liter), and 7 received the formula without iron supplement (iron concentration, less than 0.5 mg/liter). The Bifidobacterium spp. most frequently isolated from the three groups of infants were B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, and B. bifidum. The bacteroides spp. most frequently isolated were B. fragilis and B. vulgatus. The most common Clostridium sp. in the three groups of infants was C. perfringens. The type of milk did not select for species of Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, or Clostridium, except for Clostridium butyricum, which was isolated significantly more often from bottle-fed infants with iron supplement than from the other groups, and Clostridium tertium, which was more often isolated from breast-fed infants. The species of the three anaerobic genera did not persist for a long period of time in the three groups of infants.
