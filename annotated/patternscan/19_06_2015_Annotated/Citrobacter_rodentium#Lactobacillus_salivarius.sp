TI  == effect of intestinal colonisation by two lactobacillus strains on the immune response of gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == the effect of intestinal colonisation on the immune system was investigated in germ-free mice monoassociated with lactobacillus strains isolated from calf faeces. single doses of lactobacillus acidophilus l36 or lactobacillus salivarius l38 were administered to germ-free mice by intragastric gavage. ten days later, the mice were euthanised. gene expression levels of interleukin 5 (il-5), il-6, il-10, il-12b, il-17a, gamma interferon (ifn-gamma), transforming growth factor beta 1 (tgf-beta1), and tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) were quantified  in segments of the small and large intestines by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. all the mice were colonised rapidly after lactobacillus administration with intestinal counts ranging from 6.53 to 8.26 log cfu/g. l. acidophilus l36 administration increased the expression of cytokines involved with the th2 (il-5, il-6 and tgf-beta1) and th17 (il-17a, tnf-alpha and  il-6) inflammatory response, whereas l. salivarius l38 appeared to stimulate a pattern of less diversified cytokines in the intestine. intragastric gavage of l. acidophilus l36 and l. salivarius l38 induced similar levels of colonisation in the digestive tracts of germ-free mice but stimulated different immune responses  in the intestinal mucosa. the different immunomodulation patterns might facilitate the potential use of these lactobacilli as probiotics to treat distinct pathological conditions, for example protection against citrobacter rodentium infection by stimulating il-17 production.
