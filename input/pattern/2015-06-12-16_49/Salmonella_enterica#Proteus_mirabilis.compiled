TI  - Two novel Salmonella genomic island 1 variants in Proteus mirabilis isolates from swine farms in China.
AB  - Four different Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1), including two novel variants,  were characterized in one Salmonella enterica serovar Rissen ST1917 isolate and three Proteus mirabilis isolates from swine farms in China. One novel variant was derived from SGI1-B with the backbone gene S021 disrupted by a 12.72-kb IS26-composite transposon containing the dfrA17-aadA5 cassettes and macrolide inactivation gene cluster mphA-mrx-mphR. Another one was an integron-free SGI1 and contained 183-bp truncated S025 next to IS6100 and S044.
TI  - Aerobic bacterial microbiota isolated from the cloaca of the European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis) in Poland.
AB  - We conducted a comparative analysis of the aerobic cloacal bacteria of European pond turtles (Emys orbicularis) living in their natural environment and juvenile turtles reared under controlled conditions in a breeding center. We included 130 turtles in the study. The aerobic bacteria isolated from the cloaca of the juvenile turtles were less diverse and more prevalent than the bacteria isolated from free-living adults. We isolated 17 bacterial species from juvenile captive turtles, among which the dominant species were Cellulomonas flavigena (77/96), Enterococcus faecalis (96/96), Escherichia coli (58/96), and Proteus mirabilis (41/96). From the adult, free-living turtles, we isolated 36 bacterial species, some of which are a potential threat to public health (e.g., Salmonella enterica serovars Newport, Daytona, and Braenderup; Listeria monocytogenes; Yersinia enterocolitica; Yersinia ruckeri; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Vibrio fluvialis; and Serratia marcescens), and pathogens that are etiologic agents of diseases of ectothermic animals (e.g., Aeromonas sobria, Aeromonas caviae, Hafnia alvei, Edwardsiella tarda, and Citrobacter braakii; the last two species were isolated from both groups of animals). The cloacal bacterial biota of the European pond turtle was characterized by numerous species of bacteria, and its composition varied with turtle age and environmental conditions. The small number of isolated bacteria that are potential human pathogens may indicate that the European pond turtle is of relatively minor importance as a threat to public health.
TI  - The master activator of IncA/C conjugative plasmids stimulates genomic islands and multidrug resistance dissemination.
AB  - Dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes occurs mostly by conjugation, which  mediates DNA transfer between cells in direct contact. Conjugative plasmids of the IncA/C incompatibility group have become a substantial threat due to their broad host-range, the extended spectrum of antimicrobial resistance they confer, their prevalence in enteric bacteria and their very efficient spread by conjugation. However, their biology remains largely unexplored. Using the IncA/C conjugative plasmid pVCR94DeltaX as a prototype, we have investigated the regulatory circuitry that governs IncA/C plasmids dissemination and found that the transcriptional activator complex AcaCD is essential for the expression of plasmid transfer genes. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with exonuclease digestion (ChIP-exo) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approaches, we have identified the sequences recognized by AcaCD and characterized the AcaCD regulon. Data mining using the DNA motif recognized by AcaCD revealed potential AcaCD-binding sites upstream of genes involved in the intracellular mobility functions (recombination directionality factor and mobilization genes) in two widespread classes of genomic islands (GIs) phylogenetically unrelated to IncA/C plasmids. The first class, SGI1, confers and propagates multidrug resistance in Salmonella enterica and Proteus mirabilis, whereas MGIVmi1 in Vibrio mimicus belongs to a previously uncharacterized class of GIs. We have demonstrated that through expression of AcaCD, IncA/C plasmids specifically trigger the excision and mobilization of the GIs at high frequencies. This study provides new evidence of the considerable impact of IncA/C plasmids on bacterial genome plasticity through their own mobility and the mobilization of genomic islands.
TI  - Detection of Salmonella spp. by a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method targeting bcfD gene.
AB  - In this study, we developed and validated a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for Salmonella detection targeting bcfD gene, a conserved fimbrial operon gene existing in Salmonella. The Salmonella LAMP assay we developed successfully amplified 44 Salmonella strains (14 standard strains and 30 clinical isolates), but none of 9 non-Salmonella standard strains (Proteus mirabilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexneri, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Campylobacter jejuni and Vibrio parahemolyticus). The detection limit was 5 CFU of Salmonella pure culture or 200 CFU of artificially spiked faeces per reaction system (equivalent to 5000 CFU g(-1) of faeces), and this method could directly detect Salmonella in chicken faeces free of pre-enrichment in a reaction time of 25 min. Our experiments show that the LAMP method we developed is a rapid, sensitive, specific and practical method for Salmonella detection. The Salmonella LAMP assay can potentially serve as new on-site diagnostics in the food and agricultural industries. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was established to detect Salmonella targeting bcfD gene, a conserved fimbrial operon gene. The detection limit was 5 CFU of Salmonella pure culture or 200 CFU of artificially spiked faeces per reaction system (equivalent to 5000 CFU g(-1) of faeces), and this method could directly detect Salmonella in chicken faeces free of pre-enrichment in a reaction time of 25 min. The Salmonella LAMP assay is a rapid, sensitive, specific and practical method for Salmonella detection and can potentially serve as new on-site diagnostics in the food and agricultural industries.
TI  - Structural and functional features of Crl proteins and identification of conserved surface residues required for interaction with the RpoS/sigmaS subunit of RNA polymerase.
AB  - In many gamma-proteobacteria, the RpoS/sigmaS sigma factor associates with the core RNAP (RNA polymerase) to modify global gene transcription in stationary phase and under stress conditions. The small regulatory protein Crl stimulates the association of sigmaS with the core RNAP in Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, through direct and specific interaction with sigmaS. The structural determinants of Crl involved in sigmaS binding are unknown. In the present paper we report the X-ray crystal structure of the Proteus mirabilis Crl protein (CrlPM) and a structural model for Salmonella Typhimurium Crl (CrlSTM). Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro assays, we demonstrated that CrlSTM and CrlPM are structurally similar and perform the same biological function. In the Crl structure, a cavity enclosed by flexible arms contains two patches of conserved and exposed residues required for sigmaS binding. Among these, charged residues that are likely to be involved in electrostatic interactions driving Crl-sigmaS complex formation were identified. CrlSTM and CrlPM interact with domain 2 of sigmaS with the same binding properties as with full-length sigmaS. These results suggest that Crl family members share a common mechanism of sigmaS binding in which the flexible arms of Crl might play a dynamic role.
TI  - Galleria mellonella native and analogue peptides Gm1 and DeltaGm1. II) anti-bacterial and anti-endotoxic effects.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are important components of the innate immune system of animals, plants, fungi and bacteria and are recently under discussion as promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics. We have investigated two cecropin-like synthetic peptides, Gm1, which corresponds to the natural overall uncharged Galleria mellonella native peptide and DeltaGm1, a modified overall positively charged Gm1 variant. We have analysed these peptides for their potential to inhibit the endotoxin-induced secretion of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) from human mononuclear cells. Furthermore, in a conventional microbiological assay, the ability of these peptides to inhibit the growth of the rough mutant bacteria Salmonella enterica Minnesota R60 and the polymyxin B-resistant Proteus mirabilis R45 was investigated and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed to characterize the morphology of the bacteria treated by the two peptides. We have also studied their cytotoxic properties in a haemolysis assay to clarify potential toxic effects. Our data revealed for both peptides minor anti-inflammatory (anti-endotoxin) activity, but demonstrated antimicrobial activity with differences depending on the endotoxin composition of the respective bacteria. In accordance with the antimicrobial assay, AFM data revealed a stronger morphology change of the R45 bacteria than for the R60. Furthermore, Gm1 had a stronger effect on the bacteria than DeltaGm1, leading to a different morphology regarding indentations and coalescing of bacterial structures. The findings verify the biophysical measurements with the peptides on model systems. Both peptides lack any haemolytic activity up to an amount of 100mug/ml, making them suitable as new anti-infective agents.
TI  - Structure of the RNA polymerase assembly factor Crl and identification of its interaction surface with sigma S.
AB  - Bacteria utilize multiple sigma factors that associate with core RNA polymerase (RNAP) to control transcription in response to changes in environmental conditions. In Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, Crl positively regulates the sigma(S) regulon by binding to sigma(S) to promote its association with core RNAP. We recently characterized the determinants in sigma(S) responsible for specific binding to Crl. However, little is known about the determinants in Crl required for this interaction. Here, we present the X-ray crystal structure of a Crl homolog from Proteus mirabilis in conjunction with in vivo and in vitro approaches that probe the Crl-sigma(S) interaction in E. coli. We show that the P. mirabilis, Vibrio harveyi, and E. coli Crl homologs function similarly in E. coli, indicating that Crl structure and function are likely conserved throughout gammaproteobacteria. We utilize phylogenetic conservation and bacterial two-hybrid analyses to predict residues in Crl important for the interaction with sigma(S). The results of p-benzoylphenylalanine (BPA)-mediated UV cross-linking studies further support the model in which an evolutionarily conserved central cleft is the surface on Crl that binds to sigma(S). Within this conserved binding surface, we identify a key residue in Crl that is critical for activation of Esigma(S)-dependent transcription in vivo and in vitro. Our study provides a physical basis for understanding the sigma(S)-Crl interaction.
TI  - Characterization of 17 chaperone-usher fimbriae encoded by Proteus mirabilis reveals strong conservation.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis is a Gram-negative enteric bacterium that causes complicated urinary tract infections, particularly in patients with indwelling catheters. Sequencing of clinical isolate P. mirabilis HI4320 revealed the presence of 17 predicted chaperone-usher fimbrial operons. We classified these fimbriae into three groups by their genetic relationship to other chaperone-usher fimbriae. Sixteen of these fimbriae are encoded by all seven currently sequenced P. mirabilis genomes. The predicted protein sequence of the major structural subunit for 14 of these fimbriae was highly conserved (>/= 95% identity), whereas three other structural subunits (Fim3A, UcaA and Fim6A) were variable. Further examination of 58 clinical isolates showed that 14 of the 17 predicted major structural subunit genes of the fimbriae were present in most strains (>85%). Transcription of the predicted major structural subunit genes for all 17 fimbriae was measured under different culture conditions designed to mimic conditions in the urinary tract. The majority of the fimbrial genes were induced during stationary phase, static culture or colony growth when compared to exponential-phase aerated culture. Major structural subunit proteins for six of these fimbriae were detected using MS of proteins sheared from the surface of broth-cultured P. mirabilis, demonstrating that this organism may produce multiple fimbriae within a single culture. The high degree of conservation of P. mirabilis fimbriae stands in contrast to uropathogenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, which exhibit greater variability in their fimbrial repertoires. These findings suggest there may be evolutionary pressure for P. mirabilis to maintain a large fimbrial arsenal.
TI  - Mycosynthesis and characterization of silver nanoparticles and their activity against some human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to biosynthesis silver nanoparticles from the fungus Nigrospora sphaerica isolated from soil samples and to examine their activity against five human pathogenic strains of bacteria viz. Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Staphylococcus aureus using disc diffusion method. The synergistic effect of silver nanoparticles in combination with commonly used antibiotic Gentamycin against the selected bacteria was also examined. The synthesized silver nanoparticles from free-cell filtrate were characterized by using UV-Vis spectrophotometer analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). UV-Vis spectrophotometer analysis showed a peak at 420 nm indicating the synthesis of silver nanoparticles, FTIR analysis verified the detection of protein capping of silver nanoparticles while SEM micrographs revealed that the silver nanoparticles are dispersed and aggregated and mostly having spherical shape within the size range between 20 and 70 nm. The synthesized silver nanoparticles exhibited a varied growth inhibition activity (15-26 mm diam inhibition zones) against the tested pathogenic bacteria. A remarkable increase of bacterial growth inhibition (26-34 mm diam) was detected when a combination of silver nanoparticles and Gentamycin was used. A significant increase in fold area of antibacterial activity was observed when AgNPs in combination with Gentamycin was applied. The synthesized silver nanoparticles produced by the fungus N. sphaerica is a promising to be used as safe drug in medical therapy due to their broad spectrum against pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Identification of three novel avian beta-defensins from goose and their significance in the pathogenesis of Salmonella.
AB  - Here, we report the characterization of three avian beta-defensins (AvBDs) from the goose, named anser_AvBD1, AvBD3, and AvBD6, respectively. All of anser_AvBDs exhibited broad antibacterial activity. In addition, the antibacterial activity of all of the AvBDs against Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis decreased significantly in the presence of 100mM NaCl (P<0.01). None of the AvBDs showed hemolytic activity. In order to assess the significance of these anser_AvBDs in the infection of Salmonella enteritidis, mRNA expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and anser_AvBDs in tissues of both control and infected geese was evaluated. We observed a significant up-regulation of TLR4, anser_AvBD1, 3, and 6 in some immune tissues evaluated, in response to S. enteritidis infection. These data demonstrated that TLR4 may serve a possible role in eliciting host immune responses to pathogens, and beta-defensins may play a pivotal role in the host defense mechanisms of the goose.
TI  - Effects of subtherapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials on gene acquisition events in Yersinia, Proteus, Shigella, and Salmonella recipient organisms in isolated ligated intestinal loops of swine.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess antimicrobial resistance and transfer of virulence genes facilitated by subtherapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials in swine intestines. ANIMALS: 20 anesthetized pigs experimentally inoculated with donor and recipient bacteria. PROCEDURES: 4 recipient pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella flexneri, or Proteus mirabilis) were incubated with donor bacteria in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of 1 of 16 antimicrobials in isolated ligated intestinal loops in swine. Donor Escherichia coli contained transferrable antimicrobial resistance or virulence genes. After coincubations, intestinal contents were removed and assessed for pathogens that acquired new antimicrobial resistance or virulence genes following exposure to the subtherapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials. RESULTS: 3 antimicrobials (apramycin, lincomycin, and neomycin) enhanced transfer of an antimicrobial resistance plasmid from commensal E coli organisms to Yersinia and Proteus organisms, whereas 7 antimicrobials (florfenicol, hygromycin, penicillin G, roxarsone, sulfamethazine, tetracycline, and tylosin) exacerbated transfer of an integron (Salmonella genomic island 1) from Salmonella organisms to Yersinia organisms. Sulfamethazine induced the transfer of Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 from pathogenic to nonpathogenic Salmonella organisms. Six antimicrobials (bacitracin, carbadox, erythromycin, sulfathiazole, tiamulin, and virginiamycin) did not mediate any transfer events. Sulfamethazine was the only antimicrobial implicated in 2 types of transfer events. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: 10 of 16 antimicrobials at subinhibitory or subtherapeutic concentrations augmented specific antimicrobial resistance or transfer of virulence genes into pathogenic bacteria in isolated intestinal loops in swine. Use of subtherapeutic antimicrobials in animal feed may be associated with unwanted collateral effects.
TI  - Emergence of Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1) among Proteus mirabilis clinical  isolates in Dijon, France.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1) is often encountered in antibiotic-resistant Salmonella enterica and exceptionally in Proteus mirabilis. We investigated the prevalence of SGI1-producing clinical isolates of P. mirabilis in our hospital (Dijon, France). METHODS: A total of 57 strains of P. mirabilis resistant to amoxicillin and/or gentamicin and/or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole isolated from August 2011 to February 2012 as well as 9 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing P. mirabilis from our collection were tested for the presence of SGI1 by PCR. The complete SGI1 structure from positive isolates [backbone and multidrug resistance (MDR) region] was sequenced. RESULTS: SGI1 was detected in 7 isolates; 5 out of the 57 isolates collected during the study period (9%) and 2 out of the 9 ESBL-producing strains of our collection. The structures of the seven SGI1s were distinct. Three different backbones were identified: one identical to the SGI1 backbone from the epidemic Salmonella Typhimurium DT104, one with variations already described in SGI1-K from Salmonella Kentucky (deletion and insertion of IS1359 in the region spanning from S005 to S009) and one with a variation never detected before (deletion from S005 to S009). Six different MDR regions were identified: four simple variants containing resistance genes already described and two variants harbouring a very complex structure including regions derived from several transposons and IS26 elements with aphA1a never reported to date in SGI1. CONCLUSIONS: SGI1 variants are widely distributed among P. mirabilis clinical strains and might spread to other commensal Enterobacteriaceae. This would become a serious public health problem.
TI  - FlgM proteins from different bacteria exhibit different structural characteristics.
AB  - Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are a unique class of proteins that do not require a stable structure for function. The importance of IDPs in many biological processes has been established but there remain unanswered questions about their evolution and conservation of their disordered state within a protein family. Our group has been studying the structural similarities among orthologous FlgM proteins, a model class of IDPs. We have previously shown that the FlgM protein from the thermophile Aquifex aeolicus has more structure at A. aeolicus' physiological temperature (85 degrees C) than is observed for the Salmonella typhimurium FlgM, suggesting that the disordered nature of FlgM varies among organisms and is not universally conserved. In this work, we extend these studies to the FlgM proteins from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Bacillus subtilis. We demonstrate that the B. subtilis, E. coli, and S. typhimurium FlgMs exist in a premolten globule-like conformation, though the B. subtilis FlgM is in a more compacted conformation than the other two. The P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis FlgM proteins exist in a currently unknown conformation that is not either coil-like or premolten globule-like. The P. aeruginosa FlgM appears to contain more weak intramolecular contacts given its more compacted state than the P. mirabilis FlgM. These results provide experimental evidence that members of the same protein family can exhibit different degrees of disorder, though understanding how different disordered states evolve in the same protein family will require more study.
TI  - Characterization of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in enterobacteriaceae clinical strains and characterization of the plasmids implicated in their diffusion.
AB  - A total of 788 clinical Enterobacteriaceae were collected to describe the aminoglycoside-modifying genes (AME genes) and to characterize the plasmids that carry these genes. Among the 788 strains collected, 330 (41.8%) were aminoglycoside-resistant: 264 Escherichia coli (80%), 33 Proteus mirabilis (10%), 10 Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), six K. oxytoca (1.8%), five Enterobacter cloacae (1.5%), three Morganella morganii (0.9%), three Providencia stuartii (0.9%), two Salmonella enterica (0.6%), and one each Citrobacter freundii, C. koseri, Proteus vulgaris, and Shigella sonnei. The most affected aminoglycoside was streptomycin (92.7%), followed by kanamycin (26.3%), gentamicin (18%), tobramycin (16.9%), netilmicin (3.6%), and amikacin (1.5%). The AME genes found were aph(3'')-Ib (65.4%), ant(3'')-Ia (37.5%), aph(3')-Ia (13.9%), aac(3)-IIa (12.4%), aac(6')-Ib (4.2%), ant(2'')-Ia (3.6%), and aph(3')-IIa (1.2%). Thirty-four percent of the strains showed more than one enzyme. The most frequent association was ant(3'')-Ia plus aph(3'')-Ib (35 strains). From 66 selected AME genes, 24 were plasmid located: 12 aac(3)-IIa, six aph(3')-Ia, three ant(3'')-Ia, two ant(2'')-Ia, and one aac(6')-Ib. These genes were located in plasmids belonging to incompatibility groups F, FIA, FIB, or HI2. In conclusion, the AME genes involved in aminoglycoside-clinical resistance were aac(3)-IIa, aac(6')-Ib, and ant(2'')-Ia, genes that confer resistance to tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin.
TI  - 1-alkyl-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridinium bromides: inhibitory effect on virulence factors of Candida albicans and on the growth of bacterial pathogens.
AB  - A homologous series of 1-alkyl-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridinium bromides, termed compounds 1-11, was synthesized and studied for antibacterial and antifungal activity. Of these, compound 8, containing a ten-carbon alkyl chain, showed maximum inhibition against all the tested bacterial strains. The highest antibacterial activity using a disc diffusion method was recorded against Mycobacterium smegmatis [zone of inhibition (ZOI): 45.75+/-0.25 mm], followed by Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Vibrio cholerae, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhi. In addition to antibacterial activity, compounds 3-11 displayed good inhibitory action against the human opportunistic yeast pathogens Cryptococcus neoformans and various Candida spp. The maximum ZOI was observed against Cryptococcus neoformans (51.5+/-0.5 mm) using compound 8, with ZOIs of 23.5+/-0.5, 32.0+/-0.0, 27.75+/-0.25 and 41.5+/-0.5 mm against Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis and Candida krusei, respectively. Furthermore, compound 8 caused inhibition of the candidal yeast-hyphae transition at a concentration of 0.29 microM and also inhibited the secretion of extracellular hydrolytic enzyme such as secreted aspartyl proteinase at subinhibitory concentrations. Compound 8 showed very little haemolytic activity at a concentration of 0.58 microM (1.315+/-0.75 %), with its highest haemolytic activity (47.806+/-2.32 %) observed at a concentration of 2.9 microM.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  - The aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. The tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. In the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. Due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the pH values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. The inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. Phosphates obviously made the development of most Gram-positive bacteria impossible. Especially Micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. On the other hand, Gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. The exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. It should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates HEXA68 and HEXA70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. By comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on pH values.
TI  - Development of an improved selective and differential medium for isolation of Salmonella spp.
AB  - We describe an improved selective, differential, and cost-effective medium, XA medium, which contains d-arabinose, to facilitate the selective isolation of Salmonella spp. The sensitivity and the specificity of XA medium were compared to those of xylose lysine desoxycholate agar (XLD) using stock cultures and naturally contaminated food samples. XA medium and XLD were evaluated with a total of 82 Salmonella and 69 non-Salmonella stock cultures. Of 82 strains of Salmonella spp. tested, 76 produced a characteristic black colony on XA medium and XLD. The remaining 6 strains belonged to Salmonella enterica serovars Berta (n = 1), Paratyphi A (n = 1), Gallinarum (n = 2), and Pullorum (n = 2). The sensitivities of XA medium and XLD were identical (92.7%). Citrobacter freundii (n = 21) and Proteus mirabilis (n = 21) stock cultures produced black colonies on XLD, whereas only 4 strains of P. mirabilis appeared as black colonies on XA medium. In the second phase of the study, a total of 180 food samples were cultured onto XA medium and XLD after selective enrichment. The sensitivities of XA medium and XLD were equal (100%), and a total of 6 Salmonella strains were isolated from the 180 food samples. The specificity of XA medium (92.0%) was superior to that of XLD (73.0%), with a total of 14 and 47 false-positive results found on XA medium and XLD, respectively. On the basis of its good specificity, XA medium is useful for the isolation of Salmonella spp. from food samples.
TI  - Early strains of multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Kentucky sequence type 198 from Southeast Asia harbor Salmonella genomic island 1-J variants with a novel insertion sequence.
AB  - Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1) is a 43-kb integrative mobilizable element that harbors a great diversity of multidrug resistance gene clusters described in numerous Salmonella enterica serovars and also in Proteus mirabilis. The majority of SGI1 variants contain an In104-derivative complex class 1 integron inserted between resolvase gene res and open reading frame (ORF) S044 in SGI1. Recently, the international spread of ciprofloxacin-resistant S. enterica serovar Kentucky sequence type 198 (ST198) containing SGI1-K variants has been reported. A retrospective study was undertaken to characterize ST198 S. Kentucky strains isolated before the spread of the epidemic ST198-SGI1-K population in Africa and the Middle East. Here, we characterized 12 ST198 S. Kentucky strains isolated between 1969 and 1999, mainly from humans returning from Southeast Asia (n = 10 strains) or Israel (n = 1 strain) or from meat in Egypt (n = 1 strain). All these ST198 S. Kentucky strains did not belong to the XbaI pulsotype X1 associated with the African epidemic clone but to pulsotype X2. SGI1-J subgroup variants containing different complex integrons with a partial transposition module and inserted within ORF S023 of SGI1 were detected in six strains. The SGI1-J4 variant containing a partially deleted class 1 integron and thus showing a narrow resistance phenotype to sulfonamides was identified in two epidemiologically unrelated strains from Indonesia. The four remaining strains harbored a novel SGI1-J variant, named SGI1-J6, which contained aadA2, floR2, tetR(G)-tetA(G), and sul1 resistance genes within its complex integron. Moreover, in all these S. Kentucky isolates, a novel insertion sequence related to the IS630 family and named ISSen5 was found inserted upstream of the SGI1 complex integron in ORF S023. Thus, two subpopulations of S. Kentucky ST198 independently and exclusively acquired the SGI1 during the 1980s and 1990s. Unlike the ST198-X1 African epidemic subpopulation, the ST198-X2 subpopulation mainly from Asia harbors variants of the SGI1-J subgroup that are encountered mainly in the Far East, as previously described for S. enterica serovars Emek and Virchow.
TI  - Radial and spiral stream formation in Proteus mirabilis colonies.
AB  - The enteric bacterium Proteus mirabilis, which is a pathogen that forms biofilms  in vivo, can swarm over hard surfaces and form a variety of spatial patterns in colonies. Colony formation involves two distinct cell types: swarmer cells that dominate near the surface and the leading edge, and swimmer cells that prefer a less viscous medium, but the mechanisms underlying pattern formation are not understood. New experimental investigations reported here show that swimmer cells in the center of the colony stream inward toward the inoculation site and in the process form many complex patterns, including radial and spiral streams, in addition to previously-reported concentric rings. These new observations suggest that swimmers are motile and that indirect interactions between them are essential in the pattern formation. To explain these observations we develop a hybrid model comprising cell-based and continuum components that incorporates a chemotactic response of swimmers to a chemical they produce. The model predicts that formation of radial streams can be explained as the modulation of the local attractant concentration by the cells, and that the chirality of the spiral streams results from a swimming bias of the cells near the surface of the substrate. The spatial patterns generated from the model are in qualitative agreement with the experimental observations.
TI  - Lactobacillus fermentum isolated from human colonic mucosal biopsy inhibits the growth and adhesion of enteric and foodborne pathogens.
AB  - A number of Lactobacillus species are used as probiotic strains in order to benefit health. We have isolated L. fermentum from human colonic mucosal biopsy samples that possess antimicrobial activities against entroinvasive and foodborne pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella paratyphi A, Shigella sonnei, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio sp. In addition to lactic acid, L. fermentum secretes antimicrobial proteinacious compound(s) that was found to be active even at neutral pH (pH 7.0). The compound was sensitive to heat treatment and trypsin digestion. Lactobacillus fermentum inhibited the adhesion of enteropathogens to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. Isolated cell surface associated proteins (SAPs) from L. fermentum were sufficient for the adhesion exclusions of enteropathogenic E. coli. Our results indicate that L. fermentum produces antimicrobial compounds and SAPs to inhibit the growth and adhesion of enteropathogens, respectively.
TI  - Nasal immunization with attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium expressing an MrpA-TetC fusion protein significantly reduces Proteus mirabilis colonization in the mouse urinary tract.
AB  - The development of effective strategies to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) has become an important goal in public health. Proteus mirabilis is commonly associated with complicated UTIs and expresses several virulence factors, including mannose-resistant Proteus-like (MR/P) fimbriae. Here, a fusion protein formed from MrpA, the structural protein of MR/P fimbriae, and TetC, a non-toxic but highly immunogenic fragment of tetanus toxin, to be delivered by an attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium mutant in vivo was constructed. The ability of this strain to induce an immune response and to protect mice against a urinary tract challenge with P. mirabilis was investigated. The protein was successfully expressed in S. Typhimurium. After two immunization doses, intra-nasally vaccinated mice showed a significant increase in specific serum IgG against MrpA and against Salmonella lipopolysaccharide, as well as a significant decrease in kidney and bladder colonization by P. mirabilis after challenge. However, no significant correlation was observed between antibody response and kidney or bladder colonization. MrpA fused to TetC and expressed in S. Typhimurium effectively protected mice against an experimental P. mirabilis UTI.
TI  - The Salmonella genomic island 1 is specifically mobilized in trans by the IncA/C  multidrug resistance plasmid family.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1) is a Salmonella enterica-derived integrative mobilizable element (IME) containing various complex multiple resistance integrons identified in several S. enterica serovars and in Proteus mirabilis. Previous studies have shown that SGI1 transfers horizontally by in trans mobilization in the presence of the IncA/C conjugative helper plasmid pR55. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report the ability of different prevalent multidrug resistance (MDR) plasmids including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) gene-carrying plasmids to mobilize the multidrug resistance genomic island SGI1. Through conjugation experiments, none of the 24 conjugative plasmids tested of the IncFI, FII, HI2, I1, L/M, N, P incompatibility groups were able to mobilize SGI1 at a detectable level (transfer frequency <10(-9)). In our collection, ESBL gene-carrying plasmids were mainly from the IncHI2 and I1 groups and thus were unable to mobilize SGI1. However, the horizontal transfer of SGI1 was shown to be specifically mediated by conjugative helper plasmids of the broad-host-range IncA/C incompatibility group. Several conjugative IncA/C MDR plasmids as well as the sequenced IncA/C reference plasmid pRA1 of 143,963 bp were shown to mobilize in trans SGI1 from a S. enterica donor to the Escherichia coli recipient strain. Depending on the IncA/C plasmid used, the conjugative transfer of SGI1 occurred at frequencies ranging from 10(-3) to 10(-6) transconjugants per donor. Of particular concern, some large IncA/C MDR plasmids carrying the extended-spectrum cephalosporinase bla(CMY-2) gene were shown to mobilize in trans SGI1. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The ability of the IncA/C MDR plasmid family to mobilize SGI1 could contribute to its spread by horizontal transfer among enteric pathogens. Moreover, the increasing prevalence of IncA/C plasmids in MDR S. enterica isolates worldwide has potential implications for the epidemic success of the antibiotic resistance genomic island SGI1 and its close derivatives.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of highly functionalised novel beta-lactam grafted spiropyrrolidines and pyrrolizidines.
AB  - A facile and one-pot synthesis of a series of novel spiropyrrolidines/pyrrolizidines with beta-lactam substituent has been accomplished through 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of alkenyl esters derived from beta-lactam aldehyde as dipolarophile with the dipole azomethine ylide derived from 1,2- and 1,3-diketones and secondary amino acids. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for antimicrobial activities and found to exhibit relatively good antibacterial activity at lower concentration against four human bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Salmonella genomic islands and antibiotic resistance in Salmonella enterica.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance in several Salmonella enterica serovars that cause gastrointestinal disease in humans is due to a set of related genomic islands carrying a class 1 integron, which carries the resistance genes. Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1), the first island of this type, was found in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 isolates, which are resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, florfenicol, streptomycin, spectinomycin, sulfonamides and tetracycline. Several Salmonella serovars and Proteus mirablis have since been shown to harbor SGI1 or related islands carrying various sets of resistance genes and some distinct groups have emerged. SGI1 is an integrative mobilizable element and can be transferred experimentally into Escherichia coli. However, within serovars, isolates recovered from different parts of the world appear to be clonal, indicating that SGI1 movement may be rare. Potential reservoirs in food-producing animals or in ornamental fish have been identified for some serovars.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of the essential oils of commonly consumed medicinal herbs  using an in vitro model.
AB  - The chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from 10 commonly consumed herbs: Citrus aurantium, C. limon, Lavandula angustifolia, Matricaria chamomilla, Mentha piperita, M. spicata, Ocimum basilicum, Origanum vulgare, Thymus vulgaris and Salvia officinalis have been determined. The antibacterial activity of these oils and their main components; i.e. camphor, carvacrol, 1,8-cineole, linalool, linalyl acetate, limonene, menthol, a-pinene, b-pinene, and thymol were assayed against the human pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Micrococcus flavus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, S. epidermidis, S. typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus. The highest and broadest activity was shown by O. vulgare oil. Carvacrol had the highest antibacterial activity among the tested components.
TI  - Seasonal variation, chemical composition, and analgesic and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from leaves of Tetradenia riparia (Hochst.) Codd in southern Brazil.
AB  - The seasonal variation of the chemical composition of the essential oil from fresh leaves of Tetradenia riparia (Hochst.) Codd grown in southern Brazil was analyzed by GC-MS, and the analgesic and antimicrobial activities of this oil were assayed. The yield of essential oil ranged from 0.17% to 0.26%, with the maximum amount in winter and the minimum in spring. The results obtained from principal components analysis (PCA) revealed the existence of high chemical variability in the different seasons. The samples were clearly discriminated into three groups: winter, autumn, and spring-summer. Samples collected during winter contained the highest percentages of calyculone (24.70%), abietadiene (13.54%), and viridiflorol (4.20%). In autumn, the major constituents were ledol (8.74%) and cis-muurolol-5-en-4-alpha-ol (13.78%). Samples collected in spring-summer contained the highest percentages of fenchone (12.67%), 14-hydroxy-9-epi-caryophyllene (24.36%), and alpha-cadinol (8.33%). Oxygenated sesquiterpenes were predominant in all the samples analyzed. The observed chemovariation might be environmentally determined by a seasonal influence. The essential oil, when given orally at a dose of 200 mg/kg, exhibited good analgesic activity on acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, inhibiting the constrictions by 38.94% to 46.13%, and this effect was not affected by seasonal variation. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil against the bacterial strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, and Enterobacter cloacae, and the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans was assessed by the disc diffusion method and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration. The results obtained, followed by measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), indicated that S. aureus, B. subtilis, and Candida albicans were the most sensitive microorganisms, showing largest inhibition, and the lowest MIC values varied from 15.6 to 31.2 microg/mL, 7.8 to 15.6 microg/mL, and 31.2 to 62.5 microg/mL, respectively.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of extracts from plants of central Argentina--isolation of an active principle from Achyrocline satureioides.
AB  - The great increase in bacterial infections is fueling interest in the search for  antibacterial products of plant origin. Extracts obtained from 51 native and naturalized plants from central Argentina were therefore evaluated for their IN VITRO inhibitory activity on pathogenic bacteria with the aim of selecting the most active ones as new sources of effective antibiotics. The susceptibility of reference and clinical strains of Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, and Staphylococcus aureus was determined. Extracts from Achyrocline satureioides, Flourensia oolepis, Lepechinia floribunda, and Lithrea molleoides were the most potent, with MIC and MBC values ranging from 0.006 to 2 and 0.012 to 10 mg/mL, respectively, on both gram-positive and negative bacteria. The antibacterial activity-guided isolation of A. satureioides ethanol extract showed 23-methyl-6-O-desmethylauricepyrone (1) to be the most active compound. This compound showed inhibitory effects against gram-positive bacteria with MIC and MBC values of 0.002 and 0.008 mg/mL, respectively, while on gram-negative strains, the MIC and MBC were 0.062-0.250 and 0.062-0.500 mg/mL, respectively. The strong antibacterial activity shown by the four plant extracts or the compound isolated from A. satureioides suggests that they could become part of the arsenal of antibacterial drugs currently used.
TI  - Chromosomally encoded blaCMY-2 located on a novel SXT/R391-related integrating conjugative element in a Proteus mirabilis clinical isolate.
AB  - Integrating conjugative elements (ICEs) are mobile genetic elements that can transfer from the chromosome of a host to the chromosome of a new host through the process of excision, conjugation, and integration. Although SXT/R391-related ICEs, originally demonstrated in Vibrio cholerae O139 isolates, have become prevalent among V. cholerae isolates in Asia, the prevalence of the ICEs among gram-negative bacteria other than Vibrio spp. remains unknown. In addition, SXT/R391-related ICEs carrying genes conferring resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins have never been described. Here we carried out a genetic analysis of a cefoxitin-resistant Proteus mirabilis clinical isolate, TUM4660, which revealed the presence of a novel SXT/R391-related ICE, ICEPmiJpn1. ICEPmiJpn1 had a core genetic structure showing high similarity to that of R391 and carried xis and int genes completely identical to those of R391, while an IS10-mediated composite transposon carrying bla(CMY-2) was integrated into the ICE. A nucleotide sequence identical to the 3' part of ISEcp1 was located upstream of the bla(CMY-2) gene, and other genes observed around bla(CMY-2) in earlier studies were also present. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequences of hot spot 2 and hot spot 4 in ICEPmiJpn1 showed high similarity to that of hot spot 2 in SXT(MO10) and with a part of the nucleotide sequence found in P. mirabilis ATCC 29906, respectively. ICEPmiJpn1 was successfully transferred to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Citrobacter koseri in conjugation experiments. These observations suggest that ICEs may contribute to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes among clinically relevant Enterobacteriaceae, which warrants careful observation of the prevalence of ICEs, including SXT/R391-related ICEs.
TI  - Transfer of a phage T4 gene into Enterobacteriaceae, determined at the single-cell level.
AB  - The transfer range of phage genes was investigated at the single-cell level by using an in situ DNA amplification technique. After absorption of phages, a phage T4 gene was maintained in the genomes of non-plaque-forming bacteria at frequencies of 10(-2) gene copies per cell. The gene transfer decreased the mutation frequencies in nonhost recipients.
TI  - Discovery of novel 2',3',4'-trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone derivatives as anti-gram-positive antibacterial agents.
AB  - A number of 2',3',4'-trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone derivatives were synthesized and examined for growth inhibition of several kinds of bacteria. 2',3',4'-Trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone itself exhibited no antibacterial activity, but some of its derivatives showed various antibacterial activities depending on functional groups introduced on the 2-phenyl ring. Eighteen out of 24 compounds synthesized in this study appeared to possess antibacterial activities against at least two Gram-positive strains of Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, 2-(biphenyl-4-yl)-2',3',4'-trihydroxyacetophenone being the most active with LC(50) of 5.8 muM and 5.6 muM respectively. However, none of the synthesized compounds exhibited inhibitory effects on Gram-negative strains, such as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica, suggesting that anti-Gram-positive specificity of the antibacterial compounds.
TI  - Synthesis of some novel imidazole-based dicationic carbazolophanes as potential antibacterials.
AB  - Synthesis of fluorescent imidazole-based dicationic carbazolophanes incorporating various spacer units is described. Interestingly, the cyclophanes 2a and 5a incorporating a pyridine moiety exhibited superior antibacterial activity against most of the pathogenic bacteria in the tested concentrations as compared to the other cyclophanes as well as the test control, benzalkonium chloride (BAC), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) and tetracycline.
TI  - Secondary chromosomal attachment site and tandem integration of the mobilizable Salmonella genomic island 1.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Salmonella genomic island 1 is an integrative mobilizable element (IME) originally identified in epidemic multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) DT104. SGI1 contains a complex integron, which confers various multidrug resistance phenotypes due to its genetic plasticity. Previous studies have shown that SGI1 integrates site-specifically into the S. enterica, Escherichia coli, or Proteus mirabilis chromosome at the 3' end of thdF gene (attB site). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report the transfer of SGI1 to a Delta thdF mutant of S. Typhimurium LT2. In the absence of thdF, the frequency of transconjugant formation was reduced by around thirty times of magnitude. Through DNA sequencing SGI1 was shown to integrate specifically into a secondary attachment site (2(nd)attB), which is located in the intergenic region between the chromosomal sodB and purR genes. At this 2(nd)attB site, we found that a significant fraction of SGI1 transconjugants (43% of wild type and 100% of Delta thdF mutant) contained tandem SGI1 arrays. Moreover, in wild type S. Typhimurium LT2 transconjugants, SGI1 integrated into both attachment sites, i.e., thdF and sodB-purR. The formation of SGI1 tandem arrays occurred in both specific attB sites. There was heterogeneity in the size of the SGI1 tandem arrays detected in single transconjugant colonies. Some arrays consisted as far as six SGI1s arranged in tandem. These tandem arrays were shown to persist during serial passages with or without antibiotic selection pressure. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The ability of integration into two distinct chromosomal sites and tandem array formation of SGI1 could contribute to its spread and persistence. The existence of a secondary attachment site in the Salmonella chromosome has potential implications for the mobility of SGI1, which may integrate in other attachment sites of other bacterial pathogens that do not possess the 1(st) or 2(nd) specific SGI1 attB sites of Salmonella.
TI  - Isolation and purification of enterocin E-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain NRRL B-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, or Enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to Campylobacter jejuni. The isolate produced a 5,362-Da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. enterica serovar Gallinarum, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other Campylobacter species isolates. The enterocin, E-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. The proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin E-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. Specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase K, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. The enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees C and was stable at pH values between 5.0 and 8.7. However, activity was lost below pH 3.0 and above pH 9.5. Administration of enterocin E-760-treated feed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of C. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) CFU. Enterocin E-760 also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired Campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
TI  - Characterization of Antarctic psychrotrophic bacteria with antibacterial activities against terrestrial microorganisms.
AB  - Five-hundreds and eighty bacterial strains, isolated from various Antarctic marine sources and locations, were screened for antimicrobial activity against terrestrial microorganisms. Twenty-two Antarctic isolates (3.8%), mainly retrieved from the water column at Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea), expressed antagonistic activity against one to three indicator organisms. Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis resulted as the more susceptible, followed by Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis. None of the isolates inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica and the eukaryotic fungus Candida albicans. Active Antarctic isolates, identified by 16S rDNA sequencing and phenotypically characterized by classical methods, were phylogenetically affiliated to the Actinobacteria (16 strains) and the gamma-Proteobacteria (6 strains). Inhibition patterns, as well as phenotypic characteristics, highly vary for different isolates, even though they were affiliated to the same genus or closely related to the identical microorganism retrieved from the database, suggesting that these features were more likely strain-rather than species-specific.Results obtained from the present study confirm previous observations and highlight the potentiality of Antarctic marine bacteria as novel source of antibacterial substances.
TI  - Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1), variant SGI1-I, and new variant SGI1-O in proteus mirabilis clinical and food isolates from China.
AB  - Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1) and variants (SGI1-I and the new variant SGI1-O) were mapped in five strains of Proteus mirabilis isolated from humans and food in China. Sequencing showed that SGI1 and variants were integrated at the 3' end of the chromosomal thdF gene as previously described for Salmonella strains.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Quercus ilex bark's extracts.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of different extracts of Quercus ilex bark (Fagaceae)  was studied in vitro against seven reference strains of bacteria by using a disc-diffusion method and agar-dilution method. The ethyl acetate extract (QE), n-butanol extract (QB) and final aqueous layer (QA) were effective against all bacterial strains tested at MICs ranging from 128 to 512 microg/ml. The n-hexane extract (QH) and dichloromethane extract (QD) showed no activity.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of Emblica officinalis and Coriandrum sativum against Gram negative urinary pathogens.
AB  - Present investigation is focused on antibacterial potential of aqueous infusions  and aqueous decoctions of Emblica officinalis (amla) and Coriandrum sativum (coriander) against 345 bacterial isolates belonging to 6 different genera of Gram negative bacterial population isolated from urine specimens by employing well diffusion technique. Aqueous infusion and decoction of Emblica officinalis exhibited potent antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (270), Klebsiella pneumoniae (51), K. ozaenae (3), Proteus mirabilis (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10), Salmonella typhi (1), S. paratyphi A (2), S. paratyphi B (1) and Serratia marcescens (2) but did not show any antibacterial activity against Gram negative urinary pathogens.
TI  - Proteus mirabilis clinical isolate harbouring a new variant of Salmonella genomic island 1 containing the multiple antibiotic resistance region.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A clinical isolate of Proteus mirabilis strain 18306, which displayed the multidrug resistance phenotype of Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1), was examined for the presence of this island including its multiple antibiotic resistance genomic region. METHODS: P. mirabilis 18306 was isolated in March 2006 from a patient in Palestine with diabetic foot infection. Antibiotic susceptibility tests and various molecular techniques, including PCR, cloning and DNA sequencing were used for detection and characterization of SGI1 in P. mirabilis 18306. RESULTS: P. mirabilis 18306 showed the typical multidrug resistance phenotype of SGI1 as it was resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulphonamides and tetracycline, in addition to trimethoprim and nalidixic acid. Molecular characterization showed that P. mirabilis 18306 harboured a structure similar to SGI1, except that the aadA2 gene, which confers resistance to streptomycin and spectinomycin, of standard SGI1 had been replaced with dfrA15, which confers resistance to trimethoprim. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequence of the extrachromosomal circular form of SGI1 in P. mirabilis was found to be identical to that of Salmonella Typhimurium DT104. However, PCR results showed that P. mirabilis 18306 was negative for the left and right junctions which represent the integration sites of SGI1 into Salmonella enterica chromosome. Hence, this new variant of SGI1 may be integrated at a different site into the chromosome of P. mirabilis 18306. Tn1826-derived class 2 integron, which carries only two gene cassettes, sat2 and aadA1, was also identified in this strain. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified a new variant SGI1 containing the multiple resistance genomic region in a multidrug-resistant strain of P. mirabilis. This is the first report for SGI1 in a genus other than Salmonella.
TI  - Lipid-specific membrane activity of human beta-defensin-3.
AB  - Defensins represent a major component of innate host defense against bacteria, fungi, and enveloped viruses. One potent defensin found, e.g., in epithelia, is the polycationic human beta-defensin-3 (hBD3). We investigated the role of the lipid matrix composition, and in particular the presence of negatively charged lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from sensitive (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Minnesota) or resistant (Proteus mirabilis) Gram-negative bacteria or of the zwitterionic phospholipids of human cells, in determining the action of polycationic hBD3 on the different membranes, and related to their biological activity. The main focus was directed on data derived from electrical measurements on a reconstitution system of the OM as a planar asymmetric bilayer composed on one side of LPS and on the other of a phospholipid mixture. Our results demonstrate that the antimicrobial activity and the absence of cytotoxicity can be explained by the lipid-specificity of the peptide. A clear correlation between these aspects of the biological activity of hBD3 and its interaction with lipid matrices could be found. In particular, hBD3 could only induce lesions in those membranes resembling the lipid composition of the OM of sensitive bacterial strains. The permeation through the membrane is a decisive first step for the biological activity of many antimicrobial peptides. Therefore, we propose that the lipid-specificity of hBD3 as well as some other membrane-active antimicrobial peptides is important for their activity against bacteria or mammalian cells.
TI  - CMY-16, a novel acquired AmpC-type beta-lactamase of the CMY/LAT lineage in multifocal monophyletic isolates of Proteus mirabilis from northern Italy.
AB  - We report multifocal detection (four different cities in northern Italy) of Proteus mirabilis isolates resistant to both oxyimino- and 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins and producing a novel acquired AmpC-like beta-lactamase. The enzyme, named CMY-16, is a variant of the CMY/LAT lineage, which differs from the closest homologues, CMY-4 and CMY-12, by a single amino acid substitution (A171S or N363S, respectively) and from CMY-2 by two substitutions (A171S and W221R). Expression of the cloned bla(CMY-16) gene in Escherichia coli decreased susceptibility to penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam. Tazobactam was more effective than clavulanate at antagonizing the enzyme activity. Genotyping, by random amplification of polymorphic DNA and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA digested with SfiI, showed that isolates were clonally related to each other, although not identical. The bla(CMY-16) gene was not transferable to E. coli by conjugation or transformation. In all isolates, it was chromosomally located and inserted in a conserved genetic environment. PCR mapping experiments revealed that the bla(CMY-16) was flanked by ISEcp1 and the blc gene, similar to other genes of this lineage from plasmids of Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella spp., and E. coli. Overall, these results revealed multifocal spreading of a CMY-16-producing P. mirabilis clone in northern Italy. This finding represents the first report of an acquired AmpC-like beta-lactamase in Proteus mirabilis from Italy and underscores the emergence of similar resistance determinants in the European setting.
TI  - Metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-AB), and benzidine (Bz). The cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and intestinal anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. In addition, the cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome P450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (CO) difference spectrum. This was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. Our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-AF, 4-AB, and Bz into mutagens. The metabolic activation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome P450 enzyme. For those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a P450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.
TI  - Peptides selected for binding to a virulent strain of Haemophilus influenzae by phage display are bactericidal.
AB  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is an obligate parasite of the oropharynx of humans, in whom it commonly causes mucosal infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, and bronchitis. We used a subtractive phage display approach to affinity select for peptides binding to the cell surface of a novel invasive NTHi strain R2866 (also called Int1). Over half of the selected phage peptides tested were bactericidal toward R2866 in a dose-dependent manner. Five of the clones encoded the same peptide sequence (KQRTSIRATEGCLPS; clone hi3/17), while the remaining four clones encoded unique peptides. All of the bactericidal phage peptides but one were cationic and had similar physical-chemical properties. Clone hi3/17 possessed a similar level of activity toward a panel of clinical NTHi isolates and H. influenzae type b strains but lacked bactericidal activity toward gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica) bacteria. These data indicate that peptides binding to bacterial surface structures isolated by phage display may prove of value in developing new antibiotics.
TI  - Real-time PCR duplex assay for Rickettsia prowazekii and Borrelia recurrentis.
AB  - Rickettsia prowazekii, the etiologic agent for epidemic typhus, and Borrelia recurrentis, the etiologic agent of relapsing fever, both utilize the same vector, the human body louse (Pediculus humanus), to transmit human disease. We have developed an assay to detect both bacterial pathogens in a single tube utilizing real-time PCR. Assays for both agents are specific. The R. prowazekii and B. recurrentis assays do not detect nucleic acid from R. typhi, R. canada, or any of eight spotted fever rickettsiae. In addition they did not react with Neorickettsia risticii, N. sennetsu, Franciscella persica, Bartonella quintana, Legionella pneumophila, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, the B. recurrentis assay did not detect B. duttonii, B. coriaceae, B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. hermsii, or B. burgdorferi nucleic acid. Both assays detected repeatedly only R. prowazekii or B. recurrentis either when tested alone or together in one test tube.
TI  - Interaction of the atypical prokaryotic transcription activator FlhD2C2 with early promoters of the flagellar gene hierarchy.
AB  - The transcriptional activator FlhD2C2 is the master regulator of bacterial flagellum biogenesis and swarming migration, activating the "early" class II promoters of the large flagellar gene hierarchy. Using primer extensions, band-shift assays, and enzymatic and chemical footprinting, we describe the binding of the FlhD2C2 heterotetramer to the promoter regions of four class II flagella operons, fliAZ, flhBA and the divergent flgAMN and flgBCD(EFGHIJ). Each of the promoter regions was bound by a single heterotetramer, i.e. the flgAMN and flgBCD operons are characterised by a single FlhD2C2 binding site. Binding affinity differed, and correlated with previously reported promoter strength and order of activation. Methylation protection and interference, and depurination and depyrimidation interference provided a detailed map of critical bases within a common 46-59bp DNaseI footprint overlapping the promoter -35 sequences. These data and compilation of the 12 known class II promoter sequences of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium allowed determination of a FlhD2C2 binding site with pseudo symmetry, comprising two 17-18bp inverted repeats, each a consensus FlhD2C2 box, separated by a 10-11bp spacer. DNaseI hypersensitivity indicated that binding may cause a conformational change in the promoter regions. Only the FlhC subunit can bind DNA independently, but the specificity and stability of the interaction is strengthened by FlhD. Here, photo-crosslinking established that both FlhC and the stabilising FlhD contact the DNA within the FlhD2C2 tetramer. Our data suggest that specificity of recognition and stability of the FlhD2C2/DNA complex require protein-protein interaction and interaction of both FlhC and FlhD subunits with DNA. These characteristics of the FlhD and FlhC subunits in the FlhD2C2/DNA complex are strikingly atypical of prokaryotic regulators.
TI  - Detection of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase genes in clinical isolates by using multiplex PCR.
AB  - Therapeutic options for infections caused by gram-negative organisms expressing plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases are limited because these organisms are usually resistant to all the beta-lactam antibiotics, except for cefepime, cefpirome, and the carbapenems. These organisms are a major concern in nosocomial infections and should therefore be monitored in surveillance studies. Six families of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases have been identified, but no phenotypic test can differentiate among them, a fact which creates problems for surveillance and epidemiology studies. This report describes the development of a multiplex PCR for the purpose of identifying family-specific AmpC beta-lactamase genes within gram-negative pathogens. The PCR uses six sets of ampC-specific primers resulting in amplicons that range from 190 bp to 520 bp and that are easily distinguished by gel electrophoresis. ampC multiplex PCR differentiated the six plasmid-mediated ampC-specific families in organisms such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Family-specific primers did not amplify genes from the other families of ampC genes. Furthermore, this PCR-based assay differentiated multiple genes within one reaction. In addition, WAVE technology, a high-pressure liquid chromatography-based separation system, was used as a way of decreasing analysis time and increasing the sensitivity of multiple-gene assays. In conclusion, a multiplex PCR technique was developed for identifying family-specific ampC genes responsible for AmpC beta-lactamase expression in organisms with or without a chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamase gene.
TI  - Effect of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, and interleukin-4 on bacteria-enterocyte interactions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the mechanisms involved in bacterial translocation from the intestinal lumen to extraintestinal sites. Because the cytokine cascade associated with sepsis, inflammation, and trauma has been shown to affect intestinal epithelial permeability, experiments were designed to clarify the effects of selected cytokines on bacterial adherence to and internalization by cultured HT-29 and Caco-2 enterocytes. METHODS: Mature, confluent enterocytes were pretreated 48 to 72 h with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon gamma, (IFN-gamma), or interleukin-4 (IL-4). Adherence of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and bacterial internalization was quantified by the gentamicin protection assay. Enterocyte permeability was measured by transepithelial electrical resistance and by flux of 40-kDa fluorescent dextran. Bacterial transmigration across confluent enterocytes was measured using enterocytes cultivated on permeable supports. RESULTS: TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-4 had variable effects on bacterial adherence to HT-29 and Caco-2 enterocytes, although the most consistent finding was increased bacterial adherence associated with INF-gamma. However, none of these cytokines had a noticeable effect on bacterial internalization by either Caco-2 or HT-29 enterocytes. In addition, none of these cytokines had a noticeable effect on the permeability of confluent enterocytes as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance or dextran flux. Bacterial transmigration across confluent HT-29 enterocytes was not altered by TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, or IL-4; however, IL-4 consistently decreased bacterial transmigration across confluent Caco-2 enterocytes. CONCLUSIONS: IFN-gamma may augment the epithelial adherence of selected species of enteric bacteria, and IL-4 may act as a barrier-sustaining agent to decrease bacterial migration across the intestinal epithelium.
TI  - [Identification of plasmid-encoded cephalosporinase ACC-1 among various enterobacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella) isolated from a Tunisian hospital (Sfax 997-2000)].
AB  - Because a multiresistant K. pneumoniae outbreak detected in an intensive care unit of a parisian hospital, combined to the production of the plasmid-encoded cephalosporinase ACC-1, a probable importation via a patient was suggested from another country (Tunisia). The investigation was conducted to examine 35 clinical strains of enterobacteria resistant to ceftazidime without synergy towards Augmentin. Other test of synergy with two inhibitors, BRL 42715, Ro 48-5545 was performed by diffusion method and deposit of 10 micrograms of inhibitor on disks containing ceftazidime, cefoxitin and cefotetan. Synergies were obtained suggesting a probable production of ACC-1 type among six isolates of K. pneumoniae (two), Proteus mirabilis (one) and Salmonella (three) issued from different units. The isoelectric focusing on gel revealed at least one band of beta-lactamase activity at 7.8 but also demonstrated the simultaneous production of several probable beta-lactamases including TEM-type, SHV-2 and ACC-1 among S. enterica ser. Livingstone. The PCR of the gene blaacc-1 was positive. The sequencing (1160 pb) of two products showed high identity (99-100%) with the gene blaacc-1 deposited in 1999. Finally the ACC-1 type reported in Tunisia was probably imported in France via a patient. Because a simultaneous synthesis of ESBL and ACC-1 type, its presence may be invisible and need more investigation.
TI  - CMY-2-producing Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli strains isolated in Spain (October 1999-December 2000).
AB  - CMY-2 plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase (CMY-2) was detected in 21 isolates from two hospitals located in different geographical regions of Spain between October 1999 and December 2000. The isolates comprised two Salmonella enterica serovars (Mikawasima and Montevideo), 16 Escherichia coli, one Klebsiella pneumoniae, one Klebsiella oxytoca and one Proteus mirabilis. In addition to the expected resistance to beta-lactams, including extended-spectrum cephalosporins and cefoxitin, all isolates showed a broad spectrum of associated resistance. All were resistant to sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and streptomycin, and all but two were also resistant to gentamicin. Five isolates were studied in detail and all transferred CMY-2 and other resistance determinants by conjugation. Genomic DNA restriction pattern analysis of the E. coli isolates excluded the dissemination of a single clone. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that CMY-2 has been detected in P. mirabilis, K. oxytoca and S. enterica serovars Mikawasima and Montevideo. It is also the first time that CMY-2 has been described in Spain.
TI  - Site-directed mutagenesis and phylogenetic comparisons of the Escherichia coli Tus protein: DNA-protein interactions alone can not account for Tus activity.
AB  - The Tus protein of Escherichia coli is capable of arresting DNA replication in an orientation-dependent manner when bound to specific sequences in the bacterial chromosome called Ter sites. Arrest of DNA replication has been postulated to occur either by a barrier mechanism, where Tus acts as a physical block to replication fork progression, or through protein-protein interactions between Tus and some component of the replication fork. A previous mutational analysis of Tus suggested that the amino acids in the L1 loop might play a role in replication arrest. Site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids in the L1 loop and other amino acid residues on the "non-permissive" face of Tus was performed to identify residues that affected Tus function. One mutant, E47Q, gave results that are inconsistent with the barrier model, showing a greater affinity for the Ter site (with a t 1/2 of 348 min versus 150 min for wild-type Tus) but a reduced ability to arrest DNA replication in vivo. In addition to the site-directed mutagenesis studies, the tus genes of Salmonella, Klebsiella, and Yersinia were sequenced and the proteins expressed in E. coli to assess their ability to arrest DNA replication. The results presented here support a role for protein-protein interactions in Tus function, and suggest that residues E47 and E49 participate in replication fork arrest.
TI  - Bacterial modification of LPS and resistance to antimicrobial peptides.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (APs) are ubiquitous in nature and are thought to kill micro-organisms by affecting membrane integrity. These positively charged peptides interact with negative charges in the LPS of Gram-negative bacteria. A common mechanism of resistance to AP killing is LPS modification. These modifications include fatty acid additions, phosphoethanolamine (PEtN) addition to the core and lipid A regions, 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose (Ara4N) addition to the core and lipid A regions, acetylation of the O-antigen, and possibly hydroxylation of fatty acids. In Salmonella typhimurium, LPS modifications are induced within host tissues by the two-component regulatory systems PhoPQ and PmrAB. PmrAB activation results in AP resistance by Ara4N addition to lipid A through the activation of at least 8 genes, 7 of which are transcribed as an operon. Loss of this operon and, therefore, Ara4N LPS modification, affects S. typhimurium virulence when administered orally. Transposon mutagenesis of Proteus mirabilis also suggests that LPS modifications affect AP resistance and virulence phenotypes. Therefore, LPS modification in Gram-negative bacteria plays a significant role during infection in resistance to host antimicrobial factors, avoidance of immune system recognition, and maintenance of virulence phenotypes.
TI  - Integrin expression, enterocyte maturation, and bacterial internalization.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in the translocation of enteric bacteria. Adhesion molecules mediate interactions between some enteric pathogens and mammalian cells, but no such interactions have been identified for enterocytes and normal enteric bacteria. Using enteric pathogens, adhesion molecule expression has been linked to bacterial internalization and to enterocyte differentiation. Therefore, experiments were designed to study enterocyte integrin expression and differentiation, as well as enterocyte internalization of Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Relative expression of the alpha2, alpha3, and beta1 integrin subunits on Caco-2 and HT-29 enterocytes (mature and immature) was measured by ELISA. Bacteria-enterocyte surface interactions were observed by light and scanning electron microscopy. Bacterial internalization by enterocytes was quantified using the gentamicin protection assay. RESULTS: Expression of the alpha2, alpha3, and beta1 integrin subunits was consistently increased in immature compared to mature Caco-2 enterocytes; however, compared to mature enterocytes, immature HT-29 enterocytes had similar expression of alpha3 and beta1 but decreased alpha2. Compared to untreated mature enterocytes, bacterial internalization was increased in immature enterocytes as well as mature enterocytes with lateral membranes artifactually exposed. However, there was no difference in bacterial internalization between immature enterocytes and mature enterocytes treated to expose the lateral membrane. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial internalization by enterocytes appeared to be due to factors other than integrin expression or enterocyte differentiation. Exposure of the lateral enterocyte membrane may play an important role in facilitating bacterial internalization by enterocytes.
TI  - Genetic characterization of the Klebsiella pneumoniae waa gene cluster, involved  in core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
AB  - A recombinant cosmid containing genes involved in Klebsiella pneumoniae C3 core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis was identified by its ability to confer bacteriocin 28b resistance to Escherichia coli K-12. The recombinant cosmid contains 12 genes, the whole waa gene cluster, flanked by kbl and coaD genes, as was found in E. coli K-12. PCR amplification analysis showed that this cluster is conserved in representative K. pneumoniae strains. Partial nucleotide sequence determination showed that the same genes and gene order are found in K. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae, for which the core chemical structure is known. Complementation analysis of known waa mutants from E. coli K-12 and/or Salmonella enterica led to the identification of genes involved in biosynthesis of the inner core backbone that are shared by these three members of the Enterobacteriaceae. K. pneumoniae orf10 mutants showed a two-log-fold reduction in a mice virulence assay and a strong decrease in capsule amount. Analysis of a constructed K. pneumoniae waaE deletion mutant suggests that the WaaE protein is involved in the transfer of the branch beta-D-Glc to the O-4 position of L-glycero-D-manno-heptose I, a feature shared by K. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Yersinia enterocolitica.
TI  - Conserved regulatory elements of the promoter sequence of the gene rpoH of enteric bacteria.
AB  - The rpoH regulatory region of different members of the enteric bacteria family was sequenced or downloaded from GenBank and compared. In addition, the transcriptional start sites of rpoH of Yersinia frederiksenii and Proteus mirabilis, two distant members of this family, were determined. Sequences similar to the sigma(70) promoters P1, P4 and P5, to the sigma(E) promoter P3 and to boxes DnaA1, DnaA2, cAMP receptor protein (CRP) boxes CRP1, CRP2 and box CytR present in Escherichia coli K12, were identified in sequences of closely related bacteria such as: E.coli, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In more distant bacteria, Y.frederiksenii and P.mirabilis, the rpoH regulatory region has a distal P1-like sigma(70) promoter and two proximal promoters: a heat-induced sigma(E)-like promoter and a sigma(70) promoter. Sequences similar to the regulatory boxes were not identified in these bacteria. This study suggests that the general pattern of transcription of the rpoH gene in enteric bacteria includes a distal sigma(70) promoter, >200 nt upstream of the initiation codon, and two proximal promoters: a heat-induced sigma(E)-like promoter and a sigma(70) promoter. A second proximal sigma(70) promoter under catabolite-regulation is probably present only in bacteria closely related to E.coli.
TI  - A novel action of the proton pump inhibitor rabeprazole and its thioether derivative against the motility of Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - The motility of Helicobacter pylori was maximum at 37 degrees C and at pH 6. A newly developed proton pump inhibitor, rabeprazole (RPZ), and its thioether derivative (RPZ-TH) markedly inhibited the motility of H. pylori. The concentrations of the drug necessary to inhibit 50% of the motility were 0.25, 16, 16, and >64 microgram/ml for RPZ-TH, RPZ, lansoprazole, and omeprazole, respectively. No such inhibitory effects were observed with H(2) blockers or anti-H. pylori agents. The motilities of Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli-but not those of Vibrio cholerae O1 and O139, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Proteus mirabilis-were also inhibited. Prolonged incubation with RPZ or RPZ-TH inhibited bacterial growth of only H. pylori, except for a turbid colony mutant. The results indicate that RPZ and RPZ-TH have a characteristic inhibitory effect against the motility of H. pylori (spiral-shaped bacteria), which is distinguished from that against bacterial growth.
TI  - Mechanisms of action of rabbit CAP18 on monolayers and liposomes made from endotoxins or phospholipids.
AB  - We have investigated the mechanism of action of the cationic antimicrobial protein (18 kDa) CAP18 on liposomes and monolayers made from phospholipids and enterobacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). CAP18 intercalates into lipid matrices composed of LPS from sensitive strains, weaker into those made of LPS from a resistant strain (Proteus mirabilis strain R45) or negatively charged phospholipids, but not into those composed of neutral phosphatidylcholine. From the combination of data obtained with fluorescence resonance energy transfer and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and film balance measurements, it can be concluded that structural differences in the LPS determine the depth of intercalation of CAP18 into the respective lipid matrices. Thus, we identified the L-Arap4N linked to the first Kdo of the LPS of P. mirabilis strain R45 to be responsible for the CAP18 resistance of this strain. These data provide insight into CAP18-mediated effects on the integrity of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and led to an improved model for rabbit CAP18 membrane interaction.
TI  - Lupene-type triterpenes from Periploca aphylla.
AB  - Two new lupane derivatives, 3beta,6alpha-dihydroxylup-20(29)-ene (1) and 6alpha-hydroxylup-20(29)-en-3beta-octadecanoate (2), have been isolated from the stems of Periploca aphylla, in addition to beta-sitosterol and lupeol. The structures of 1 and 2 were determined by spectral and chemical methods. Compound 1 showed strong inhibition of alpha-glucosidase type VI and a moderate antibacterial activity.
TI  - Genomic subtractive hybridization and selective capture of transcribed sequences  identify a novel Salmonella typhimurium fimbrial operon and putative transcriptional regulator that are absent from the Salmonella typhi genome.
AB  - Salmonella typhi, the etiologic agent of typhoid fever, is adapted to the human host and unable to infect nonprimate species. The genetic basis for host specificity in S. typhi is unknown. The avirulence of S. typhi in animal hosts may result from a lack of genes present in the broad-host-range pathogen Salmonella typhimurium. Genomic subtractive hybridization was successfully employed to isolate S. typhimurium genomic sequences which are absent from the S. typhi genome. These genomic subtracted sequences mapped to 17 regions distributed throughout the S. typhimurium chromosome. A positive cDNA selection method was then used to identify subtracted sequences which were transcribed by S. typhimurium following macrophage phagocytosis. A novel putative transcriptional regulator of the LysR family was identified as transcribed by intramacrophage S. typhimurium. This putative transcriptional regulator was absent from the genomes of the human-adapted serovars S. typhi and Salmonella paratyphi A. Mutations within this gene did not alter the level of S. typhimurium survival within macrophages or virulence within mice. A subtracted genomic fragment derived from the ferrichrome operon also hybridized to the intramacrophage cDNA. Nucleotide sequence analysis of S. typhimurium and S. typhi chromosomal sequences flanking the ferrichrome operon identified a novel S. typhimurium fimbrial operon with a high level of similarity to sequences encoding Proteus mirabilis mannose-resistant fimbriae. The novel fimbrial operon was absent from the S. typhi genome. The absence of specific genes may have allowed S. typhi to evolve as a highly invasive, systemic human pathogen.
TI  - Substrate-specific binding of hook-associated proteins by FlgN and FliT, putative chaperones for flagellum assembly.
AB  - During flagellum assembly by motile enterobacteria, flagellar axial proteins destined for polymerization into the cell surface structure are thought to be exported through the 25-30 A flagellum central channel as partially unfolded monomers. How are premature folding and oligomerization in the cytosol prevented? We have shown previously using hyperflagellated Proteus mirabilis and a motile but non-swarming flgN transposon mutant that the apparently cytosolic 16. 5 kDa flagellar protein FlgN facilitates efficient flagellum filament assembly. Here, we investigate further whether FlgN, predicted to contain a C-terminal amphipathic helix typical of type III export chaperones, acts as a chaperone for axial proteins. Incubation of soluble radiolabelled FlgN from Salmonella typhimurium with nitrocellulose-immobilized cell lysates of wild-type S. typhimurium and a non-flagellate class 1 flhDC mutant indicated that FlgN binds to flagellar proteins. Identical affinity blot analysis of culture supernatants from the wild-type and flhDC, flgI, flgK, flgL, fliC or fliD flagellar mutants showed that FlgN binds to the flagellar hook-associated proteins (HAPs) FlgK and FlgL. This was confirmed by blotting artificially expressed individual HAPs in Escherichia coli. Analysis of axial proteins secreted into the culture medium by the original P. mirabilis flgN mutant demonstrated that export of FlgK and FlgL was specifically reduced, with concomitant increased release of unpolymerized flagellin (FliC), the immediately distal component of the flagellum. These data suggest that FlgN functions as an export chaperone for FlgK and FlgL. Parallel experiments showed that FliT, a similarly small (14 kDa), potentially helical flagellar protein, binds specifically to the flagellar filament cap protein, FliD (HAP2), indicating that it too might be an export chaperone. Flagellar axial proteins all contain amphipathic helices at their termini. Removal of the HAP C-terminal helical domains abolished binding by FlgN and FliT in each case, and polypeptides comprising each of the HAP C-termini were specifically bound by FlgN and FliT. We suggest that FlgN and FliT are substrate-specific flagellar chaperones that prevent oligomerization of the HAPs by binding to their helical domains before export.
TI  - Structural and immunochemical studies of two cross-reactive Proteus mirabilis O-antigens, O6 and O23, containing beta1-->3-linked 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose residues.
AB  - A marked serological cross-reactivity was observed by ELISA and a precipitation test between anti-Proteus mirabilis O23 serum and the lipopolysaccharide as well as the O-specific polysaccharide from the Proteus mirabilis strain belonging to serogroup O6. The structures of the O-specific polysaccharides were elucidated using chemical and NMR spectroscopic analyses, and the only common component, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose (beta-D-GlcNAc), was revealed, which was suggested to be responsible for the cross-reactivity observed. Both anti-O23 and anti-O6 sera were shown to react with 1, 3-Linked beta-D-GlcNAc-containing O-antigen from Salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae O59 also. The lack of reactivity of Smith-degraded P. mirabilis O6 O-specific polysaccharide with homologous antiserum indicated the crucial role of alpha-D-glucuronic acid in specific antibody binding.
TI  - Transmucosal passage of bacteria across rat intestinal epithelium in the Ussing chamber: effect of nutritional factors and bacterial virulence.
AB  - Transmucosal passage of bacteria across the intestine, the essential and prerequisite step for bacterial translocation, cannot be effectively studied using in vivo models of translocation. We have adapted the Ussing chamber into a fresh, sterile organ culture system that can facilitate the study of bacterial-epithelial interactions. Intestinal membranes were mounted in the Ussing chamber and perfused with a solution rich in putative mucosal micronutrients. The transmembrane potential difference was constantly monitored as a marker of intestinal integrity. Transmucosal passage of various bacteria across the normal intestinal epithelium was quantitated, and the mucosal membrane was examined by light and transmission electron microscopy. The addition of potassium cyanide to the mucosal perfusate resulted in an irreversible loss of potential difference. Oxygen deprivation also led to a precipitous drop in potential difference, but it was reversible with prompt reoxygenation. In contrast, intestinal membranes perfused with a solution consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 20 mM glutamine maintained their potential difference for a sustained period (>180 min). Both the viability and structural integrity of the ileal intestinal membrane were maintained in culture ex vivo using this perfusate. Qualitative differences were observed in the mechanism of transmucosal passage of mild to moderately virulent bacteria such as Escherichia coli C-25 and Proteus mirabilis M-13, which pass through the intestinal epithelium without causing overt damage to the mucosa, and more virulent organisms such as Salmonella typhimurium, which cause extensive mucosal damage by light and transmission electron microscopy. The Ussing system should provide a useful model of intact organ culture for the study of the mechanisms of bacterial translocation and the pathogenesis of enteric infections.
TI  - Novel selective and non-selective optical detection of microorganisms.
AB  - A new instrument, capable of detecting metabolic changes due to microbiological activity, is described. Optical changes in growth media are monitored in a semi-fluid zone that separates the liquid medium containing the sample. Data demonstrate that common media can be utilized in conjunction with this rapid automated technology. Nutrient broth with the pH dye indicator. bromocresol purple was suitable for total counts. Selective media containing dyes were utilized to assess the presence or absence of specific groups of organisms. Biochemical reactions, such as lysine decarboxylase activity, were identified by the unique generated patterns, and specific enzymatic cleavage reactions with chromogenic substrates, such as 5-bromo-4 chloro-3 indolyl-beta-D-glucuronic acid (X-GLUC), were monitored.
TI  - Elevated levels of anti-proteus antibodies in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  - We carried out this study to determine if our patient population with rheumatoid  arthritis (RA) has elevated levels of antibodies to gut bacteria. Seventy patients with RA were categorised as being either active or inactive on clinical grounds. Antibodies to the H and O antigens of Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhi were determined by tube agglutination method in these patients, 18 patients with osteoarthritis and 82 healthy controls. There was no significant difference in the anti-proteus antibody titres between both the control groups and patients with inactive disease. However, antibody levels among patients with active disease were significantly higher than controls (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in anti-salmonella antibody titres among the various disease and control groups. Elevated antibody levels could suggest a role for Proteus as an etiological agent in RA.
TI  - [Use of semi-solid Diasalm medium for isolation of Salmonella enteritidis].
AB  - The Diagnostic Semi-solid Salmonella Agar (DIASALM) was compared with two commercial semi-solid Rappaport-Vasiliadis media (MSRV by Oxoid and SRVA, basis by HiMedia) using 52 strains of Salmonella and 10 strains of interfering Gram-negative bacteria. The diagnostic potency for salmonellae was higher in DIASALM than in MSRV or SRVA. Unlike the Rappaport-Vasiliadis media, DIASALM contains a diagnostic system consisting of lactose, saccharose and bromocresol purple, allowing the differentiation of salmonellae from non-pathogenic Gram-negative sugar-fermenting bacteria (Tab. I). The semi-solid media were supplemented with 0.0015% nitrofurantoine to recover specifically Salmonella enteritidis. Eighty percent of strains of the latter serovar were resistant to this chemotherapeutic agent, while all the other serovars were sensitive to it. The use of discs soaked with the monovalent Salmonella antiserum H:g,m increased the recovery rate in 95 percent of S. enteritidis strains. Compared with the cultures from peptone water, the diameters of the migration zones formed by the positive cultures grown in M-broth were larger by 3 to 5 mm. Pure cultures of salmonellae were isolated in 98% of cases from the borders of the migration zones when mixed cultures of salmonellae (a S. enteritidis isolate from a patient, density 10(3) to 1 or 2 cells per drop) and Citrobacter koseri or Edwardsiella tarda, or Proteus mirabilis, or Psedomonas aeruginosa (densities > or = 10(3) cells per drop) were inoculated onto DIASALM (Tab III).
TI  - Intracellular survival of enteric bacteria in cultured human enterocytes.
AB  - Translocating enteric bacteria have been visualized within intact intestinal epithelial cells in animal models of bacterial translocation. Although the ability of the enterocyte to engulf bacteria has been well documented in both in vivo and in vitro experimental models, relatively little is known about the enterocyte's ability to degrade internalized bacteria. Intracellular survival of eight strains of enteric bacteria (two strains of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, two strains of Escherichia coli, and two strains of Enterococcus faecalis) was quantified over a 20 h period using two different types of terminally differentiated polarized enterocytes considered relevant in vitro models of human small intestinal epithelium, namely Caco-2 and HT-29 cells. Caco-2 enterocytes were generally more permissive for bacterial uptake when compared with HT-29 enterocytes. However, bacterial survival was similar within each type of enterocyte, and most strains of enteric bacteria remained viable within enterocytes for the 20 h duration of the assay. In addition, with the exception of one strain of L. monocytogenes in Caco-2 cells, intracellular enteric bacteria had no noticeable effect on host enterocyte viability for this 20 h duration. Transmission electron microscopy was used to visualize both intact and degraded bacteria within individual enterocytes, suggesting that prolonged bacterial survival might have resulted from simultaneous bacterial degradation and replication. Thus, although enterocytes internalize enteric bacteria, enterocytes might not kill internalized bacteria as efficiently as leukocytes. Observations of bacterial intracellular survival supported the hypothesis that the enterocyte might be a portal of entry for translocating microbes, and observations of intracellular bacterial degradation might have implications for the role of the enterocyte as an antigen-presenting cell.
TI  - Uptake pathways of clinical isolates of Proteus mirabilis into human epithelial cell lines.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis isolates obtained from urine and faeces showed high invasion levels into several human epithelial cell lines in gentamicin assays. Invasion efficiencies of isolate 102 from a monkey with diarrhoea equalled or even exceeded those of Salmonella typhi strain Ty2 (6.3 to 13.8% of the inoculum). Vegetative, non-swarming P.mirabilis invaded epithelial cells efficiently and were found in endosomes and free in the cytoplasm. Although inhibition of eukaryotic protein synthesis by cycloheximide did not reduce bacterial uptake, inhibition with bacteriostatic antibiotics of bacterial protein-, RNA-, or DNA-synthesis reduced invasion drastically. Involvement of eukaryotic structures and processes in internalization was determined by using various inhibitors in the invasion assay. Uptake of P.mirabilis isolated from urine into gut (INT 407, HCT-8) cells and bladder (T24) cells was dramatically inhibited only by microfilament depolymerization. Internalization of faecal isolate 102 into gut or bladder epithelial cells was inhibited by depolymerization of microfilaments or microtubules. Engulfment of isolate 102 into T24 bladder cells was also reduced by inhibition of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Interference with endosome acidification decreased the number of intracellular bacteria of isolate 102 in all three cell lines. These results suggest that P.mirabilis isolates from different sources are internalized by epithelial cells by different eukaryotic processes, and that these processes can vary between cell lines.
TI  - A human temporal bone study of acute bacterial meningogenic labyrinthitis.
AB  - It is well established that sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is an important sequela of acute bacterial meningitis. Previous human temporal bone histopathologic studies have suggested that such hearing loss is due to labyrinthitis. This study involved a detailed and systematic evaluation of the auditory and vestibular end-organs in 41 human temporal bones from patients with acute bacterial meningitis, aimed at describing the spectrum of histopathologic changes within the labyrinth, ascertaining likely routes for spread of infection from the meninges to the inner ear, and comparing the data from humans with those described in a rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. Our study revealed the following: (a) Suppurative labyrinthitis occurred in 20 (49%) bones. Of these 20 bones, the cochlea was affected in all, whereas the vestibular organs were involved in 10. Eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids without the presence of inflammatory cells (so-called "serous" labyrinthitis) occurred in 14 of the remaining 21 bones. This staining occurred primarily within the vestibular system. Its significance and pathogenesis remains unknown; (b) Sensory and neural structures of the inner ear appeared intact in the majority of specimens, including bones with suppurative labyrinthitis and those with eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids. This finding raises the possibility of preventing or reversing SNHL by therapeutic intervention. Spiral ganglion cells were severely degenerated in 12% of bones, indicating a retrocochlear site of hearing loss in addition to the cochlea. This subset of patients may perform poorly after cochlear implantation; (c) It has been traditionally assumed that irreversible and permanent SNHL is caused by suppurative labyrinthitis, whereas reversible SNHL is caused by serous labyrinthitis. Our findings question the validity of these assumptions; (d) The data were consistent with the hypothesis that both the cochlear modiolus and cochlear aqueduct can serve as potential pathways for spread of infection from the meninges to the inner ear; (e) There were many similarities in the histopathology of the inner ear in humans when compared with the rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. A notable difference was that the cochlear aqueduct appeared to be the sole pathway for spread of infection in the rabbit, whereas in the human, both the modiolus and aqueduct were possible pathways.
TI  - Characterization of beta-lactamase gene blaPER-2, which encodes an extended-spectrum class A beta-lactamase.
AB  - Plasmidic extended-spectrum beta-lactamases of Ambler class A are mostly inactive against ceftibuten. Salmonella typhimurium JMC isolated in Argentina harbors a bla gene located on a plasmid (pMVP-5) which confers transferable resistance to oxyiminocephalosporins, aztreonam, and ceftibuten. The beta-lactamase PER-2 (formerly ceftibutenase-1; CTI-1) is highly susceptible to inhibition by clavulanate and is located at a pI of 5.4 after isoelectric focusing. The blaPER-2 gene was cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of a 2.2-kb insert in vector pBluescript includes an open reading frame of 927 bp. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of PER-2 with those of other beta-lactamases indicates that PER-2 is not closely related to TEM or SHV enzymes (25 to 26% homology). PER-2 is most closely related to PER-1 (86.4% homology), an Ambler class A enzyme first detected in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. An enzyme with an amino acid sequence identical to that of PER-1, meanwhile, was found in various members of the family Enterobacteriaceae isolated from patients in Turkey. Our data indicate that PER-2 and PER-1 represent a new group of Ambler class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. PER-2 so far has been detected only in pathogens (S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis) isolated from patients in South America, while the incidence of PER-1-producing strains so far has been restricted to Turkey, where it occurs both in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Methanol extracts LPS from deep rough bacteria.
AB  - Several rough strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica and Proteus mirabilis were cultivated in the presence of (14C)acetate, which incorporated into their phospholipids and lipopolysaccharide. Phospholipids were removed from the cells with ethanol extraction. However, as shown by thin layer chromatography, methanol additionally extracted remarkable quantities of lipopolysaccharide from deep rough strains, but not from bacteria containing complete or nearly complete core.
TI  - Screening of in vitro antibacterial activity from Syzygium Guineense (Willd) hydrosoluble dry extract.
AB  - Diarrhoea is one of the most important causes of infant mortality in the world. As modern drugs are expensive or unavailable in developing countries, many people use traditional medicines in Africa for the treatment of several diseases. In our study, we investigated the antibacterial activity of Syzygium Guineense extract in order to assess its activity on some bacterial strains involved in diarrhoeal diseases and to justify its use. The aqueous dry extract was prepared by decoction followed by evaporating to dryness and tested according to dilution method. This extract showed an antibacterial activity against some bacterial strains: Salmonella E., Shigella D., Shigella F., E. Coli., Enterobacter A. It did not show any activity against Citrobacter F., Proteus M., Klebsiella P. Storage conditions (27 degrees C, glass flask) did not affect antibacterial properties of the extract.
TI  - Survival of enterobacteria in liquid cultures during microwave radiation and conventional heating.
AB  - Bacteria in food have been reported to survive in larger numbers after processing by microwave radiation than after conventional processing. The bactericidal effect of a domestic microwave oven (SHARP R-7280) on certain pathogenic enterobacteria species was investigated in vitro, in comparison with conventional heating (boiling). The death rates of different nosocomial strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella sofia, Salmonella enteritidis, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested. The microwave oven and the conventional heating system used were both calibrated in order to calculate temperatures from exposure times. For each strain duplicate samples of 25 ml of pure culture with concentrations at least 10(6) cfu/ml were exposed to microwave radiation. An equal number of samples of the same volume and concentration were exposed to conventional heating. Subsequently all samples were examined qualitatively and quantitatively following standard microbiological procedures. The results indicate that microwaves have an efficient bactericidal effect on the enterobacteria in liquid cultures.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of bile on bacterial invasion of enterocytes: possible mechanism for increased translocation associated with obstructive jaundice.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clarify the effect of bile salts on internalization of enteric bacteria by intestinal epithelial cells. DESIGN: Randomized study. SETTING: Research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Cultured human intestinal epithelial cells, namely HT-29 cells. INTERVENTIONS: The effect of bile was studied by adding bile during the time period in which bacterial cells were permitted to interact with enterocytes. In subsequent experiments, bile was added to the culture medium used to grow bacteria, and bacterial cells were washed before adding bacteria to enterocytes. Three different concentrations of three different bile preparations were tested. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Salmonella typhimurium and Proteus mirabilis were each incubated with HT-29 cells for 1 hr; the numbers of internalized bacteria were subsequently quantified following enterocyte lysis. The presence of bile during bacteria-enterocyte incubation had no effect on the numbers of internalized bacteria. However, if S. typhimurium or P. mirabilis were grown in the presence of bile, these washed bacterial cells were generally internalized by HT-29 cells in significantly fewer numbers, compared with bacterial cells grown in medium without bile supplementation. Enterocyte viability and morphologic ultrastructure did not appear to be affected by the presence of bile itself, or by the interaction with bacterial cells that had been cultivated in unsupplemented medium or in bile-supplemented medium. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to bile during bacterial growth resulted in bacterial cells with decreased invasiveness for cultured intestinal epithelial cells. This observation is consistent with previous in vivo studies of obstructive jaundice, where the absence of bile in the intestinal lumen, not bile duct ligation, appeared to facilitate bacterial translocation in obstructed animals. Thus, the presence of bile in the intestinal lumen may decrease bacterial translocation by a mechanism that involves decreased epithelial internalization of enteric bacteria.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the NapA acid phosphatase/phosphotransferase of Morganella morganii: identification of a new family of bacterial acid-phosphatase-encoding genes.
AB  - The gene encoding a minor phosphate-irrepressible acid phosphatase (named NapA) of Morganella morganii was cloned and sequenced, and its product characterized. NapA is a secreted acid phosphatase composed of four 27 kDa polypeptide subunits. The enzyme is active on several organic phosphate monoesters but not on diesters, and is also endowed with transphosphorylating activity from organic phosphoric acid esters to nucleosides and other compounds with free hydroxyl groups. Its activity is inhibited by EDTA, inorganic phosphate, nucleosides and Ca2+, but not by fluoride or tartrate, and is enhanced by Mg2+, Co2+ and Zn2+. At the sequence level, the NapA enzyme did not show similarities to any other sequenced bacterial phosphatases. However, a search for homologous genes in sequence databases allowed identification of two open reading frames located within sequenced regions of the Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis genomes respectively, encoding proteins of unknown function which are highly homologous to the Morganella enzyme. Moreover, the properties of the NapA enzyme are very similar to those reported for the periplasmic nonspecific acid phosphatase II of Salmonella typhimurium (for which no sequence data are available). These data point to the existence of a new family of bacterial acid phosphatases, which we propose designating class B bacterial acid phosphatases.
TI  - The specificity of the anti-Proteus antibody response in tissue-typed rheumatoid  arthritis (RA) patients from Brest.
AB  - Anti-Proteus mirabilis antibody titres were found to be elevated in 50 active tissue-typed French rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients from Brest when compared to 49 healthy French controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; P < 0.001) and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA; P < 0.001). However, there was no significant elevation in antibody titres against Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium in the RA patients compared to the controls when measured by ELISA. Serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were also found to be significantly higher in RA patients when compared to healthy control subjects (P < 0.001). These results suggest that P. mirabilis may play an important and specific role in the triggering and persistence of RA.
TI  - Bees aren't the only ones: swarming in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Swarming is a form of active surface motility that is widespread among flagellated, Gram-negative bacteria. In the laboratory, growth of the bacteria on certain agar surfaces leads to induction of the differentiated swarmer-cell state. Swarmer cells are generally long and multinucleate, always hyperflagellated, and can move rapidly over the agar surface in a coordinated manner. Some swarm colonies exude large amounts of 'slime', which could be essential for promoting intimate cell-cell contacts during swarming. There is evidence that the differentiated swarmer-cell stage facilitates pathogenic associations with host tissue. Almost nothing is known about the molecular signalling mechanism of surface sensing. Increased viscosity appears to be sensed by several bacteria, but other environmental cues, specific to each bacterium, are also important. In organisms in which swarming motility has been studied in some detail, the chemotaxis system has been shown to play an important role. The recent discovery of swarming motility in two genetically well-characterized organisms--Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium--should lead to rapid progress in understanding this process.
TI  - Effect of LPS on epithelial integrity and bacterial uptake in the polarized human enterocyte-like cell line Caco-2.
AB  - Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been speculated to facilitate bacterial translocation by a mechanism involving physical disruption of the gut mucosal barrier. Polarized, cultured intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2 cells) were used to study the effect of LPS on enterocyte structure, viability, and susceptibility to bacterial invasion. Varying concentrations of biologically active LPS were incubated with enterocytes for 1 and 16 hr. LPS had no noticeable effect on enterocyte viability or morphology, as measured by uptake of vital dyes, by distribution of cytoskeletal filamentous actin, and by visualization of subcellular ultrastructure. Transepithelial electrical resistance was similar in enterocyte cultures incubated with LPS for 1 hr, but there was a noticeable decrease after 16 hr, indicating a loss of epithelial integrity after prolonged exposure to LPS. The effect of LPS on bacterial uptake was studied using six strains of enteric bacteria with varying abilities to invade Caco-2 cells: Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli (2 strains), and Enterococcus faecalis. Electron microscopy showed enteric bacteria in intimate association with enterocyte apical microvilli, and internalized bacteria were consistently observed within cytoplasmic, membrane-bound vacuoles. Following a 1-hr incubation of individual strains of enteric bacteria with Caco-2 cells, numbers of viable intracellular bacteria varied significantly between individual bacterial strains, but numbers of intracellular bacteria were similar for each strain incubated with enterocytes exposed to 0, 10, and 100 micrograms LPS for 1 and 16 hr. Thus, although prolonged exposure to LPS might have some effect on enterocyte culture integrity (as measured by decreased electrical resistance), LPS had no discernible effect on enterocyte structure, viability, and susceptibility to bacterial invasion. These results suggested that LPS-induced bacterial translocation might not involve loss of epithelial viability, or facilitated entry of bacteria into intestinal epithelial cells.
TI  - Oral infectivity and bacterial interactions with mononuclear phagocytes.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to clarify the association between the oral infectivity of a bacterial strain and its susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them. Ten bacterial strains tested--all of known oral infectivity--comprised Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes (three strains), Escherichia coli (two strains), Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, and a Bacteroides sp. The phagocytic uptake of each strain was measured as the bacteria to phagocyte ratio after mononuclear phagocytes in mouse peritoneal exudate were permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo for 3 min. The three Listeria strains were the most susceptible to phagocytic uptake and the Salmonella strain was relatively resistant. The intracellular survival of each strain was studied during a subsequent 2 h in-vitro incubation of the mononuclear phagocytes that had been permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo. The strains with the best intracellular survival were Ent. faecalis and two of the three Listeria strains. The ability of S. typhimurium to survive intracellularly was intermediate but better than that of the two E. coli strains. Oral infectivity was not consistently correlated with susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them.
TI  - Outer membrane permeability barrier to azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin in gram-negative enteric bacteria.
AB  - Mutations which severely affect the function of the outer membrane of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium (lpxA and firA mutations of lipid A synthesis and rfaE mutation of the lipopolysaccharide inner-core synthesis) were found to decrease the MICs of erythromycin, roxithromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin by factors of 32 to 512, 32 to 1,024, 64 to 512, and 16 to 64, respectively. The sensitization factors for three other hydrophobic antibiotics (rifampin, fusidic acid, and mupirocin) ranged from 16 to 300. The outer membrane permeability-increasing agents polymyxin B nonapeptide (3 micrograms/ml) and deacylpolymyxin B (1 microgram/ml) sensitized wild-type E. coli to azithromycin by factors of 10 and 30, respectively. Quantitatively very similar sensitization to the other macrolides took place. Polymyxin-resistant pmrA mutants of S. typhimurium displayed no cross-resistance to azithromycin. Proteus mirabilis mutants which were sensitized to polymyxin by a factor of > or = 300 to > or = 1,000 had a maximal two- to fourfold increase in sensitivity to azithromycin. These results indicate that azithromycin and the other new macrolides use the hydrophobic pathway across the outer membrane and that the intact outer membrane is an effective barrier against them. Furthermore, the results indicate that azithromycin, in contrast to polymyxin, does not effectively diffuse through the outer membrane by interacting electrostatically with the lipopolysaccharide.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of tosufloxacin against and uptake of tosufloxacin by outer membrane mutants of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of tosufloxacin and other quinolones against and apparent uptakes of tosufloxacin and other quinolones by outer membrane mutants of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella typhimurium were studied. The hydrophobicity of tosufloxacin was nearly equal to that of ofloxacin or lower than those of sparfloxacin and nalidixic acid. OmpF- and OmpC-deficient E. coli and 40-kDa porin-deficient P. mirabilis mutants were twofold more susceptible to tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin but two- to fourfold less susceptible to other quinolones than their parent strains. In S. typhimurium lipopolysaccharide-deficient (rough) mutants, the differences in susceptibility to tosufloxacin were similar to those to sparfloxacin and nalidixic acid. The apparent uptake of tosufloxacin by intact cells was increased in porin-deficient mutants compared with that by their parent strain. These results suggest that the permeation route of tosufloxacin across the outer membrane is different from that of other fluoroquinolones and that tosufloxacin may permeate mainly through the nonporin pathway, presumably phospholipid bilayers. However, this characteristic is independent of the hydrophobicity of the molecule.
TI  - [The immunogenicity of mono- and associated vaccines made from strains of opportunistic bacteria].
AB  - In experiments on white mice the immunogenic potency of two variants of combined  vaccines prepared from strains of opportunistic bacteria was compared with that of monovaccines used as the components of the combined vaccines. All the vaccines under study were found highly immunogenic. Decrease of monovaccine share in the combined vaccine did not reduce the immunogenic potency to any of the strains. An 8- to 16-fold increase in the level of specific antibodies in the colostric lactosera of cows immunized with combined vaccines was observed, and the survival rate of newborn calves increased 3- to 4-fold.
TI  - Aztreonam for treating meningitis caused by gram-negative rods.
AB  - 10 patients with meningitis due to unusual gram-negative organisms (Pseudomonas,  Proteus, Salmonella and Klebsiella) were effectively treated with aztreonam. A detailed history and a thorough physical examination combined with careful laboratory testing resulted in accurate diagnosis and cure of all patients.
TI  - Interspecies compatibility of selenoprotein biosynthesis in Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Several species of Enterobacteriaceae were investigated for their ability to synthesize selenium-containing macromolecules. Seleniated tRNA species as well as seleniated polypeptides were formed by all organisms tested. Two selenopolypeptides could be identified in most of the organisms which correspond to the 80 kDa and 110 kDa subunits of the anaerobically induced formate dehydrogenase isoenzymes of E. coli. In those organisms possessing both isoenzymes, their synthesis was induced in a mutually exclusive manner dependent upon whether nitrate was present during anaerobic growth. The similarity of the 80 kDa selenopolypeptide among the different species was assessed by immunological and genetic analyses. Antibodies raised against the 80 kDa selenopolypeptide from E. coli cross-reacted with an 80 kDa polypeptide in those organisms which exhibited fermentative formate dehydrogenase activity. These organisms also contained genes which hybridised with the fdhF gene from E. coli. In an attempt to identify the signals responsible for incorporation of selenium into the selenopolypeptides in these organisms we cloned a portion of the fdhF gene homologue from Enterobacter aerogenes. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned 723 bp fragment was determined and it was shown to contain an in-frame TGA (stop) codon at the position corresponding to that present in the E. coli gene. This fragment was able to direct incorporation of selenocysteine when expressed in the heterologous host, E. coli. Moreover, the E. coli fdhF gene was expressed in Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens and Proteus mirabilis, indicating a high degree of conservation of the seleniating system throughout the enterobacteria.
TI  - Sandwich enzyme immunoassays for detection of Salmonella typhi.
AB  - Enzyme immunoassays were developed using monoclonal antibodies raised against somatic (O), flagellar (H) and capsular (Vi) antigens of Salmonella typhi. The assay based on anti-O monoclonal antibodies could specifically detect S. typhi and soluble lipopolysaccharide (LPS) isolated from S. typhi. Anti-H MoAbs detected motile S. typhi and soluble flagellar antigen. Monoclonal antibodies against capsular polysaccharide could detect Vi-containing S. typhi as well as soluble Vi antigen. The three assays reported here detected S. typhi with 100% sensitivity in blood culture broths obtained from bacteriologically confirmed typhoid patients and were negative with blood specimens containing Salmonella senftenberg, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis or Streptococcus (alpha-hemolytic) derived from patients with pyrexia. The assays, however, did not demonstrate the presence of soluble antigens in sera and urine samples obtained from typhoid patients.
TI  - The core region of Proteus mirabilis R110/1959 lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - The complete core structure present in the lipopolysaccharide of the R mutant R110/1959 from Proteus mirabilis (Proteus type II core) was investigated using methylation analysis and a number of degradation methods such as Smith degradation and beta-elimination. These studies combined with earlier work on a Rc-type mutant of P. mirabilis O28 (R4/O28) which shares the same inner core region, allowed formulation of the complete core structure of the Proteus type II core as shown in Scheme 1. (formula; see text) A characteristic feature of the Proteus core of type II is the presence of two units of D-galacturonic acid (DGalA); one in terminal, the other one in a chain-linked position. In addition, the presence of the two isomers of glycero-D-manno-heptose (LDHep and DDHep) and the lack of galactose are conspicuous. DDHep occupies a terminal position in the external core region, whereas the three units of LDHep in addition to dOclA form, as in other enterobacterial core types, the internal core region. The taxonomic significance of the presence of DGalA in the Proteus type II core, but also in all R cores of other Proteeae investigated so far, will be discussed.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigemonam against urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - Tigemonam's in vitro activity was compared with that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, gentamicin, and norfloxacin. Thirty-two strains of Pseudomonas and 960 strains of Enterobacteriaceae were studied using the agar dilution method (including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Salmonella enterica). Tigemonam displayed good activity against Enterobacteriaceae. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were as follows: MIC50S were 0.01 mg/L for P. mirabilis and 0.5 mg/L for S. marcescens, MIC90S were 0.03 mg/L for P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris and 4 mg/L for Citrobacter freundii. Tigemonam inhibited E. coli and P. mirabilis, the most common strains of urinary pathogens. Despite MIC90S of 9.5 and 4 mg/L for Enterobacter and C. freundii, respectively, resistance to tigemonam was observed. Tigemonam was found to be inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with MIC50S and MIC90S higher than 128 mg/L (range, 64 to greater than 128 mg/L). Tigemonam's activity was found to be similar to that of cefotaxime, slightly less than that of norfloxacin and aztreonam, and substantially greater than that of gentamicin. Of all the drugs tested, only norfloxacin and aztreonam possessed activity profiles against P. aeruginosa that were compatible with their clinical usefulness (MIC90, 8 mg/L for norfloxacin; MIC50, 8 mg/L and MIC90, 32 mg/L for aztreonam). Cefotaxime and gentamicin showed no activity on more than 90% of the P. aeruginosa strains tested.

TI  - The action of LPS porins and peptidoglycan fragments on human spermatozoa.
AB  - This study examines the action of the cell wall components of enterobacteria on the vitality of human spermatozoa. Lipopolysaccharides extracted from Escherichia coli K12 killed about 80% of the spermatozoa at a concentration of 50 micrograms/ml. Porins extracted from E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium killed between 80% and 100% of the spermatozoa at a concentration of 50 micrograms/ml. Muramic acid and N-acetylmuramic acid caused about 60% mortality at a concentration of 50 micrograms/ml. The possibility that the products of cellular lysis in the course of gram-negative infections cause temporary sterility is discussed.
TI  - Cloning of genes from members of the family Enterobacteriaceae with mini-Mu bacteriophage containing plasmid replicons.
AB  - An in vivo cloning system that uses derivatives of the Escherichia coli bacteriophage Mu with plasmid replicons has been extended to five different species of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Mu and these mini-Mu replicon elements were introduced into strains of E. coli, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii, and Proteus mirabilis by infection, by transformation, or by conjugation with newly constructed broad-host-range plasmids containing insertions of these elements. Lysates from these cells, lysogenic for Mu and mini-Mu elements, were used to infect sensitive recipient strains of E. coli, S. typhimurium, and C. freundii. Drug-resistant transductants had mini-Mu replicon elements with inserts of different DNA sequences. All of the lysogens made could be induced to yield high phage titers, including those coming from strains that were resistant to Mu and Mu derivatives. Clones of 10 particular genes were isolated by their ability to complement specific mutations in the recipient strains, even in the presence of the E. coli K-12 restriction system. Some of the mini-Mu replicon elements used contained lac gene fusing segments and resulted in fusions of the lac operon to control regions in the cloned sequences.
TI  - Late intraphagosomal hydrogen ion concentration favors the in vitro antimicrobial capacity of a 37-kilodalton cationic granule protein of human neutrophil granulocytes.
AB  - We described previously (W.M. Shafer, L.E. Martin, and J.K. Spitznagel, Infect. Immun. 45:29-35, 1984) the presence of a 37-kilodalton cationic antimicrobial protein (37K CAP) in extracts of granules prepared from human polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN). In this investigation, we prepared 37K CAP from PMN granule extracts by sequential ion-exchange and molecular-sieve chromatography and examined its antimicrobial activity against a number of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. At concentrations of 5 micrograms/ml or lower, 37K CAP exerted selective antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria. These bacteria included Acinetobacter lwoffii, Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, and Shigella sonnei. However, at 5 micrograms of 37K CAP per ml, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens resisted this antimicrobial activity. The bactericidal activity of 37K CAP was greatest in acidic (pH 5.5) as opposed to alkaline (pH 7.5) media. The level of S. typhimurium resistance to 37K CAP correlated with the presence of O antigen in the lipopolysaccharide. In the absence of O antigen repeat units, resistance was proportional to the length of the core oligosaccharide. These results suggest that 37K CAP may contribute significantly to the ability of PMN to kill gram-negative bacteria by nonoxidative means, particularly as the maturing phagolysosome becomes acidified.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharide of Providencia rettgeri. Chemical studies and taxonomical implications.
AB  - The chemical constitutional analysis of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) isolated from Providencia rettgeri was carried out. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using sodium dodecylsulfate or sodium deoxycholate showed that the lipopolysaccharide mostly consisted of short sugar chains. The lipid A was precipitated out after mild acid hydrolysis of LPS. From the supernatant degraded polysaccharide and unsubstituted core fractions were isolated. Compositional analysis of the core material revealed the presence of galacturonic acid, galactose, glucose, glucosamine, L-glycero-D-manno-heptose, 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid, alanine and phosphorus. Methylation analysis of the core material indicated the presence of terminal units of glucose, galacturonic acid and glucosamine. The chemical structure of the lipid A was elucidated. It constitutes a beta-1,6-glucosamine disaccharide substituted on either side by ester and glycosidically-bond phosphate residues. The ester-bound phosphate was found to be substituted by a 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinosyl residue. The amino groups of the backbone disaccharide are N-acylated by 3-O-(14:0)14:0 and 3-O-14:0. Two hydroxyl groups of the disaccharide are esterified by 3-O-(14:0)14:0 and 3-O-14:0. The taxonomical importance of these structural details will be discussed.
TI  - Susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria to the synergistic bactericidal action of serum and polymyxin B nonapeptide.
AB  - Polymyxin B nonapeptide was able to sensitize Escherichia coli strains and strains of Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae to the bactericidal action of fresh normal human serum. The degree of sensitization varied significantly within the strains. Strains of Proteus mirabilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and N. meningitidis remained resistant.
TI  - Interspecific reconstitution of maltose transport and chemotaxis in Escherichia coli with maltose-binding protein from various enteric bacteria.
AB  - In Escherichia coli, the periplasmic maltose-binding protein (MBP), the product of the malE gene, is the primary recognition component of the transport system for maltose and maltodextrins. It is also the maltose chemoreceptor, in which capacity it interacts with the signal transducer Tar (taxis to aspartate and some repellents). In studies of the maltose system in other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, we found that MBP is produced by Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Serratia marcescens. MBP from all of these species cross-reacted with antibody against the E. coli protein and had a similar molecular weight (about 40,000). The Shigella flexneri and Proteus mirabilis strains we examined did not synthesize MBP. The isoelectric points of MBP from different species varied from the acid extreme of E. coli (4.8) to the basic extreme of E. aerogenes (8.9). All species with MBP transported maltose with high affinity, although the Vmax for K. pneumoniae was severalfold lower than that for the other species. Maltose chemotaxis was observed only in E. coli and E. aerogenes. In S. typhimurium LT2, Tar was completely inactive in maltose taxis, although it signaled normally in response to aspartate. MBP isolated from all five species could be used to reconstitute maltose transport and taxis in a delta malE strain of E. coli after permeabilization of the outer membrane with calcium.
TI  - Binding of polymyxin B nonapeptide to gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The binding of the outer membrane-disorganizing peptide polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN) to gram-negative bacteria was studied by using tritium-labeled PMBN. Smooth Salmonella typhimurium had a binding capacity of ca. 6 nmol of PMBN per mg (dry weight) of bacteria, which corresponds to ca. 1 X 10(6) to 2 X 10(6) molecules of PMBN per single cell. The binding was of relatively high affinity (Kd, 1.3 microM). The isolated outer membrane of S. typhimurium bound ca. 100 nmol of PMBN per mg of outer membrane protein (Kd, 1.1 microM), whereas the cytoplasmic membrane bound 9 to 10 times less. Other bacteria which are susceptible to the action of PMBN (Escherichia coli strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae) also bound large amounts of PMBN. The S. typhimurium pmrA mutant, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Proteus mirabilis (all known as resistant to polymyxin and PMBN) bound 3.3, 4, and 12 times less than S. typhimurium, respectively. The binding of PMBN to S. typhimurium was effectively inhibited by low concentrations of polymyxin B, compound EM49 (octapeptin), polylysine, and protamine. Spermine, Ca2+, and Mg2+ also inhibited the PMBN binding although they were ca. 160, 700, and 2,400 times less active (based on molarity) than polymyxin B, respectively. No binding inhibition was found at the tested concentrations of streptomycin, tetralysine, spermidine, or cadaverine.
TI  - Transition of deletion mutants of the composite resistance plasmid NR1 in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Derivatives of the composite R plasmid NR1 from which a portion of the resistance determinants (r-determinants) component had been deleted were found to undergo amplification of the remaining r-determinants region in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The wild-type NR1 plasmid does not amplify in these genera, although all of these plasmids undergo amplification in Proteus mirabilis. The deletion mutants retained the mercuric ion resistance operon (mer) but conferred a much lower level of sulfonamide resistance than NR1. The remaining r-determinants region, which is bounded by direct repeats of the insertion element IS1, formed multiple tandem duplications in E. coli, S. typhimurium, and P. mirabilis after subculturing the host cells in medium containing high concentrations of sulfonamide. Gene amplification was characterized by restriction endonuclease analysis, analytical buoyant density centrifugation, DNA-DNA hybridization, and sedimentation in sucrose gradients. The tandem repeats remained attached to the resistance transfer factor component of the plasmid in at least part of the plasmid population; autonomous tandem repeats of r-determinants were probably also present. Amplification did not occur in host recA mutants. Amplified strains subcultured in drug-free medium lost the amplified r-determinants. By using a strain temperature sensitive for the recA gene, it was possible to obtain gene amplification at the permissive temperature. Loss of r-determinants took place at the permissive temperature, but not at the nonpermissive temperature. The termini of the deletions of several independent mutants which conferred low sulfonamide resistance were found to be located within the adjacent streptomycin-spectinomycin resistance gene.

TI  - Determination of surface charge of some bacteria by colloid titration.
AB  - The surface charge of bacteria is always negative except below pH 2. The negative charge depends mainly upon phosphate and carboxyl groups. The charge of six kinds of bacteria was determined by colloid titration between pH 2 and 11. When there is amino group on the cell surface, it is positive as ammonium cation between pH 2 and 10, and it combines with the negative groups to neutralize the negative charge. In the presence of formalin, the colloid titration results show that the free amine is blocked by formalin, and the amino group can be estimated by the difference between the two titration results. Above pH 10, the titration results of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi in the presence of formalin implied the existence of guanidyl group. The titration results of living bacterial suspensions were quite the same as those of heat-killed ones.
TI  - Evidence for clustering of RNA polymerase and ribosomal protein genes in six species of Enterobacteria.
AB  - 32P-labelled DNA fragments from the E. coli beta operon were used as hybridisation probes for homologous DNA sequences in chromosomal digests of six species of Enterobacteria. In all species the hybridisation pattern suggested clustering of the genes comprising the beta operon.
TI  - Transferable resistance to cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefamandole and cefuroxime in clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens.
AB  - In conjugational crosses, three Klebsiella pneumoniae strains and one Serratia marcescens strain have been demonstrated to transfer resistance determinants to newer types of cephalosporins. While Klebsiella strains donated cefotaxime, cefamandole and cefuroxime resistance to Escherichia coli K-12 recipients, the genetic analysis of exconjugants after the transfer of plasmids from Serratia strains to Proteus or Salmonella recipients showed that the cefoxitin resistance determinant was also co-transferred. In subsequent transfer cycles of this plasmid, cefotaxime and cefoxitin resistance determinants segregated in contrast to the relative stability of plasmids derived from Klebsiella strains in subsequent transfer cycles. From results obtained in this study, it may be concluded that in some strains of nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae, resistance to newer cephalosporins could be transmissible and thus plasmid-located.
TI  - Sensitization of Gram-negative bacteria to antibiotics and complement by a nontoxic oligopeptide.
AB  - A major virulence factor of bacteria that cause generalized infections is their resistance to the lytic action of the complement cascade, an important defence mechanism of the host. Invasive Gram-negative enteric bacteria, which cause about one-third of all bacteraemic infections, are completely resistant to lysis by complement, even in the presence of hyperimmune serum. The same bacteria are also resistant to many antibiotics that are effective therapeutic agents against other bacteria, as the outermost surface layer (the outer membrane) of the bacteria functions as a permeability barrier. Here we show that it is possible to sensitize such bacteria to both complement and antibiotics by using an agent that binds to the outer membrane. This agent is a nontoxic derivative of polymyxin which by itself has no bactericidal action.
TI  - Activity of organophosphorus insecticides in bacterial tests for mutagenicity and DNA repair--direct alkylation versus metabolic activation and breakdown. II. O,O-dimethyl-O-(1,2-dibromo-2,2-dichloroethyl)-phosphate and two O-ether derivatives of trichlorfon.
AB  - The following organophosphates were tested for their ability to induce DNA damage in a rec-type repair test with Proteus mirabilis strains PG713 (rec- hcr-) and PG273 (wild-type) and point mutations in the his- strain TA100 of Salmonella typhimurium: O,O-dimethyl-O-(1,2-dibromo-2,2-dichloroethyl)-phosphate (NALED); trichlorfon-O-methyl ether (TCP-O-ME), O,O-dimethyl-(1-methoxy-2,2,2-trichlorethyl)-phosphonate; trichlorfon-O-methyl ether vinyl derivative (TCP-O-MEVD), O,O-dimethyl-(1-methoxy-2,2-dichlorovinyl)-phosphonate. All compounds were negative in the repair test but induced base pair substitutions in S. typhimurium. The mutagenicity of NALED is due to the direct alkylating ability of the parental molecule and to mutagenic metabolites generated by enzymatic splitting of the side chain. Glutathion-dependent enzymes in the S9-mix eliminate the mutagenic activity of NALED completely. Mutation induction by TCP-O-ME and TCP-O-MEVD is predominantly caused by the reactive O-methyl ether configuration of the side chain and is resistant to metabolic inactivation by NADPH- or glutathion-dependent enzymatic pathways in the S9-mix of mice.
TI  - R-plasmid transfer in a wastewater treatment plant.
AB  - Enteric bacteria have been examined for their ability to transfer antibiotic resistance in a wastewater treatment plant. Resistant Salmonella enteritidis, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli were isolated from clinical specimens and primary sewage effluent. Resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfadiazine, and tetracycline was demonstrated by spread plate and tube dilution techniques. Plasmid mediation of resistance was shown by ethidium bromide curing, agarose gel electrophoresis, and direct cell transfer. Each donor was mated with susceptible E. coli and Shigella sonnei. Mating pairs (and recipient controls) were suspended in unchlorinated primary effluent that had been filtered and autoclaved. Suspensions were added to membrane diffusion chambers which were then placed in the primary and secondary setting tanks of the wastewater treatment plant. Resistant recombinants were detected by replica plating nutrient agar master plates onto xylose lysine desoxycholate agar plates that contained per milliliter of medium 10 micrograms of ampicillin, 30 micrograms of chloramphenicol, 10 micrograms of streptomycin, 100 micrograms of sulfadiazine, or 30 micrograms of tetracycline. Mean transfer frequencies for laboratory matings were 2.1 X 10(-3). In situ matings for primary and secondary settling resulted in frequencies of 4.9 X 10(-5) and 7.5 X 10(-5), respectively. These values suggest that a significant level of resistance transfer occurs in wastewater treatment plants in the absence of antibiotics as selective agents.
TI  - Phages C-2 and J: IncC and IncJ plasmid-dependent phages, respectively.
AB  - Phages C-2 and J were isolated from sewage. Phage C-2 was filamentous and formed  plaques on Salmonella typhimurium strains carrying various C plasmids. It also plated on Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens strains carrying particular C plasmids, but failed to form plaques on lines of Escherichia coli K12 strains harbouring most of these plasmids, although in all cases, phage multiplication on the strains was demonstrated. No phage increase occurred in any strain which lacked a C plasmid or contained plasmids of other incompatibility groups. The phage was sensitive to chloroform and, unlike other filamentous bacterial viruses, adsorbed to shafts of conjugative pili. It had a disc-like structure at the end which attached to the pilus. Phage C-2 had a buoyant density of 1 . 30 g cm-3 and a single-stranded circular DNA genome of 3 . 0 MDal. Phage J had an hexagonal head with an inter-apical distance of 40 nm and a short noncontractile tail. It was resistant to chloroform and diethyl ether. The phage formed plaques or propagated on E. coli strains harbouring some IncC plasmids and all IncJ and IncD plasmids tested. The phage did not form plaques but propagated on P. mirabilis and Ser. marcescens strains carrying these plasmids. It did not plate or propagate on S. typhimurium strains harbouring the plasmids. The plaques were very hazy and variable in size. The phage attached sparsely, at a site which appeared to be located at the base of the tail, to sides of conjugative pili.
TI  - [Studies in vivo and in vitro on relations between Schistosoma mansoni and some enterobacteria strains].
AB  - Studies performed in vivo and in vitro, using scanning electron microscopy, on relations between Schistosoma mansoni and some enterobacteria show a strong association for certain bacterial strains (Salmonella typhimurium). Salmonellae adhesion on tegumental surface of male and mature Schistosoma is only possible in vitro owing to bacterial synthesis of strong fibres penetrating inside the worm. These interactions are not found with Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis or with young schistosomula.
TI  - Rosanilins: indicator dyes for chloramphenicol-resistant enterobacteria containing chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.
AB  - Rosanilin dyes such as crystal violet and basic fuchsin have been used as indicator dyes in solid growth medium for chloramphenicol-resistant enterobacterial colonies containing the enterobacterial resistance enzyme chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). On certain media containing rosanilins, cells containing CAT formed darker colonies than cells not containing CAT. Contrast was affected by the types and concentrations of complex nutrients, sugars salts, and rosanilin dyes present. When crystal violet was used as the indicator dye, contrast could not be obtained for strains whose growth was partially inhibited by crystal violet. Contrast could not be obtained between yeast colonies with and without the enterobacterial resistance enzyme, between Bacillus subtilis colonies with and without the staphylococcal resistance enzyme, or between enterobacterial colonies with and without the staphylococcal resistance enzyme. The darker coloration of enterobacterial colonies with the enterobacterial enzyme was due to the binding of dye to enzyme. Rosanilin dues have been used to score resistance phenotypes by colony color, to detect chloramphenicol-sensitive sectors in chloramphenicol-resistant colonies, and to screen for occasional chloramphenicol-sensitive cells in a resistant population during cloning by insertional inactivation of the chloramphenicol resistance gene.
TI  - Antibacterial action of combinations of oxytetracycline, dimethyl sulfoxide, and  EDTA-tromethamine on Proteus, Salmonella, and Aeromonas.
AB  - Antibacterial effects against Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhimurium, and Aeromonas hydrophila were obtained with subminimal inhibitory concentrations of oxytetracycline and EDTA-tromethamine. Antibacterial effects were not observed with subminimal inhibitory concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide plus oxytetracycline or with dimethyl sulfoxide plus EDTA-tromethamine. Using a 2-dimensional Microtiter checkerboard technique, inhibitory activities of the various combinations of solutions were studied, and isobolograms were plotted. A synergistic effect was seen with combinations of oxytetracycline and EDTA-tromethamine. The greatest synergistic effect was observed when the mixture was caused to react with P mirabilis. These findings were confirmed by kinetic studies of microbial death, using one-fourth minimal inhibitory concentrations of these preparations.
TI  - In vitro adherence of bacteria to prosthetic vascular grafts.
AB  - The adherence of staphylococci and Enterobacteriaceae radiolabelled with 3H-thymidine to Dacron and polytetrafluoroethylene prosthetic vascular graft materials was investigated using an in vitro method. Adherence readily occurred after a few minutes of incubation. Enterobacteriaceae adhered to Dacron in a 10-100 times greater number per mm of length than to polytetrafluoroethylene. The addition of velour to the Dacron graft further increased the number of adherent bacteria. In contrast, the adherence of coagulase-negative and positive staphylococci per mm of length was roughly the same to Dacron and polytetrafluoroethylene. The adherence of bacteria to vascular graft materials may be part of the underlying pathogenesis of vascular graft infections and differential adherence amongst various graft materials could be of clinical importance. However, in the absence of controlled clinical studies, the significance of these findings remains to be determined.

AB  
TI  - Phage t: a group T plasmid-dependent bacteriophage.
AB  - Phage t was isolated from sewage from Pretoria. It formed plaques only on Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium strains that carried plasmids belonging to incompatibility group T. Five of six group T plasmids permitted visible lysis of R+ host strains. There was no visible lysis of E. coli J53-2 or S. typhimurium LT2trpA8 carrying the T plasmid Rts1 although the strains supported phage growth as indicated by at least a 10-fold increase in phage titre. The latter strains transferred the plasmid at high frequency to E. coli strain CSH2 and the resulting transconjugants plated the phage. Proteus mirabilis strain PM5006(R402) failed to support phage growth although it transferred the plasmid and concomitant phage sensitivity to E. coli J53-2. The phage was hexagonal in outline, RNA-containing, resistant to chloroform and adsorbed to the shafts of pili determined by T plasmids.
TI  - Phage X: a plasmid-dependent, broad host range, filamentous bacterial virus.
AB  - Phage X was isolated from sewage as plating on Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium strains harbouring the incompatibility group X plasmid R6K. It also plated on a strain of Serratia marcescens carrying this plasmid. It failed to form plaques on Proteus mirabilis, P. morganii or Providencia alcalifaciens harbouring R6K, but did multiply on them. No phage increase occurred with homologous R- strains. Phage X also plated or registered an increase in titre on E. coli or S. typhimurium strains carrying various plasmids of incompatibility groups M, N, P-1, U or W as well as the unassigned plasmid R775. It adsorbed to pili determined by a group P-10 plasmid in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain but did not multiply on this organism. The phage was filamentous and curly, resistant to ribonuclease and diethyl ether and sensitive to chloroform. It adsorbed to the tips of pili.
TI  - Effects of moisture content on long-term survival and regrowth of bacteria in wastewater sludge.
AB  - The effects of moisture content on the survival and regrowth of seeded and indigenous enteric bacteria in raw sludge were determined. Cultures of six strains of fecally associated bacteria grown in sterilized, liquid sludge (5% solids) were all quite stable at this moisture level for over 90 days at 21 degrees C. When the moisture content of the sludge containing these organisms was reduced by evaporation and the samples were stored at 21 degrees C for extended periods, bacterial inactivation rates were generally proportional to the moisture losses of the samples. A dramatic reversal in this effect was observed in samples containing more than 90% solids. In this dried sludge, every bacterial species studied except Proteus mirabilis was found to be extremely stable. Bacteria indigenous to sludge were also found to survive for long periods in dried sludge. Regrowth of bacterial isolates in sterilized raw sludge was found to occur readily at 37 degrees C in samples containing less than or equal to 75% solids, but no growth was observed in samples with greater than or equal to 85% solids. Some growth, but to less than saturation densities, occurred with 80% solids. Growth of seeded Salmonella typhimurium was also found to occur in the presence of indigenous organisms in both liquid and dewatered raw sludges. However, the population density attained was well below that found in sterilized samples of the same sludges. In addition, the number of salmonellae dropped below detectable limits within a few days in sludges containing viable indigenous organisms, whereas little decrease occurred during this time with salmonellae grown in previously sterilized sludges.
TI  - Expression of E. coli genes carried by hybrids of plasmid RP4.
AB  - Hybrids of the RP4 plasmid, containing bacteriophage Mu and chromosomal genes of  Escherichia coli, were transferred into Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. The individual genes of the arginine, histidine, leucine and threonine operons were expressed in these microorganisms.
TI  - Antigenic relationships between pore proteins of Escherichia coli K12.
AB  - Antisera were raised against the purified Escherichia coli K12 outer membrane proteins ompA-, ompC- and ompF proteins and protein e. Several immunological methods were used to investigate the specificity of the antisera and the immunological relationship between the major outer membrane proteins. Although the antisera had been raised against highly purified proteins, several of them contained activity against lipopolysaccharide and lipoprotein due to minor impurities in the immunogens. The three general porins ompF protein, ompC protein and protein e were shown to be cross-reactive. Anti-(ompA protein) serum only reacted with the homologous protein. None of these antisera reacted with the phage lambda receptor protein or with protein III. Pore protein preparations isolated from Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter cloaceae and Proteus mirabilis were found to be structurally related to the E. coli K12 porins as they reacted with the antisera raised against E. coli K12 porins.
TI  - Comparative studies on the regulation of tryptophan synthesis.
AB  - In vitro DNA recombination techniques have revolutionized the study of genetic control of biosynthetic pathways. Using examples drawn from the pathway of tryptophan synthesis, approaches to the deciphering of regulatory signals and response mechanisms through transposition of DNA segments and DNA sequence analysis will be presented. After reviewing the known chromosomal arrangements and regulatory patterns of trp genes in the bacterial groups studied so far, and describing the results of transferring all or part of the pathway's genes from one organism to a distantly related one, the use of this technique to analyze new organisms will be described. Along with some advantages over the conventional methods there are some pitfalls. Finally, since it is likely that events analogous to recombinant DNA experiments take place readily in nature, their consequences in studies of bacterial evolution will be conjectured.
TI  - Effects of subminimal inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics in experimental infections.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of subminimal inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of antibiotics were studied in two animal models. In mice, the oral cephalosporin CGP 9000 was effective in 11 of 20 different gram-negative infections and cephalexin was effective in one of these infections, both at 50% effective doses (ED(50)) that produced peak concentrations of drug in plasms equal to one-half to one-sixteenth the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the infecting organism. In gram-positive infections, both antibiotics were effective only at concentrations above the MIC. In rabbits, sub-MICs of cephaloridine, ampicillin, and gantamicin were maintained for 6-10 hr by intravenous infusion. At steady-state concentrations equal to one half to one-eighth the MIC, the beta-lactam antibiotics caused elongation and filamentation, and gentamicin caused enlargement, of Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhimurium in peritoneal exudate; the number of viable cells of each of these bacteria was temporarily reduced. In infections with E. coli and P. mirabilis, sub-MIC's of beta-lactam antibiotics and of gentamicin prolonged the survival rates for infected animals beyond those for control animals. Rabbits infected with S. typhimurium and treated with ampicillin at a concentration of one-third the MIC Tended to die sooner than did control animals.
TI  - Effect of serum and blood on Enterobacteriaceae grown in the presence of subminimal inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin and mecillinam.
AB  - Bacteria from the strains of five species of Enterobacteriaceae grown in the presence of subminimal inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin or mecillinam formed into filamentous or round cells. These filamentous and round cells as well as normal control bacteria were incubated with either fresh human serum or blood, the bactericidal effects of which were then determined. In most cases, the bactericidal effect of either serum or blood on filamentous or round cells was less than the effect on control cells. In some cases, the effect on these drug-exposed cells was similar to that on control cells, but in no instance was the effect greater for the drug-exposed cells than for the control cells. However, in all cases in which the bactericidal effect of either serum or blood on the control cells was greater than or equal to 99%, the bactericidal effect on the drug-exposed cells was close to 90%. Although drug-exposed cells were not much more resistant to the bactericidal effect of serum or blood than were normal bacteria, they clearly were not more susceptible to these effects.

TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefamandole in vitro.
AB  - Cefamandole, a new cephalosporin derivative, was found to have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against a cross-section of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated clinically. Gram-positive cocci, except for Streptococcus faecalis, were extremely susceptible to cefamandole; penicillin G-resistant Staphylococcus aureus also was highly susceptible. Minimal bactericidal concentrations for gram-positive cocci approximated the minimal inhibitory concentrations. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae were very susceptible to the drug. Most strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and Proteus species were inhibited by low concentrations of cefamandole, Salmonella typhi, including ampicillin- and chloramphenicol-resistant strains, was inhibited by low concentrations of cefamandole. Susceptible bacteria became increasingly resistant as the inoculum size was increased. Strains of Pseudomonas were resistant to cefamandole.

TI  - Comparative studies of RNA polymerase subunits from various bacteria.
AB  - The molecular structure of RNA polymerases from Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella anatum,serratia marcescens, Aerobacter aerogens, Proteus mirabilis and Bacillus subtilis were compared based on:i) inhibition of the enzyme activity by treatment with antibodies against E. coli RNA polymerase subunits;ii) analysis of antibody precipitates by sodium ododecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and iii) analysis of antibody precipitates by urea-isoelectrofocusing followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-slab gel electrophoresis in the second dimension. All the bacterial RNA polymerases examined cross-react equally with anti-E. COLI HOLOPOLYMERASE BUT EXHIbit different extents of cross-reaction with antibodies against individual subunits. Except for B. subtilis RNA polymerase, the molecular weight and isoelectric point of the enzyme subunits are close to those of E. coli polymerase. However, minor difference were found at least within the resolution of the techniques employed:S. anatum polymerase has sigma subunit larger than E. coli sigma subunit; P. mirabilis enzyme has sigma subunit larger in size and more acidic in charge, and alpha subunit smaller and more basic than corresponding E. coli subunits. The electrophoretic map of B. subtilis enzyme subunits is completely different from that of E. coli enzyme.
TI  - Conservation of transfer ribonucleic acid and 5S ribonucleic acid cistrons in Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The genes for tranfer ribonucleic acid (tDNA) and 5S ribonucleic acid (5SDNA) were isolated from the total deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of Escherichia coli. The relatedness of tDNA and 5S from E. coli and other species of Enterobacteriaceae was determined by reassociation of the isolated genes labeled with 32PO4 to unlabeled, unfractionated DNA. Double-stranded DNA was separated from unreacted DNA by hydroxyapatite chromatography. Thermal elution profiles were done to determine the amount of unpaired bases present in related DNA sequences. Relative to total DNA, both 5S DNA and tDNA were highly conserved throughout the Enterobacteriaceae, including the genera Yersinia and Proteus.
TI  - R plasmids coding for gentamicin, tobramycin, and carbenicillin resistance in Serratia, Klebsiella and Escherichia coli strains from a single clinical source.
AB  - Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella sp. and Escherichia coli strains bearing transferable resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics, namely, gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, lividomycin, and carbenicillin, as well as to a series of more classical drugs, began to emerge in materials from the Frankfurt University Hospital. Plasmids from Serratia, Klebsiella, and E. coli exhibit a broad host range in that they are transferable to E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium receipients. They are not transferable to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although in that species plasmids of gentamicin and tobramycin resistance, was well as of resistance to further drugs, were detected in that area as early as in 1973. High-level carbenicillinase has been identified in Serratia and Klebsiella plasmids associated with drug resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics.
TI  - Diploidy for a structural gene specifying a major protein of the outer cell envelope membrane from Escherichia coli K-12.
AB  - Homogenotes, heterogenotes, and intergeneric hybrids have been studied that are diploid for the structural gene of a major outer cell envelope membrane protein (protein II) from Escherichia coli. This protein can act as a phage receptor. In wild-type homogenotes, diploidy for the gene did not cause a gene dosage effect. It could be shown with two heterogenotes that both the chromosomal mutant and the episomal wild-type genes are expressed, and in each case more of the mutant than the wild-type protein species was found in the cell envelope. In on case of 21 phage-resistant mutants missing protein II was a trans effect observed of the mutant gene on the expression of the episomal wild type gene. Transfer of E. coli episomes carrying the protein II structural gene into Salmonella typhimurium and Proteus mirabilis resulted in intergeneric hybrids that became sensitive to the relevant phage and harbored the E. coli protein II in their cell envelopes. The results may be taken as suggestive evidence for a simple feedback mechanism for the regulation of synthesis of protein II, and they show that there are no highly specific requirements on protein primary structure for incorporation into an outer cell envelope membrane.
TI  - Purification and properties of the alpha2beta2 complex of tryptophan synthetase of Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - A procedure is described for the purification of the tryptophan synthetase alpha2beta2 complex from cell extracts of Proteus mirabilis. A 30-fold purification was achieved with an overall yield of about 23% and a specific activity of 1,600. The complex can be dissociated and the subunits isolated in a pure form. The complex can be reconstituted from the isolated subunits to regain the initial activity. The alpha and beta2 subunits of the tryptophan synthetase complex of P. mirabilis are not significantly different from those of Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria as to their physical properties, amino acid compositions, and enzymic properties. Complementation studies indicate that the alpha subunit of P. mirabilis hybridizes well with the beta2 subunit from E. coli. Similarly, the beta2 subunit of P. mirabilis readily complexes with the alpha subunits from E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Serratia marcescens. The hybrids formed are all effective in catalyzing the conversion of indoleglycerol phosphate plus serine into tryptophan and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. However, these hybrids have reduced or no activity in the other reactions, namely, the condensation of indole and serine to form tryptophan or the aldolytic cleavage of indoleglycerol phosphate.
TI  - Tryptophan operon regulation in interspecific hybrids of enteric bacteria.
AB  - We examined tryptophan regulation in merodiploid hybrids in which a plasmid carrying the trp operon of Escherichia was introduced into Trp mutants of other enteric genera, or in which a plasmid carrying the trpR+ (repressor) gene of E. coli was transfered into fully constitutive trpR mutants of other genera. In these hybrids the trp operon of one species is controlled by the repressor of a different species. Similar investigations were possible in transduction hybrids in which either the trp operon or the trpR+ locus of Shigella dysenteriae was introduced into E. coli. Our measurements of trp enzymes levels in repressed and nonrepressed cells indicate that Trp regulation is normal, with only minor quantitative variations, in hybrids between E coli and Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Proteus mirabilis. Our results support the idea that a repressor-operator mechanism for regulating trp messenger ribonucleic acid production evolved in a common ancestor of the enteric bacteria, and that this repressor-operator recognition has been conversed during the evolutionary divergence of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Derivation and properties of F-prime factors in Escherichia coli carrying nitrogen fixation genes from Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - A His+ Nif+ Escherichia coli K12, Hfr strain (UNF43) was constructed by an intergeneric mating between a Klebsiella pneumoniae donor strain (HF3) and a his-HFR E. coli strain (SBI824) which transfers his as an early marker. An F-prime nif plasmid, FN39, carrying genes which correspond to the E. coli chromosomal region, metG gnd his shiA, but excluding purF and aroD, was isolated from UNF43. Translocation of carbenicillin resistance genes from a P-type R-factor, R68, to FN39 increased the stability of his and nif on the derivative F-prime, FN68. Sedimentation analysis of both F-primes in sucrose gradients revealed our covalently closed circular(CCC) DNA species of molecular weights 279 +/- 9, 136 +/- 3, 90 +/- 1 and 44 +/- 1 megadaltons. It is suggested that the two smallest CCC-DNA species are component replicons of the composite F-primes of molecular weight 136 +/- 3 megadaltons, and that the molecules of 279 +/- 9 megadaltons are CCC-dimers. FN68 was transferable in intergeneric matings to Klebsiella aerogenes, K. pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium but not to Proteus mirabilis; only carbenicillin resistance and sex factor activity were transferred to Erwinia herbicola. nif genes on FN68 were expressed in a Nif- mutant of K. pneumoniae and also in S. typhimurium, which in conventional tests is naturally non-nitrogen-fixing; expression of the his determinant of FN68 became temperature-sensitive in S. typhimurium.
TI  - Beta-lactam antibiotics with N-oxide side chains. 1. Quinoxaline N-oxides.
AB  - A series of penicillin derivatives of quinoxaline di-N-oxide carboxylic acids was prepared. These compounds were prepared from the acid chlorides and mixed anhydrides of the quinoxaline di-N-oxides. The compounds prepared exhibited minimal antibacterial activity against gram-negative organisms.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of antibiotics in human bile (author's transl)].
AB  - Marked differences exist between antibacterial activity in human bile and broth.  Whereas penicillins and cephalosporines exhibit virtually the same activity in broth and bile, tetracycline shows a great lose, and the activity of the aminoglykosides is increased in bile. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of chlorampenicol and co-trimoxazole are also different in broth and human bile. The differences in activity are related to the pH although not all deviations can be attributed to the effect of the pH. These results should be considered when treating gallbladder infections.
TI  - Microbial formation of nitrosopyrrolidine from nitrosoproline.
AB  - The fate of orally administered NPro was determined in rats. Unchanged NPro could be recovered in the urine, while NPy was detected in the faeces of two of three rats tested. After successive administration of NPro to the same rats, their intestinal contents were inoculated into media containing NPro to test for NPy formation. Decarboxylation of NPro occurred in the faeces cultures from those rats whose faeces had contained NPy. When the faeces from 10 mice were inoculated into the NPro media, all gave negative reactions for NPro decarboxylation. However, when the faeces of eight rats and those of 15 rabbits were tested, two rats and one rabbit exhibited NPy formation. L-Pro and NPro decarboxylase reactions were tested on 24 strains of bacteria and three strains each of E. coli and Proteus mirabilis isolated from rat intestines. It was found that seven bacteria gave a positive reaction with L-pro decarboxylation, while only two species, both belonging to Pseudomonas, could decarboxylate NPro.
TI  - Abnormal forms of bacteria produced by antibiotics.
AB  - Subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics can produce in vitro aberrant forms of bacteria that are similar to those observed in specimens and cultures from patients being treated with antibacterial agents. Eight species of bacteria were grown on membranes placed on agar containing subinhibitory concentrations of nine antibiotics. The resulting organisms were examined by Gram stain and electron microscopy. Gram stains showed filamentous and granular forms of enterobacteria with bipolar staining, giant staphylococci, and rodlike pneumococci. Electron micrographs showed changes in the number and distribution of ribosomes in enterobacteria and septum abnormalities in cocci. Such abnormal forms can occasionally simulate the appearance of quite different species, and they may indicate the presence of a subinhibitory antibiotic concentration at the site of infection as a result of prior antibacterial therapy.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial evaluation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid esters, carbonitriles, and carboxamides.
AB  - A series of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid esters,  carbonitriles, and carboxamides (2a-k) was synthesized and initially evaluated (dose range 50-400 mg/kg) in mice infected with Escherichia coli. Only two derivatives, the ethyl and butyl esters of 1-ethyl-1,2-dihydro-4-hydroxy-7-methyl-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid, protected the animals against E. coli and several other gram-negative bacterial pathogenic infections. A pro-drug type of mechanism appears to be operable since neither agent showed in vitro activity.

TI  - Systematic difference in the methylation of ribosomal ribonucleic acid from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A survey of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was performed to compare the distributionof N6-methylated adenine. It was found that (i) all the gram-positive strains tested, Staphylococcus aureus, Sarcina lutea, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus megaterium, contain neither N6-monomethyl adenine (m6A) nor N6-dimethyladenine (m26A) in 23S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA). In the case of S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, strains which are clinically resistant to erythromycin contain m26A. (ii) The gram-negative strains Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6A but not m23A in 23S rRNA. These observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. Because of the demonstrated relationship between N6-dimethylation of adenine in 23S rRNA and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed systematic differences found in rRNA methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.
TI  - 3-Substituted 2-formylquinoxaline 1,4-dioxides.
AB  - The methylnitrone of 3-methyl-1,4-dioxidoquinoxaline-2-carboxaldehyde (1) has been exceptional antibacterial activity in vivo. Derivatives of 3-hydroxymethyl-1,4-dioxidoquinoxaline-2-carboxaldehyde and 3-acetoxymethyl-1,4-dioxidoquinoxaline-2-carboxaldehyde were prepared. Several of these compounds were found to be antibacterial agents of the same order of activity as I.
TI  - Substituted 1-[(5-nitrofurfurylidene)amino]-4-imidazolin-2-ones.
AB  - A series of 1-[(5-nitrofurfurylidene)amino]-4-imidazolin-2-ones has been prepared. A new synthesis of 4-alkyl-1-[(5-nitrofurfurylidene)amino]-4-imidazolin-2-ones involving the oxidative ring closure of 5-nitro-2-furaldehyde 2-(2-hydroxyethylalkyl)semicarbazones is described. The in vitro testing of the compounds against a variety of bacteria is reported.
TI  - In-vitro effect of edta-tris-lysozyme solutions on selected pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro effect of EDTA-Tris-lysozyme solution on 16 pathogenic bacteria of medical or veterinary importance was determined. Marked decreases in bacterial count occurred with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Moraxella osloensis and Campylobacter fetus, and smaller decreses with Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella boydii, Aeromonas hydrophila, proteus mirabilis, Listeria monocytogenes and Erysipelothrix insidiosa. The test solution had no effect on Klebsiella ozaenae, Brucella canis, Cornynebacterium pyogenes, Coryne, renale, Streptococcus equi and staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Existence of a free form of a specific membrane lipoprotein in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The existence of a free form of a specific lipoprotein of molecular weight 7,200  was examined in the envelopes of several gram-negative bacteria. When the envelope proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, distinct peaks were observed in Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at the same position as the free form of the lipoprotein of Escherichia coli. However, the peak was not observed in Proteus mirabilis. The protein at the peak in S. typhimurium was shown to contain little or no histidine as expected from the amino acid composition of the lipoprotein. Furthermore, antiserum against the highly purified lipoprotein from E. coli was shown to react with the proteins from S. typhimurium and S. marcescens and to form the specific immunoprecipitates. In contrast, the protein from P. aeruginosa did not react with the antiserum at all. Thus, it is concluded that S. typhimurium and S. marcescens have the free form of the lipoprotein in their envelopes as does E. coli. P. aeruginosa contains a protein of the same size as the lipoprotein, but it is not certain whether the protein is the same structural protein as the lipoprotein from E. coli. P. mirabilis may not have any free form of the lipoprotein, may have it in a very small amount, or may have a lipoprotein of different molecular weight serving the same function.

TI  - Characteristics of PRD1, a plasmid-dependent broad host range DNA bacteriophage.
AB  - Several distinctive properties of PRD1, an icosahedral plasmid-dependent phage, are described. The drug-resistance plasmid-dependent host range of PRD1 extends beyond the P incompatibility group and includes gram-negative bacteria containing plasmids of incompatibility groups N and W. PRD1 phage will infect pseudomonads and Enterobacteriaceae containing either a P or W incompatibility group plasmid. PRD1 adsorbs to the cell wall of R(+) bacteria and thus its infectivity indicates cell wall alterations by these drug-resistance plasmid groups. PRD1 nucleic acid is duplex DNA with an estimated molecular weight of 24 x 10(6). The appearance of PRD1 in electron micrographs is suggestive of lipid content in addition to its buoyant density of 1.348 in CsCl and its sensitivity to chloroform. The latent period of PRD1 varies with the R(+) host bacterial strain used for growth of the phage.

AB  - The enzymatic and molecular properties of 14 oxacillin-hydrolyzing beta-lactamases, all of them R-factor-specified, were studied, and two distinct groups were found. Four of the enzymes had a molecular weight of 24,000, were active against methicillin, and had an electrophoretic mobility of -0.1 cm/h. Eight enzymes had a molecular weight of 45,000, low activity against methicillin, and an electrophoretic mobility of +0.5 cm/h. The remaining two enzymes were similar to those of the second group in being relatively inactive against methicillin, but their molecular weight was lower (42,000) and their electrophoretic mobility was different (-0.1 cm/h). All the enzymes of both groups were sensitive to inhibition by sodium chloride. The two groups were not completely homogeneous in their enzymatic properties; seven possible subtypes could be recognized.
TI  - R-mediated beta-lactamases and episomal resistance to the beta-lactam drugs in different bacterial hosts.
AB  - Ten penicillinase plasmids of varying taxonomic origin were studied after transfer to a variety of bacterial hosts. Nine of the ten plasmids specified enzymes with the following identical, or very similar, properties: substrate profile, molecular weight, susceptibility to heat and inhibitors, and electrophoretic mobility, i.e., TEM-like enzymes. The tenth R-mediated beta-lactamase was a cephalosporinase. Plasmids with TEM-like enzymes mediated resistance patterns identical towards the beta-lactam drugs, whereas the resistance pattern of the cephalosporinase plasmid was distinctly different. Expression of enzyme and resistance had a dual R-factor and host specificity. Escherichia coli K-12 and Salmonella typhi constituted one group of the same R-factor phenotype expressions. Most, but not all, penicillinase plasmids exhibited in Proteus PM1 a considerably lower order of beta-lactamase activity and an even lower order of resistance to the beta-lactam drugs than the previous two hosts. This difference was most pronounced for the resistance to carbenicillin, which was mediated by the plasmids specifying the synthesis of TEM-like enzymes. Release by osmotic shock was complete in the host E. coli K-12 for the TEM-like enzymes, but was lower for the cephalosporinase and minimal or negative in the PM1 host. Crypticity factor for benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, and carbenicillin was not related to the increase in resistance mediated by the penicillinase plasmids in both K-12 and PM1 hosts. Inoculum size effects for the penicillins and 6-aminopenicillanic acid were higher in PM1 than in K-12 R(+) cultures. The expression of penicillinase plasmids in wild-type bacteria was strain specific and not species specific. For two plasmids of different phenotypes for beta-lactamase activity (and resistance) in K-12 and PM1 hosts, a positive correlation was found between their phenotype and the relative amount of episomal deoxyribonucleic acid, as detected by ethidium bromide density gradient centrifugation. This is interpreted as indicating differences in the mode of replication of the plasmids in the two hosts.
TI  - Round of replication mutant of a drug resistance factor.
AB  - A derivative of the R factor NR1 (called R12) has been isolated which undergoes an increased number of rounds of replication each division cycle in Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhimurium. The alteration resulting in the increased number of copies (round of replication mutation) is associated with the transfer factor component of the R factor. R12 has the same drug resistance pattern as NR1, is the same size as shown by sedimentation in a sucrose gradient and electron microscopy (63 x 10(6) daltons), and has the same partial denaturation map. The level of the R factor gene product chloramphenicol acetyltransferase has been examined in P. mirabilis and was found to be consistent with gene dosage effects. The plasmid to chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid ratio of NR1 increases several fold after entry into stationary phase, whereas this ratio for R12 remains approximately constant. Individual copies of R12 are selected at random for replication from a multicopy plasmid pool. A smaller percentage of R12 copies replicate during amino acid starvation than has previously been found for NR1 in similar experiments.

AB  - A partial amino-acid sequence of Bacillus subtilis 168 flagellin is presented. The region of unassigned sequence in this 304-residue polypeptide chain spans residues 158-173. Comparison of the 27-residue aminoterminal CNBr peptide of B. subtilis 168 flagellin with that derived from the flagellin of the serologically unrelated strain of B. subtilis, W23, shows only three conservative substitutions, whereas the 16-residue carboxyl-terminal peptides derived from these flagellins were identical. The comparison of the very limited sequence information available on the flagellins of Salmonella and Proteus with that on B. subtilis indicates homology between these proteins.

TI  - Elevated temperature technique for the isolation of salmonellas from sewage and human faeces.
AB  - Modified Moore's swabs, placed in sewers for 5 days, were used to concentrate salmonellas from sewage. Duplicate cultures of swab strips in selenite broth were incubated at 41 and 37 degrees C. respectively. Salmonella organisms were recovered consistently from the swabs when the enrichment broths were incubated at 41 degrees C. However, when equal portions of the same swabs were incubated at 37 degrees C., only 22% of them yielded Salmonella organisms. These results indicate an advantage in incubating the selenite broths at 41 degrees C. rather than 37 degrees C. in attempting to isolate salmonellas from sewage.One hundred and fifty faecal samples were examined for salmonellas by culture in selenite broths incubated at 41 and 37 degrees C. Twelve (8%) samples were positive at 41 degrees C. compared to only 10 (6.7%) positive samples at 37 degrees C. This difference is not statistically significant to indicate an advantage of the elevated-temperature of incubation over the conventional temperature in attempting to isolate salmonellas from human faeces. Moreover, results of the recovery rates of S. paratyphi B, S. typhi, and S. typhimurium indicate that an incubation temperature of 37 degrees C. is more appropriate for recovering salmonellas from artificially infected faecal samples than an incubation temperature of 41 degrees C. This stresses the inability of laboratory studies to mimic conditions in nature.

TI  - Epicillin: experimental chemotherapy, pharmacodynamics, and susceptibility testing.
AB  - Epicillin exhibits excellent therapeutic activity when administered orally or subcutaneously to mice infected with a variety of pathogenic bacteria. These included single strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, non-penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella schottmuelleri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, strains of microorganisms selected as typical of those that frequently cause serious clinical infections. In oral chemotherapeutic comparisons of tetracycline, chloramphenicol, cephalexin, ampicillin, and epicillin, the latter, with but minor exceptions, exhibited activity comparable to that of most of the other antibiotics studied. Oral administration to mice of a loading dose of epicillin or ampicillin resulted in similar peak blood levels and decay curves. The concentration in urine and the excretion rates were significantly higher in epicillin than in ampicillin-treated animals. Presumptive evidence suggests that the inter-pretation of zone diameters obtained with 10-mug epicillin discs should be the same as is used for 10-mug ampicillin discs.
TI  - Comparative study of isoenzyme formation of bacterial beta-galactosidase.
AB  - The enzyme beta-galactosidase was studied in crude extracts of Escherichia coli 3300, E. coli grown on a selenium and sulfur medium, Salmonella typhimurium F-lac, Serratia marcescens F-lac, S. marcescens P-lac, Proteus mirabilis F-lac, P. mirabilis P-lac, Aeromonas formicans, and Streptococcus lactis. The isoenzymes could be demonstrated by an alternative histochemical technique. Different isoenzyme patterns were found to be determined by the beta-galactosidase structural gene and not by the cytoplasm within which the beta-galactosidase was formed. In addition, the beta-galactosidases from strains which form isoenzymes were more stable to heat and urea treatments than the enzyme formed by those organisms which produce reduced amounts of, or no, isoenzyme.
TI  - Nature of lactose-fermenting Salmonella strains obtained from clinical sources.
AB  - Six of seven lactose-fermenting (lac(+)) Salmonella strains obtained from clinical sources were found to be capable of transferring the lac(+) property by conjugation to Salmonella typhosa WR4204. All of the six S. typhosa strains which received the lac(+) property transferred it in turn to S. typhimurium WR5000 at the high frequencies typical of extrachromosomal F-merogenotes. These six lac elements were also transmissible from S. typhosa WR4204 to Proteus mirabilis and to some strains of Escherichia coli K-12; moreover, they were capable of promoting low frequency transfer of chromosomal genes from S. typhimurium WR5000 to S. typhosa WR4204. One of these lac elements was shown also to be capable of promoting low frequency chromosome transfer in E. coli K-12. E. coli K-12 strains harboring these lac elements exhibited sensitivity to the male specific phage R-17. Sensitivity to R-17 was not detected in Salmonella strains containing the elements. Examination of the lac elements in P. mirabilis by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation showed that each element had a guanine plus cytosine content of 50%. The sizes of the elements varied from 0.8 to 3% of the total Proteus deoxyribonucleic acid. The amount of beta-galactosidase produced by induced and uninduced cultures of S. typhimurium WR5000 and S. typhosa WR4204 containing the lac elements was lower than that produced by these strains with the F-lac episome. The heat sensitivity of beta-galactosidase produced by the lac elements in their original Salmonella hosts indicated that the enzyme made by these strains differs from E. coli beta-galactosidase.
TI  - Polynucleotide sequence relationships among members of Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Polynucleotide relationships were examined among many representatives of the Enterobacteriaceae by means of agar, membrane filter, and hydroxyapatite procedures. The amount of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that reassociated was dependent, especially in interspecific reactions, on the annealing temperature. In only three cases: Escherichia coli-Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium-S. typhi, and Proteus mirabilis-P. vulgaris, was relative interspecific duplex formation 80% or higher. In most cases interspecies DNA duplex formation was 40% or less of that obtained from intraspecies DNA reassociation reactions. The stability of E. coli-S. flexneri DNA duplexes formed at either 60 or 75 C was virtually identical to that of homologous E. coli DNA duplexes, and the degree of interspecies duplex formation was minimally affected by the temperature increase (86% at 60 C; 77% at 75 C). The thermal stability of DNA duplexes formed at 60 C between DNA from E. coli and DNA from strains of Aerobacter aerogenes, S. typhimurium, S. typhi, and P. mirabilis was about 12 to 14 C below that of reassociated E. coli DNA. At 75 C, the formation of the interspecific DNA duplexes was markedly decreased, but the stability of the DNA able to reassociate at this temperature approximated that of reassociated E. coli DNA. The degree of reassociation and the thermal stability of E. coli-S. flexneri DNA duplexes suggests relatively little evolutionary divergence in these organisms. The other enterobacteria tested, however, have diverged to a point where less than one-half of their DNA can reanneal with E. coli DNA at 60 C and less than 10% reacts at 75 C. The degree of divergence between various enterobacteria does not appear to be uniform along the DNA molecule. Ribosomal ribonucleic acid (RNA)-specific sequences are conserved among most enterobacteria. An examination of messenger RNA relatively specific for the lactose operon suggests that specific chromosomal genes may diverge more or less than the genome as a whole.
TI  - Bacterial interference induced in embryonated eggs by staphylococci.
AB  - Studies of experimental infections in embryonated eggs demonstrated that prior allantoic infection with avirulent staphylococci afforded significant protection against subsequent challenge with virulent strains. All strains of coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci tested that were relatively avirulent for embryonated eggs were capable of producing interference. The interference induced afforded protection not only against challenge with virulent staphylococci, but also against Diplococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and one strain of influenza virus (A(2)J 305). Prior allantoic infection with avirulent staphylococci also protected against intravenous as well as allantoic infection with challenge strains.Interference required infection with viable bacteria. The onset of interference appeared within a few minutes after injection of the interfering strain, but was not maximal until 24 hours had elapsed between injection of the interfering and challenge strains. The protection afforded by the production of interference could not be overcome by increased inoculum size of the challenge strain and extended even to challenge with 10(9) bacteria. Studies of in vitro and in vivo growth of challenge strains in allantoic fluid demonstrated that some interfering strains inhibited growth of the challenge strains. Other strains produced interference without producing prolonged inhibition of the growth of challenge strains. Similarly, interference could not be attributed to attenuated virulence of the challenge organisms. All interfering strains studied produced enhanced bactericidal activity of whole blood from the affected embryos, but whether this affected leukocyte activity, opsonization, or other host defense mechanisms has yet to be determined.
TI  - TRANSFER OF EPISOMIC ELEMENTS TO PROTEUS. II. NATURE OF LAC+ PROTEUS STRAINS ISOLATED FROM CLINICAL SPECIMENS.
AB  - Falkow, Stanley (Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Washington, D.C.), J. A. Wohlhieter, R. V. Citarella, and L. S. Baron. Transfer of episomic elements to Proteus. II. Nature of lac(+)Proteus strains isolated from clinical specimens. J. Bacteriol. 88:1598-1601. 1964.-Strains of Proteus mirabilis exhibiting the unusual property of utilizing lactose (lac(+)) have been reported in clinical material. A genetic examination discloses that the lac(+) determinants in these Proteus strains are associated with an infectious element, P, which is distinct from the sex factor of Escherichia coli K-12. The composite genetic element, P-lac, is readily transmissible to other enteric species and possesses properties which conform to those of an episomic element of the transfer variety. CsCl density-gradient studies of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extracted from lac(+)P. mirabilis indicate that the P-lac(+) element did not arise in this species, but was acquired from an organism possessing a markedly different DNA base composition.
