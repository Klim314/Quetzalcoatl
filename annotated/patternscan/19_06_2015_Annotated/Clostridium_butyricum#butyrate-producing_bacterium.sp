TI  == induction of peroxisomes by butyrate-producing probiotics.
AB  == we previously found that peroxisomal biogenesis factor 11a (pex11a) deficiency is associated with a reduction in peroxisome abundance and impaired fatty acid metabolism in hepatocytes, and results in steatosis. in the present study, we investigated whether butyrate induces pex11a expression and peroxisome proliferation, and studied its effect on lipid metabolism. c57bl/6 mice fed standard chow or a high-fat diet (hfd) were treated with tributyrin, 4-phelybutyrate acid (4-pba), or the butyrate-producing probiotics (clostridium butyricum miyairi 588 [cbm]) plus inulin (dietary fiber), and the body weight, white adipose tissue, serum triglycerides, mrna expression, and peroxisome abundance were evaluated. tributyrin or 4-pba treatment significantly decreased body weight and increased hepatic mrna expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (pparalpha) and pex11a. in addition, 4-pba  treatment increased peroxisome abundance and the expression of genes involved in  peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation (acyl-coenzyme a oxidase 1 and hydroxysteroid [17-beta] dehydrogenase 4). cbm and inulin administration reduced  adipose tissue mass and serum triglycerides, induced pex11a, acyl-coenzyme a oxidase 1, and hydroxysteroid (17-beta) dehydrogenase 4 genes, and increased peroxisome abundance in mice fed standard chow or an hfd. in conclusion, elevation of butyrate availability (directly through administration of butyrate or indirectly via administration of butyrate-producing probiotics plus fiber) induces pparalpha and pex11a and the genes involved in peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation, increases peroxisome abundance, and improves lipid metabolism. these results may provide a new therapeutic strategy against hyperlipidemia and obesity.

TI  == a gene-targeted approach to investigate the intestinal butyrate-producing bacterial community.
AB  == background: butyrate, which is produced by the human microbiome, is essential for a well-functioning colon. bacteria that produce butyrate are phylogenetically diverse, which hinders their accurate detection based on conventional phylogenetic markers. as a result, reliable information on this important bacterial group is often lacking in microbiome research. results: in this study we describe a gene-targeted approach for 454 pyrotag sequencing and quantitative  polymerase chain reaction for the final genes in the two primary bacterial butyrate synthesis pathways, butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase (but) and butyrate kinase (buk). we monitored the establishment and early succession of butyrate-producing communities in four patients with ulcerative colitis who underwent a colectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis and compared it with three control samples from healthy colons. all patients established an abundant butyrate-producing community (approximately 5% to 26% of the total community) in  the pouch within the 2-month study, but patterns were distinctive among individuals. only one patient harbored a community profile similar to the healthy controls, in which there was a predominance of but genes that are similar to reference genes from acidaminococcus sp., eubacterium sp., faecalibacterium prausnitzii and roseburia sp., and an almost complete absence of buk genes. two patients were greatly enriched in buk genes similar to those of clostridium butyricum and c. perfringens, whereas a fourth patient displayed abundant communities containing both genes. most butyrate producers identified in previous studies were detected and the general patterns of taxa found were supported by 16s rrna gene pyrotag analysis, but the gene-targeted approach provided more detail about the potential butyrate-producing members of the community. conclusions: the presented approach provides quantitative and genotypic insights  into butyrate-producing communities and facilitates a more specific functional characterization of the intestinal microbiome. furthermore, our analysis refines  but and buk reference annotations found in central databases.

TI  == fermentation rs3 derived from sago and rice starch with clostridium butyricum bcc b2571 or eubacterium rectale dsm 17629.
AB  == resistant starch type 3 (rs3) is retrograded starch which is not digested by human starch degrading enzyme, and will thus undergo bacterial degradation in the colon. the main fermentation products are the short chain fatty acid (scfa): acetate, propionate and butyrate. scfa has significant benefit impact on the metabolism of the host. the objectives of this research were to study the scfa profile produced by colonic butyrate producing bacteria grown in medium containing rs3. rs3 was made from sago or rice starch treated with amylase, pullulanase and the combination of amylase and pullulanase. fermentation study was performed by using clostridium butyricum bcc b2571 or eubacterium rectale dsm 17629, which has been identified as capable of degradation of starch residue and  also regarded as beneficial bacteria. experimental result revealed that enzyme hydrolysis of retrograded sago or rice starch was beneficial to rs formation. rs3 derived from sago contained higher rs (31-38%) than those derived from rice starch (21-26%). this study indicated that c. butyricum bcc b2571 produced acetate, propionate and butyrate at molar ratio of 1.8 : 1 : 1, when the medium was supplemented with rssa at concentration 1%. in the medium containing similar  substrate, e. rectale dsm 17629 produced acetate, propionate and butyrate at molar ratio of 1.7 : 1 : 1.2. high levels of acetate, propionate and butyrate at  molar ratio of 1.8 : 1 : 1.1 was also produced by e. rectale dsm 17629 in medium  supplemented with rssp at concentration 1%. the results showed that both bacteria responded differently to the rs3 supplementation. such result provided insight into the possibility of designing rs3 as prebiotic with featured regarding scfa released in the human colon with potential health implication.
