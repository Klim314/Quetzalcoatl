TI  - Uncultivated bacteria as etiologic agents of intra-amniotic inflammation leading  to preterm birth.
AB  - Intra-amniotic infection and inflammation are major causes of preterm birth (PTB). However, intra-amniotic inflammation is often detected in the absence of infection. This may partly be due to the culturing methods employed in hospital laboratories, which are unable to detect the uncultivated species. In this study, intra-amniotic microbial infections associated with PTB were examined by both culture and 16S rRNA-based culture-independent methods and were corroborated by the presence of intra-amniotic inflammation. Amniotic fluid (AF) specimens from 46 pregnancies complicated by PTB and 16 asymptomatic women were analyzed. No bacterial DNA was amplified in AF collected from the asymptomatic women. Among the 46 samples associated with PTB, bacterial DNA was amplified from all (16/16) of the culture-positive samples and 17% (5/30) of the culture-negative samples. In the culture-positive group, additional species were detected in more than half (9/16) of the cases by PCR and clone analysis. Altogether, approximately two- thirds of the species detected by the culture-independent methods were not isolated by culture. They included both uncultivated and difficult-to-cultivate species, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Leptotrichia (Sneathia) spp., a Bergeyella sp., a Peptostreptococcus sp., Bacteroides spp., and a species of the order Clostridiales. To examine intra-amniotic inflammation, an AF proteomic fingerprint (mass-restricted score) was determined by surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Inflammation was detected in all five samples which were culture negative but PCR positive. Women who were PCR positive more often had elevated interleukin-6 levels in their AF, histological chorioamnionitis, and funisitis and delivered neonates with early-onset neonatal sepsis. Previously unrecognized, uncultivated, or difficult-to-cultivate species may play a key role in the initiation of PTB.
TI  - Relationship of specific vaginal bacteria and bacterial vaginosis treatment failure in women who have sex with women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis frequently persists after treatment. The role of  newly defined bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria (BVAB), which have a specificity for this condition of 97% or greater, has not been assessed. OBJECTIVE: To define risks for bacterial vaginosis persistence, including pretreatment detection of specific vaginal bacteria, among women reporting sex with women. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: University-based research clinic. PATIENTS: 335 women age 16 to 29 years reporting sex with at least 1 woman in the past year. Participants were recruited through advertisements and provider referral. INTERVENTION: Bacterial vaginosis was treated with intravaginal metronidazole gel (0.75%), 37.5 mg nightly for 5 nights. MEASUREMENTS: Species-specific 16S recombinant DNA polymerase chain reaction assays targeting 17 bacterial species were applied to vaginal fluid obtained at baseline. Test of cure by clinical criteria and Gram stain analysis and repeated polymerase chain reaction assays of vaginal fluid were performed 1 month after treatment, and interim behaviors were assessed by using computer-assisted self-interview. RESULTS: Of 335 women, 24% of whom also reported sex with men within 3 months before enrollment, 131 (39%) had bacterial vaginosis. In the 120 (92%) women who returned for follow-up, the incidence of persistent bacterial vaginosis was 26% and was statistically significantly higher in women with baseline detection of 3 Clostridiales bacteria, designated as BVAB1 (risk ratio, 2.0 [95% CI, 1.1 to 4.0]), BVAB2 (risk ratio, 8.7 [CI, 2.5 to infinity]), or BVAB3 (risk ratio, 3.1 [CI, 1.7 to 5.8]); Peptoniphilus lacrimalis (risk ratio, 3.5 [CI, 1.6 to 15.5]); and Megasphaera phylotype 2 (risk ratio, 3.4 [CI, 1.4 to 5.5]). Persistence was lower with treatment adherence (risk ratio, 0.4 [0.2 to 0.9]). Detection of these bacteria at the test-of-cure visit was associated with persistence, whereas posttreatment sexual activity was not. LIMITATIONS: Findings may not be generalizable to women who have sex only with men, or to women whose bacterial vaginosis is treated with oral antibiotics. The study may be too small and may involve a population that is too highly selected to draw definitive conclusions about associations of persistent infection with posttreatment sexual behaviors. CONCLUSION: Persistent bacterial vaginosis is associated with several bacteria in the Clostridiales order, Megasphaera phylotype 2, and P. lacrimalis, suggesting that vaginal microbiology at diagnosis may determine risk for antibiotic failure.
