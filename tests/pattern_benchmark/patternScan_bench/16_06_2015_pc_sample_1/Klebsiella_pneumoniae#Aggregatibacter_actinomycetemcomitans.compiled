TI  - 16S rDNA-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. We sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe AE-COPD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe AE-COPD. Total bacterial DNA was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16S rDNA sequences and cDNA libraries. We used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial 16S rDNA sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. RESULTS: Analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. Species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16S rDNA sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16S rDNA indicated lower levels of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe AE-COPD.
TI  - [Enteric Gram negative rods and unfermented of glucose bacteria in patients with  peri-implant disease].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Implants can be colonized by microorganisms from oral biofilms and  may affect peri-implant tissues health. Among these bacteria, pathogens typically associated with periodontitis can be found, such as Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis, as well as Gram negative enteric bacilli not typically associated with periodontal diseases. OBJECTIVE: Superinfecting bacteria were characterized from peri-implant lesions in patients with history of periodontitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-eight implants were studied in 55 patients; the average patient age was 56 years. Forty-nine implants had peri-implant lesions and 19 were considered stable. Subgingival samples were obtained in affected and stable implants. The samples were streaked on Mac-Conkey agar and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. The colonies were identified with the kit-BD BBL Crystal E/NF(R). RESULTS: Superinfecting organisms were detected in 20 patients--they were seen more frequently at diseased implants (n=15) than at healthy implants (n=5). The prevalence of superinfecting bacteria on the selected implants was 33.8% (n=23/68). These bacteria were more prevalent among affected implants (n=17 or 25%) than those with stable implants n=6 (8.8%). Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent Gram negative rod detected (n=12). CONCLUSIONS: One-third of the implants had superinfecting organisms. Implants with a peri-implant lesion had a higher frequency of superinfecting bacteria. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common superinfecting organism isolated. A multiple infection caused by superinfecting bacteria was present only at diseased implants. These microbial agents potentially affect implant stability.
TI  - Broad-spectrum biofilm inhibition by Kingella kingae exopolysaccharide.
AB  - Cell-free extracts prepared from Kingella kingae colony biofilms were found to inhibit biofilm formation by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans, and K. kingae. The extracts evidently inhibited biofilm formation by modifying the physicochemical properties of the cell surface, the biofilm matrix, and the substrate. Chemical and biochemical analyses indicated that the biofilm inhibition activity in the K. kingae extract was due to polysaccharide. Structural analyses showed that the extract contained two major polysaccharides. One was a linear polysaccharide with the structure -->6)-alpha-d-GlcNAcp-(1-->5)-beta-d-OclAp-(2-->, which was identical to a capsular polysaccharide produced by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 5. The second was a novel linear polysaccharide, designated PAM galactan, with the structure -->3)-beta-d-Galf-(1-->6)-beta-d-Galf-(1-->. Purified PAM galactan exhibited broad-spectrum biofilm inhibition activity. A cluster of three K. kingae genes encoding UDP-galactopyranose mutase (ugm) and two putative galactofuranosyl transferases was sufficient for the synthesis of PAM galactan in Escherichia coli. PAM galactan is one of a growing number of bacterial polysaccharides that exhibit antibiofilm activity. The biological roles and potential technological applications of these molecules remain unknown.
TI  - An in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (CloSYS Oral Rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. METHODS: Oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. The numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity. RESULTS: As expected, Listerine and Crest Pro-Health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. Breath Rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. CloSYS and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, CloSYS oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that CloSYS Oral Rinse has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.
TI  - Effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB  - The in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. Ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. Agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. Then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. Further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against Porphyromonas gingivalis. This result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. Only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Candida albicans) survived in part. Addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. The bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included A. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. In conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. Ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of moxifloxacin against gram-negative enteric rods from colombian patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gram-negative enteric rods were associated with periodontal diseases  in several populations. The association between enteric and putative periodontal pathogens has received little attention in the literature. The present investigation determined the occurrence and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates of Gram-negative enteric rods from Colombian patients with chronic periodontitis. METHODS: Clinical parameters and the in vitro antimicrobial sensitivity of isolates of Gram-negative enteric rods were examined in 76 patients with chronic periodontitis in Medellin, Colombia. Subgingival samples were processed using culture and biochemical tests for the detection of periodontal and superinfecting pathogens. Selected colonies of Gram-negative enteric rods from pure cultures were used to test the susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests were used to determine differences in clinical variables versus the presence or absence of Gram-negative enteric rods. RESULTS: Klebsiella pneumoniae was found in 12 patients, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found in four patients, and three other species were recovered with a lower prevalence. Men (38.75%) tended to harbor more of the studied organisms than women (17.7%) (P = 0.04). Gram-negative enteric rods in periodontal pockets correlated positively with the presence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (respectively, r = 0.66, 0.31, and 0.32; P <0.001). All superinfecting organisms demonstrated a high susceptibility to moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin but exhibited a variable susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. CONCLUSIONS: This study found high levels of Gram-negative enteric rods in patients with chronic periodontitis. Moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin appeared capable of eradicating these organisms from periodontal pockets. Its good activity against Gram-negative enteric rods and periodontopathogens suggests the potential use of moxifloxacin as an adjunctive antibiotic in the treatment of mixed periodontal infections.
TI  - Mouthrinses: a comparative microbiological study.
AB  - This study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of different mouthrinses whose use is extended in Spain. Six different antiseptic mouthrinses were studied by means of determination of Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus mutans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Also in vivo experiments were carried out in volunteers by the use of mouthrinses and evaluation of bacterial populations before and after the treatment. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death was determined. Results suggested that the determination of MIC values is not a reliable method to evaluate the antibacterial effect of such products. On the other hand those rinsing solutions based on the effect of oxygen, such as those containing carbamide peroxide have a greater efficacy against anaerobic bacteria compared with rinses whose active molecule is a disinfectant. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death demonstrates that the essential oil rinse kills bacteria much faster. All tested mouthrinses were active as antibacterial although those based on oxygen production or essential oils were more active than solutions based on chlorhexidine and Triclosan.
