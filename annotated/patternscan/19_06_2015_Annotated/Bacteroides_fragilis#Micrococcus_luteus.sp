TI  == [antibacterial activity of cervical mucus in pregnant or non-pregnant women].
AB  == antibacterial activities of human cervical mucus obtained from non-pregnant and pregnant women were tested using standard blood agar plates. the combined effect  of cervical mucus with cefmetazole (cmz) was also investigated. obtained results  are summarized as follows. 1. cervical mucus specimens obtained from 6 subjects at 9 to 36 weeks of pregnancy showed antibacterial activity to only one strain of bacillus subtilis among organisms tested. the cervical mucus enhanced the activity of cmz against 1 strain of streptococcus pyogenes and 2 strains of micrococcus luteus, but no effect was observed against other organisms tested. 2. cervical mucus specimens obtained from non-pregnant women showed antibacterial activities to 8 of 11 strains (72.7%) of b. subtilis tested. the cervical mucus enhanced the activities of cmz against 1 strain of s. pyogenes and 3 strains of b. subtilis. the tested organisms included staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, s. pyogenes, b. subtilis, m. luteus, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, and candida albicans, but, as described above, cervical mucus samples showed antimicrobial activities only against b. subtilis (9/17, 52.9%), and specimens obtained only from non-pregnant women or pregnant women with less than 11 weeks of pregnancy showed any antimicrobial activities.

TI  == pyrimidine dimer excision repair of dna in bacteroides fragilis wild-type and mitomycin c-sensitive/uv-sensitive mutants.
AB  == an enzyme preparation purified from micrococcus luteus was shown to be specific for uv-induced pyrimidine dimers and was suitable for the detection of dna excision repair systems. the wild-type bacteroides fragilis bf-2 strain and a mitomycin c-sensitive mutant (mtc25) had constitutive dimer excision systems which functioned efficiently under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. a uv-sensitive mutant (uvs9) had markedly reduced levels of the constitutive dimer  excision systems under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. since liquid holding recovery under aerobic conditions was inhibited by chloramphenicol whereas the final level of excision repair in b. fragilis bf-2 was not affected, it is concluded that pyrimidine dimer removal is not the process responsible for increased physiological aerobic liquid holding recovery.
