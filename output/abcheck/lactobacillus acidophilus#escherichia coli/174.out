the effect of probiotics on the genotoxicity of furazolidone.
antigenotoxic activity of probiotic bacteria against furazolidone was studied using the short-term bacterial assay sos chromotest, with escherichia coli pq37 as the test organism.
the supernatants from probiotic and furazolidone co-incubation exhibited rather strong suppression on sos induction produced by furazolidone on e. coli pq 37 (sfia: lacz).
genotoxicity inhibition was found for all strains of the examined bacteria belonging to three genera.
the highest genotoxicity inhibition was detected for bifidobacterium lactis bb-12 (92.0%) and for lactobacillus acidophilus t20 (81.9%).
