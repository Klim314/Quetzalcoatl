TI  == intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: a systematic review.
AB  == evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. in the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of firmicutes; a higher count of bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, and  bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, and lactobacillus. in the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of bacteroides; a lower count of akkermansia muciniphila, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and clostridium; a higher prevalence of b. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of b. catenulatum and staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.

TI  == early colonization with a group of lactobacilli decreases the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.
AB  == background: microbial deprivation early in life can potentially influence immune  mediated disease development such as allergy. the aims of this study were to investigate the influence of parental allergy on the infant gut colonization and  associations between infant gut microbiota and allergic disease at five years of  age. methods and findings: fecal samples were collected from 58 infants, with allergic or non-allergic parents respectively, at one and two weeks as well as at one, two and twelve months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and  real time pcr, using species-specific primers, was used for detection of bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, clostridium (c.) difficile, a group of lactobacilli (lactobacillus (l.) casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus. infants with non-allergic parents were more frequently colonized by lactobacilli compared to infants with allergic parents (p = 0.014). however, non-allergic five-year olds acquired lactobacilli more frequently during their first weeks of life, than their allergic counterparts, irrespectively of parental allergy (p = 0.009, p = 0.028). further the non-allergic children were colonized with lactobacilli on more occasions during the first two months of life (p = 0.038). also, significantly more non-allergic children were colonized with b. bifidum at one week of age than the children allergic at five years (p = 0.048). conclusion: in this study we show that heredity for allergy has an impact on the gut microbiota in infants but also that early lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus) colonization  seems to decrease the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.

TI  == altered early infant gut microbiota in children developing allergy up to 5 years  of age.
AB  == background: early colonization with bifidobacteria and lactobacilli is postulated to protect children from allergy, while clostridium (c.) difficile colonization might be associated with allergic disease. previous studies of infant gut microbiota in relation to subsequent allergy development have mostly employed culture-dependent techniques, studied genera of bacteria and the follow-up period was limited to 2 years. objective: to relate gut microbiota in early infancy, notably bifidobacteria and lactobacilli at species level, to allergy development  during the first 5 years of life and study if environmental factors influence the early infant gut microbiota. methods: fecal samples were collected at 1 week, 1 month and 2 months after birth from 47 swedish infants, followed prospectively to 5 years of age. bacterial dna was analysed with real-time pcr and related to allergy development, family size as well as endotoxin and fel d 1 levels in house dust samples. primers binding to c. difficile, four species of bifidobacteria, two lactobacilli groups and bacteroides fragilis were used. children regarded as  allergic manifested allergic symptoms and were skin prick test positive during their first 5 years while non-allergic children were neither. results: children who developed allergy were significantly less often colonized with lactobacilli group i (lactobacillus (l.) rhamnosus, l. casei, l. paracasei), bifidobacterium adolescentis and c. difficile during their first 2 months. infants colonized with several bifidobacterium species had been exposed to higher amounts of endotoxin and grew up in larger families than infants harbouring few species. conclusion: a more diverse gut microbiota early in life might prevent allergy development and may be related to the previously suggested inverse relationship between allergy,  family size and endotoxin exposure.

TI  == competitive inhibition of adherence of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, enteropathogenic escherichia coli and clostridium difficile to intestinal epithelial cell line lovo by purified adhesin of bifidobacterium adolescentis 1027.
AB  == aim: to observe competitive inhibition of adherence of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec), enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) and clostridium difficile (c. difficile) to intestinal epithelial cell line lovo by purified adhesin of bifidobacterium adolescentis 1027 (b. ado 1027). methods: the binding  of bacteria to intestinal epithelial cell line lovo was counted by adhesion assay. the inhibition of adherence of etec, epec and c. difficile to intestinal epithelial cell line lovo by purified adhesin of b. ado 1027 was evaluated quantitatively by flow cytometry. results: the purified adhesin at the concentration of 10 microg/ml, 20 microg/ml and 30 microg/ml except at 1 microg/ml and 5 microg/ml could inhibit significantly the adhesion of etec, epec  and c. difficile to intestinal epithelial cell line lovo. moreover, we observed that a reduction in bacterial adhesion was occurred with increase in the concentration of adhesin, and mfi (mean fluorescent intensity) was decreased with increase in the concentration of adhesin. conclusion: the purified adhesin of b.  ado 1027 can inhibit the adhesion of etec, epec and c. difficile to intestinal epithelial cell line lovo in a dose-dependent manner.

TI  == changes in predominant bacterial populations in human faeces with age and with clostridium difficile infection.
AB  == the bacterial composition of human faeces can vary greatly with factors such as age and disease, although relatively few studies have monitored these events, particularly at species level. in this investigation, bacteria were isolated from faecal samples from healthy young adults and elderly subjects, and elderly patients with clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (cdad). the organisms were identified to species level on the basis of their cellular fatty acid profiles with the midi system. in some groups of bacteria, species diversity was  found to change with age despite the overall numbers of organisms being similar at genus level. bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. ovatus and prevotella tannerae were common gram-negative anaerobes isolated from young adults. bacteroides species diversity increased in the faeces of healthy elderly people. bifidobacterial species diversity decreased with age, with bifidobacterium adolescentis and bif. angulatum being the most common isolates. cdad patients were characterised by greater diversity of facultative species, lactobacilli and  clostridia, but greatly reduced numbers of bacteroides, prevotella and bifidobacteria. such bacterial population changes in the normal microbiota could  result in metabolic conditions favourable for the establishment of pathogenic micro-organisms, such as clostridia, and would have considerable effects on the biochemical capacity of the large intestine as a whole. alterations in the community structure of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli have relevance for dietary and therapeutic interventions such as the use of pre- or probiotics that aim to modify the composition or metabolic activities of the intestinal microflora in a  beneficial way, particularly in elderly people or individuals at risk of cdad.

TI  == evaluation of 16s rrna and cellular fatty acid profiles as markers of human intestinal bacterial growth in the chemostat.
AB  == chemostats were used to study the effects of carbon and nitrogen limitation and specific growth rate on 16s rrna synthesis and cellular fatty acid (cfa) profiles in four human intestinal bacteria (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bifidobacterium  adolescentis, clostridium bifermentans and cl. difficile). cellular fatty acid synthesis varied with dilution rate and nutrient availability in different species, but these cellular constituents were relatively stable phenotypic characteristics in bact. thetaiotaomicron, where branched chain and hydroxy cfa were good taxonomic markers. conversely, cfa in the gram-positive bacteria varied markedly with changes in growth environment. for example, in chemostats, cyclopropane cfa were only synthesized in cl. bifermentans and cl. difficile under n-limited conditions. similarly, dimethyl acetal (dma) fatty acids in bif.  adolescentis were primarily produced during n-limited growth, and this was inversely related to dilution rate. at low growth rates, 16s rrna concentrations  (microg rrna per ml culture) correlated with viable bacterial counts, but were more closely related to specific growth rate when expressed as a function of cell mass (microg rrna per mg dry weight bacteria). however, this did not reveal differences in bacterial population size and rrna concentration in c-limited cultures. thus, at low dilution rates, c limitation strongly reduced rrna synthesis in cl. bifermentans, despite viable cell counts being similar to those  in n-limited cultures. these results indicate that, while 16s rrna is a useful indicator of microbial activity, cell growth rate does not necessarily relate to  rrna concentration under all nutritional conditions. consequently, bowel habit and diet will affect both cfa and rrna content in bacteria isolated from intestinal samples, and this should be taken into consideration when interpreting such data measurements.
