TI  == microbiological diagnosis and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia and acute copd exacerbation in daily clinical practice: comparison to current guidelines.
AB  == background: the aim of this secondary analysis was to evaluate current microbiological approaches, microbiology, and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease (aecopd) in clinical practice and to compare them with current  international guidelines. methods: a total of 362 patients with suspected cap were enrolled in 14 european centers in a prospective multicenter study. results: a total of 279 inpatients (cap, n = 222; aecopd, n = 57) were evaluated. a total  of 83 (37 %) cap patients and 25 (44 %) aecopd patients did not undergo any microbiological tests. in patients with cap/aecopd, blood culture was performed in 109 (49 %)/16 (28.1 %), urinary antigen tests for legionella pneumophila in 67 (30 %)/9 (16 %), and sputum investigation in 55 (25 %)/17 (30 %), respectively. the most frequent pathogens in cap were streptococcus pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae, l. pneumophila, staphylococcus aureus, and enterobacter cloacae; in aecopd they were escherichia coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. all cap patients (mean = 11.1 days) and 35 (61.4 %) of aecopd patients (mean = 8.9 days) received  antibiotics. cap patients were given mostly aminopenicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors and aecopd patients were given mostly cephalosporins. conclusions: pathogens isolated in cap and aecopd and the antibiotic therapy used are in good  accordance with the guidelines. blood culture, recommended for all cap patients,  was performed in only 50 % of the cases and antibiotic therapy lasted longer than the suggested 5-7 days. therefore, international guidelines regarding performance of blood culture and duration of antibiotic therapy should be adopted more often. this duration was independent of the number of isolated pathogens and number of symptoms on admission. therefore, the question arises as to whether microbiological data are necessary only for patients who are resistant to initial therapy.

TI  == the binding of mbl to common bacteria in infectious diseases of children.
AB  == objective: to purify mannan-binding lectin (mbl) from human serum and detect its  binding ability to several kinds of bacteria common in infectious diseases of children. methods: mbl was purified from human serum by affinity chromatography on mannan-sepharose 4b column. its binding ability to eight species, 97 strains of bacteria was detected by enzyme-linked lectin assay (ella). results: mbl has different binding ability to bacteria and shows strong binding ability to klebsiella ornithinolytica and escherichia coli, but shows relatively lower binding ability to staphylococcus haemolyticus, enterobacter cloacae and staphylococcus epidermidis. to different isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and staphylococcus aureus, mbl shows quite different binding ability. conclusions: mbl has different binding ability to different bacteria, and has relatively stronger binding ability to gram-negative bacteria.  its binding ability to different isolates of certain kinds of bacteria is quite different.

TI  == neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == background: airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli (gnb) and gram-positive cocci (gpc) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. whether  gnb are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (bsi) and/or to the severity  of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) is unknown. methods: we prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. the severity of bpd was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. results: after 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with gpc (staphylococus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). superimposed on 36% of these infants was gnb airway colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), enterobacter cloacae (25%), escherichia coli (25%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), serratia marcescen (10%), acinetobacter baumannii and haemophilus influenzae (5%). comparison between 174 gpc- and 86 gnb-colonized infants showed  that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. fifteen percent of gnb-colonized infants developed bsi caused by gnb and 14% developed bsi caused by gpc. no significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and bsi was noted. gnb infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with gpc. gnb colonization was a predictor of severe bpd after controlling for ventilation. ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of gnb-colonized and 33% of noncolonized  infants and was not a predictor of bpd severity. conclusion: gnb airway colonization creates a moderate risk for bsi. antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate gnb. gnb airway colonization is associated with severe bpd, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate gnb from the airways should be undertaken.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activities of the penem wy-49605 (sun5555) against recent clinical isolates from five u.s. medical centers.
AB  == the in vitro activity of wy-49605 (sun5555) (wy) was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid against 2,958 consecutive clinical isolates from five medical centers and 402 respiratory pathogens from 18 other facilities. most members of the family enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by wy (mic at which 50% of the isolates are inhibited [mic50], < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml). mic90s of > or = 8.0 micrograms/ml were observed for enterobacter cloacae, serratia spp., and proteus mirabilis. wy was the most active drug against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml)  and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic90, 4.0 micrograms/ml). the four drugs were not active against nonenteric gram-negative bacilli, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus haemolyticus. at  2.0 micrograms/ml, wy inhibited 82% of enterococcus faecalis strains and was equal to or superior to the other drugs against streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis.
