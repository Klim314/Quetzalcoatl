TI  == effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  == bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. cell-free supernatants (cfs) were prepared from growth of enterococcus faecalis atcc 19433, pseudomonas fluorescens atcc 13525, escherichia coli 08, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, bacillus subtilis 168, bacillus coagulans 185a, b. coagulans 7050, clostridium sporogenes pa3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus salivarius, and streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. the inhibitory effects of cfs on  the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and tulane virus in raw 264.7 and llcmk2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of cfs or after exposure of host cells to cfs. slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and tulane virus in the continuous presence of cfs  of b. subtilis 168 and e. faecalis 19433, respectively. cfs cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. virus persisted in the cfs that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of cfs on virions. the viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.

TI  == commensal bacteria modulate innate immune responses of vaginal epithelial cell multilayer cultures.
AB  == the human vaginal microbiome plays a critical but poorly defined role in reproductive health. vaginal microbiome alterations are associated with increased susceptibility to sexually-transmitted infections (sti) possibly due to related changes in innate defense responses from epithelial cells. study of the impact of commensal bacteria on the vaginal mucosal surface has been hindered by current vaginal epithelial cell (vec) culture systems that lack an appropriate interface  between the apical surface of stratified squamous epithelium and the air-filled vaginal lumen. therefore we developed a reproducible multilayer vec culture system with an apical (luminal) air-interface that supported colonization with selected commensal bacteria. multilayer vec developed tight-junctions and other hallmarks of the vaginal mucosa including predictable proinflammatory cytokine secretion following tlr stimulation. colonization of multilayers by common vaginal commensals including lactobacillus crispatus, l. jensenii, and l. rhamnosus led to intimate associations with the vec exclusively on the apical surface. vaginal commensals did not trigger cytokine secretion but staphylococcus epidermidis, a skin commensal, was inflammatory. lactobacilli reduced cytokine secretion in an isolate-specific fashion following tlr stimulation. this tempering of inflammation offers a potential explanation for increased susceptibility to sti in the absence of common commensals and has implications for testing of potential sti preventatives.

TI  == inhibition of staphylococcus aureus by the commensal bacteria of human milk.
AB  == aims: to study the bacterial diversity in expressed human milk with a focus on detecting bacteria with an antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus,  known as a causative agent of maternal breast infections and neonatal infections. methods and results: random isolates (n = 509) were collected from breast milk samples (n = 40) of healthy lactating women, genotypically identified, and tested for antimicrobial activity against staph. aureus. commensal staphylococci (64%) and oral streptococci (30%), with staph. epidermidis, strep. salivarius, and strep. mitis as the most frequent isolates, were the predominant bacterial species in breast milk. one-fifth of staph. epidermidis and half of strep. salivarius isolates suppressed growth of staph. aureus. enterococci (ent. faecalis), isolated from 7.5% of samples, and lactic acid bacteria (lab) (lactobacillus rhamnosus, lact. crispatus, lactococcus lactis, leuconoctoc mesenteroides), isolated from 12.5% of samples, were also effective against staph. aureus. one l. lactis isolate was shown to produce nisin, a bacteriocin used in food industry to prevent bacterial pathogens and spoilage. conclusions: expressed breast milk contains commensal bacteria, which inhibit staph. aureus. significance and impact of the study: the strains inhibitory against the pathogen staph. aureus have potential use as bacteriotherapeutic agents in preventing neonatal and maternal breast infections caused by this bacterium.
