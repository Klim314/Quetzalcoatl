TI  == the effect of scaling and root planing on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases: 12-month results.
AB  == background/aims: previously, we reported that srp resulted in a decrease in mean  pocket depth and attachment level and reduced prevalence and levels of bacteroidesforsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola at 3 and  6 months post-srp in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis. 32 of the 57 subjects  were monitored at 9 and 12 months. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the microbial and clinical effects of srp in 32 (mean age 48+/-11) subjects over a 12-month period. method: clinical assessments of plaque, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth and attachment level were made prior to srp and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-therapy. subgingival plaque samples were taken at each visit and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique for the presence and levels of 40 subgingival species. each subject also received maintenance scaling at each of the subsequent monitoring visits. differences in clinical parameters and prevalence and levels of bacterial species were analyzed pre- and post-therapy using the wilcoxon signed ranks test. the quade test for related samples was used for analysis of multiple visits. results: mean pocket depth (mm+/-sem) decreased  from 3.2+/-0.3 at baseline to 2.9+/-0.3 at 12 months (p<0.01). mean attachment level showed significant reduction at 6 months, but did not diminish further. bleeding on probing and plaque were significantly reduced at 12 months (p<0.001,  p<0.05, respectively). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola decreased in  prevalence and levels up to the 6-month visit and remained at these lower levels  at 9 and 12 months. significant increases in levels and prevalence were noted at  12 months for actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum ss polymorphum, streptococcus mitis, capnocytophaga sp, and veillonella parvula. conclusions: the data suggest that the maintenance phase of therapy may be essential in consolidating clinical and microbiological improvements achieved as a result of initial therapy.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by treponema denticola, porphyromonas  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga orchracea, capnocytophaga sp., actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis. the enzymes produced by capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while  the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mm chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mm inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. these observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.

TI  == relationship of subgingival microbial complexes to clinical features at the sampled sites.
AB  == subgingival plaque samples from 100 active destructive periodontal lesions and 150 inactive subgingival sites in 33 subjects were analyzed by predominant cultivable microbiota techniques. 50 isolates were characterized from each sample and where possible, the isolate was placed in 1 of 134 microbial species or groups. the sites were clustered on the basis of the proportions of all of the species detected in each sample using a minimum similarity matching coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. 10 clusters containing 166 sites were formed which exhibited greater than 35% minimum similarities. all clusters were made up of sites from multiple subjects and were formed on the basis of different combinations of micro-organisms. certain complexes of micro-organisms appeared to relate to the severity of periodontal destruction and the activity of the sampled site. the combination of f. nucleatum, b. forsyth and w. recta (cluster vii) or b. gingivalis, b. intermedius and s. intermedius (cluster viii) distinguished clusters made up of sites which on average had the most attachment loss and the deepest pockets. these clusters contained the highest proportions of active sites and sites which lost greater than 3 mm of attachment after therapy. clusters dominated by v. parvula (cluster iii), the actinomyces sp. (cluster x) or the combination of s. sanguis ii, s. mitis, v. parvula and s. intermedius (cluster ii) were made up of sites which exhibited less active disease and responded more  favorably to therapy. sites in other clusters exhibited moderate levels of prior  destructive disease and disease activity status closer to the mean values for all 250 sites.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the predominant cultivable microbiota of active and inactive lesions of destructive periodontal diseases.
AB  == subgingival plaque samples were taken from active and inactive lesions in 33 subjects exhibiting active destructive periodontal diseases. active diseased sites were those which showed a significant loss of attachment within a 2-month interval as computed by the "tolerance method". the predominant cultivable species from 100 active sites were compared with those found in 150 inactive sites of comparable pocket depth and attachment level loss. among the 33 subjects, w. recta, b. intermedius, f. nucleatum, b. gingivalis and b. forsythus  were elevated more often in active sites; whereas, s. mitis, c. ochracea, s. sanguis ii, v. parvula and an unnamed actinomyces sp. were elevated in inactive sites. the likelihood of a site being active was increased if b. forsythus, b. gingivalis, p. micros, a. actinomycetemcomitans, w. recta, or b. intermedius were detected in that site, and decreased if s. sanguis ii, the actinomyces sp., or c. ochracea were detected.

TI  == [phlegmon of the fore arm succeeding to a dog-bite : respective role of the miscellaneous bacteria involved in this mixed infection (author's transl)].
AB  == the authors report a case of a severe mixed infection (phlegmon of the fore arm)  succeeding to a dog bite. a complex flora has been isolated from this phlegmom :  pasteurella multocida, pasteurella pneumotropica, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces sp., bacteroides melaninogenicus, and a gram- bacteria related to group ii j. the pathogeny of such diseases is discussed, dwelling in one hand on  the part of synergistic development of these various germs and in the other hand  on the part played by saliva in the severity of animal or human bites. this kind  of wound requires careful disinfection and radical debridment without omitting a  preventive broad-spectrum antibiotherapy.

TI  == urease assay and urease-producing species of anaerobes in the bovine rumen and human feces.
AB  == a growth medium and test were developed for rapid detection of urease in fermentative anaerobic bacteria. using nonselective rumen fluid roll-tube agar medium and the new test, it was confirmed that peptostreptococcus productus is often the most numerous urease-forming species in human feces. also, some fecal strains of ruminococcus albus, clostridium innocuum, and clostridium beijerinckii produced urease. single strains of fusobacterium prausnitzii, coprococcus catus,  and streptococcus mitis that were strongly ureolytic on isolation later lost this ability. urease activity was also detected in many strains of nonselectively isolated rumen species. they include succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, treponema sp., ruminococcus bromii (not previously known to be present in the rumen), butyrivibrio sp., bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides ruminicola, and p. productus.  most p. productus strains contain urease; however, the uniformity of this feature in the other species noted above is not known. the urease in many of these species was not detected if the growth medium contained 0.2% or more (each) yeast extract and trypticase.
