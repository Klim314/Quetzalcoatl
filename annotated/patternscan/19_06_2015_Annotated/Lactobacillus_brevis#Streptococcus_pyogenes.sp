TI  == inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-p), has been documented for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and lactococcus lactis, but not for other gram-positive bacteria. using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated atp-dependent hpr(ser) kinase that phosphorylates ser-46 in hpr of the phosphotransferase system. a small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-p phosphatase (pase  ii), previously identified only in lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. further, lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks pase ii. the results reveal that pase ii is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-p hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. they provide correlative evidence that pase ii initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.

TI  == further studies on thymidine kinase: distribution pattern of the enzyme in bacteria.
AB  == various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (tk; ec 2.7.1.21). taking the specific tk activity of escherichia coli k12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific tk activities. in the gram-positive cocci, staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of strep. pyogenes (29%). neisseria sicca, a gram-negative coccus, lacked tk. gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (bacillus, 13-51%; clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of b. megaterium (2%) and c. difficile (1-3%). among the gram-positive asporogenous rods, listeria monocytogenes and six species of lactobacillus (especially l. brevis, l. buchneri and l. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. lactis and l. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). of the species of pseudomonas studied, most  lacked tk but ps. fluorescens and ps. maltophilia had significant tk activity (15-53%). of the gram-negative facultative anaerobes, vibrio lacked tk, while enterobacteriaceae, including salmonella (148-1120%), escherichia (59-141%), klebsiella (78-299%) and serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'pr. rettgerella' (307%). propionibacterium and bifidobacterium and related organisms other than streptomyces, nocardia, rhodococcus, corynebacterium and mycobacterium lacked tk. the seven species of candida tested, and cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked tk.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
